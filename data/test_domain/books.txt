william styron wrote bestseller it very easy see , why " sophie choice " became one - it all characteristics bestseller : important subject , emotional rendering , acute descriptions many surprises way . it recalls story three housemates brooklyn : young , aspiring writer , stingo ( alter ego styron , presumably , since he narrator ) , sophie zawistowska , polish woman who escaped death auschwitz-birkenau , jewish maniacal lover sophia , natan . many secrets ( mostly sophie , but ultimately all protagonists ) revealed gradually tension punctuated several dramatic events . book long , but very captivating therefore it fast read . i very moved story , but not only sophie trauma , but also ( mainly ) feelings triangle . i think characters ' personalities very well depicted they come alive pages this novel ( well other , minor characters , which very colorful too , like sophie father or even landlady ) . writing very good , said , i must say i am surprised opinions , writing mundane only topic wwii victim interesting moving this book . me it just opposite - it very good novel , but accuracy or relations concentration camps , or descriptions death camps survivors , it better get know other books ( styron actually good job enumerating some examples authors , like tadeusz borowski , whom i recommend ) . it novel one should not forget . me it triply interesting because my polish background interest both immigrant culture ( brooklyn ) american south , which me equally mysterious poland before under nazi occupation american reader . so if you think styron shows south or new york superficial manner , you imagine polish part similar style ( although obviously author researched subject , there some strangely vague statements , like mention ghetto cracow - jews lived their quarter kazimierz , but i am not sure if it could called ghetto we understand word now ) . reader left until almost end book what meant title when answer arrives , it already bit blurred all other events narrative . my opinion , it very good novel , but not completely perfect , maybe because it seems attempt achieve too many goals ( both form content ) .	1

we love diana gabaldon outlander series . we 1st four cd now . it good actually begin see transition scotland america upheaval happened time prior american revolution . so often we get english centric view time . so often we look only french indian war - which actually called 7 years war europe - go no further . diana begins tie events scotland , england , france , colonies , how they flowed events scotland . since i always loved time travel science fiction , i enjoy interplay present past , historical research showing what goes past . i thought her loops information interesting too . since i some geneological research , i am well aware tediousness times , but joy discovery well . i thought she great job adding this story . i love way she brings customs time forefront , like witch trials , french court manners , travel documents , " hand fasting " , gathering clans name few . one thing her books i don't like one sexually explicit scene each books so far i could without . black jack randall interegation " outlander " , visit french king " dragon fly amber " , plantation scene " voyager " , rape scene " drums autumn " . these scenes actually not just gratuitous , they actually critical story . but it certainly made it hard listen kids car . dan mcmillen	1

i recommend this book . this first bell hooks i read , deeply impressed her clear , rooted moral position state american global society . her writing this piece shifts narrative her own history growing up south , present academic , political critique today . i found her writing fluid her point view significant . black woman america someone who experienced lower upper class existence according journey them , her perspective complex , making her voice deep necessary . no way i specify difference this book . she calls morally just society , which denounces consumerism perpetuates exploitation , racism , sexism while it advertised fantasized life pursuit . seeing current issue newsweek cover story , titled " how win , " regarding ceo expertise making money succeeding " american way , " immediately brought where we stand into consideration . this book call action , illumination depressing unjust , cruel foolish system which ignores afraid reforming itself enough allow " world where we all enough live fully well . " i particularly appreciated her chapters living simply , think it appropriate bold call make place where stuff acquisition social symbols significance . conclude , i found this description class page 103 , rita mae brown , important : " class much more than marx definition relationship means production . class involves behavior , your basic assumptions , how you taught behave , what you expect yourself others , your concept future , how you understand problems solve them , how you think , feel , act .	1

* case you can't tell length , i really , really loved this novel , if this review helps one person make decision buy read this gem , i'll feel if my day well-spent . * more i read , more my sense inner horror threatened erupt . each turned page , heavy sense despair foreboding settled over my mind . " book bad ? " you ask me . i reply resounding " no ! " " why , then , you horrified ? why , then , you despairing ? " you question . " because , " i answer , " each flip page , i one page closer end . " stereotypes misunderstood . they're so often used because they're so often true . i'm use valid one now , fact : there two types gay novels , surprisingly enough , they follow ancient greek theories theater . there gay drama , which must include least two gay-bashings ( one which often results death ) , least one failed suicide attempt , forty-seven deaths aids , romance end all romances nipped bud prejudice , suicide , aids , or all above . gay drama almost always synonymous ' gay tragedy , ' almost always political , often moral -- awaken people terrors gay prejudice change course society . almost like love ( which i now refer albil ) not gay drama variety ( thank god ) . no , albil gay comedy . these , like austen pride prejudice , " light bright sparkling , " usually quite literally , since they often flashy covers . gay comedies , while they may touch some serious issues , never confront them directly approach them only through lens tinted laughter . while they would not mind changing world better , that not their goal . no , gay comedy goal entertain , entertain , entertain !, none it quite well albil . my point , constant reader , this : expect albil what it intends give , you not one reviewers who viciously lampoons novel silly or unimportant or irrelevant . you would not go paris expecting everyone speak russian , so not read gay comedy expecting find earth-shattering drama . now , return issue hand : albil . i think best way begin confront few claims novel detractors . they claim , constant reader , albil storyline " so frustratingly predictable , [ sic ] it like playing connec t-t he-dots straight line " ( adam . barley , amazon.com, august 28 , 2005 ) . albil , i've already said , gay romantic comedy ; there no such thing non-predictable gay romantic comedy . yes , you know first few pages novel end travis craig rekindling their high school passion . yes , you know there some sort obstacle(s ) way . but you not read romantic comedies -- least , you shouldn't read romantic comedies -- surprised . pleasure derived reading novel like albil , however , not how often author throw you curveball but how well author keep your eyes ball . , quite frankly , once you begin reading , your eyes never leave book pages . few reviews mentioned novel too forceful its issues , it takes them beats you over head them . this , i ask , " what issues ? " yes , both craig travis become sort unintentional activist , but issues never take center stage . , after all , partly why albil gay comedy not gay drama . yes , there bit gay-bashing novel ( older high schooler calls younger one bad f-word ) , but aforementioned older high schooler gets his come-uppance , novel moves . yes , aids makes brief appearance , but it only brief one , not mention one necessity any story gay men living 80s . kluger never lets his characters or his novel become soap-box which campaign or altar which preach . fact , i quite surprised so many people claim he , since kluger merely uses issues , it seems , add depth likability his characters , not address issues their own sake . despite these two attacks novel , almost all previous reviews positive , rightly so . i said blurb , novel rather unconventional format , told mostly through excerpts unexpected items like restaurant menus newspaper clippings , so i feared i would not able connect characters much i would if novel chose more conventional narrative vehicle . interestingly -- i won't admit this too often -- i completely , entirely wrong . fact , quite opposite happened : i found myself appreciating characters more falling love them faster because unconventional way which they unwrapped . large part novel first-person narrative , course , so we not lose entirely age-old art paragraphs , but sporadically interspersed e-mails student assignments other crazy excerpts create certain amount depth novel itself , providing different angle which view characters . interestingly , none characters except travis craig explicitly narrative sections , yet supporting cast developed well two stars , all through kluger insertions personal webpages email correspondence phone conversations . quite fea t.t he novel not , course , flawless ; nothing , after all . novel end approaches faster than speeding bullet ; this may intentional , since beginning novel , when travis craig high school , also happens relatively quickly , it may aesthetically excellent choice , but someone who not want see novel end , realizing you only few pages feel like there ought few hundred more never good feeling . every character novel -- even travis roommate father craig mother , who play relatively marginal parts novel -- developed so well you feel if each one could his own spin-off novel if he tried . yet -- this inevitable -- certain characters developed more fully than others . travis , high school nerd who goes cross-country find craig , takes flesh bones much faster than craig retains bit edge over him throughout most novel . i not want belittle craig , because he expertly crafted well , but travis seemed more fully-realized individual than his lover . one other problem these two characters their narrative often sounded same ; since they such entirely different characters , i expected different writing styles , slightly different senses humor , etc ., but i not find their individual narratives ; they both sounded like travis . these gripes mine -- fast ending , slightly less-developed ( but not under-developed ) characters , etc . -- extremely insignificant , considering my praise . i said before , i finished novel , i really horrified . i really close novel feel more depressed than i when i started , simply because story over . i leave travis craig , brian clayton , kevin charleen jody , aj gordo , noah . way i judge truly great work literature -- whether it shakespearian high art or nora roberts-esque popular fiction -- way i feel when i turn last page . when piece question truly great , there feeling settles over you , feeling like you've just -- use clich , which misunderstood stereotypes -- lost your best friend . because you just lose your best friend , after all . entire entourage them , really . feeling , sense " what now ?, " truly great ... part reason i really hate reading truly great literature . nobody likes losing his best friend , after all , especially if there isn't sequel	1

i definitely liked this sarcastic but warm book solitary travels thru europe , interlaced fragments journey taken years earlier certain weirdo named katz . glimpses into european culture just great- how movie tickets sold here , how food served attitude there . also , there great comedy scenes odd duck places like lichtenstein milan , but also rewarding beauty capri paris . i wish two things : there more katz , who one most misanthropic figures i come across while generally makes good comedy ; also , last three chapters hadn't felt quite so tired . i suspect just realistic impression how author feel towards end his journey but it anti-climactic .	1

after reading some reviews available , i felt it necessary provide more balanced perspective this novel . few years ago , i read secret life bees . admittedly , mermaid chair not quite measure up , however , it its own merits . while readers may not necessarily agree portrayal religious figures , i not believe kidd any way attempting show them negative light . if one this interpretation , it shallow one , best . initially , i myself disappointed main character preoccupations men , but it takes looking beyond these aspects come away perhaps different interpretation . i feel this work helps us begin discover what makes us all human , many issues , despite what american public tends think , complex don't necessarily clear-cut answers . each us human unique experiences . perhaps then so-called hard-and-fast solutions not fitting many situations . who among us should judge what right wrong without gaining some perspective their personal situation first ? furthermore , everyone not immune making mistakes . perfection not realm what human , perhaps imperfection serves important function forming who we . given this , even seemingly insane behavior , like jessie mother cutting off her fingers , begins make more sense . i urge readers look meaning goes further than crazy people cutting off fingers married woman affair monk order come away better understanding what it binds all us together	1

this immensely interesting provocative little book ray kurzweil . because its ultimately predictive nature , this book raise many eyebrows ( there even discussion neo-luddites ! ) more erudite people probably ask more questions than this book answers . nevertheless , this book hold you spellbound least until predictions begin . readership interested technology , it provides many , many interesting facts stimulating theories around it . one these surely " law accelerating returns " way technological advancement throughout history understood light this law its corollaries . big learning computational models - recursive , genetic finally evolutionary . it fascinating learn how these models work , how these models implemented many niche domains including investments primary markets . third big plus book snippets discussions technologies which still emerging far main stream including invasive non invasive scanning human brain , state virtual reality , etc . kurzweil also good job raising some very fundamental questions . primary among these artificial consciousness . however , these likely debates raging years sometimes these questions , though raised , not conclusively answered insipidly dealt . each chapter ends conversation molly - machine ( though conscious one ! ) kurzweil . perhaps idea summarize chapter novel way throw bit humour . both respects , kurzweil success moderate . far predictions concerned , time tell . world today , state technology not pervasive kurzweil book seems imply . more children die disease hunger each day africa than developed world seems care . it almost decade since dolly , sheep , cloned . however , cloning technology remains behind closed doors . socio-politico-economic consequences development remain issue needs time , understanding categorization . nevertheless , this remains important book - get technology-focused point view then take learnings evaluate them context broader world we live . no computer yet . !	1

this first graham greene novel i read , encouraged because it my cousin ( her husband ) favorite book . little i know i would relate protagonist so much . i , firstly , would like say i loved this book . true human suffering not always gory . emotional suffering sometimes " cut deeper " . greene writing style legitimate emotion conflict me analyzing all my romantic relationships . although i am not " religious fan " i feel her turn toward god religion plausible one . one many people would use end affair . book captures idea you can't choose who you love but there always consequences adultery . religious revelation leaves nasty taste my mouth , but again , i've seen it happen real people , so fact fictional characters going through something real , makes book story love believable . after reading this graham i ended up reading most his works few short months . graham books definately classics their own right capture human heart , human emotion , human deception unique way i relate .	1

i've just completed book generally concur other positive reviews . it good read book generalist who across several subjects disciplines incorporates into his/her work - which what winchester so successfully here . my quibble very early book winchester makes very big statement which not actually backed up . page 5 he states much larger volcanic eruptions ( toba , tambora , taupo , katmai)had much less direct effect human society than krakatoa . he bases this observations 1883 humans much more sophisticated - there trained observers , technological innovations ( telegraph particular ) which linked world . ok , one accept 1883 eruption huge , devastating etc but virtually say it overwhelms others truly huge statement . 73000 years ago there vast explosion toba sumatra makes 1883 explosion look mild . toba seems ended inter glacial period ushered long volcanic winter which created " bottleneck " event where very few survivors ( few 1000-3000 worldwide ! ) genetic material became predominant . this time when homo erectus our sapiens ancestors spreading around globe . but we don't go back far . 1815 there bigger explosion tambora which killed more people , created year without winter ( 1816 ) . this recorded history but no there no telegraphs . eruptions mediterranean around 500bc earlier krakatoa eruptions ( especially ad515 event ) bigger again . winchester deal earlier krakatoa event but rather cursory dismissive way . yet there indications 515ad event killed off civilsation java . there no suggestion 1883 eruption destroyed any civilisation all . this modern historical bias - attitude what reported recently more important than what not reported earlier . this criticism no way detracts excellent stuff winchester included his book . he paints comprehensive picture what cataclysm , but say it most important global catastrophe not correct .	1

i think frantzen downright scary ! not only he write our inner worlds so accurately , most people hate him his books ... but he also seems know our outer world eerily perceptive way . just read pages describing " decadent people " response catastrophe , there you our 9/11 reality . those pages gave me goosebumps . then , few pages , we watch all monsters who created financial environmental disaster , skip away their millions . hmmmm ... he not only damn talented words , deep , deep understanding what people really , what love , what sacrifice , but also what our corrupt society . frankly , i keep amazed , i can't wait read everything he written . it possible readers become so upset him because he bringing literature new realm ? realm we may not ready ? realm we're not comforable because it so much less " arty " -- despite his beauty words , but so much more real . no his characters not likeable -- we , when we're all naked confused scared selfish ? i don't think so . but they -- only one or two exceptions his books -- loveable . we come know his characters way god must . inside , where , all ugliness flaws , there grace beauty . ultimately , all satire , irony , cynicism , these books rich hope , redemption , grace . damn this writer who knows something	1

normally book this long readers like myself cannot even get close end before saying , " enough already , get point . " this book , however , different . fourth installment j.k. rowling harry potter series , harry potter goblet fire full danger deceit lurking around every adventurous corner . while this book longest books so far it jam-packed excitement character development . end this book i not thinking seven hundred thirty-five pages i just finished reading , nor eight hundred seventy pages next book , i just wanted get back hogwarts harry potter fifth year . while school during his fourth year , harry sees hears things he never thought he would this makes thrilling addition series . harry summer ends his attendance exciting quidditch world cup weasley family . no sooner game end than death eaters begin attacking muggles muggle-born wizards dark mark lord voldemort conjured unknown person woods use harry missing wand . soon he returns school , danger continues get closer harry . tri-wizard tournament held hogwarts although age restriction placed goblet emit champion names , someone who it out harry managed get his name entered it unfortunately chosen goblet . later book , while harry waits alone dumbledore office speak him he sees hears more unexpected . he discovers pensieve which he accidentally finds himself one dumbledore memories death eater trials . first , harry not known what going or where he but after few scenes dumbledore returned his office pulled harry back into present time explaining phenomena he just experienced . whilst memory he heard startling news neville longbottom parents . dumbledore further explains neville parents currently living asylum because they cruciatus curse placed them some time ago afterward never quite same . most shocking information what stood out most me information harry learns later book when faced once again lord voldemort . tri-wizard cup inner most part maze used third task tournament . first wizard reach this cup champion . harry cedric , who decided both grab handles same time , quickly realized it actually portkey which transported both champions cemetery voldemort muggle father now called home . while there , lord voldemort summons death eaters touch dark mark peter pettigrew arm harry soon discovers identities some dark lord most loyal followers . because identities death eaters always so mysterious up until this point we only put together our sneaking suspicions , this information quickly becomes very satisfying . most satisfying aspect book however character development . readers notice this book introduces many new intriguing characters such rita skeeter , annoying reporter daily prophet who just cannot seem leave well enough alone -- or matter tell truth her reports , professor mad-eye moody , paranoid seemingly insane ex-auror who introduced hogwarts ' new defense against dark arts teacher who keeps strangely protective watch over harry . more importantly readers notice marked difference approach rowling makes toward her characters this installment series . weasley get lot more attention this book than series thus far . fred george get more text this book whereas others they just backdrop characters readers finally get meet charlie bill eldest weasley bunch . because harry busy through most book worrying tri-wizard tournament , we also get see more ron than before . this book we watch him struggle two different issues effort rowling show his growth through puberty . ron first inner struggle harry constant overshadowing him . youngest weasley boys , ron felt like runt bunch all his life then it just so happens his best friend hogwarts , top second most famous name wizarding world next you-know-who , now strangely fourth champion this year tri-wizard tournament . ron second inner struggle tension hermione himself . when hermione gets asked yule ball none other than ron hero , international quidditch star tri-wizard champion representing durmstrang , viktor krum , ron feels crushed flooded feelings jealousy . hermione expressed ron next time he needed date he would better off asking her first before someone else gotten chance . this character tension quite reason look forward upcoming books series . addition , hermione busy library much book researching her activist group , society promotion elfish welfare . hermione seen first time this book outside interests ; although she quickly enlists harry ron membership , this something hermione developed her own reflective direction her character growth . whereas other harry potter books series up until this point ended rather positive note , this one surprisingly not . rowling managed break patterns readers may thought they would find this book . end , because harry narrowly escapes lord voldemort instead sending him back into hiding , it makes reader want run right out fifth book even quicker . my opinion , this book could make or break reader interest series ; but sheer horror finality cedric diggory death awful foreboding comes rebirth lord voldemort , rowling fifth harry potter book series promises even more surprising than fourth .	1

i heard importance , significance " education henry adams " long time . i finally determined i needed read it . i acutally read it twice , found less it second time than first . i am sorry i missed greatness this book . i am sure there something wrong me , but i found it incredibly unimpressive . perhaps this came fact henry adams not likeable man . he famous holding court his home near white house , making caustic negative comments every president who lived there . granted , he lived washington time when there plenty second-rate occupants white house . but thought people wasting their time trying please blue-blooded snob like adams depresses me . why anyone bother ? he lived atmosphere snobbery , sharp-tongues , clever remarks , brilliant conversation . world went without him , truth told , he contributed less than people who walked his house each day . he very good historian his time . but who reads his books now ? not very many . short , his own work not long-lasting he would wanted it . maybe influence some presidents he mocked lasted longer than published purchased work henry adams . " education henry adams " not much real information . he got education one place , none others . surely , suicide his wife provided some very painful education henry -- but he wrote nothing it his book . when eric sevareid wrote " not so wild dream , " it compared " education henry adams . " meant compliment . oddly , i think sevareid book much , much better . sevareid wrote america , common man , war , what it all meant him . adams needed get out more . he not see america -- not america built common citizen who put it all together , defended it . i gained trememdous amount sevareid . i cannot say same work henry adams . again , lot this might me . perhaps i read book bad time . maybe i needed read it third time . i not know . i know i not think this great american classic . forgive , please , my ignorance .	-1

citizen explores just what freedom really it follows young man , thorby , he matures boy man . starting slave sold most unusual beggar , baslim , we see first aspect many equate absolute opposite freedom , though we see fact ' slaves ' sometimes more freedom choice than ' free men ' . society he paints here vivid believable ( though economics slavery star-travelling culture always seemed little dubious me ) . baslim far more than he appears , puts thorby through rigorous education , both academic practical . how you become really good beggar ? here heinlein falls ayn rand - whatever you , it best your ability , begging juggling . also there several comments included here integrity self - lies others misleading yourself both come some dictums . these items may pass over young readers ' heads , but perhaps planting seeds all assumptions should examined , nothing should accepted ' faith ' , personal integrity more important than ' success ' , consequences actions should examined carefully before committing action . later , baslim calls some favors sends thorby live free traders , group space merchants keep themselves their own unique culture . here thorby discovers aspect freedom : person ability he wishes severely constrained culture which he lives . free trader society ( which owes much margaret mead seminal ideas , highlighted anthropologist character named margaret mader - heinlein not usually so obvious his names ) rigid matriarchal domination separation into moieties provides security , peace mind , ability through rigid rules formalism allow small group people live together extended periods without breaking any heads , but its downside great limitations freedom choice . this section book may best part , society so different today american culture it becomes fascinating its own right , apart its effects thorby . thorby himself grows changes significantly this part book , first love determining just how he must balance demands duty personal desires . last section deals thorby back earth , within society not much different our own , shows third aspect freedom : internal courageousness make your own decisions act upon them . freedom just constrained internal timidity and/or defining decisions external forces . this last section offers little terms new or different views society ( though it good mirror some flaws capitalistic/lawyer dominated one ) , it isn't engrossing first two sections , but highly important terms completing heinlein thematic investigation all aspects freedom . characterization other than thorby baslim pretty thin , especially females appear supporting roles . this fairly typical his juveniles , they basically strong adventure novels their primary focus their central character . but thematic line slavery/freedom much stronger here than most his messages other books , this particular position also stated some those other works ( most especially farnham freehold ) , seen one heinlein personal beliefs ( unlike some other positions he proposes his books seem mainly designed stir up debate ) . this book not heinlein absolute best , nor even best his so-called ' juveniles ' ( which typically better reading than most ' adult ' mainstream bestsellers ) , but still provides engrossing , fun , illuminating read . recommended all readers willing look life styles different their own . --- reviewed patrick shepherd ( hyperpat )	1
ron heifetz clearly one seminal leadership scholars , practitioners , teachers field today . this superb volume , sharon daloz parks , takes off where his two previous books ( " leadership without easy answers " " leadership line " ) leave off . " leadership taught " takes its readers through heifetz harvard business school course " pal 101 -- exercising leadership : mobilizing group resources . " those us who studied heifetz two previous books taken courses modeled off his hbs course ( i columbia teachers college almost decade ago ) , " lcbt " provides excellent refresher . my columbia tc professor ( who must ta'd heifetz when she teaching harvard graduate school education ) ran outstanding version his course her own right . using all heifetz key principles pedagogical techniques ( very similar curriculum ) , she put us through our paces teaching leadership " adaptively . " it watershed learning experience invaluable practical value me . although my field leadership development secondary-school education ( both teachers students ) , i borrow heavily heifetz theory work graduate level . although i doubt they intended this way , i see these 3 works sort trilogy adaptive leadership . heiftez " leadership line " ( co-written marty linsky ) probably most accessible three : clearly place any reader start learning h powerful approach . " leadership without easy answers " most scholarly thoroughly developed ( extensive historical examples , etc . ) . daloz parks " lcbt " concentrates heifetz leadership course itself . what experience taking it like his students ? how o--o don't--its lessons stick them they resume their professional lives ? daloz parks answers these questions balanced , fair , accurate , leavened plenty anecdotal evidence . we get glimpses classroom interactions , we hear professor heifetz speaking quite candidly advantages -- well challenges -- his dynamic educational approach . any serious scholar or teacher leadership must peruse this product harvard business school press . one beauties heifetz approach it works virtually any area : business , education , public service , etc . its principles apply equally commercial not-for-profit sectors . sum , i can't recommend " leadership taught " highly enough leaders and/or faculty leadership-development programs all stripes . sharon daloz parks us all great service recording impact heifetz work those fortunate enough study master himself	1

i never actually thrown book across room frustration - i love books , so this drastic ! spoilers ahead - please don't read if you haven't read book . i managed ( somehow ) get through first book , ' wideacre ' , which i disliked - whilst i adore rest gregory novels , so this hard me - grit my teeth tried read this book , sequel i'd bought it it looked more promising . it ' marginally better ' one reader put it , than first , but very depressing frustrating book indeed . i getting very angry frustrated after second half book - many other readers highlighted , julia consistent inability stand up richard made it impossible me like her anymore . i quite honestly wanted slap her wake her up dreamy state she ! because i wanted so much julia james - who i liked great deal . i so depressed after everything went wrong she didn't marry him ... ah , because i expecting usually very clever ms gregory surprise me twist end say , aha ! she get her true love end she ralph get rid richard although it not happily ever after she learns grow backbone very first female heir wideacre . rape scene julia richard very violent far too detailed i think it may difficult stomach anyone who ever abusive situation like , fact , anyone all . i don't want get into tricky area abortion too much , but i really feel strongly julia should gone ralph help when she concieved child richard . this child incest rape - she knew her heart there should no heir wideacre - they all simply too inbred it needed end somewhere nothing going right . clean slate , so speak . yet she gives child away - then her final letter asks james find child ?! what ?! i expecting perhaps deformed child , after all this inbreeding ( i mean this child product parents who brother sister grandparents who brother sister !!! ) but she perfect beautiful . i hoping gypsies would keep her she'd never found again .. but alas , lacey madness live ... perfect end this book would nice twist . gregory could made her very good point inheritance rights lack power women beatrice julia era richard killed ralph , then julia inheriting land - baby sarah adopted out gypsies never seen again julia either lives widow runs land or ( this would lovely - i bet all girls sighed over james little , didn't you ? he little like handsome romantic leads austen books ) james forgave her - they both made mistakes julia not intentional nor her fault ( i practically screaming her it wasn't her fault - she gets it end , when it too late ! ) they marry ' normal ' children - or perhaps none , they just learn their mistakes respect each other , make fresh start wideacre . there so many allies julia - she sweet girl i liked her - i wish i could shaken her though , i got so mad . so many people village offered their help - this trap she caught richard could avoided - ahhh ... so frustrating . i not reading third book series . i shall go back reading gregory more historic novels ( constant princess one i haven't read yet it sounds excellent ) . i wouldn't recommend this one	-1
this far my favorite stephen king novel . i not hear any fanfare when it came out but purchased it break dark tower novels . novel surprise its unique story depth . unlike lot stephen king novels deal darkening human spirit , this novel delves more into hope . there bad men , " low men yellow coats ( wonderful phrase ! ) " but there also concrete good world characters trying hold onto . king weaves two different decades makes connections not overly coincidental or trite . he also gives few nods his dark tower works , but they not overt . you not read series . they more treat his long term readers universe he trying create throughout his novels . i highly recommend this book ( but don't fooled movie , it weak comparison )	1

`the iraq war ' eminent english military historian journalist , john keegan model reflective reporting recent major historical event , bringing bear all keegan insight into anglo-american history military practice . starters , i strongly disagree those reviewers who felt keegan gives us too much background least two reasons . first , actual military campaign so short , narrative it would hardly fill book half this size . second , background much more interesting much less well known those us who followed every move third infantry division first marine expeditionary force cnn day day kuwait baghdad . most immediate lesson i got this book fact central command commander , general tommy franks good or better commander than his colleague commander 1991 gulf war , `stormin norman schwarzkopf ' . if franks impressed keegan who studied analyzed every major conflict 20th century , i no doubt franks good man military task hand . corollary lesson this immediate military task , franks fact enough troops accomplish immediate capitulation iraqi armed forces . this not mean there enough coalition forces nail things down after initial success it certainly not mean frank civilian superiors washington really understood iraqi situation either before war began or after coalition gained nominal control country . most interesting aspects keegan summary actual combat fact regular iraqi troops simply melted away approach american or british heavy units , heaviest resistance came neither regular troops nor elite republican guard , but `fedayeen ' irregulars , many whom actually islamic fanatics neighboring countries such syria . native iraqis so uninterested war civilians routinely wandered into combat areas often mistaken fedayeen fanatics . interesting aspect keegan narrative combat his characterization overwhelming superiority american uk troops over their iraqi opponents . iraqi equipment bought soviets least two generations behind allied gear third fourth rate troops simply no match elite marines , airborne divisions , first line 3rd infantry division ( which actually more like armored division world war ii days ) . eminently balanced reporter historian , i very happy see his outsider assessment american troops commanders , especially those periods end march , example , when so many commentators prophesying doom gloom what nothing more than holdup desert storm order supply lines catch up forward troops . really interesting stuff comes background chapters . one surprise how such seemingly small events sway tide history , how european american public alarmed when western journalist executed iraq , after thousands natives purged not so much flicker interest . influence then prime minister margaret thatcher first president bush consider military action against saddam 1991 . even more interesting material book contrast saddam generally secular regime contrasted fundamentalist islam regimes iran other middle eastern countries . keegan not draw any significant conclusions this , but he very effectively paints picture makes cooperation iraq al quaida seem very unlikely . possibly single most interesting observation comes page 54 where keegan explains mystery why islam , which leading source learning thought over 700 years , turns its back independent reasoning future directs faithful more oriented past . this same time ( 15th 16th centuries ) when western christian church accommodating reason scientific inquiry , leading technological prominence western europe time went . people who looking strong , concrete reasons why we should or should not invaded iraq 2003 not find them this book , although keegan offer plenty factual material help people make up their own minds these issues . but , even keegan admits he not yet whole story leaves some questions open very end . any balanced view invasion iraq should take this narrative into account .	1

somewhat unorthodox christian , i am not opposed efforts revisit earliest sources christian tradition order discern original teachings jesus his followers . it indeed quite possible - even probable - those teachings underwent transformation development , some these developments eventually ran contrary original teachings . there books follow this process way intellectually respectable based sound scholarship ; this book - unfortunately - not one them . this book appeal those who despise orthodox christianity yet feel compelling need reinterpret christianity according their subjective psychological needs . such people , facts not matter , any theory which radically reinterprets traditional christianity - no matter how far-fetched - find ready audience . those who want views early christianity pay attention historical facts , i recommend - without necessarily agreeing - scholarly works geza vermes , raymond brown , bart ehrman , marcus borg , . . wright , even bishop spong ( if you insist ultra-liberalism ) . not waste your money rubbish aptly-named timothy freke .	-1

this type novel most writers naught but aspire craft ! i first introduced this novel my sophomore year high school . ( far what misguided reviewer below posted , i not protest , but devoured every bit this breathtaking work art ! ) i instantly captured unique writing style well remarkable story , , needless say , this book remains one my favorite - if not my very favorite - novels i assigned read high school . novel written three different narratives , told primarily documentary fashion , giving it feel epic . story follows three generations women trueba family , whose patriarch selfish , dictatorial , but ultimately understandable esteban trueba . naming female characters story specifically symbolize purity ( " blanca " means " white " spanish , while " clara , " " nivea , " " alba " embody clarity , snow , dawn respectively ) , allende deliberately explores feminism , setting her story society which thrives conservative , chauvinistic ideals . which brings me violence . yes , there rape scenes ; let me explain : allende , this point story , trying convey absolute horror esteban trueba relations peasant girls ( metaphor mistreatment working class upper class , also mistreatment women men , expanding allende notions feminism ) . scenes explicit because they meant shocking infuriating great degree . far making this novel " abhorrent , " these scenes add emotional impact story . who like this book : -readers who appreciate well-worded , well-crafted classic-feminists-readers who don't mind shocked or disturbed certain scenes meant shocking disturbing-readers who empathize profound , colorful , developed characters-readers who love broad , eventful plotlines hidden meanings , metaphors , symbolism-readers who don't mind bit magic realism ! -readers who appreciate story which plays out like musicwho not like this book : -readers who cannot stand feminism or open chauvinists-readers who cannot tolerate shocking or explicit scenes-readers who easily offended glorification radical or liberal ideas ( record , homosexuality not glorified but stated simple , existing part world , much like existence concepts such feminism , prejudice , true love)with exception above mentioned audience , i guarantee this book keep its reader turning pages ! masterpiece	1

i've read lot books buddhism various flavors - zen , tibetan , etc . most zen books i've read either very abstract , or very straightforward but lacking detail how practice day-to-day . cheri huber written ultimate book pretty much buzzword-free extremely simple put test . /suffering optional/ not really buddhist book , or zen book . it happens written zen teacher , there few buddhist-y words ( mostly " karma " ) used highlight points which western culture tends lack solid terminology . but most part , this simply book freeing yourself ways you ( often unknowingly ) punish yourself . suffering indeed optional , cheri huber shows how see tha t.t his very fast , very simple read , but not fooled . /suffering optional/ not set out some pie-in-the-sky path happiness involves no effort your part . quite opposite , author herself quick point out : " i remind people annoying regularity if this practice easy it would more popular . consider , please . look around see what thousands or even millions ' adherents .

i read mr. harris ' book . i quite disagree his ideas , just i find him , writer , quite disagreeable . there some threads his book hold one fascination , or even which earn one admiration . some his ideas such apparent originality one must applaud him sake them . his insight into ancient spartan society , example , one these . nevertheless , this reader disagrees use which author puts his insights , well conclusions he draws them . truth , his conclusions not conclusions , but actually his own prior assumptions , dressed up conclusions . it should apparent any astute reader author , this work , set out simply justify , any way he , his prior conclusions evils liberal democracy , liberal " intellectuals , " arab societies , internationalism . his effort this , he repeatedly stoops use fallacious arguments , misrepresent others either outright dissimulation or ad hominem attack , ( unconvincingly ) dress up his assumptions conclusions . mr. harris compares people leadership contemporary united states people leadership 16th century aztecs . specifically , he compares events september 11 , 2001 , those cortez conquest aztecs . he argues ( thanks " liberal intellectuals " ) we ignorant islamic terrorism terrorists montezuma strange men who arrived mexico peak aztec empire . condense his argument , he claims we failed understand nature 9/11 attack nature those who perpetrated it , just montezuma failed understand nature spaniards ' sudden appearance . he says we , like aztecs ( again , thanks " liberal intellectuals " ) , giving islamic militants too much break , not recognizing them what they -- purely evil , irrationally motivated , utterly indifferent anyone else , finally he accuses us incapable recognizing who , who not , enemy , any more . but fact west long history islamic world , we understand their motivations , we cannot claim mystified their feelings thoughts - short , we not , fact , position anything like montezuma his aztec empire . if there any truth author thesis all , one not need cite twice-removed theorizing " liberal intellectuals " see where truth most evident - one need only look bush administration . america attacked group saudis reasons largely american military presence saudi arabia , bush response transparently fabricate bogus connections 9/11 iraq , then attack iraq , conveniently ignoring , failing largely explore , real threads led 9/11 - saudi money , pakistani support protection taliban , truly deplorable history western relations middle east . if we apply harris ' comparison , it would bush who takes place montezuma , bush who misunderstands nature , even identity , enemy , bush whose " fantasy ideology " propelled him into grievous misadventure impossible quagmire . i don't know any " liberal intellectuals " well enough speak them , but i know this liberal , many , many others stood behind america attack al-qaeda taliban afghanistan , precisely because we recognize nature identity enemy . liberals , intellectual or otherwise , took view only after we saw bush turning away pursuit terrorists , making shameful use 9/11 carry out his pre-assigned task : invade iraq establish permanent bases there order exercise hegemony middle eastern oil fields make neat profit halliburton , while he it . but , turning back mr. harris , he wishes us regard this " new " enemy inexplicable implacable force evil toward which we must show no quarter , even point taking no interest all what might actually motivating them , what might effect change them , or what strategies we might adopt , other than one entailing their total merciless destruction us . his extraordinary thesis , thesis defies well-established principles human political behavior , this enemy simply hates us who what we , no identifiable cause or causes , their sheer unreasonableness sufficient motivation them wage desperate , even self-destructive war against us , no matter what it costs them . it impossible anyone pretend west not long history islamic peoples middle east , one which west not always villain , but which traces , nevertheless , unbroken story exploitation , political meddling ( including deliberate destruction true democracy iran ) , manipulation , encouragement conflict , encouragement crimes against humanity , what many muslims see absolutely unqualified support israel all its actions . what author here nothing more than demonize islamic world disregarding our actual history them . mr. harris ' prescription , pretty much line well-known pnac neoconservatives , we abandon any all diplomatic means , we abandon international cooperation , we abandon our own principles , including those congruent geneva convention , order destroy this enemy utterly , any cost ourselves or people middle east . frankly , spite his carefully constructed philosophical rationalizations , this conclusion incorrect unwarranted history it constitutes " fantasy ideology " every bit mistaken delusional osama bin-laden . finally , this reader found certain violations logic good faith mr. harris ' book . while these , alone , may or may not any bearing mr. harris ' major argument , one nevertheless distressed , made distrustful , his willingness stoop such means . one example this where author misrepresents statements richard butler , chief arms inspector united nations . 2002 , mr. butler suggested it unseemly united states insist upon no development or acquisition nuclear weapons presently non-nuclear nations , while u.s. , same time , not only refuses back away nuclear weapons itself , but even developing new forms nuclear weapons intimating our willingness actually use them theater . mr. harris presents mr. butler argument if butler actually advocating " no double standard " development or acquisition nuclear weapons non-nuclear nations . fact , mr. butler intent point out united states , refusing any adjustment its own position nuclear weapons , doing very little justify its demands upon others or encourage them , fact , not pursue nuclear weapons . without visibly making up facts , mr. harris nonetheless , i believe deliberately , twisted words mr. butler mean something they not mean . mr. harris also attacks martha nusbaum essay behalf cosmopolitanism , " patriotism vs . cosmopolitanism . " he hangs his attack first essay reference famous greek , diogenes , then switches his attack anything ms. nusbaum may written , choosing instead launch ad hominem attacks essentially irrelevant ( not mention ancient ) diogenes - pointing out , example , diogenes said masturbated publicly agora . while ms. nusbaum essay her ideas really not based apocryphal doings sayings diogenes , it satisfies mr. harris ' intellectual standards simply smear intellectual ad hominem attack long-dead , imperfectly remembered greek buffoon . readers integrity find this sort deliberately shoddy reasoning throughout mr. harris ' book . if many readers adopt mr. harris ' views , despite obvious flaws his reasoning despite intellectual dishonesty permeates his book , they so their own peril . like montezuma , they failed recognize dangerous enemy when he standing right before them .	-1

south florida television meteorologist bryan norcross earned local rock-star status even some national notoriety his commendable reporting before , during , after hurricane andrew strike miami 1992 . now norcross authored hurricane almanac . norcross states book he hopes produce annual updates book . perhaps future editions better fleshed out , but inaugural version quite number rough spots . my main issue book whenever section begins become interesting useful reader thinks some in-depth advice analysis follow , section ends abruptly . reader often then urged check accompanying website norcross helped start order get more detail . but such detail fact not currently available site , which basically contains only some links other sites where one may buy batteries , etc ., bulk . course rome wasn't built day , maybe site far more useful future years . but if he going specifically title book " hurricane almanac 2006 " include repeated references supposedly helpful website , he responsibility actually provide useful information during 2006 hurricane season . otherwise , it would better him just wait until 2007 it righ t.t he book seems rushed into print , which might explain ( though not excuse ) lack detail . norcross acknowledgments imply there severe time rush . perhaps publishers norcross wanted least get something out there this year . " something " often better than nothing , but not always . sometimes it better just say nothing rather than give half story . i know number south floridians who feel although norcross far ahead his counterparts other tv stations 1992 , gap narrowed or even altogether eliminated recent years . it isn't norcross unintelligent , but he become somewhat preachy scolding . he given relentlessly lecturing his audience , where some newer area meteorologists seem more flexible willing not only constantly recite basics , needed , but sometimes go beyond them . i mention this here because this same unhelpful patronizing attitude comes across numerous points book . instance , norcross first bullet point what or not during storm once winds reach 40 mph not any open flame . true necessary say . but then right below , " what when winds reach 60 " section , he says same thing ( all caps ) . it still true , but it still also blindingly obvious . same pattern unnecessary repetition occurs his almost-identical long lists how home dwellers should deal storm how high-rise dwellers should deal one . this more editing flaw than authorial one ; editors should condensed confusingly similar lists one large one common all circumstances , plus few shorter ones address problems specific living tall buildings , example . then there just too much plain mastery obvious . consider this bit advice norcross , example : " i little solar-powered radio . it works well long it sun , meaning it doesn't work well night . " well , that certainly true statement . if you're sort person who would normally expect their solar-powered devices run well midnight , it may even news you . but i'm betting it probably isn't . then there times when norcross throws out useful suggestions , but without enough explanation or follow-up . different points he lists several ways which bathtub may put good use hurricane : it may filled water used later sanitary purposes , or people may shelter themselves it mattress over them protection during storm , or valuables may placed it protection . maybe these each useful suggestions , taken individually . but there no attempt made coordinate these very different ideas . newcomers hurricane country might still no idea who or what should actually placed into their bathtub(s ) storm approaches . book contains overview what tropical systems how they form . it somewhat helpful section how read interpret national hurricane center various advisories other statements . it brief though interesting overview notable historical storms , which apparently culled other books ( especially pre-1870 storms ) . it long sections how prepare act during storm . these sections me most disappointing ; length my opinion misused constant repetition same few points instead detailed explanation . section various window-protection products not nearly detailed enough ( terms brands , etc . ) , i said repeated referrals book website provided no additional help . norcross also includes section how he would it ( better ) . despite his credentials expertise , i mostly unimpressed his suggestions , chiefly because most just general concepts thrown out there without any specificity or much attempt meet possible objections . instance , he calls strongly " national catastrophe fund , " but his fund just title without program behind it . he doesn't even attempt give any estimates what such program would cost , what it would cover , etc . would it pay people rebuild still dangerous low-lying sections flooded new orleans , instance ? might some landlords or investors not bother even protect their property if they knew government going come afterwards reimburse them any losses ? if so , couldn't " cure " worse than disease , terms leading still more future tragedy loss ? one suggestion i find very convincing his proposal storm-proofing expenses routinely added homeowners ' mortgages . norcross wisely points out , it lot more practical possible many homeowners add $ 10,000 existing $200 , 000 , thirty-year mortgage pay safety way than come up same $ 10,000 ( or more ) one lump sum . lenders mortgage holders should more than willing work homeowners this regard , protecting home protects their investment . notice way this one truly useful suggestion one contained actual numerical estimates . word almanac 300 page length might suggest some people this fairly sizeable , densely-packed work . if so , would incorrect assumption . book doesn't half content 600 page " world almanac , " example , or even one tenth or one twentieth such content . print large , line spacing generous , white space predominates throughout . there really wasn't enough written fill whole book ; it more very extended faq or pamphlet than it almanac . again , future editions this book this may well change . book could serve good outline what its successor books should look like . but right now , it not much use i would discourage anyone purchasing work its present status	-1

his cold war classic , unbearable lightness , milan kundera expounds , " there infinite difference robespierre who occurs only once history robespierre who eternally returns , chopping off french heads . " his own cold war classic , william appleman williams investigates " tragedy terror " american foreign policy , subverting our american ideals humanity self-determination then continually forgetting , chopped off heads ad infinitum . " tragedy american diplomacy , " williams traces open door policy , its articulation open door notes mckinley administration its culmination , when it became engrained minds cold warriors like truman kennan . open door became internalized perhaps why it , like kundera robespierre , " eternally returns . " ruling class continually turned open door , which basically holds our internal tensions economic problems solved not here home but transforming rest world our liking , all while thinking they've struck upon something entirely new . williams writes , " among many ironies kennan policy containment , perhaps greatest fact he so internalized assumptions principles open door policy he thought he proposing radically different program . " this sharp historical analysis , if " tragedy " filled only likes it , essay would still cold war classic . but it philosophical weight such what follows this critique kennan leaves " tragedy " full meaning relevance fifteen years after fall berlin wall : " this indeed final act transformation utopia into ideology . " i write , it 2004 american forces occupy iraq . whether you agree bush rationale war or not , you should understand it not some new doctrine ; whatever he tells us , september 11 , 2001 not " change everything ; " nor bush neocons first dream up such utopia . like kennan , however , those who led us war believed they doing something radically different . like kennan containment , iraq war fact just swing open door policy first opened spanish-american war ( which also devolved military victory over tyranny into more ambiguous crushing native insurgency ) . way , leaders such senator vandenburg , he admitted candid moment , realized need " scare hell out american people . " williams laments vandenberg likeminded elites " consciously employ exaggeration oversimplification accomplish their objectives . " ( odd foreshadowing 2004 , williams 1972 revision opens young vietnam veteran turned protester named john forbes kerry asking , " how you ask man last man die mistake ? " ) clearly then , williams much teach us still today . williams not preach despair . he hopeful america might find transcendence , karl jaspers defined it , tragic , looking historical mirror brutal honesty then acting humanely , armed truth . he hoped america might stop smashing local revolutions while calling them soviet plots , instead turn our focus inward , show world how people live peacefully democratically . 1972 edition i read , williams concludes holding up chile inspiration self-determination . few months after he wrote this , nixon administration , particularly henry kissinger , made sure there'd no more self-determination chile . president allende death september 11 , 1973 , installation murderous war criminal pinochet dictator , open door , executioner axe , kept swinging .	1

this one those rare books pressfield enraptured me way " gates fire "' battle scenes , made me so bored i almost dropped book same few chapters . this great sort insight into alexander mind , strategies . use " daimon " sort connect alexander dark side separate entity extremely reminiscent what matthew stover anakin revenge sith novelization ( calling anakin inner demon his dragon ) . maybe stover borrowed this . battle scenes very gritty bloody , but some points some battles , description gets muddled descriptions formations or obscure battle philosophies involving attacking defending , always attack , while battle seems progress all once one sentence , then minute time next few . this happens mostly gaugamela , where much time spent descriptions philosophy , companion cavalry essentially air what feels like nearly hour just charging toward darius after leading his cavalry away . other points , such chaeronea some parts granicus , battle scenes stupendously . hydaspes part , involving meeting porus before battle , porus offering adopt alexander , alexander very caesar-like plot divert waters hydaspes cross foot ( scrapped after his meeting porus infuriates him . ) one little minor -- virtually unimportant -- element which picked me incorrect spelling some generals ' names . i realize there many ways saying their names ( such craterus , crateros , krateros , crateras , etc ) but i grew familiar names like parmenion , crateros , hephaistion , etc , pressfield uses parmenio , craterus , hephaestion , etcall all , this not up calibur " gates fire " , but it definitely something special . last lines book particular particularly astounding resonate within me surprisingly tender , yet sad moment . if you don't want hear it , don't go on*spoiler*alexander recites short song/poem noise made wind blowing through stacked sarissas . it sung earlier book , but end , it resonates very truly alexander , soldier : sarissa song sad song . he pipes it soft low . i would ply gentler trade , says he , but war all i know .	1

i begin criticisms high crimes misdemeanors . these nagging little criticisms i make because points i'll allude sorts things would make me roll my eyes little , or excuse myself couple minutes breather if this conversation rather than book . ms. coulter suffered fate all those who seek insert comic relief or sarcasm into serious material . witticisms , sarcasm , barbed ironies , sage observations , facts , foregone conclusions , research don't always blend perfectly suit all people all time . some ( perhaps little mean-spirited ) humor expense liberals , i found sophomoric and/or repetitive and/or little snide . there , i've gone record , let me say me , these irritations accounted 12 sentences book . usually they kickers " call response " , or wrap-up rhetorical statement or question . i tried bear mind i really didn't buy this book comedy . rest book , i cannot give more stellar praise . without apology , i say this , time , only book its kind i ever read . past month or so , i've since read other coulter books . distinguish myself several reviewers , i read entire book . bibliography , references annotations impressive . i didn't or take time trace down every one them . owing largely addition , i seem remember someone else taking issue ann coulter fact-checking accuracy , coming away figuratively bloodied nose his trouble . if ( liberal ) you'll allow quotes documentation check out , i'll allow ( conservative ) there * always * opportunity contextual disagreement or more thorough research into any given blurb or quote . qualify this review , i am mostly conservative , i believe united states , i believe my fellow americans , i believe morals , right vs . wrong high standard ethics should applied , indeed expected our political leaders ( well business leaders , religious leaders , teachers , law enforcement , lawyers , judges , etc ., etc . ) . things i don't believe persecution human beings based sexuality , race , religion , creed , or politics . i also don't believe liberals stupid . i believe select people stupid independent political affiliation , but different longer story ... all this say , if you feel you should discount or hearken my review based who i am , you now know some basics person whom you already mentally primed agree or disagree . ( yes , i know i should've just ended sentence preposition ... it bothered me ) if , your mind , i'm still neocon fanatic , hopped up reagan kool-aid , fine . i still my best honestly evaluate this book . facts citations ms. coulter used build her case seem airtight . logic she used , witticisms criticisms aside , made sense me . i am astounded what i've learned . spin machine she described leaps bounds beyond anything i imagined after seen movie " wag dog " . person who tries whittle things down essentials , then move , i really understand how inundation conflicting stories , viewpoints assertions basically paralyzes american voter/citizen . it no wonder president clinton wasn't removed office . time matter put vote , issues truly hand obfuscated misrepresented so fully , ( most nation -in my remembrance- convinced whole thing monica ) no one person seemed credible grasp truth . clarify , it wasn't monica . it * * sex , but not wholesome , middle-america sex , so hale beautiful . notably , not kind sex correctly omitted polite conversation because it personal virtuous expression partners ( rather than acquaintances ) . quite likely , though most don't know why , we all feel little dirty , perhaps little ashamed endured whole messy affair . sex scandals ( plural ) white house definitely something this country could without . though i wish it hadn't happened , i'm glad i've found out more details this episode u.s. history . book nothing if not annotated details , quotations , recorded testimony , truth , highly cogent damning lambasting our former president . you indignant , you enlightened , you puzzle how these quotes tidbits escaped your attention during media frenzy . if you're willing admit there surpassingly effective spin machine somewhere maryland virginia , you feel justified your suspicions more went than we told . moreover , this book interesting sex scandals like part two four book . i found pre-presidency late-second-term material more interesting , more telling , foremost more genuinely horrifying . truth known , president clinton could adultered , thus shamed his wife child , ultimately office president all who salute it until cows came home , he would only met mild disapproval me . jfk notorious just more . fdr mistress . poor gary hart ... i digress . public figures imperfect , ( if not deeply flawed ) corrupt , philandering , disingenuous , cloying base since politics began . i read lines book , time passed , clintons getting better bolder their many sundry misbehaviors . stakes went up , their skill increased . i further surprised find out much evidence indicates mrs. clinton lynchpin whole criminal enterprise ( several them , fact ) . note mrs. clinton not just lawyer , but hailed brilliant lawyer . erstwhile senator new york may well fairly accomplished criminal well . though i can't call these arguments against clintons surprising , i am profoundly dismayed apparent snow-job ( couldn't resist ) perpetrated against american public . before you vote hillary ' 08 , you should read this book . if you vote her afterwards , fine . we agree disagree ... but , if you got your news cnn during this tumultuous time , please read high crimes misdemeanors first . i am pliable suggestions books or articles offer plausible defense against accusations this book ( say , i am not inviting rabid , bush-hating emails , etc ... i could more pleased bush too ) . if work cites facts verifiable evidence , not opinion invective , i read it thankfully . meanwhile , you should read this , see if you agree , try debunk which you doubt , prove yourself you're reasonable , thoughtful truly impartial seeker truth . i surmise you stunned , i	1

i am trying not cry while writing this review because incredible impact this great work judith herman my life . i first read book 4 years ago ( i 19 time ) , suggestion my therapist . today it remains one only two books topic i kept . i never let go this book . this probably most comprehensive book ptsd ever written . it lauded just every psychologist i ever met . i extensive field knowledge area psychology just based experience self-education , this book clinician book fullest . it exceedingly intelligent , informed , compassionate all once . people who read this book not ptsd find it heartbreaking difficult -- people who ptsd read this book find it life-shattering . that where it starts . it starts extremely in-depth look biological underpinnings ptsd , concept narrative memory vs . traumatic memory , discussion studies indicated survivors process traumatic memory brain differently than they process normal , or narrative memory . underlying message outset people who survived trauma dealing fractured schemas fragmented concepts self -- whereas people who survived prolonged , repeated trauma early life never able form cohesive self or schema first place . other words , we're building scratch . i don't believe me more terrifying words ever spoken . herman language deeply compassionate but almost surgical its painful precision . she so thoroughly educated validating it hard not nauseated because it so true it so real ... she makes it real concrete , scientific sense , more than just emotional , " i'm okay , you're okay " sense . you realize first time ptsd isn't just bunch jumbled feelings , but systematic medical disorder very predictable symptoms psychological implications . that where hope begins -- once you understand ptsd symptoms same everyone -- whether war veteran , survivor domestic abuse , terrorism , or natural disaster -- you realize how not alone you really . nearly everyone experienced something traumatic , but only 15% develop ptsd result . complex-ptsd ( prolonged , repeated trauma ) even rarer . it easy feel alone because it not something people often talk . but this book makes you confident , not only you aren't alone , but what you suffering real professionally recognized medical condition . once you learn your disorder back forward , you learn how recognize its stages how treat it . you don't see it who you anymore , but rather external force you learning cope . you recognize your strength survivor . more importantly , you learn take those fragmented pieces " traumatic memory " form them into cohesive " narrative " memory . you learn speak unspeakable . it not easy speak unspeakable , voice forbidden black horrible thoughts ... but once you , you learn they aren't so horrible when exposed daylight . everything makes sense again . black hole traumatic memory loses its power , while sense whole complete sense self , includes , but not revolve around trauma , gains upper hand . imagine life where you don't think trauma every day , where sounds smells feelings don't haunt you every turn . imagine life where you describe your trauma story " boring . " it sounded impossible me time , but it reality obtained , her book , j.h. lays out precisely how this millions survivors worldwide . whenever anybody i know makes light ptsd or tries play it off like not real illness or something i control , i throw this book all knowledge i gained their face . people can't argue judith . she knows what she talking . if you survivor trauma or sufferer ptsd , this best possible book read . this source which all knowledge springs . 100,000 other books ptsd use this one their knowledge base . judith herman owns . this not book talks gently you . it doesn't try protect you . it clinician book . it uses technical terminology . if you unsafe space or feeling mentally unstable , don't read it , or read it very slowly . my husband headed ph . clinical psychology read countless books abnormal psychology . he read this book better understand me . this day he maintains it single most emotionally difficult book he ever read his life . best part this book , it equisitely re-readable . i came back it after three years . i found it didn't tear me apart way it first time . instead i looking myself awe : " look what i up against . look what . look what i information my life !

aptly named , my life spans time bill clinton birth hope , arkansas , inauguration george . bush 43rd president . one imagine how difficult it write subject such large scope . clinton devotes first hundred pages or so his boyhood adolescence hot springs , arkansas . events this portion book not extraordinary , but clinton good gift storytelling , so i found his recounting his childhood interesting . level political commentary this portion very little , so potential readers adverse clinton views don't need worry here . next part book , 250 pages , covers clinton enrollment georgetown , oxford , yale law school . here clinton writings become more political , since he worked several campaigns arkansas his senator washington . clinton also describes himself thinking presidency early high school , accounting his enrolling georgetown ( washington , . . ) , despite never visiting campus or knowing anyone there . after graduating yale , clinton moved back arkansas almost immediately into politics . this point , my life concerned primarily clinton political career arkansas white house . early years , consisting his failed run congress , his tenure attorney general , his first term governor , depict young man fresh out law school sometimes struggling connect ordinary people arkansas . clinton very candid discussing his shortcomings these years , more so than his later political life . accounts backwoods campaigning deal making written good fashion , both interesting relevant clinton development politician . those familiar arkansas love this portion book . appropriately , majority my life covers time span late 1991 early 2001 , starting clinton announcement presidency . starting presidency , clinton covers his life almost day-to-day fashion , even covering mundane aspects presidency . i found it interesting ; some may find it boring . i learned great deal various international , domestic , political struggles era . one problem , though , sometimes i felt i needed history textbook keep up everything . clinton jumps one event next , sometimes so much it hard keep everything straight . i stopped caring remembering names clinton staff various world leaders halfway through . problem presidential portion book high level political commentary , especially during impeachment proceedings . often , clinton reads if he delivering campaign speech entire time , continually trying make his point reader . though it interesting know clinton thoughts , preaching becomes tedious rather quickly . meetings clinton national world leaders covered very well contain many examples behind-closed-doors types action i mentioned before . overall , this portion book good account day-to-day life president , told very detailed , first-person style . my life recommended anyone who interested life 42nd president , well history past twenty years . it interesting story enjoyed almost anyone .	1

i wish i written " mission-based marketing , " consultant peter brinckerhoff smart , well-written book . certainly title terrific , underscoring it only effective marketing nonprofit mission-based . but more than brinckerhoff written basic book marketing nonetheless propounds some very advanced views . " mission-based marketing , " its companion workbook " mission-based marketing : organizational development workbook , " largely book reluctant novice nonprofit marketer , his board or staff . there lot handholding here , including lengthy treatises subjects `competition ' ( it ultimately good , he says ) `flexibility ' ( it even better ) . same token , " mission-based " conspicuously free basic marketing concepts like " four ps . " there little substance pricing theory , nothing much branding , pet subject most for-profit marketing mavens . instead , brinckerhoff starts laying out plain-spoken english why nonprofits who may thought marketing `sales ' thereby unsavory , get past idea . he calls such thinking " non-profit marketing disability . " it stems , he says , knowing what your constituents " need " caring little what they " want ; " filling wants defining thereby unsavory element for-profit marketing . but brinckerhoff easily dispatches non-profit marketing disability before twentieth page . matter , he takes starch out taint sales while he it . imagine would-be client treatment facility dangerous herself or others , he suggests . client needs treatment , but she doesn't want it . since she adult , you can't force her into treatment . but you market her , this case `sell ' her treatment . " job mission-based marketer make person want what they need , " he says . ergo , " good marketing good mission . " nice ! even all handholding , there still plenty relevant here more sophisticated mission-based marketers , especially chapters customer service marketing planning . but it testament value validity this book i finished " mission-based marketing " same time i reading issue " marketing management , " magazine published american marketing association , i found them markedly similar . several scholar-members ama proposed changing product-centric four ps marketing mix customer-centric " siva , " [ solutions , information , value access ] . this cutting-edge thinking leading lights world largest marketing membership group , it mirrors broad strokes brinckerhoff central themes . i quibbles , but they're minor . chapter five marketing cycle , he takes his 6-part customer-centric approach , so similar siva , out trot . second stage " market inquiry " or " what your markets really want ? " presumes you actually discover what your markets really want . while brinckerhoff soundly recommends " asking , asking , listening " it not necessarily given you discover what your customer wants simply asking them . customer may not know , or able articulate what he wants . not all marketers or market researchers capable parsing out those hidden wants , either . plus , any customer-centric approach not-for-profit or for-profit marketing runs risk merely reactive ; not innovating . no focus group ever suggested original sony walkman , instance . instead , it birthed minds engineers who knew what possible , sold marketers who knew how make people want something they never conceived . mission-based marketing well-wrought book , excellent resource , terrific addition any mission-based marketer library	1

beckett " krapp last tape " doesn't seem get respect it deserves drama critics because it always set up against his other works . it lacks tremendous absurdity " waiting godot " or " endgame " but it its fair share . some respects " krapp lasttape " much more human face than others : we understand krapp much more than gogo or didi . this serves make him someone whom we more easily identify , therefore , makes him more tragic . essential question this play raises " who krapp ?

this long biography capote covers writer birth death , appears comprehensive . mostly it easy read fascinating character well great author . i can't give it five stars however , since i feel it problems several areas . first , author spends too much time capote childhood . alright already , he weird childhood . so most people these days ! it dragged far too long expense more interesting periods where five years could fly one ( short ) chapter . second , there should introductory chapter ny high society before author disclussed capote voyage through it . sort what painter french high society before describing how proust entered it . this would useful because no one remembers who these people anymore ( i adult time ny ) or worse , only remembers them because they friends or foes , or both , capote . so book dated respect ; reading it 2006 it seems like capote conferring social distinction rather trying acquire it . finally paperback cover absolutely weird . i know it tie movie , but instead picture capote it picture seymour hoffman playing capote . bizzare . it would like biography lincoln picture raymond massey cover . considering hoffman didn't even mention capote academy awards , it truely strange	1

there some really excellent detailed reviews already posted here , i try not duplicate their efforts . however benefit those considering whether purchase this book i make some brief observations . first , this book demonstrates why tufte continues more or less unique field technical graphical communications . his broad sweep his high equal concern aesthetics , cognitive decision science , principles handling evidence , intellectual integrity all combine produce uniquely valuable examples how help facts tell their otherwise often hidden story . each tufte books , including this one , clearly labor love his part , even point sometimes annoyingly painstaking . i almost don't want sully his books my scrawled margin notes diagrams ( but i anyway , there just too much there think resist it ! ) . second , i think tufte rightly accused keeping same basic presentation relatively minor variation ever since his first remarkable brilliant book series . if you just want know principles he espouses , you could probably just buy first book not bother rest . it leading example illustrating core principles example after detailed example exceptional visual displays information subsequent books , including beautiful evidence , add value corpus . there some idiosyncrasies here don't really pertain evidence , such photos tufte own sculptures , but these arguably add certain charm presentation sometimes help illustrate unusual breadth author application principles . i don't find them particularly useful , but i've spoken others different interests who found them fascinating addition . third , tufte work , all its inspiration care , not detailed enough stand its own course technical graphical communication . you need supplement it education graphing techniques , statistics , decision making , evidence handling , so , order apply principles real novel cases . his main value culling universal principles all these fields help guide their application real world unique circumstances . beautiful evidence , like tufte previous books series , illustrates masterpieces technical communications why they masterpieces , it doesn't offer step step instructions recreating them . his best , tufte inspires your own genius , bridging art science , he doesn't offer algorithm creating graphs . i think worst you could say beautiful evidence same tufte work general , he become rather repetitive his explanations , may often tantalize you brilliances you may never able learn or apply . best i often try remember examples tufte books there may better way communicate information , there may often value or least inspiration perusing what really clever people similar information past , rather than just applying boilerplate graph problem . most useful specific things i gotten beautiful evidence so far concept sparklines embed quantitatve context elegantly into text , particularly cogent description tufte general principles , his detailed analysis " cognitive style " bullet list presentations found so widely presentations . those who , like me , never tire seeing masterful examples communicating technical information , inspired them improve their own communications , even find these examples beautiful well elegant , this book very welcome rewarding addition .	1

blame it new jersey public schools , if you like . i find they're always handy scapegoat . because - though i blush confess it - i first came across emily bronte classic tale undying love people confusingly similar names , wuthering heights , when i saw glamorous , romantic 1939 film story , not when i read actual grim gritty 1847 novel . this may explain why , long time , when i thought novel hero , heathcliff , i thought heroic-looking , sad-eyed laurence oliver , consequently held this famous brooder rather high esteem . i so no longer , reason why summed up two words - john sutherland . this professor scholar , heathcliff murderer ?, put some greatest novels western literature under microscope , found out all their inconsistencies flaws . he looks classic literature new perspective , asking intriguing questions its novels , offering solutions problems they raise - putting new spins onto books which most people probably feel they already know inside out . i , example , thought i knew something character heathcliff , until i read sutherland essay him , his various deeds doings . after reading this book ( which discusses works bronte , charles dickens , jane austen , george eliot , amongst many others ) i guarantee you look some your favorite books entirely new way - see depths , puzzles , inconsistencies them you never saw before . i , one , now greet laurence olivier entrance screen wuthering heights boo rather rude hand gesture , rather than pinkening cheek fluttering lash . such power heathcliff murderer	1
if you're looking rip-roaring yarn hoary old prospectors jumping claims battling over gold nuggets , this not it . johnson book thoughtful work social history reexamines collective memory many people gold rush ( all-american gold-diggin ' brawl ) context letters , diary entries , legal cases ballads people who actually * * gold rush used document their lives . picture emerges one complex society grew up around promise instant wealth . one thing , americans not ( johnson account ) always largest group miners southern mines : french guardsmen expelled their country , chilean aristocrats , mexican families , canadian traders , chinese sailors , indian tribes lived area before gold rush began - everyone got action . this cultural meeting place brought interactions both peaceful ( lessons how use chopsticks ) violent ( practise " frontier justice " usually targeted non-whites without caring whether person hanged anything original crime , if fact original crime took place . ) johnson book sketches believable portrait evolvoing politics region , way explains everything origin chinese landromats antonio bandaras character _the mask zorro_ ( suddenly much more interesting movie since i read this book ) . johnson writing gender-studies perspective , so she particularly interested issues sprung up ( mostly ) all-male mining society . if you're culture considers women work " unmanly , " thus never taught cook or clean yourself , how you survive frontier environment ? some , answer you didn't ( miners got sick lot , scurvy one killers ) . others you either learned practise domestic chores yourself ( which you could then sell or split others ) , and/or you paid lot money help . other words , gold rush not only attracted men after gold , but women who saw they could make money selling services ( all kinds ) gold miners . johnson section french prostitutes , example ( who going get taxed inspected veneral disease if they stayed france ) , explains how real money-makers gold rush often not miners ( who depended luck strike it rich ) but merchants who sold them . thing i admired most this book author voice . johnson presents us bunch stories , but instead offering just one interpretation , she gives us many possible readings stories also reminds us whose voice left out . example , her section miners diaries she reminds reader diary-writing important part 19 protestantism , so most available diaries written very religious , protestant perspective . older historical approach would claimed this meant most people camp religious protestants : johnson , other hand , reminds us catholics , non-religious protestants illiterates there too , but they weren't writing diaries . overall , i thought johnson book very impressive . it won't necessarily give you complete picture gold rush ( johnson only looking southern mines ) , but it give you more complete picture than you'd if all you'd ever heard hollywood version history . looking some other reviews this site , i gather some people get mad this book because it doesn't squish history into adventure story , while others get mad because they see it " liberal revisionism . " i actually thought johnson really fair her presentation history : she spends lot time looking raiding fights going * all * racial groups this area , she makes it clear fact american miners came dominate mines lot fact mines usa , government tended ( but not always ) side natives over foreigners . revisionist angle , yes , johnson challenging popular perception what gold rush ( all-american bonanza ) but she doing so based what seems lot historical evidence testimony miners themselves . other words i'm gathering most people who hated this book looking something completely different than what i would look history book . if you , like me , looking well-written interpretation historical evidence acknowledges when author * doesn't * know something , this good history book .	1

" but " night shift " couple clunkers , too , if " nightmares dreamscapes " fails times , it so sake king advancing his craft . if you find stories like " ten o'clock people " " rainy season " anything less than classic king shorts like " mangler " " quitters , inc ., " you kidding yourself more than little bit	1

i couldn't even begin count all things stanley coren gets wrong intelligence dogs . instance , one section he claims dogs ability math but part book he claims they can't tell difference tug toy human skin . first clearly way beyond dog capacity , while second something which comes totally natural them . how coren get things so backwards ? " intelligence " tests he provides nothing intelligence but how focused or driven dog test ( or game ) while you're doing it . instance , i tried one tests my dog putting piece food under towel , then waited see how long it took him find treat . i'd still waiting if i hadn't decided he'd never look under towel . then i tried same game teasing my dog one his favorite toys . then i hid it under towel , it took him less than second get toy . so my dog apparently both smarter dumber ends coren intelligence spectrum . ( this just one example , way : whole idea testing dog iq like this bogus . ) don't get me started coren pedantic retelling alpha myth . granted , he wrote this book before latest research wild wolf packs proved there no such thing dominance hierarchy , or alpha wolf , or rest alpha nonsense . though , i doubt if even data would change coren mind . after all , he seriously recommends rolling your dog over its back every day pulling one animal hind legs air create posture which supposedly " signifies submission pack leader . " ( really ? dogs use " signifiers " now ? )the funny thing , shortly after reading passage i saw wolf documentary tv papa wolf exact opposite or what coren recommends ! he rolled over his back let pups jump top him bite his nose ! they loved it ! so i tried what papa wolf his pups my dog -- alpha male , if there ever one -- he loved it . later night , our last walk , he ten times obedient me than he before i'd mimicked papa wolf behavior . again , coren everything exactly backwards reality . this " through looking glass " quality persists throughout book , coren even saying dogs capable hypothetical , symbolic , conceptual thinking . wha ..? i'm sorry . i love dogs i think they wonderful abilities should honored respected , but abilities they geared dog , not mini-me four legs tail . one thing , fully one third dog brain devoted processing olfactory information , none processing symbols concepts . i think coren needs little more research comparative neuroanatomy actual wolf behavior before he makes more ridiculous claims like ones he made this inane book .	-1

donald davis , his book lightning strike , made effort clarify historical record providing details demonstrate , once all , who responsible shooting down bomber carried admiral isoroku yamamoto over bougainville april 1943 . much book focuses events leading up mission find shoot down yamamoto aircraft . this first portion book introduces members strike team responsible intercepting destroying targe t.t om lanphier , one pilots mission , claimed he solely responsible shooting down aircraft carrying yamamoto , but davis brings forth new evidence not available contemporary historians immediately following war demonstrating lanphier not only not shoot down yamamoto plane himself , but probably no involvement whatsoever shooting down aircraf t.t he book easy read certainly provide new insights into 60+ year old controversy over who responsible ending yamamoto involvement world war ii . i would change only couple things book - first very minor : conclusion book , davis tells us rex . barber responsible destruction yamamoto bomber , but then he ends book writing " 2004 ... rex barber deserved 100 percent credit shooting down admiral yamamoto . resolution accompanied legislation clear path congress finally award barber medal honor . " unfortunately , he not tell reader whether or not deserved medal ever awarded ( it turns out , legislation still pending publication date book ) . 2nd thing i would change little more significant - i would changed length book removing some pre-mission background information members strike team . details presented make interesting reading , but ( my opinion ) , don't really add understanding mission itself . i would strongly recommend this book anyone looking understanding what happened admiral yamamoto fateful day	1

thomas jefferson left powerful legacy america ( , some extent , around world ) . no other founding father evokes much passion contemporary society jefferson , nor any figure harder understand . when it comes reflecting jefferson what he stood , author joseph ellis notes " [ i]t seems impossible steer honorable course idolatry evisceration . " other words , you either love him or you hate him . ellis ' objective steer honorable course attempt understand appreciate " true jefferson , " which third president tended hide everyone , including ( above all ) himself . most part , ellis successful his goal balance , although one gets sense author tilts decidedly toward evisceration . ellis endeavors only understand jefferson given his upbringing colonial virginia , experience continental congress , paris late 1780s , partisan rancor 1790s , international upheaval overshadowed his presidency . there no effort extract any core timeless jeffersonian principles present future generations latch . ellis notes , " lifting jefferson out [ his historical ] context bringing him into present like trying plant cut flowers . " given his unique objective , it isn't surprising ellis took unique approach . he zooms jefferson critical moments his life explains his motivations beliefs time where they came . ellis reviews just four periods jefferson storied career , but he so great depth great insigh t.t he jefferson emerges these vignettes able earnest statesman , but also whimsical dreamer pathological powers self-deception . jefferson , american revolution opening salvo global war despotism corruption , french revolution just second act . his return public life 1796 ( ellis says jefferson retirement early 1790s sincerely meant permanent ) motivated genuine fear federalists intended rollback american revolution . vein , his whole life dedicated promoting protecting utopian vision country small , yeoman farmers ( jefferson lived inherited plantation ) , little debt ( jefferson died bankrupt ) no slavery ( jefferson owned hundreds , relied them his livelihood didn't set them free his death ) . ideally , federal government would reduced handling foreign affairs . jefferson hostility large active central government so deep unshakable ellis likens his election presidency 1800 martin luther named pope ( jefferson presidency witnessed one most audacious executive acts american history , louisiana purchase - contradiction ellis ascribes unique place " west " held jefferson view future america ) . end , i found my sense " understanding jefferson " actually diminished reading this book , yet it excellent , beautifully written i would unhesitatingly recommend it someone solid background sage monticello . we don't live " jefferson america " today , yet large highly educated swaths society believe we . perhaps same pathological self-deception exhibited jefferson somehow collectively inherited future generations americans .	1

what zionism why must it critiqued . this book addressing latter , but we must address both . zionism nationaist idea coming late 19th century . it nationalist religious secular(one many ironies ) embraces jewish people quest nation . we must view it we view pan-turkism . pan-tukism views turks people , but turks also muslim , thus it encompasses religion nation . jews basically same , nation wrapped inside religion , like all old tribal religions used like hindu nationalism today , we might japan . zionism socialist . it looked land , originally uganda , then israel , which shoes just how unreligious it originally , since it didnt see israel essential . israel suprisingly well like most national movements it envisioned ' greater ' version homeland , like ' greater ' greece or ' greater ' serbia , or ukraine . critique it doenst clean hands . most ideologies dont . ideology its affects not two same . communism isnt inherently evil , but it responsible evil . however contemporary critique zionism decidedly left wing communist view nation doesnt matter . but then communism died so zionism . zionism its ideals died long ago . so why this book trying put new spin it ? most likely what we seeing here appeasment international media , neo-nazi islamist obsession ' zionists ' . however zionists dont exist . it red herring , like those who used find communist conspiracies everywhere . this book outdated lacks percpective . seth . frantzma	-1

written late 1990s ( later updated ) , tom friedman lengthy assessment globalization post-cold war ear etchd its place one more prominent optimistic takes subjec t.t he ny times columnist main thesis cold war system politcs ( where governments largely determine course action ) given place globalization ( where governments open up free-market capitalism allw open reporting communication ) . friedman spends more time focusing benefits globalization -- mainly , easy access cheap world labor provides poorer countreis access successful jobs , allowing them improve ( lexus ) . meanwhile , goods manufactured more cheaply , saving us money . also , free open reporting helps lead governments more towards democracy discourages corruption . thirdly , countries who interact economically disincentive get into military conflicts each other . much made globalization negatives , which friedman not ignore . this threat our sense community ( olive tree ) which we fight feel part . globalization , this local identity risk , especially smaller countries which feel they becoming " americanized . " while book long , tlatot success relies friedman great storytelling his ability encapsulate complex issues into short catch phrases ( such electronic herd golden straitjacket ) . there several problems this book , most significant which this -- people don't want like globalization . they would much rather view it ominous , spooky power which anyone sufficient intellect should dread . whether it couched environmental destruction , corporate hegemony , american imperialism , third-world exploitation , people love hate it , friedman unable properly combat this inertia . it also significant after last several years note areas where friedman predictions turned out incorrect . while internet communications revolution changed anglosphere , it not spurred much democratic change china . friedman comments enron worth good laugh well . while some aspects friedman analysis super-empowered individual threat seems prescient regard 9/11 , there aspects book which ring hollow post-9/11 world . friedman offers possible solutions problems which globalization might present , some which contain some political bias ( i'm still not exactly clear how stricter gun control laws lead better economy , instance ) . though i not read world flat , i surmise this friedman answer obselete elements this book . despite these issues , most readers find this book among most interesting those subject . while you may not always agree him , you enjoy friedman stories analysis future	1

if you want know joe hill , this not book you . readers curious stegner career might interested this early effort , but after this first impression , i little curiosity author later efforts , despite his reputation master teacher . writing legend difficult because temptation reduce myth human terms great . process putting feet clay immortal joe hill , stegner creates hoodlum-poet , angry , alienated legal alien father complex , stiff upper lip , penchant violence . occasional descriptions his songwriting seem facile psychological . one senses author precious regard his own words images struggling his need macho tough-minded . i couldn't help but feel joe hill cut down make room wallace stegner , real artist . revolutionary , wobbly , visionary , author makes persona seem like so much hype rhetoric . there nice description labor camp full suffering potential organization , but most labor scenes sprinkled so much violence one gets little sense idealistic nature enterprise . anyone interested truth needs see both sides human behavior , but stegner penchant small , trivial , mean outweighs any vision lasting good , despite his creation doubting minister . we few opportunities see joe his best this novel , but those moments consistently undercut awareness his words memorialized self-aggrandizing union leaders deluded idealists . after over one hundred pages his trial death , reader sick stegner malaise bad spirits . if you want know joe hill , sing his songs .	-1

william shakespeare play " much ado nothing " extremely funny piece literature . i thought it very cleverly planned out humorously executed . dogberry his men constantly mixing up words their meanings it gave readers comic relief . deceit mistaken identities added so much humor already capturing story . i believe shakespeare main point writing this play show many times , people get worked up over simple miscommunications . you mishear something wrong , or your anger , you tune out someone before getting all facts . all we would need fix certain problem would going source information , but many times we take easy way out . we jump gun little choose believe whatever told us despite our gut feeling information wrong . example this would when leonato heard hero scandalous evening borachio . despite fact she his daughter he would know her better than anyone , leonato believes lies told hero . leonato , her father one who raised her , should known his daughter well enough know she would not dishonor her fianc� herself . especially night before wedding she waiting . instead choosing believe his daughter , who firmly denies any all sexual relationships , he joins claudio , don john , don pedro disgracing her . one lesson learned " much ado nothing " never should people automatically assume something correct . we should " take everything grain salt " - test everything . people world these days so willing lie us readily so without second thought . many times people lied without even knowing someone so . true , sometimes lying deceit all good fun , but it still possibility hurting someone . even innocent lying its consequences . benedick beatrice both believed almost immediately what they overheard their friends saying garden correct completely true . neither person decided test what they heard . see if what said true . because both not check see if information they heard correct , everything worked out . both assumed what they heard true acted it . there no visible consequences . what mess you would if benedick decided what he overheard could not possibly true . beatrice would made fool out herself while thinking benedick felt same way . same could said other way around . i would recommend this play other readers . if people don't like read , then i would not tell others it . combination not liking read difficulty understanding old english would not make very fun pleasurable read . many would miss out humor cleverness shakespeare brilliantly displayed his audience . readers other hand would most likely like this play . humor lightheartedness makes it enjoyable play . i found myself constantly wanting know what would happen next how it would end- how shakespeare would wrap it up . happy ending also nice touch . yes , old english adds challenge reading . sometimes hard understand language makes you stop think what shakespeare trying say ultimately makes you stop realize what he truly trying communicate his audience .	1

author lovell clearly wants refurbish isabel burton image , she so . doing so , lovell not appear let desire attain goal outrun evidence hand . indeed , lovell provides reader considerable body previously unknown and/or unused material which supports her contention isabel burton --- long branded some sort religion-filled -frenzied lunatic --- piece many other victorian women who actually helped their husband careers immeasurably . ( consider , example , elizabeth custer , wife george armstrong custer . ) this book not end-all-be-all those interested richard burton , however , there actually very little way detail his travels experiences . this makes sense when narrative hits areas burton himself purposely left blank ( his indian years , forinstance ) . but this approach makes problems areas burton purposely highlighted . i enjoyed book book , found lovell stylish writer who alerts her readers her own biases ( always welcome historian ) . but those who read burton before this could --- stress " could " --- oddly unsatisfying piece work . those who come subject fresh , or wish round out their understandings this intriguing couple ( hence " could " caveat above ) , this wonderful book . it , after all , not all richard ( although richard might've thought so ; yet even here , lovell makes him good deal more rounded his sensibilities sensitivities than many who've earlier given him go ) . book couple , within those parameters it solid fascinating volume	1

most important subject homeschoolers --- teaching beginning reading -- moores give poor advice . read page 107 . they advise you wary " intensive " phonics but they don't define intensive phonics . they say young children who problems reading usually " just not ready . " my experience most such children simply not effective phonics . book advice : if you weak background phonics go out get book or program . idea repeated prevous books many bright children devise systems phonics other attack skills largely themselves . but bright child might got into useful reading much sooner he gently introduced phonics . what if you wait wait your bright child never figure out complexity word decoding . because early years so important language acquistion , starting phonics two or three years later could limit child future potential cause parents ( child ) much needless heartache stress . don't , moore recommend , delay wait light " click . " when child name letters alphabet gently start teaching systematic phonics . bright students move forward quickly , slow ones move slowly but none should experience failure if taught patient parents . page 105 he suggests " watching opportunities " teach . teaching sound o oats . most experts would say teach sound oa oats . book condemns " zealots " who rush little children into formal reading . it says development principles opposing this unchangeable rock gibraltar . ok , i don't want " rush " my child . my child wants read . tell me how it gently !! this reviewer concerned only chapter three this book	-1
before you start this book you should know any resemblance book movies hollywood turned out completely accidental . names main characters only similarity i could find norm , book much better . this , last installment musketeer series , gives us story final acts our heroes , athos , porthos , aramis d'artagnan . unlike many literary characters our musketeer friends aged story progresses all retired but d'artagnan who still captain king musketeers . athos porthos quite wealthy aramis attained rank bishop . aramis not content his station however knows secret he thinks he use become pope . this secret knowledge louis xiv twin brother who hidden away bastille aramis quite sure this brother would make better king than current monarch . aramis also pretty sure new king gratitude nominate his liberator office cardinal then scheme make new cardinal pope . this plot aramis acts alone except some help porthos who no idea what he involved . twins successfully switched short while but then plot falls apart aramis porthos flee their lives although porthos still not sure what going . " pretender " throne left his own devices aramis imprisoned new location iron mask added his discomfiture . aramis not come across this book much hero many respects this story much darker than it predecessors . given advanced age musketeers , there not nearly many swashbuckling adventures one accustomed but occasion porthos particular rise challenge . political intrigues court louis xiv decline musketeers fact main plot lines this story . end , only one four left find out which one you just read book . athos , way , only seems play side role this story neither involved plot against king or his rescue . always case , dumas ' writing style superb filled historical fact . he tend bit wordy his books often much longer than necessary but even this slight drawback he ranks one my all-time favorite authors . this book dumas closes out careers his most popular characters he it style	1

i think it good idea question some actions our present administration . but i also think it good idea use facts logic so . even lying counterproductive administration look good when attacks it illogical , irrational , false . election 2000 florida stolen ? course . bush gotten all gore votes gore gotten all bush votes , bush would won very easily . but when gore one who got most votes florida , he lost . there legislature supreme court made sure ! still , i think it little good mention this unless one wants honest other issues well . gandhi good person discuss book mentions israel ? maybe so ! after all , gandhi recommended jews try non-violence against germans late 1930s . idea not work . it just bad guess ? maybe . but gandhi also vicious opponent jewish rights levant . he no hero far i am concerned . i'd like moral person , means i wouldn't want like gandhi ! i think it may good idea modify some truly counterproductive colonial boundaries some middle eastern nations . but bronner totally unconvincing making his case , given his terrible biases against human rights middle east . let see , he says " worry over treatment arabs jews stretches back last century " ( i think he means nineteenth , not twentieth ) . arabs jews ? um , i suppose one could say worry over treatment germans , poles , russians , others jews stretches back century more . worry over treatment white americans blacks stretches back before civil war . but sentence makes whole book suspect : he appears attacking human rights vengeance . author says there " ethnic cleansing " creating israel , " employing rape torture turning those arabs living new state into second-class citizens . " he implying jews villains arabs victims . but that not true . once again , same sort thing could said , again untruthfully , behavior jews during world war two . once again , this sort statement simply vicious attack human rights well truth . bronner also attacks ariel sharon visiting temple mount ( holiest jewish site , which happens jerusalem , which happens capital israel ) . plenty knesset members visiting temple mount . why not ? but bronner makes it look if sharon something wrong visit it . he calls it " publicity stunt , " without explaining if israel tried prevent him going there , would rather serious attack jewish rights nation israel . israel , after hit series suicide bombings originating jenin , finally took some rather heroic action . it sent some ground troops jenin . this litmus test me . bronner least praise this ? no , he mocks it ! author ideas land awfully arbitrary . he shows maps indicate , falsely , israel expanding . that preposterous . 1968 , israel included all sinai . it gave all land , several times larger than rest israel , egypt . but bronner only shows tiny israel 1948 claims israel now bigger than ! bronner applaud " geneva initiative " way achieve peace region , but i think he way off base here well . author blasts authors such christopher hitchens paul berman simply speaking truth times when george bush might agreed them . he really think it ought obligation us lie just so we'll disagree george bush ? i would think truly terrible idea would simply make bush look good make us look bad . bronner asks us , rhetorically , what wrong noam chomsky . well , i'll tell you what wrong him . sure , chomsky bright sometimes makes some good points . but number issues , he simply dishonest , he uses dishonesty support those who attack human rights . this book not lead us , um , true path .	-1

donald richie extraordinary interpreter japanese culture . he translated many great modern japanese books i'm certain his knowledge japanese language incomparable . unfortunately , what he most certainly not legitimate film critic . damage he kurosawa this book unwarranted small-minded . more than i could take . richie understanding film itself completely inadequate , forcing him resort literary interpretive techniques order make up his misunderstanding cinematography nature film general . heart it - he incabable " seeing " which foundation kurosawa work . if you like wayward , stream-of-consciousness criticism masquerading serious film criticism you'll certainly get your fill . but most what richie this book lob irrelevant pot-shots kurosawa , his personality , " mistakes " overriding theme ( which becomes readily apparent towards end ) his last films just sentimental drivel . fact i can't think single film covered this book richie bear like wholeheartedly . not without uncomfortable juxtaposition his true talent ( literature ) film criticism - which i found completely inadequate . gaping hole his obvious lack understanding process filmaking , or rather way which this process differs writing meaning structure . his tone pompous , downbeat arrogant . ritchie - kurosawa film - his greatest mistake - turn reader attention " novel " kurosawa . over over he naggingly searches ( pouring over grains sand)for continuity kurosawa work bring " literary " motif everything he , say , every disparity exists one film next scrutinized under lamp literary criticism , summarily dismissed . i can't imagine anything more inappropriate work film criticism . all all , this book comes off snotty jab master filmaker master spokesman japanese culture who simply not understand film . i found reading it wretched experience . i hope you too	-1

this absolutely riveting book well describes absolute mess russia past 15 years . satter sugar-coats nothing , quite appropriately not strive " balance " including any " feel-good " stories . reading this book course not let you know ordinary moments happiness russians ( like all people ) feel , but this because satter writing economic political structures russia , which really cause nothing but misery vast majority russians . this book valuable precisely because it not flinch darkness . it pure chronicle suffering , something which may " uncool " among writers these days but which corresponds well ordinary person situation russia . satter also not make mistake so many russia-watchers ; making false distinction " good reformers " " bad putin " . they all actually same gang . said , i can't give this book 5 stars because underneath wonderful expository writing i sense vaguely repulsive thesis : russians way they because their unique " moral failings " . all readers should aware satter financed scaife crew . this probably makes darkness dawn far best book ever funded these fanatics , but i can't help but wonder if this funding came small cost . why , instance , satter not mention cronyism , viciousness lack concern human life hardly stops when one exits borders old ussr ? why he so reluctant place even smidgen blame army western advisors pundits helped create still apologize " shock treatment " reform ? we not live global economy these days ? moral responsibility cease just because we live across ocean don't stare into faces those victimized our ideology ? what all this nonsense " russian soul " ? us treasury officials washington think-tank hacks also share cup this mysterious " soul " when they sanctioned gaidar insanity ? other reviewer who noted one should not break mirror just because one not like what one sees hit nail head . i imagine scaife cronies getting off this bashing bad , bad russians , but they not draw any conclusions our own country our own culture ?

i've read all previous reviews amazon this book , i surprised find what i consider major message this book overlooked all reviews . first all , let me say i found this excellent , elegant exposition just what title indicates - " heart islam . " professor nasr explains better any other writer i ever read just what things like love justice mean muslim inner life . one hand , he addressing post 9/11 world , attempting nurture sense balance what terrorist attacks meant , mainstream muslim perspective . believers religions not always live up ideals expressed their faith nothing new , professor nasr certainly isn't trying deny . but major point - one suggested subtitle " enduring values humanity " , one taken more serious demeanor since 9/11 - professor nasr attempt show islam , society , sees itself threatened secularism globalism , which basically western creations which western society assumed , without any really good reason , universal application , which western governments , beginning imperialist period up present , foisted middle east , theoretically its own good . he points out , many major ills muslim societies , such oppressive regimes , result western tampering their societies over last two hundred years ; if one doubts this possible , one only look other areas globe , such central america , realize this not only possible , but almost unavoidable , long major industrialized powers insist setting moral tone world - moral tone predicated maintaining control other areas world , mostly premise economic necessity . professor nasr writer tradition major esotericists twentieth century , most notably rene guenon frithjof schuon among others , whose major warning us world become more secularized , true belief god jeopardized result ; secularism creates world which god marginalized , primarily basis belief inspires tyrrany . globalism further creates world which there no real place people base their lives belief god , because economic necessity becomes only constant life . final analysis , i believe this major argument this book ; 9/11 simply provided reason making argument , time goes this argument seems make more more sense , america sinks into its third year trying create middle east its desired secularized , globalized image . you may not agree this premise ( although i ); worst part all most westerners don't understand argument all	1

yoda one most important beloved characters star wars universe , yet most books comics relegate him background role . book titled yoda : dark rendezvous , one would expect see lot yoda action . good news sean stewart truly delivers . while yoda not featured constantly throughout book , when he appear his characterization simply flawless terrifically well . stewart captures all varied sides yoda we first glimpsed empire strikes back masterfully depicts why this 900-year-old jedi held such lofty regard why he so near dear our hearts fans . count dooku extended offer yoda meet person dark side-drenched planet vjun possibly discuss way end clone wars . yoda knows this probably trap , but goes anyway . he cannot extinguish hope his heart his fallen student one day see light return jedi temple try set things right . two new jedi introduced , maks leem jai maruk , their padawans whie scout . stewart builds these new characters skillfully quickly , so time they get into situation they may not all escape mid-book , there true emotion invested story . i very much liked how scout whie embodied two different kinds potential jedi . scout work like mad constantly make mistakes get anywhere order , while whie strong force effortlessly glides through training temple . however , scout experience scrapping her way through life serves her well once they outside tidy confines their home coruscant . asajj ventress displays truly vicious streak her nature . her actions during spaceport fight mid-book deplorable , yet her animal charisma still comes through her interactions dooku . her conversation dooku concerning his ultimate role schemes darth sidious fascinating ; it this sort insight , which fills out what only sketched films , one primary reasons i enjoy reading star wars novels so much ( even if my personal views sometimes differ ) . stewart lets us rattle around dooku head several occasions , what we find there fully realized , powerful man who knows he may very well wrong path but who can't bring himself step off . book quite funny star wars novel . stewart not afraid drop humor even most dire situations , while i enjoyed vast majority it , points it almost became too much . overall , though , it welcome aspect most it worked fine . it certainly helped distinguish good guys bad , dooku , ventress , traitor tac-spec footman droid kept serious . i also gleaned stewart must birder ( one myself ) his references zeiss , his specific mentions birds several times vjun coruscant , most definitively his citing peterson guide droids republic , vol . vii ( peterson birds guides arguably most classic successful line modern birding books ) . i found climax book bit lacking suspense department , dooku ventress essentially just run away we know films dooku yoda not going come terms war before revenge sith . climax satisfying psychologically but story not really end much changed big picture . i mentioned above , it stewart characterization yoda this book truly shines . we learn many details , such yoda adoration disgusting food , how he handles training youngest padawans , how he feels count dooku war , what sort r2 unit he would make . conversation dooku yoda climax terrifically interesting , image yoda standing count window ledge pouring rain tapping window grinning like gargoyle one i'll take me this book long time . yoda depicted true master inarguable spiritual center order , but same time he not portrayed perfect . it clear he learned so much making centuries mistakes . yoda : dark rendezvous delightful , fast-paced read , taking more chances tone than typical star wars novel really paid off . this sean stewart only star wars novel date ; i hope del rey plans work him again future .	1

kaminsky written easy-reading , far-ranging account his travels thoughts pork . book divided into short chapters , grouped roughly topic , interspersed recipes . recipes range fairly straightforward extremely complex . i havent tried any them , but they sound delicious . kaminsky starts book focused ham , specifically spanish iberian ham , goes into some detail food science studies curing process . it all remains fairly non-techincal , consisting mainly quotes experts , but scientific study welcome addition normal food/travel writing . he also discusses spanish conquest americas , how their introduction swine changed way we eat today . he uses this segue talk american barbeque , then he delves deeper into american pigs , looking factory farms dominate pork production us . section factory farming important one , it certainly deserves its own in-depth book ( perhaps social governmental intervention , depending your point view . ) overall , this engaging book . there some minor faults , though . i felt narrative structure could little more tightly focused ; kaminsky covers lot topics , sometimes i felt there little tying everything together . section " pork taboo " seemed particularly underdevolped . it felt times like it might series long magazine articles , rather than single book . i also found kaminsky writing style bit pretentious times , when simpler descriptions ( less name-dropping ) would sufficed . overall though , i would recommend this book . it filled eccentric characters , often far-off places , who passionate pigs , which exactly what you want food travel book	1

someone who struggled eating disorders over ten years both severely underweight overweight within space 18 months , i thought this book might some way helpful . some it , but major flaws it also contains ruined my reading it . bovey angry - fair enough , but she lets her anger cloud her vision goes much too far many poorly-researched , aggressive arguments . particular points she tries make anorexia extremely offensive . she narrows her focus see only world which compassion finite apparently selfish anorexic stolen all sympathy owed overweight woman . just simply isn't way things anorexics many ways treated far worse than overweight - force-fed locked isolated rooms without light or conversation until certain weight gained what i remember . but this isn't point , anyhow . it not competition . there no need try prove your own suffering more worthy than someone else . points you make should able stand alone . bovey viewpoint extreme . she no distance what she writing , which make passionate book , but also very black-and-white attitude . surely there space middle ground acceptance , where larger people not vie respect expense others ? truly fair world , one which no one discriminated against because size , i would like think criticizing very thin would also unacceptable . many ways , bovey aggression reaffirms her perceived quot ; outsiderquot ; status allows little room reconciliation	-1

this companion volume care soul presents same intelligent blend jungian psychology neo-christian spirituality . but , whereas care soul stressed psychological psychotherapeutical aspect , this one concentrates spirituality side . neo-christian ( gallicism ) i mean liberal , post-modern christianity , not new age-style gallimaufry . if you read emerson or ever heard unitarian-universalist sermon , you'll know just what implies . there very little moore ideas either supernatural or " magical " . mystery within . infinite or transcendental essentially symbolic ( nevertheless true , one would expect true symbols . ) like emerson , moore interesting , provocative , elegant writer ; , like sage concord , not always notably clear one ! more traditionally-minded mainline christian need not necessarily agree everything moore says . but his epigrammatic style full thought-provoking statements meditation . this useful book , someone said .	1
i'm enjoying this book far more than all other elementary game theory textbooks i've plowed through . i'm doctoral student economics , i'm reading this book readings class . i highly recommend it anyone interested dipping their feet into game theory . it very readable uses no mathematics , thus making it accessible non-technician beginner . brams uses 2x2 , non-cooperative models complete information most part . he uses both game trees normal expressions situations under analysis . this , i think , one strengths book . stories familiar , if you familiar judeo-christian religion , thus this captures one attention ways abstract stories prisoners , husband wives other classic illustrations game theory may not . god included player situations brams analyzes , his interpretations , very least , illuminating . while reading it , i reminded edmund burke quote which more or less says even heresy valuable insofar it stirs stagnant waters science such progress made . i am finding even when i disagree brams interpretation , his game theoretic explanation nonetheless sheds some light story , well broader spiritual ideas like faith rationality . one criticism i book , though , it limited only games complete information . i said , i believe fact this book only uses noncooperative games complete information its strength , precisely because i believe this book helpful primer game theory . but , because he omits problems imperfect information , i am left wondering whether he truly modeled many these situations accurately he could . instance , when dealing " sacrifice game " involving god abraham , wherein god ordered abraham sacrifice his son , isaac , brams seems treat abraham complete foreknowledge god preference rankings four various outcomes . it difficult me believe abraham , even intimate god , would possess this kind knowledge . i would preferred see brams introduce models which would allow abraham deal asymetric information inherent this kind situation . anything lost assuming complete information these games ? not necessarily . not worked alternative problems out myself , i cannot say , but since brams so effective making game theory accessible this book , i believe he ample opportunities book introduce slightly more complicated notions like mixed strategies signaling . he certainly talented creative enough so . all all , i recommend book all students economics , religion , sociology political science . i not necessarily believe analysis hugely valuable more generally " spiritual " person , but i definitely would not discourage person reading book . brams unusually gracious respectful religion , generally , characters ( including god ) this book . definitely plus . it rare anyone assume rationality when thinking religion , when scholars finally , i tend impressed . i impressed brams , both tone book , but also content . highly recommended	1

i liked daniel cohen work since 1996 when i first read his paper " tests `convergence hypothesis ' : some further results " published journal economic growth ( september ) . so , i came current book positive preconception - i am glad say i not disappointed . provocative title book misleading extent it conveys black white message : globalization one side ; its enemies other . not so . central point argument against false notion wealth income disparities west third world resulted either religious differences or exploiter-exploited relationships two regions . book points out what some interpreted result evildoing part west simply impacts unintended consequences technology . book uses example algeria where technology like ddt intended mosquito eradication therefore malaria typhoid elimination indirect effect allowing population growth which needed more food , which needed more land other resources grow food , end resulted inequalities reduced happiness . example makes clear consequences globalization " transcend simple categories good evil " ( pp . 2-3 ) . globalization not monolithic one-time phenomenon ; instead it sequential systematic westernization globe began " discovery " america 15th century , expanded english merchants 18th century , picked up pace to-date . during its early phases globalization brought non-western regions both cures ( e.g. , medicine ) infections ( e.g. smallpox ) , but it not so clear all intentional . what clear globalization dashed expectations many ended up disappointed after voluntarily abandoning their cultures western civilization , they soon discovered , example , " far delivering free entry transparency dreamed economists , socalled information society creates its own barriers , replacing those technology breaks down .

this quick review penguin edition , which contains both classic original novel its sequel . both good reads though quite different . personally , i preferred darker more dramatic sequel ; " zenda " everything just kind works itself out i thought it just tad campy . well , they're light adventure novels set mid-19th century or thereabouts . not sure where exactly fictitious kingdom ruritania supposed , but i would guess neighborhood austria or hungary . novels feature swordplay , gunfights , romance , plenty plot twists ( especially sequel ) . very well penned , written direct style outstanding word choice . both novels , rudolf rassendyl gets himself neck-deep ruritanian politics despite fact he foreigner total stranger people . what enables this he spitting image king , also named rudolf . this remarkable coincidence heart plots both novels . it interesting comparing these novels " count monte cristo " dumas , which i'm now reading . " count " deeper , more descriptive , paced much slower , requires more thought . well , my book , those elements part what it takes make five-star novel . " zenda " " rupert " too light side hit top my scale . but i still enjoyed them recommend them those looking fast-paced yarn set bygone times . i finished this book flight bulgaria month ago just left it seat pocket . i hope someone found it enjoying it now	1

there very few books personalization issue so far . this one them . it very good . central dilemma kasanoff book this : no one enjoy benefits personalization if he not willing share personal information necessary make those benefits possible . yet , sharing information , person risking his privacy bargain . issue much more complicated than most publications suggest : " just different customers different needs your business , different people different levels sensitivity respect protecting their own privacy " . kasanoff refers story we all already heard , but this time it different ending : " we would all like get back old-fashioned service where you return your local merchant he remembers you buy large white eggs you like special kind fabric . but we wouldn't think so wistfully this type relationship if merchant run off shared intimate details your life blacksmith , saloon owner , dressmaker " . here four primary individual benefits personalization : 1 . save time : eliminate repetitive tasks ; remember transactional details ; recognize habits . 2 . save money : prevent redundant work ; eliminate service components unnecessary person ; identify lower cost solutions meet all other specifications . 3 . better information : provide training ; filter out information not relevant person ; provide more specific information increasingly relevant person interests ; increase reliability information ; replace " average " information information specific person environment . 4 . address ongoing needs , challenges , or opportunities : provide one-stop services ; allow flexibility work hours , job responsibilities , benefits ; accommodate unique personal preferences ; recognize reward achievement special treatment . here 11 ways make it personal , i.e. this how firm deliver benefits personalization : 1 . combine : merge information person already others , provide additional insights . 2 . compare : show how prices , quality , or specifications one option match up others . 3 . connect : most large firms , data exist " silos " or departments . firms connect this data , providing more accurate picture firm interactions person . flip side this connecting previous disparate data removes level privacy . 4 . explain : clarify how , when , or why use product or service , or perform task , precisely when person needs such help . 5 . find : locate person , product , or service based supplied specifications . 6 . monitor : track status events , news , or actions others . 7 . recommend : suggest course action based historical data , current environment , or predictive models . 8 . remember : most people still more frustrated what firms forget them than what they remember . mantra : " never make customer tell us same thing twice " . 9 . reveal : highlight pattern or conclusion not previously evident . 10 . sort : change order or grouping information , making it easier people see patterns . 11 . trigger : prompt action when certain criteria met , such purchase item when its price falls below $150 . finally , kasanoff suggests making two changes ways employees compensated ; any company simultaneously become more profitable achieve right balance privacy personalization . change #1 : compensate employees satisfy more needs existing customers . kasanoff experience - i agree - , most privacy abuses stem efforts firms use personal information acquire new customers , not better serve existing customers . change #2 : develop modular capabilitiesto make first change , companies need accommodate differences individuals . mass customization or modular capabilities make it profitable firm support personalized relationships . customization becomes routine cost-efficient , many cases costs go down , not up . much savings comes elimination waste reduction inventory levels . kasanoff one original partners peppers rogers group coined term " one-t o-o ne " . may 2004 finalised my graduate diploma e-business thesis online personalization , i must say this book one my key sources , especially complex issue balancing personalization , privacy profit . if you're really interested personalization , you may want read my online review : " power one : gaining business value personalization technologies " nirmal pal , arvind rangaswamy ( 2003 ) . final quote foreword peppers rogers : " big brother almost here . his sister telemarketing operator who called you during dinner last night . his nephew runs sweepstakes magazine-subscription service just outside london . same rapid advances information technology pushing businesses into new paradigm competition - one-t o-o ne marketing paradigm - simultaneously generating more more opportunities abuse consumer privacy mass marketers . making databases sensitive , individual consumer information available marketers interested only next quarter sales like providing chain saws tribe slash-and-burn farmers .

shakespeare comedy , " much ado nothing , " only positive effect its audience when read . his use verbal sarcasm intellectual farce turns circumstances love into exactly what they many times truly : comedy . shakespeare creates situations appear serious characters within script , yet actually humorous audience . because they able observe things characters themselves not privy , audience able witness full absurdity many messes created within plot characters themselves . while evaluating this play , i found it interesting while shakespeare comedies , " midsummer night dream , " demonstrates how it love causes us foolish things , " much ado nothing " shows way people complicate love themselves . each comedy centers theme love , making it comedic entertaining , yet two hold contrasting views . characters ' actions " midsummer night dream " involuntarily controlled their affections , whether they real or perceived , yet actions those found " much ado nothing " what control outcome love created . throughout this story , shakespeare purposes illustrate many foolish things individuals which only complicate love further than it already . many continually deny how they feel , case benedick beatrice , while others , like claudio , quick fall into love just eager fall out again . love fickleness shown when claudio jumps quickly sharp accusations based upon false testimony , again when benedick beatrice fall love due supposed affection other . story also demonstrates how others manipulate affections , negative or positive results . leonato , don john , other miscellaneous characters add complexity show increase havoc comes increase people situation . this play communicated strongly me circumstances not always entirely complicated they appear . just false identities twisted facts create unneeded , yet hilarious , tension throughout story , putting more stress importance issues within my life makes them more they truly . because this , it not always situation problem , but my own distorted view it . claudio assumptions hero promiscuous nature benedick beatrice quick reaction gossip heard each other two images my own tendency take specific circumstances extreme they should never reach . this play therefore not only enjoyable me read ; it brought light one my strengths times becomes my personal downfall , , making me more conscious this fact , allowed me potential correct it sooner . i wholeheartedly recommend this book , especially those enjoy shakespearean theatre well good laugh . it hilarious story how manipulation our own choice action create complicated labyrinth we unable get out , times don't ever want . shakespeare excellent job poking humor into crevices every situation , lightheartedly reminds us end it our own decisions create , or destroy , mangled outcome we receive .	1

" laughter learning " i'm reading this book , i sense it what i waiting . i believe doni tamblyn really nailed it . she given structure what seems very complex art effective teaching . i'll start giving her methods try using " smooth " vs " crunchy " approach initiating group/team work , finally using some those cartoons i've accumulating years . i'm also thinking how i could apply some her ideas my online distance learning courses , where teaching learning not traditional classroom . this environment lacks needed spontaneity , but i could see what would happen if i divided my online class into small discussion teams competing bonus points " fabulous prizes " awarded our once-per-week lab meetings . i appreciate ms. tamblyn combined her comedic experience dewey ideas , theories motivation , accelerated learning , optimal/compatible brain learning , thekoran , talmud , famous quotes , tips psychology comedic delivery , taken time share her synthesis them book . her laugh learn not only great how-to book , but also scholarly piece work . i don't usually find how-to books index , references , endnotes , so many examples , case study !

this great arc ultimate spider-man series - my opinion , best ones i've read ( up venom - ugh ! ) . so much well here - story , pacing , art ; everything seemed work well together ( well , almost everything ) . if i could give it four half stars , i would . there two things i felt especially well : portrayal goblin insanity peter parker emotions . goblin insanity masterfuly - one point we actually see things through his mind , witness manifestation his dementia , both graphically narritive . it makes quite effective - if disturbing - scene . peter parker finally making some sense character ; he actually reacts one might expect teenager his position react - terrified . super powers or no super powers , green goblin parker faces monsterously powerful , totally insane , , worst all , fully aware spider-man true identity making use it threatening way . it all very convincing manner - drawings drive fear home . there other nice surprises thrown , help build fill out long term character peter parker , adding continuity connectivity . mary jane/gwen tracy portions i like less , but it harmless overall doesn't hurt highlights . over all , most intense arc i've read series so far ( which , again , up volume 6 )	1

d.g. white , author excellent yogic study adventure story , " alchemical body , " here presents edited compilation articles authentic tantra traditions taken length breadth indian-influenced asia . countries cultures include : india ( obviously ) , china , tibet/nepal japan , articles hindu , buddhist , jain ( jain ? yes , jain ) , islamic (!) shinto tantric traditions . before this volume , who would guessed sheer geographical pervasiveness tantric traditions ? topics vary architecture ethnography poetry . quality contributions uniformly very good -- well-written well-organized -- most chapters include translation , whole or part , important or obscure tantra . strongest point authors scholars , not practitioners , associated advantage , last ( least ) reader avoid fluff , hype bs pervades field so-called " tantra . " reading this volume go long ways toward removing our conditioned ignorance , delusion gullibility " sacred sex " " sacred orgasms , " phallacy worshipping linga/yoni your current hot-sex partner god/dess , like . jewels herein too numerous recount , but some my favorites include hudson chapter , " tantric rites antal poetry , " which rather lovingly introduces poetry antal , kind tamil mirabai . kudos numerous authors emphasizing relationship bhakti tantra . down side authors scholars , not practitioners , concomitant lack experiential understanding what actual tantric practices consisted , what " cosmological homology , " body psychospiritual praxis rooted various yogic practices , actually means lived experience .

harold bloom floats poet novelist short story writer like big bumble bee stopping short spells various flowers . i found his opinions witty , entertaining , sometimes profound . he lists several reasons reading his first chapter then identifies other reasons throughout text . these include : reading healing pleasure ; reading difficult pleasure since it search sublime ; we read because we can't ever know enough people ; we read prepare ourselves change ; strengthen our self learn its authentic interests ; we read quest minds more original than our own . all these reasons resonated me . bloom identifies range talented poets other writers usually covers one work each his favorites . he defines talent prolonged patience seeing what others tend not see . bloom virtual worship william shakespeare pops up almost every essay . bloom asserts shakespeare strenghts comes making no moral judgements this characters but allows reader play make those assessments . bloom considered shakespeare expert intergenerational conflict . he quotes borges who said shakespeare " everyone no one " , meaning his talent allowed him reveal character without leaving any his own finger prints . i liked bloom taxonomy short stories into two camps ; either they narrative cohension based reality such chekov , james , demaupassant , hemingway , nabokov or they unreal fantasies freed narrative format such borges , kafka , or calvino . he illustrates his taxonomy reviewing least one work each author , including wonderful review calvino invisible cities . section book covers his favorite poets including wonderfully popular " ulysses " tennyson , which one my favorites . i really liked his insights into walt whitman emily dickinson . he regards dickinson one most cognitive unique individuals print thus understand her ' difficult pleasure ' . bloom argues jane austen able , like shakespeare , " manifest sympathy all her characters , no matter how detestable , while detaching herself even her favorite . " he builds case " emma " i found convincing even though elizabeth bennett " pride prejudice " not only one my favorite fictional characters , she one my favorite people . bloom praise dicken " great expectations " matched my own high regard this novel . whereas so much dicken characature , " great expectations " character development reached new height estella decision not marry pip remains one most understated character insights english literature . she enigma but this action or lack action she reveals depth character beyond emotional crippled creature miss havisham tried make her . if she reared man-destroying monster , what better way seek her revenge her " maker " than marry chauvanist monster forsake innocent boy who loved her since childhood but whom she knew she would break . many novels briefly reviewed but i especially liked his review nathaniel west " miss lonelyhearts " his superb analysis cormac mccarthy " blood meridian " . judge holden this bloody saga one most amazing characters literature bloom defends this extremely violent novel gusto . longest essay work hamlet , which full fresh insight into this majestic work . bloom covers 57 poems , short stories , plays , novels this 279 page book , thus giving each literary work around 4 5 pages analysis . i found this just enough bloom make his point stimulate my appetite re-read many these wonderful masterpieces	1

all my readings bias media , none well documented argued mcgowan coloring news . mcgowan , senior fellow conservative manhattan institute , believes media quest ' diversity ' shapes their perspective how present news what stories cover . part argument here , because news organizations want ' correct ' their historically white-male centered coverage , they willing shape stories minority groups however groups see fit . this includes not running pictures accused criminals because it may cause racial backlash ( more recently , protest uc berkeley ) , using quota system make sure least certain amount " people around town " pictures newspaper runs african-american . mcgowan title may bit misleading , potentially bit controversial , if only " coloring " part title . mcgowan not single out media coverage african-americans , showing media also shape their coverage not offend gays , lesbians , more recently , arab-americans . instances these include coverage gay adoption racial profiling . this book not easy read . paperback version only 250-odd pages , but text small there few breaks chapters . i difficulty reading it until i got towards last 100 pages , when stuff mcgowan documents just becomes so jaw-dropping one can't believe it actually true . this includes vermont newspaper story got writer fired without normal process disputing charges taking place because small backlash agitator community . agitator hired newspaper help shape paper coverage black community , when independent source verified original article factually accurate , ended up editor resignation . book reads lot like text book less like partisan attack ( although times mcgowan obviously arguing one point view correct , but still able show why coverage , nonetheless , skewed ) . whereas books like bias spin sisters rely upon first hand experience inner workings media , coloring news all research . unfortunately , mcgowan not provide footnotes ( he provide notes end descriptions what he citing ) , which , unless you take time read notes end , makes it difficult know exactly what coming where . if you member media , you must read this book . if you care media bias , read this book . if you're casual reader , i can't recommend it you . only problems this book textbook-like nature lack inline notes . my rating : 4 out 5 stars .	1

this well written welcome addition seemingly himalayan pile works world biggest unsolved murder case subject still haunts america this day . it fair say fbi never closed case it no surprise then works such this continue appear . so many however poorly written , cover same old ground present largely unsubstantiated theories conspiracy . whilst i disagree personally authors stance oswald could not lone assassin assumption single bullet theory must incorrect , i found much text commission work generally high value . many recent ie , post 2000 publications subject , i would recommend this book good example well written pro conspiracy text . it frustrating though find yet author who fails analyze magic bullet theory open minded fashion - ignoring ground breaking work discovery channels documentary " unsolved history : jfk - beyond magic bullet dvd " including work undertaken team australian medics wound ballistics experts who reconstructed shot meticulously show it indeed possible highly probable all non fatal wounds kennedy governor connally caused same bullet . interesting exercise would compare this earl warren chapter jfk assassination his 1977 memoirs . one would find resolute assurance commission acted honorably all aspects warren himself , this book however contests whilst commission acted benignly its path conclusion there no conspiracy , it failed investigate properly some key aspects case they so we would left much less murky past rather less suspecting general public .	1

" planetary " nice mix traditional comics story-telling more offbeat , challenging fare like works alan moore , neil gaiman , etc . it traditional its various issues involve such comics popular fiction icons like superheroes , godzilla-type monsters , pulp adventure heroes , multiple universes , like . it offbeat because it treats those subjects darker , edgier way than we're used seeing . example , " planetary " posits if there really superheroes , they probably wouldn't white-bread pure typical marvel or dc offering ( indeed , this series ' version fantastic four , seen toward end this volume , shaping up villainous presence series ) . this idea nothing new , course , if you've read alan moore " watchmen " , various dc/vertigo titles , other titles aimed " mature readers " crowd shelves these days . but while " planetary " definitely gets edgy , dark , challenging like those works , it also celebrates popular comic book storytelling giving us enthusiastic action scenes , big set pieces , exciting revelations , etc ., genuinely fun fact many ways it regular ol ' comic book . " planetary " it both ways revels i t.t his initial collection includes first six issues original comics series , short , appetite-whetting " planetary " preview story ran back couple other comics titles just prior this series ' debut . mainstream superhero comics little bland you these days , but you also find edgier , adult fare out there not exciting engaging you like your comics ? give heroic investigators " planetary " shot . i'll bet you won't sorry .	1

grey king 4th book 5 part dark rising series , it , my opinion , best one series . this book builds off first three ( mostly second ) , resumes story stanton ( 2nd 3rd books ) introduces bran davies who becomes leading character this 5th book . susan cooper retains all richness first three book , she once again utilizes her skill writer paint vivid picture battle good evil ( see me review dark rising see my thoughts how she deals this topic ) . this book goes above beyond what brought us first three books series . this book both more mysterious darker than first three . i remember reading this book child getting chills reading it . it not nightmare scary or anything , somehow it scary while you reading it but soon you put book down , so fear . i think it because cooper so skilled writer she makes you fear characters her book , not yourself . also , her character development far surpassed what she 2nd 3rd books him . she somehow made him more complete , giving him sometimes confidence maturity " old one , " , other times , timidity youthfulness child 12 he . you definitely see cooper writing skills developing her series develops . this books where those skills reach their peak , they height only handful fiction authors last century surpassed . overall grade :	1

while most one year chemistry texts cover more or less same principles , order varies , illustrations similar , but they vary most way they explain material . it vocabulary they use develop helps student develop intuitions , understanding , skills authors after . this very well written text useful non-chemistry majors well science students needing introductory course chemistry . i am reading working through this text my 13 year old son . yes , he bright interested science , but text clear enough both us able grasp understand principles each section each chapter presenting us . not only this text focus teaching basic principles chemistry , it also includes historical notes margins , text focuses practical uses chemistry illustrate its principles through practical applications . while other texts also these features , i believe this text quite accessible even those without strong previous grounding science . each chapter begins series bullet points introducing what going discussed short essay . i like marginal notes illustrations well " give it some thought " feature asks student question or two order clarify understanding ensure grasp principles introduced section . like most modern textbooks , there also liberal use color aid presentation guide eye . authors also provide occasional " strategies chemistry " boxes encourage student develop certain kind thought process ways looking principles chemistry . end each chapter section called summary key terms hits highlights each section paragraph or two key terms boldface . then there section called visualizing concepts basic problems illustrations order get student work mentally material learned . section problems series questions each section red numbered questions answers back book . there also series handy tables provided appendices standard charts inside front back covers including periodic table . again , many these features included other texts because there quite bit convergence what taught one year introduction chemistry course . differences way things said more than what covered . i think this excellent very useful text learning basics chemistry why it matters our world	1
i bought this book because i looking some ideas building chicken coop . new raising chickens , i needed something would provide some good , sensible ideas building chicken coop . i really like this book couple reasons : 1 . there several different designs included book covering housing different types various purposes or situations : duck nest boxes , internal nest boxes , broody-bantam-rabbit coop , broody boxes , anti-broody coop ( sin bin ) , trap nest box , show box , bantam ark , 8ft run , two arks , free range feeder , eight-hen house , more . 2 . there appears sufficient detail each plan enable me successful completing projects . some short comings this book include : 1 ) beginner , book not provide lot background which type housing should used particular situation . example , would i better off building fixed coop or movable ( tractor ) coop ? 2 ) plans book hand drawn , it takes some additional effort understand them compared professionally drafted plans . 3 ) there no materials lists or step-by step instructions , so you'll spend some time calculate those things well . it would nice if author included least materials list plans specified . however , i am very pleased this book , because it helped me think housing needs chickens , it provided me lot good construction design ideas/considerations . end day , i'll probably adapt one or more plans this book my own needs build it . i recommend this book anyone who thinking raising chickens or other poultry , planning build their own housing their birds	1

let me begin saying this book sucked . it sucked so hard , i'm suprised black holes aren't springing up near it . i only finished this book because i bought it thought it would wrong me not . ( i only actually " read " half it , rest i read skim mode)the writing uninspired i didn't understand heroine . all . she apparently some wealthy new orleans socialite who always dreamt wife mother . but she didn't actually take care her child . or clean her house . or sex her husband ( he affair fellow lawyer tragically killed car accident . ) i no idea what this woman all day . except maybe eat icecream ? there several scenes annoyed me , but i think worse when jonnie ( her name jonquil , which please . ) decided she tired her late husband study dark so she pulls out chair rips down drapes . where she leaves them piled floor until he maid comes into room see what going . jonnie promptly tells maid dispose drapes . jonnie something pressing ? could she not clean up mess she made ? after ; i just sort hated her hoped she hit bus . i didn't much care hero , cameron , either . he seemed very one dimensional like every other romance novel bad boy . he trouble juvenile , yet he really tender sensative . i say through his actions i better feel his compassion concern others . so , i guess that plus . jonnie , i felt like reader always told what think her . you should think jonnie compassionate because she hired nanny david ( dead husband ) wouldn't given her chance . you should think jonnie wants take care her child because she says so ( even though jonnie leaves her daughter alone or nanny most run off cameron . ) i never understood title book either . i still can't figure out what opposite characters , their attraction tepid best . i don't recommend this book , unless you're stranded island alone might go crazy boredom . but even then , i would try coconut sculpture first	-1

this book very interesting . i loved way this book shows how mexicans suffer , struggle work hard get what they need survive . this book good way showing different types experiences family goes through . it gets point where you get so into book you get frightened what could happen family next . you don't know if family going get caught border patrol or if you're going able find job next season . you just don't know if your going able survive only thing you your hands hope faith . there nothing i could hate this book only thing i hated read how bad this family suffered . it hurts see how your own people gets discriminated but , it ok because this family like many other mexicans still succeeded after all things they go trough , like discriminated . other than there nothing dislike this book . i would definitely recommend this book everybody especially people who like this family illegal immigrant this country . i would like anti-immigrant people read this book so they see no matter what they try stop immigrants succeeding immigrants never stop trying no matter what they try stop them . this book great book i am sure this story repeated itself many times other mexican families . i am also sure it keep repeating itself many years , but there always limit day come when mexicans treated same everybody else this country . there many illegal immigrants more successful life than people legal this country , it kills anti-immigrants know this true .	1

bit too much like lonely planet like lp , bit lazy predictable . why , instance , these guides not recommend hotels near jama masjid agra ( where one find shops food abundance , where one but short walk red fort hence short walk access taj where transportation not involve hassles one encounters other parts town) ? you tend find lp rough guide give same recommendations far hotels concerned 6 out ten times ... it not difficult - most indian towns any size array options . i find most frustrating aspects this guide : complete lack maps certain regions ( i found there few maps smaller towns tamil nadu ); inaccuracies maps ( akbar inn agra 1km away point indicated not same street tourist guest house ... gwalior , guide you walking lenghty circles only find hotel you looking stone throw station road not indicated ... bhavnagar circle haphazardly placed map middle labyrinthine bazaar apparently meant serve purpose ); scales occasionally wrong . there also internal contradictions ... time town town indicated 5 hours when one looks travel info town but 7 hours when one looks info town . recently decided lp seriously dropped its standards when it suggested turning left out bus stop chinese town plus 1 million people looking red sign , i am loss decent guide book . maybe footprint or handbook guides way go - i yet try them . what i tend find most useful older lps ( eg those 10 years ago ) ... prices change hotels open close but those guides tend provide more options far hotels concerned maps tended more accurate - some hotels remain where one finds one , one usually finds others	-1
okay , if you any personal integrity whatsoever you've already read mirage chimera , previous tiedemann titles this asimov robot mystery series . they both great reads , but this one ( sfwa member ) i'm giving nebula recommendation . ( i usually don't so-called quot ; sharecropperquot ; novels . ) why ? because this novel goes way beyond mystery/action level previous books , brings background into play very interesting ways . without discussing plot , i'll only say it also brings asimov quot ; universequot ; up date concerns modern sf readers . questions like quot;where nanotech ? quot ; quot ; what ai ? quot ; quot ; what happened spacers ? quot ; dealt , or ominously foreshadowed . most importantly , questions raised existence bogard not swept under rug or reduced mere plot point conveniently tied up later . bogard raises fundamental questions three laws , robotics general , tiedemann faces up them lets them play out . good stuff	1

this book could used editor . i struggled through 200 250 pages ( before notes end ) before giving up . i hoping read inside account how prison unions gained power promote building more prisons , or perhaps in-depth review how politicians manipulated public tough crime . instead , i find hard follow mish-mash various vaguely related topics ( farm worker struggles central valley , problems latin america , etc . ) . although never outright stated , it seems her main conclusion california built all these prisons , then toughened laws fill them , because state wanted develop land rural areas . huh ? could it instead no one else wanted prisons near them , rural locations only place they would accepted , partly because locals more interested prison jobs ? if this conclusion , one would think there would some analysis disproving it wasn't politicians getting tough crime first , overcrowding then driving building prisons rural areas , rather than other way around . other problem writing appears like someone trying sound important , rather than trying explain something . sentence structure difficult follow , too many adjectives , etc . here example page 54 : " pivotal verb ' reproduce ' signifies broad array political , economic , cultural , biological capacities society uses renew itself daily , seasonally , generationally . " also , constant quotes middle text , apparently give air authority missing text itself , distracting . why not use footnotes ? example page 43 : " location defense other high-technology jobs ( soja 1989 ; oliver et al . 1993 ) exacerbated state residential income segregation ( walters 1992 ; mike davis 1990 ; bullard et al . 1994 ) . there few good points buried this book . example , point california politicians got tough crime time when crime already started decline two years . or fact definition crime determines how many criminals there - increasing crime rate doesn't necessarily mean increase crime , it simply reflect change definition what crime ( possession smaller amounts drugs , etc . ) . or determinate sentencing we now partly result prisoners suing treated equally under parole rules , very unintended consequence . i wish book focused aspects like these , written easier follow language .	-1

one reviewer stated , reviewer who criticized this book basis his antagonism religious faith missed point . i would go further state he showed weakness his own thinking process . true science religious faith neutral . conduct good scientific experiements , question god left out process . this no means implies scientist not hold personal opinion subject , either or against . it merely means he or she suspends personal belief interest conducting good experiments . further , number people who hold certain position regarding faith , neither makes faith valid nor makes it invalid . professor personal faith atheism . religious faith , every bit much theism , creationism , or any other many isms this world . this very adequately demonstrated his intollerant review . he takes extreme position opposite side radical creationists , but no more defensible then radical creationists ' views . he even goes so far suggest scientists ( some whom nobel prize winners ) who seem think belief god not unreasonable , not intelligent . now book itself . i find it very fascinating look process how many world great scientific minds approach questions addressed this book . people questioned take positions across spectrum belief/disbelief . book includes number answers those who not believe god . i found process approach very well , ask reasonable questions . this book i think worth reading no matter whether you believe god or don't . thinking process never hurt hearing opinions differ your own	1

i read " back when we grown-ups " few months back not enjoy novel much . i found characters boring annoying theme pointless . but i loved tone anne tyler writes . it somehow so calming lyrical so i decided take stab anne tyler " saint maybe .

jerry mander issues . yes he lot research but end he holy crusade one sided closed minded holy crusades . he treats tv evil creation . without tv device information entertainment transference , our society would knocked back 30 years or so . tv its downsides but its all up parents control its use . apparently this book direct reflection jeff mander irresponsibility parent control raising children now tries blame this incompetence tv rather then himself . he brings up some detailed convincing results but again he just redirecting blame . take tv out someone life poor route cause problems people , especially children society future . transfer information demands society transference education , news , others ability person analyze utilize information determine their success . it also greatly hamper their ability socialize . people say it works them children they successful . take look their financial standings . chances they quite wealthy reason they " good life " they buy their way through life . so when you reread book , keep your mind open keep back your mind financial standing person who wrote it . its easy him say what he wants because he money go buy what ever he wants . overall book some good points but i would not recommend it anyone waist money cost . save your money use common sense . tv good thing , long parents control it encourage other activities . its not tv bad .. its parents irresponsible . face it jeff , you sucked parent model ... stop blaming tv .	-1

i non-recommending this book much possible everyone i know . i interviewed family member former colleague one fallen . i guess what bothers me most book fact he went out everyone told us he planned write book what sort boy grows up man who would kind work make kind sacrifice ... environment which he raised ... family , town , etc . this reason , we assumed this why he wanted come his hometown : see firsthand environment which he raised . then ... out comes book ... yes , there bits pieces there some men , but let face it , it mostly battle takur ghar . enough written already . my take : he told everyone crap his intentions result , he able get access people no other author who'd wrote takur ghar prior ever ... no one would talk it , especially special ops . however , when people heard he going write some guys their inner character personality not focus battle , people willing open up talk their sons , siblings , teammates , friends . so , i extremely disappointed when book came out it wasn't what all what he said it would . my mind , he used everyone . i too , not finish reading it . i read part my brother , then looked mistakes he made names timelines just put it right down . he even painted his hometown seem like some dreary blue-collar town where no one would want live even portrayed his dad sound like some brainless dude low self-esteem meaningless work support his family ... even his dad much much more than this .	-1

this book spurred tv specials recieved many rave reviews . after getting sucked into one many tv specials talking counting cards beating vegas i decided look into issue this book , i heard , `one ' read . while reading book i found it extremely hard put down i essentially goose bumps imagining pure brilliance these college kids . book absolutely amazing , story 6 brilliant mit students who taught math professor how count cards pass these counts other teammates unknown security other casino personnel . counting 312 cards included 6 deck shoe getting accurate count unbelievable . book goes into great detail explaining all members team . reason one man team would impossible pull off because raising your bet after cards got hot , lowering betting cards cooled off , would seen very suspicious dealer you would made known security . using intricate team how millions dollars made . first member team start out table placing minimum bet every single hand while counting cards ( high card , 9 -ace , counts -1 , while low card , 2-6 , counts +1 . thus high count means many low cards drawn out shoe leaving many high cards ) . this team member generally dressed very modestly doesn't draw too much attention themselves . after count gets `hot ' this member call big spender . big spender gambler who attracts all attention , wearing extravagant clothing betting large sums money nearly every hand . after big spender seated count must passed , most crucial part entire operation . passing count without two teammates acknowledging each other . let say count +8 , after few hands them both table minimum better leave table making comment dealer such , `well i think my luck up , i'm going go hang out pool while . ' word pool not reference casinos swimming pool but actually game pool which 8 ball commonly associated . simple comment teammates never look each other while passing very vital information nearly undetectable dealer or casinos high tech security equipment , pure brilliance . true art counting cards count cards while so animated , or seemingly uninterested cards seems untrained eye you not actually counting cards . although counting cards not technically illegal it not something casinos permit . games located casinos house advantage but once advantage swings way gamblers , casino all its powers individual removed . once card counter caught they generally asked leave premises banned life . this book something everyone , good way pass time plane trip or great book read vacation get your blood pumping . i would recommend this book anyone enjoys reading thrillers , or books show underdog consistently beating heavy favorite , because after all , how you not root underdog ? brian bowe	1

when this book came out last year , i remember it uniformly dismissed garbage - mostly result accusations embedded within this tome pages regarding rafael palmeiro steroid user . well , quite bit changed since book release - congressional hearing , raffy testing positive steroids , continued growth barry bonds ' noggin . , amazingly , amid all hue cry over steroid usage baseball over past year , this reviewer finds jose canseco sanest voice debate over steroids . juiced not simply canseco love letter steroids . he uniformly unapologetic his steroid use - which slightly disturbing , yes - but his candor over fact he would merely average baseball player it not his steroid usage actually very impressive . i tired vainglorious ballplayer retrospective loooooong ago - middle school , point fact - yet , i thoroughly impressed canseco account here because there unusual amount self-awareness one would not expect any ballplayer . plus , it actually highly readable - i stop short saying " well-written " because keats this obviously not , but surprisingly engaging clearly written . while this book revelation sorts one makes likes messrs . mcgwire , sosa , palmeiro , bonds look like utter cowards not more forthright baseball-following public over their accomplishments , i still urge degree caution reading this book , particularly little-league set . this sort book i would , impressionable little leaguer , wanted desperately read . mr. canseco little too enthusiastic benefits steroids - such way one whose sense skepticism not yet fully developed could read it advertisement proverbial " b-12 " shots . also , it seems bit self-serving places regard his spousal abuse rap , somewhat unfairly takes cal ripken , jr. without any substantive reasons why . notwithstanding these criticisms , anyone whose innocence vis-a-vis baseball long since shattered , i actually highly recommend this book . how strange it canseco may ultimately come out steroid era player most unscathed - if so , it largely strength " juiced " . not literary masterpiece , but definitely among strongest baseball genre	-1
i bought this book few years ago recommendation professor labor history . history often told point view " winners " , so i thought it would good absorb perspective not usually taught . i admit all history form narrative , there no " pure " facts history since all narratives make value judgments least implicitly . but some narratives " work " better than others ; some narratives enshrine values would better us hold than others . some ways understanding past more helpful , thus more correct , than others . narrative presented this book not very helpful same reason ruling-class narratives unhelpful : both heroic narratives . only difference those who play role hero those who play marginalized switched places . history far too complex process - story - say " so-and-so responsible such-and-such " . this case , we learn poor laborers , minorities , women , immigrants " really " responsible america accomplishments . course , this partially correct , it surely case we would not where we it not these groups . but imply educated white men - people like two authors book themselves - made little " real " contribution america accomplishments but instead responsible all our social failings preposterous . this simply swing pendulum opposite extreme . fact , i think whole project parcelling out persons into groups , then telling group-based historical narrative problematic . which group defines your identity ? failing this book it mistakes part whole , necessary sufficient . much better narrative includes marginalized working class found howard zinn * people history united states * . i gave book two stars instead one because writing quite good - just like absorbing historical fiction	-1
this huge , comprehensive biography robert moses , same time examination flaws early mid twentieth century urban planning . it told considerable gusto ( times perhaps too much caro passions tend run high exposed through his prose , thus losing its dispassionate nature ) . although subject matter might not first sight stir blood those not interested urban planning or who not live new york , it really fascinating read . that because it works two levels : firstly tragedy traditional sense term hero ( moses ) carried high then destroyed his own character ; but importantly caro draws lessons learned unbalanced transport policies - over-reliance cars expense other means transportation . lessons there learned - merely building more roads serves increase traffic rather than ease congestion . lack sound relocation policy where people moved due public works creates new slums destroys established communities . it unfortunate these lessons still learned , or yet learned both developing world ( try crossing road bangkok ! ) even west ( how badly london needs better public transport ) . caro book long , but style makes his later multi-volume biography lyndon johnson so enjoyable already there : finishing work , you won't indifferent robert moses , nor what his manner urban development meant continues mean . rodgers	1

writing good technical standpoint ( i don't jump literary hurdles get through paragraph because words flow very well ) . idea good one too . what i can't get past character robert langdon . langdon supposed sharp academic but he seems lack foresight his cogitations things always dawn him last second . thing i trouble dan brown knack slowing pace story . things running strong moment then author tries just little too much build suspense . problem reader already knows where particular scene headed this attempt build up critical moment leaves me wanting skip ahead payoff . like playing fetch dog , you only tease him so long before he loses interest , especially when dog pretty good idea where ball land after it finally tossed . this book easy read but i think it bit over-rated .	-1
long time mathematics tutor teacher i know this book very well . i don't think material presented or explained way especially helpful young people . tutor i constantly reintroduce topic and/or try stay ahead student class . beyond , students asked only simplest proofs . additionally , new topic introduced then no problems appear exercise portion section help student test practice his or her understanding newly introduced topic ( course , those problems invariably show up chapter exam final ) . moreover , i think book just fails kids . it seems omit certain standard concepts " accessible " undemanding even most minor critical thinking skills . i believe both these shortcomings leave student unprepared challenging problems standardized tests college entrance exams . not mention any sort subsequent advanced work high school college . thing larson book answers many problems so arithmetically peculiar student no feeling maybe they actually got right answer . good problems reassure student they right track . also , once new concept or definition introduced it never repeated . overall , i think more capable students shortchanged misled into thinking they know more than they actually less capable student might pass geometry but perform poorly college entrance exams unable successfully progress mathematics if they need so .	-1

one hardest things anyone learn , no matter where you life , or how much money you , coping times when things don't turn out you expect . some people never recover , while others seem sail past disaster hardly break stride . trick isn't what disaster , but how they've handled it . longtime author harold . kushner , best known his when bad things happen good people , takes intriguing look ability cope using figure moses bible . yes , moses . out all various people torah , he undoubtably most complex . most us tend visualize him certain actor hollywood , brawny , noble imposing , able smite down miscreants when single blow , but those who studied moses bible find someone bit more closer earth . if anyone deal disappointment , it certainly moses . called upon lead captive jews out egypt , facing down most powerful ruler earth , it seems once he got them out wilderness sinai , things ought improving . instead , what happening when he returns first set tablets ? why , they're worshipping idol shape golden calf . it doesn't even stop there -- throughout forty years exile , people complain thirst , hunger , -- enough make anyone throw up their hands disgust walk away . perhaps most bitter all , moses denied entry into promised land , only allowed glimpse goal he worked so hard he dying . you admit , that quite disappointment . but not once during all these setbacks , moses tell god he gives up . he might protest he might not able handle burden , but he try complete it . it this message rabbi kushner uses best effect this book , giving positive use times when disappointment enters our lives , not give up . society where it seems perfection demanded , failure viewed moral failing rather than something occurs every person life , getting view across disappointment means building character rather than sign you're not going amount much . it not very long book , easily read within few hours time , but contents informative meaningful . rabbi kushner writing style very fluid readable , keeping technical jargon , while he go off tangents regularly , he never forgets what he talking . only problem i tangents occured quite bit , occansionally annoying . still , despite flaws , it good book , earned four stars i gave it overall . more importantly , it gives positive human message reassuring needed our rather complicated , perfectionist society , one sorely needed .	-1

there very few memoirs published record producers , especially producers important george martin , producer ? discovererquot ; beatles . i call it memoir because that what it - much more covered than beatles . this book george martin , through through . first 100 pages or so recount martin early history british military up through his first job recording industry . there staggering detail this , naming even most insignificant people he met way . but since we know this all contributing what would become martin genius , it really isn't all tedious . eventually we come chapter beatles - how he discovered them , how he recorded them , then single singe , how they became biggest band world . whether he intends it or not , there epic quality practically every word martin writes ( or rather , ghostwritten him ) . professional today music industry seeing literally all music recorded computers , it fascinating see technology they working . he writes actually recording * wax records * . it also nice see someone getting so excited advent stereo recording . it something we don't even think today , but producers martin era , recording stereo profound recording hard drives today . i also amazed learn he made almost no money off beatles records . today , comparable producer - say glenn ballard , alanis ' former producer - probably made dozens millions dollars . martin didn't earn any royalties those records , he also refused ownership stake publishing company set up exclusively beatles songs . this probably cost him upwards $ 50,000,000 if not more . he goes say he no regrets refusing ownership , whether or not you believe him , he lay out pretty impressive spiel not doing it money . i arrived conclusion , however , while genius producer he possibly world worst businessman . hundreds people made millions off beatles one closest them - martin - managed make almost nothing . truly staggering . this kind book that must-have beatles fan or aspiring musician , proselytize everyone else . classic book classic producer .	1

alright , when you read mainstream piece contemporary fiction author such james patterson , john grishom , tom clancy , like , you not expecting life altering experience like reading shakespeare or hemingway . this not high literature , but rather pure entertainment , without much required thinking involved .

throughout pat buchanan fascinating illustrious career , even his closest friends admirers detected certain reluctance his part engage issue race . his newest book , state emergency , mr. buchanan finally concedes accurate examination plight u.s. immigration futile without resort lens racial identity . book begins quoting arnold toynbee , giant among historians , " civilizations perish suicide , not murder . " within toynbee paradigm , civilizational suicide promoted any three " imminent , mortal perils " : dying populations , disintegrating cultures , unresisted invasions . ever historian , himself , mr. buchanan then illustrates history most dramatic precedent our dilemma , fall roman empire fifth century , not long after emperor valens granted asylum large band gothic refugees who appeared rome gates . within two years , these ingrates barbarians sacked city murdered valens , himself , eventually precipitating roman empire move istanbul , ushering dark ages . case anyone should miss analogy , author then draws parallel george bush , his favorable attitude toward third world immigration requisite amnesty . scope problemthe scope problem immense sobering , mr. buchanan not disappoint those who find statistics useful measure its gravity . example : * 36 million immigrants their offspring now living u.s. greater than all immigration u.s. 1607 1960 ; * approximately half eight million foreigners who entered u.s. 2000 2005 , so illegally ; * one 12 illegal immigrants criminal ; * 10% 20% all mexican , central american caribbean peoples now live u.s. ; * there may 20 million illegal immigrants currently residing here ; racial imperativeas informed americans already know , current wave third world immigration invading our shores differs markedly all earlier waves immigrants variety ways . today immigrants not products western , judeo-christian civilization , desiring assimilate adopt american " ethos " : rather , this new wave immigrants consist such alien backward peoples bantus somalia , ( who never heard indoor plumbing , ) mestizos central america , who apparently won't use latter even when available ! here buchanan breaks new ground his candid acknowledgement truism : " people create cultures : cultures don't create people . " other words cultures reflection talent creativity people : merely allowing alien individual access superior culture not imbue individual talents characteristics thrive this new environment , nor even appreciate i t.t here good reasons many aliens wish leave squalor they helped create back home , equally good reasons oppose their coming here , so prevent their doing u.s. which they've already their homelands . owing inexplicable " multiculturalist " zeal academia elite news media last 25 years or so , we permitted foreign nationals emigrate this country who less educated , less intelligent , less appreciative our cultural " ethos " than any wave immigrants before them . result , they far less capable assimilation , even if their numbers far fewer . solutionsin his final chapter , author proposes number intriguing solutions problem , which roughly categorized four ways : physical barriers ; electoral remedies ; economic disincentives ; legal reforms . combination , these designed avoid expense difficulty deportation , favor policy attrition . briefly , his proposal physical barrier deter invasion our southern border consists 2 fifteen foot-high fences erected immediately inside u.s. border , two-lane road them permit border patrol travel either direction . supplementing these , buchanan proposes motion sensors alert border patrol , second wall eight foot " coiled wire . " beyond this , he suggests deep ditches prevent further penetration border vehicles used smuggle drugs humans , should any successfully penetrate earlier obstacles . author claims these physical barriers could built $8 billion , amount easily offset inevitable savings welfare , medicaid , crime , disease , etc . terms electoral reform , buchanan suggests willingness take corrective action should essential pre-condition support any candidate running public office , support border fence should pre-condition support any presidential candidate . also , states should urged enact measures such california proposition 187 , arizona proposition 200 , both which written deny welfare illegal aliens . economic disincentives go beyond merely shutting off welfare spigot would require federal legislation , could consist heavy fines hiring illegals , well jail terms repeat offenders . likewise , i.r.s. could directed assess penalties interest tax obligations not withheld when illegals employed " off-the-books " paid cash . moreover , cities sanctuary policies might penalized reducing amount federal monies they receive , annually , universities favoring illegals lower , " in-state " tuition could penalized same manner . author suggested legal reforms consist ending so-called " chain-migration , " whereby legal immigrant apply his entire extended nuclear family brought here once he becomes citizen . buchanan also advocates we end dual citizenship : if someone votes foreign election , they committed crime : if they serve foreign government or military , they should presumed renounced u.s. citizenship . author also recommends we enact federal laws over-ride local sanctuary laws , end phenomenon " anchor-babies , " whereby child born u.s. automatically citizen , even if his parents here illegally . deporting felons , gang members , drunk drivers additional suggestions . illegals should also ineligible receive social security or " earned income tax credit . " he suggests u.s. deny visa applications and/or foreign aid governments ( such mexico ) might refuse cooperate such reforms . meantime , buchanan recommends we impose immigration moratorium , allowing time national debate what kinds new immigrants we should allow into u.s. ( who knows ? : even republicans might eschew lip service " multiculturalism " if they saw large majority electorate demanded immigrants white , skilled , employable , christian ! ) conclusionmr . buchanan considers immigration " existential crisis our civilization . " vintage buchanan , he sums up problem illegal immigration manner upon which it would difficult improve : " ... they not americans they not belong our home . if we not stop this invasion start repatriating them lands whence they came , we lose our country , we unworthy our fathers who gave this country us - unworthy our children , we , through our softness , squandered their priceless patrimony .

kathy watson argues ably nimbly we should not regard mary lamb madness occasional thing visited her left no traces , leaving essential mary lamb behind . no , it part parcel her personality , seen her writing well . watson discovers outside famous tales shakespeare which she wrote her brother charles ( splitting down corpus shakespeare ignoring histories , writing up comedies , leaving tragedies charles ) , mary lamb wrote other books well , which she makes sound perfectly fascinating . i would love read " mrs. leicester " book hope tarcher , which published this fine biography , print companion book mary lamb collected writing . she hints also mary drawn many men , including romantic poet samuel taylor coleridge , who so sexy she just couldn't help herself when he around . charles eventually ask coleridge not come around because visit him would find mary going little crazy . watson brings us into early 19th century world madhouse , which pretty creepy place . women private means like mary lamb their own rooms own attendants , but still they must seen some dreadful sights , making their lives very different other women their class who general protected seamy . you never forget however , mary killed her own mother knife , crime so rare people hardly ever run into it , even judges long histories criminal cases , even hardened homicide cops . why she it ? watson provides limited answer . my mind mary lamb psychology similar lizzie borden , except she perhaps more lovable more humorous nature . but both brooders both nurtured unassimilable hatred toward patriarchal structure family	1

" romeo , romeo ! where art thou romeo ? " wait minute , wrong play ! my opinion , much ado nothing very funny book/play i somewhat enjoyed reading it . only bad part it it chick flick ( or its case chick play ) . old english also took away play sometimes . however , most part it understandable . overall , i believe shakespeare probably reason writing play other than just pure entertainment . much ado nothing classic shakespearian type play . it comedy two young couples . one couple benedick beatrice . start play they love one , they just not know it yet . they constantly bickering fighting each other . other couple hero claudio , who madly love each other ( or so they think ) plot make benedick beatrice realize they love each other . they also help form leanato , don pedro , margaret ursula . meanwhile , don pedro evil brother don john his henchmen , conrade borachio , plot break up hero claudio . plan nearly succeeds , rather unusual constable dogberry his somewhat merry men must come rescue claudio hero relationship . i said before , main point shakespeare writing play probably more than entertainment . i believe he also wrote it because he wanted show how crazy love make person . play , beatrice benedick fall love each other . after claudio shames hero , beatrice so upset she asks benedick kills claudio . now presents problem because benedick claudio good friends . first , benedick very reluctant this . so reluctant he refuses this . after she says she not love him any more benedick immediately agrees kill claudio . even though i would probably same thing benedick position , it still amazing what love make you . surprisingly , i actually learned something this play . it simple fact assumptions very , very dangerous . thanks don john his henchmen evil plot , claudio thought he seen hero cheating him borachio . reality , it margaret borachio he saw . acting only what he saw , he shamed hero " killed " her . end , it happily ever after moment . personally , i expected better ending , but that just me . yes , i would recommend this book but i myself not love it . too much love , not enough action drama . however , it very funny , especially constable dogberry ( my favorite character book/play ) . also plot well developed so kept my interest . overall , it good worth reading . i would give book/play 8.11 out 10 . you would probably like it so go buy read it . great play , but it just not me .	-1

this very ambitious book , it covers very diverse set topics gravity . one good things this book it covers lot material isn't usually covered books general relativity or string theory , especially this level detail . it certainly not introduction general relativity or string theory . i would recommend readers unfamiliar these topics study wald polchinski firs t.t he book opens chapters covering differential geometry nother theorem . intent isn't teach readers these topics , but rather establish notation provide high level review . when gravitation introduced it not usual geometrical approach , but it approached theory massless spin two particles , feynman lectures gravitation . it interesting approach showing starting linear theory non-linear terms must included consistency this leads general relativity which leads geometric interpretation gravity . it also includes nice discussion gravitational energy momentum psuedotensor . more detailed consideration non-localizability gravitational energy give throughout book . following this gravitational action covered fair amount detail . addition more common approach considering metric only independent variable theory , he also covers approach where metric connection independent variables . although it less common see palatini formalism it hardly uncommon . it also foundation approach non-string theory approach quantum gravity , i.e. loop quantum gravity . i enjoyed discussion torsion general relativity , this covered more detail than one usually sees . up until this point book covered classical gravity , however approach isn't standard one . approach general relativity one useful understanding material quantum gravity . none this material particularly obscure ( exception teleparallelism ) , but i think it fairly unusual see it all covered one place so much depth . next , author extends poincare algebra including fermionic generators give supergravity . he restricts his coverage only = 1 = 2 supersymmetry . this followed more extensive coverage energy general relativity , mainly focusing non-localizability gravitational energy energy conditions . next few chapters deal various solutions general relativity . first couple , schwarzschild reissner-nordstrom solutions , covered most ( former essentially all ) books general relativity . however , coverage here goes way beyond normal . after quickly getting schwarzschild solution its thermodynamics higher dimensional analogs covered . reissner-nordstrom case there even greater amount material beyond normal . this included : proca lagrangian , majumdar-papapetrou family solutions , static solutions multiple extremal black holes , gravitational solitons , more discussion localizability gravitational energy , thermodynamics , electromagnetic duality ( including extension he relates , u dualities string theory ) , monopoles , chern-simons terms higher dimensional solutions . over next couple chapters more solutions described , some fair amount depth : taub-nut , taub-bolt , bps states , instantons , plane fronted gravity waves , kaluza-klien black holes , bogomol'nyi bound , dehn twits dilaton black holes . it nice seeing all this covered one place ; however , times it reads catalog i wasn't really sure what main point . after chapter supersymmetry book moves study string theory . this comprises final third book . introductory string material presented lightening rate . i would guess most readers exposed string theory first time would overwhelmed . naturally branes also covered . emphasis most this part duality symmetries string theory how they relate various solutions . string part book finishes off describing black hole solutions string theory . one interesting inconsistency book he describes schwarzschild solution gravitational field massive pointlike particle . what makes this interesting earlier book he went great lengths explain schwarzschild solution not gravitational field massive pointlike particle , easiest way see this singularity this spacelike so source can't massive particle . whole i liked this book lot , i thought it many strengths . i wouldn't choose it first book general relativity or string theory , but that not its intent anyway . approach developing gravity isn't usual one ( interestingly he uses + --- signature which fairly uncommon , these days , outside study spinors ) , but it good compliment it one students gravitation should aware . not only because it provides bridge study quantum gravity , but also because it interesting its own right . strength lot interesting , often neglected , topics developed much more detail than usually provided	-1

( i heard some people whose bodies * naturally * manufacture ethanol ordinary sugars food sufficient quantites become drunk without ever consumed liquid alcohol ; these freak instances people tripping non-pyshoactive mushrooms may represent something similar -- rare individuals whose bodies convert innocuous chemicals into psychoactive ones ; since reported cases people who didn't intend eat magic mushroom first place , who probably sworn off mushroom eating forever result their experience , likelihood repeat occurence given individual probably close zero . still , fact such unexpected event occurred all underscores couple points which stamets makes again again : don't eat any wild mushroom which you not positively identified , don't gorge yourself species which you * * identified until you taken small sample see how your own body reacts them . ) one interesting feature book estimate relative potency psilocybin-containing mushrooms explanation why some cultivated mushrooms differ widely potency even though they belong same species . some members species psilocybe actually don't contain any psilocybin all , but apparently all members species either taste bad or too chewy used food , even non-psychoactive ones . only weakness book it not contain section describing numerous cultivated varieties . cubensis , which vary greatly appearance growing requirements ( , according vendors , least ) potency . many these varieties doubtless " gone wild " ( stamets says grounds universities outside courthouses two best places hunt " wild " psilocybin mushrooms ! ) , but there only one listing species photos what presumably wild varities not derived artificial selection growers . stamets true fan mushrooms his commercial website ( he doesn't sell psilocybin mushrooms , way ) gives examples how mushrooms used bioremediation polluted lands used improve yields crops . stamets points out one best places look wild muchrooms land which just hit storm or where humans just ravaged it put up or tear down building . although stamets not gone far off deep end terrence mckenna his brother ( writing under their own names or " ott osric " ) , it apparent he , like many other partakers magic mushrooms , believes them vital part gaia their spread humans part planetary evolution . simple example , those hunting " magic " mushrooms ( whether deliberately or not ) carry magic mushroom spores back where they found , but they also carry spores other species which grow nearby , their turn , vital ecological components even if they aren't psychoactive : just growing * near * psychoactive mushroom gives other mushrooms evolutionary advantage their spores dispersed primates anxious go tripping but whose hair or fur or clothes brush against other species mushroom carry their spores location . it becomes easy see why some people believe psychoactive mushrooms ( especially psilocybe species ) co-evolved humans means enhance biosphere gaia . i give this book five well-deserved stars . i know know other book which contains so much information magic mushroom history mycology provides such clear-cut easy follow steps identifying psilocybin-containg species . if nothing else it beautiful look . ****	1

after reading first three volumes merchant princes i half willing completely write charles stross off . this fantasy series less than impressive while it decent ideas parallel worlds secret families potential really strong series . but merchant princes overall disappointing read . charles stross , other hand , lauded most awards writer sff awarded he picks up nominations almost before he finishes writing work fiction . so maybe it just me . maybe i missing something . stross known more his science fiction than his fantasy , so perhaps if i gave his science fiction shot i would find something would live up hype . i started beginning atrocity archives . atrocity archive short novel which his first published novel archives also includes novella concrete jungle . concrete jungle hugo winner 2005 best novella . i only describe small portion what novel because there just somethings i am unable explain properly . let me say novel set early 2001 there man named bob howard who works laundry london . laundry secret organization which place battle forces darkness . imagine world where nazis attempted tap into netherworld bring all sorts evil support third reich all this possible just science fact . stross gives level detail unreal impossible feels almost prosaic . it remarkable talent . bob howard ( robert . howard reference , anyone ? ) computer guy but wants put field spy type jobs his involvement without sufficient training gets him involved events build beyond what he ever would imagined . bob howard gets involved into this very netherworld evil laundry trying desperately stop . what makes atrocity archives quite bit different than other sff novels this combination lovecraft , len deighton spy novels perhaps little bit neal stephenson . i think charles stross far stronger non-merchant princes work because while atrocity archives read like slow moving spy novel it kept building building became more more interesting exciting find out what happening next . atrocity archives worth time spent reading it . -joe sherr	-1

i confess i didn't get very far this one . if you read this course , i'm very sorry . i'm not academic , but i i read lot philosophy . i'll put lot energy into complex text , but i prefer invest it works enlighten , not confuse . clarity-precision scale , i would push levinas right past " dense " or " challenging " put it somewhere " turgid " " impenetrable . " ( his apologists decry inability human language convey levinas ' sophisticated thoughts . maybe so , but perhaps apology says more his thoughts than it human language . ) any case , it take you long time genuinely read this book . if you're looking truth ( opposed passing grade required course ) , you would better served spending 3 hours contemplating reasoning your own working definition following words : --- " totality " --- " infinity " --- " other " then spend 3 hours contemplating reasoning your own understanding how three interrelated . then get decent translation aristotle metaphysics .

this book ends stating " only understanding heidegger children appreciates their relationship german catastrophe traumas it bred prove capable doing justice their powerful complex philosophical legacy . " this sentence could easily begun book , it effectively introduces what wolin set out : present intellectual historical roots heidegger " children " ( hannah arendt , karl lowith , hans jonas , herbert marcuse ) . whether he succeeds this depends upon how one understands lineage intellectual development , how account any thinking appears new . wolin excellent providing parallel complementary ideas milieu which each " children " lived worked . he gifted eye similar potentially influential observations arguments ; whether means he explained finished product represented each title subjects ' works , distinct question . i'm glad read wolin -- it time worth spending . there numerous proofreading errors (' it ' instead ' if ' , . . ) unsettling mode writing heavily depends upon precision often complex distinctions , but gist his writing never doubt . my understanding heidegger philosophy specifically his relationship national socialism , definitely enhanced . it wolin core use what i call " contagion theory , " gives me greatest pause both his analysis this volume overall utility his work . i found myself mentally summoning voice america fifties , asking " you ever , or you now ...

this thoroughly researched mostly fair-minded account rise 6 most important members bush war cabinet his first term . digging deep into their respective backgrounds , james mann clearly demonstrates how their life histories career experiences shaped their views favor american military dominance , process debunking many lunatic conspiracy theories pass mainstream criticism decision go war iraq conduct war . he also clearly shows just how silly those antiwar loons who pinned such high hopes colin powell pointing out both he richard armitage any rational definition war hawks who merely disagreed rest vulcans when how fight iraq , not whether . yet ..., yet .... though james mann no partisan hack , though he clearly made sincere effort fair unbiased , end his liberal bias seeped through . this shows up most clearly his first annoying , then unintentionally hilarious , finally just plain sad continual assumption worst motives vulcans . when facts available mr. mann sticks them , even taking time debunk some more idiotic conspiracy theories , but when facts absent , mr. mann continually falls into trap assuming venal motives same people he just defended only marginally loonier accusations . saddest thing i am sure mr. mann completely unaware it , would probably respond confused stare if i tried point this out him . he just wouldn't able get it . area where he blinded liberal bias his continual attempts make big issue how people who once opposed democrat foreign policies designed spread democracy turned around supported republican foreign policies designed spread democracy . reason it turns out rather simple . democrat policies condemned because they usually failed , resulting more oppressive dictatorships , while republican policies praised because they usually worked , resulting real democracies ! this actually good microcosm liberal-conservative divide whole host issues : conservatism results-oriented ; liberalism isn't . what this means , sadly , we probably going forced rely more more conservative historians going forward , not because they unbiased , far it , but because they only historians enough self-awareness even attempt guard against their own biases .	-1

this messy book succeeds ( degree it so ) despite its flaws . some subjects covered well , some covered poorly , even where there coverage , discussions maddeningly inconsistent . first , good : author otto friedrich energetic finding many former residents berlin sources this work , some best parts book their colorful reminiscences their lost ruined city . friedrich also included interesting chapters social milieu time , particularly cultural scene : classical music , drama nascent motion picture industry . there some nice character sketches some leading artists era : lotte lenya , bertolt brecht various musicians . general , despite crazy-quilt nature coverage , friedrich best social history aspects berlin . now , bad : book very scattershot , mile wide , but mostly inch deep . example , discussion german movie industry time , although marlene dietrich emil jannings discussed , peter lorre , ernst lubistch f.w. murnau discussed only passing . among pictorial artists , george grosz covered discussed , but becker , nolde scores other artists get superficial or non-existent coverage . maybe it inevitable try discuss tangled political history weimar era rise nazis history berlin , but friedrich not professional historian , his weaknesses this area glaring . any reader even passing interest weimar era find far better accounts politics period than friedrich book . even if you grant he needed discuss political events day his work , there lamentable lack focus his political coverage , which mirrors overall unevenness this work . example , his descriptions combat streets freikorps communists immediate post-war period freshness vitality come testimony eyewitnesses , they give reader sense chaos became horrifyingly prevalent berlin . but his discussion germany policies toward payment reparations ( dawes plan young plan , etc . ) , best , superficial misleading . if you read this book , you might consider reading sections deal social history period just skipping ( or finding better sources ) political history .	-1

northanger abbey , jane austen satirizes what her her late 18th century readers gothic novel . even before ann radcliffe published enormously popular mysteries udolpho 1794 , novel sentiment all rage . such stories heroine likely cry , swoon , moan drop hat . radcliffe her book added other gothic ingredients fear , ghosts , haunted houses , other paranormal phenomena . austen looked down writers who their heroines engage such unseemly behavior even though she later treat seriously same trait sensibility sense sensibility . heroine northanger abbey catherine morland , who seems unlike what later prove typical austen protagonist . catherine start book much more closely allied " sense " half push-pull sense sensibility dichotomy all her works . she daughter prosperous clergyman who travels resort named bath , where she meets falls love henry tilney . there usual romantic plot complications austen novel which normally allow heroine attracted her male counterpart encounter suitable obstacles , all which neatly resolved after both parties undergo some serious soul searching which turn leads higher level moral vision . this case , austen great fun catherine first showing her full sense , then later shifting gears morphing her into standard " sensible " female gothic genre , finally whirling catherine back position reason logic . it takes half book before austen gets gothic satire which it well-known . when catherine arrives northanger abbey , she inexplicably affected conventional gothic trappings place . where earlier catherine would see occurrence might seemed spooky other more stereotyped gothic heroines but not so her , newer catherine now could see same eerie event filled unfounded terror . it only now austen makes clear target her barbed satire . she plainly disgusted other writers who purposefully filled empty heads their heroines gothic terror , but when she same , it excusable since satire , not stereotype , her aim . later , catherine grasp sense returns she able exonerate her own mind general tilney suspected charge murder his wife . end novel , reader introduced theme sense versus sensibility or unstructured emotion versus stifling reason . catherine morland , later nearly all austen female protagonists , austen suggests choose two extremes , one might seek middle ground so each one complement , rather than supplement other . there simply too many examples extremes who end badly austen works one ignore her implied advice .	1

" people tend feel pretty comfortable themselves this time , knowing if they should make mistake it won't undo image others them , more importantly , it won't undo image they themselves . this psychological emotional understanding provides new context experimentation , retirement often provides new feeling finally free time try something new . both these inner outer elements liberating additive . this new sense available time personal liberty later life , combined significant life experience , produces new feelings freedom , courage , confidence commonly described men women advanced age . here , too , contrary negative stereotypes , feeling more free allows older individuals experiment , take risk , try something new . most us , we head into our sixties , become more comfortable who we . if we make mistake while trying something new , it doesn't shatter our self-image . so while someone his twenties may not dare take art class fear looking incompetent , doing something unfamiliar , person his forties or beyond much less concerned appearances , more interested experimenting new ways learn . cohen research underscores adventurous nature adults this liberated phase development . his investigations show older adults who not handicapped extenuating circumstances such poor health or financial constraints -- just venturesome their younger counterparts . this greater freedom courage helps explain why throughout history so many older adults their late sixties , seventies or beyond assumed role shapers shakers society . one thinks socrates , copernicus , titian , montaigne , goethe , rembrandt , newton , einstein , nelson mandela , simone de beauvoir , may sarton , eleanor roosevelt , people who rose greatness their later years . advancing years late life , what cohen calls encore stage , there desire -- developmental urgency , really -- affirm life number ways . it might through completing creative work , or resolution longstanding problem , statement waiting said , or right thing hold years . encore phenomenon taps inner pressure many feel or say something before it too late . phrase applies strongly field music , reminding us how many noted musical achievements come late or end musicain or composer career or life cycle -- like late works verdi , liszt , stravinsky . this time advancing age , which creative expression shaped desire make strong , lasting contributions personal or community level , affirm life , take care unfinished business , celebrate one own contribution . this phase typically occurs among those their eighties or older . multidisciplinary dr. cohen cites some fascinating biological studies brain reveal one early fifties late seventies there actually increase both number length branches individual brain cells different parts brain involved higher intellectual functioning ( cohen , . 79 ) these branching changes compensate brain cell loss occur over time . they also give further evidence platicity or modifiabilty brain it ages . something even more interesting these neuro-biological findings they directly correspond timewise unfolding above human potential phases pointing possible biological connection changes human development second half life . these human potential phases combine elements age-based developmental stages described erikson greater fluidity life transitions we experience today . sometimes we might experience phase sync others our age , but not always , age occurrence varies . sometimes they co-exist , intersect , even synergize or combine way adds even greater energy mix . significance these human potential phases they set state new creative thrust different points our lives . our awareness these phases help close gap recognizing our potential acutually harnessing it . knowing natural course development bring us closer tapping our creative potential different times provide much needed measure confidence or faith which we sometimes need begin , change or energize our creative efforts . i only scratched surface this book , but this summary should sufficient indicate its importance . i recommend everyone interested new discoveries human behavior , creativity longevity read it . -john-raphael staude , h.d. proteus60@aol.co	1

dr. williams studies women marine corps men nursing discuss what it like gender minority occupation . her most important point experience differs based upon biological sex . if women male-dominated field it rough not mean men female dominated field it same way . what came across most directly me how much gender still matters . if this book , dr. williams writes men choose avoid nursing whereas male military leaders actively prevent women entering field . moreover , gender complex . female marines see their femininity strength , but male marines see same quality substandard . male nurses get called doctor because patients simply can't fathom idea male nurse . fact , some patients say men practice " male nursing " because idea still seems so novel oxymoronic them . unfortunately , continued reality violence against women documented : male nurses noted male doctors throw things female nurses . i scandalized ! first , i surprised this sociology text so many psychological underpinnings . then again , two disciplines highly interrelated . still , freudian idea earliest memories parental practices affects everything may rub some readers wrong way . author clearly feminist not just some neutral observer . i support women rights , so didn't bother me . however , other readers may indict her " agenda . " me , however , pointing gender inequality legitimate aim . both her discussions nursing marines mentioned military often . thus , i am surprised she not directly cite feminist military scholar cynthia enloe . book starts off saying , " same way studying transgendered people tells us lot mainstream gender , so studying female marines male nurses tell us gender workplace over all . " i would argue transgendered people not studied enough , especially they deal employment settings . i hope more scholars take project . my biggest critique this book how lesbians lesbophobia mostly ignored . author notes heterosexual male nurses go out their way announce their sexual orientation gay male nurses may not receive advantages their straight counterparts . she also mentions gay men expelled military . however , huge numbers lesbians get expelled military too . because this book published 1989 , dr. williams not benefit numerous books printed 1990s spoke lesbian oppression military . still , gay rights activist urvashi vaid noted discrimination against women specifically lesbians longstanding feminist issue . dr. williams doesn't even state military discriminatory policies may why women inclusion marine corps taken given . dr. williams ' erasure here quite problematic . dr. williams quotes several men who say they not money attend medical school thus they became nurses . i don't buy one bit ! you get loans med school if you grades . getting into medical school difficult anybody . undergraduate nursing courses don't stress premedical curriculum way science departments . getting into medical schools such intense weeding process argument informants present here cannot possibly true . start , dr. williams confesses finding female marines talk much easier than finding male nurses . i know it taboo rank oppressions , but i wish author spoken how male femininity punished society more than female masculinity . parents discipline girly boys laugh off tomboyishness . women wear pants , but men punished wearing dresses . thus , maybe men punished more entering nursing than women who enter marine corps . i enjoyed this book , just i everything dr. williams writes . she insightful promising academic . gender radicals traditionalists should investigate what she say	-1

gershom scholem transformed kabbalah into acceptable academic discipline . today many writers/scholars/professors follow his footsteps ( e.g. wolfson idel ) . he , no doubt , us great service . it should noted , however , he historian -- neither scientist nor kabbalist . he appears faithfully presented kabbalistic doctrines , teachnings , etc . middle ages onward . nonetheless , reader should sensitive certain lack scientific viewpoint one hand mystical/experiential knowledge orientation other -- all his works . said , this wonderful book , one his best ( after " major trends jewish mysticism " ) . if you like this book , i'd recommend you also read , " jewish gnosticism-merkabah mysticism-and talmudic tradition . " work here illuminates many main kabbalistic concepts regarding godhead , including shekinah ( god presence or immanance god , which female ) , sephiroth ( emanations god ) , zaddik ( righteous person ) , etc . his voluminous entry jewish encyclopedia kabbalah also published stand-alone volume simply called , " kabbalah . " this work highly recommended it covers lots ground including major kabbalists . any serious student kabbalah find present work necessary addition his/her repertoire . my favorite quote this book page 139 where he quotes great maggid mezerich : " tsaddikim make god , if one may phrase it thus , their unconscious . " rabbi dov baer mezhirech ( great maggid ) or torah ( korets 1804 ) . 115b jerusalem 1956	-1

pollan taps into almost universal wish -- doing something else living . his strength here , his previous books , cheerleader . everyone wants told , " go ahead , you it , " pollan tells us just . since he defines second acts so broadly ( couple who decide buy second home country , instance ) , nearly everyone considered candidate second act . he outlines steps you should take before taking leap . decide just what it you want don't want , determine what financial family support you need , etc . making orderly exercise out it , it seems more attainable . pollan good organizing us putting positive spin doing something risky frightening most us . i disagree him one point , asking family members money . he says your family wants you happy , if they planning leaving you money their , instance , you should tell them you need it now . or , if you don't willing wealthy grandparents , ask siblings or parents loan . this sounds like mistake me , but maybe pollan knows better . it would also nice summary steps end book . if you thinking second act ( who isn't ) , you could probably figure out pollan steps your own , but it nice them organized you friendly mentor cheering you .	-1
john searle philosopher philosopher . he also scrupulously honest fault . when reading him , one never stop wonder whether he really believes what he saying . present work , " construction social reality " ( csr ) " no exception . lucid , cogent , packed insights , csr vintage searle -- thinker who just seems get better better age . nowadays one no more ignore searle than could medieval thinker ignore aristotle , or modern thinker ignore kant . when i begin writing any philosophical subject , i always check see whether searle close . csr offers most perspicuous account " social facts " or " institutional facts " any work i know , except , perhaps , chapter 5 searle earlier work , " intentionality . " i would recommend anyone interested subject read chapter together csr . focus chapter 5 " background . " searle develops this notion great length csr , especially chapter 6 . ( great strength csr logical progression topics one chapter next . ) idea background around least since husserl heidegger , key element heidegger analysis " time . " sure , searle not slavishly follow heidegger ; two thinkers very different takes what intentionality . ( especially lucid analysis difference searle heidegger found hubert dreyfus ' classic introduction heidegger , " being-in-the-world . " ) but anyone who second thoughts running headlong into thicket heideggerian prose hardly better than start searle . after all , when we're doing philosophy , it always good idea understand problem we're trying solve , questions we're trying answer . heidegger doesn't make it easy this . searle . not searle perfect . like most philosophers , he doesn't always resist urge engage speculative metaphysics . this he early csr . example , he writes : " since our investigation ontological , i.e. , how social facts exist , we need figure out how social reality fits into our overall ontology , i.e. , how existence social facts relates other things exist . we make some substantive presuppositions how world fact order we even pose questions we trying answer . we talking how social reality fits into larger ontology , but order , we describe some features larger ontology . " ( csr , 5-6 . ) yes , we make presuppositions . but here one point which searle heidegger differ ; i'm inclined side heidegger . we don't really get clear what our presuppositions ; , fact , it doubtful we ever . when we think we , we invariably get entangled speculative venture . whole foundationalist notion we must begin " clear distinct ideas " rings bit archaic nowadays . searle tries achieve clarity accepting incontrovertible axioms which , him , mark out boundaries any human cognitive enterprise . listen searle : " truth , us , most our metaphysics derived physics ( including other natural sciences ) . many features contemporary natural science conception reality still dispute still problematic . . . but two features our conception reality not up grabs . they not , so speak , optional us citizens late twentieth early twenty-first century . it condition your educated person our era you apprised these two theories : atomic theory matter evolutionary theory biology . " ( csr , 6 . ) it true educated person must " apprised " these two theories . it doesn't follow however , one give them foundational significance which searle claims them . what matters not our metaphysics , but our presuppositions . , heidegger would insist , we can't get clear them appealing science . fact , science not interested our " conception reality " or ultimate origins things . if our presuppositions get way our ability science , we may change them part . but this doesn't mean we draw picture ultimate reality its totality order proceed science . again , this just not something scientists care . i submit searle analysis institutional facts go forward whether he committed naturalist or believer divine revelation . but then , again , none this matters reader who wants know how social reality put together . , this definitive source . searle long ago earned his status primus inter pares philosophical community . whether he much thinker everyone else less certain . age when muddled thinking deemed virtuous , most people learned all they know philosophy oprah winfrey , one must probably conclude searle always home among his own . he'll never invited appear daytime talk show . his credit , i'm confident he wouldn't accept invitation . i wish i could give csr ten stars instead five . aidan mcdowell	1

first , clear couple things up : 1851 edition pearl great price published independently followers joseph smith england -- after he died , you understand ( 1844 ) . he couldn't possibly telling two different stories 1823 1851 because 1851 he dead . original pogp actually pamphlet put together people england who wanted remember some joseph smith teachings . i haven't actually read original document so i can't know if words " angel nephi " appear there " man truth " claims , but if they he lucky enough read them , then he should enough scholar know stacks stacks other sources attesting joseph smith testimony regarding his moroni visitation . " angel nephi " first edition independent missionary pamphlet safely seen simple typo ethusiastic printer . 2 ) joseph smith convicted " glass looking , fortune telling or prophesying " ? yes he . yes god forbid israelites deuteronomy fortune telling , but what those two things each other ? just because some local preachers tried persecuting smith under catch-all law 1826 mean he really something so terrible if he broke fortune telling commandment law moses ( 2000 . . ) ? didn't jesus say him law moses away ? even so , i believe fortune telling looked still wrong ( see peter book acts ) but wasn't what joseph smith doing or convicted under catch-all law my mind -- he prophecying , something may no no under some 1826 law , but a-ok lord . see bible . now , all i left say , see this book . i love it . it clears up lot bible fits into it quite nicely ( quite literally )	1

i really like way judy budnitz writes . i picked up flying leap years ago hooked . she one those authors when i go bookstore i look up see if anything new released . i don't know if she everyone though . her stories tend highly . . . imaginative . they almost like fairy tales , allegories may or may not deeper meaning . honest , i've never really looked . her writing just so rich full flavor i tend just devour stories sitting not think them later . her writing matured " nice big american baby " darker feeling than flying leap . i would even argue it darker than her novella , " if i told you once , " which its dark parts , but really straddles space flying leap baby . my favorite story far this collection " saving face " story two people living imaginary authoritarian regime ruled benign prime minister . perhaps it sign her maturation author ( or perhaps me reader ) i keep this story percolating my head going over themes true love , devotion , happenstance , self play this story . it really very very good . " visitors " also nice diversion wherein she uses interesting flash-cut narrative routine never gets boring or staid due fact after each transition you left wondering what new bizarre twist dialogue or scenery she going appear . you really can't go wrong budnitz book so if you looking something interesting read i would highly recommend her .	1

i fortunate study george burt when he teaching university michigan school music late seventies early eighties . just before he left teach rice university , he taught course film music i fortunate attend . david raksin few other film composers came spoke us their scores films we watched some sequences ( obviously , laura one them ) . this book came later i am sure burt used it his teaching rice . this book emphasizes works hugo friedhofer , alex north , david raksin , leonard rosenman , but they used illustrate points burt wants make rather than study composers works themselves . i remember burt emphasized music film not something added it anymore than music accompanying theme fugue separate it any material way . , what screen what score provides form counterpoint fuse into whole . neither music nor film complete or effective without other . if you watch films this mind , you notice how some handle music so effectively , some less well , some just awful use music ( this apart - but contributing factor - success film " work " ) . this book came out before digital computerized equipment used film today , but musical aspects spot i am sure technical considerations synchronization so forth still matter great deal . means ease integration doesn't change difficulty conception or composition . there six chapters : 1 ) story thing : music vital role , should film music heard ?, contrapuntal aspect , associative power music . 2 ) characterization : individual people , groups people , symbolic meanings , emotional context , ambient time place , source music3 ) emphasizing dramatic line : musical accents , missing beat or pulse , pacing4 ) sequence unit : best years our lives ( homecoming scene ) , laura ( apartment scene ) , east eden ( climactic scene)5 ) sound function when music absent : matter fact dialogue , psychological containment , acoustic space , moments anguish , telling quality ambient sound , question realism6 ) practical matters human element : spotting process , timings , synchronization , generalized compositional approaches , orchestration orchestra , synthesizer , music mix dubbing . i think this music invaluable composers arrangers wanting working film , tv , even commercials . however , i also think those wanting direct produce these works would benefit reading through this material . sure , there music examples someone not trained reading music find impossible , but examples not critical understanding points text . they add depth , but points made words text . anyone interested this topic film buff or general reader find their appreciation film music greatly enhanced . enjoy ! recommended	1

connie willis interesting writer this interesting book , page-turner well . it very good read . but i some misgivings . i agree this not your typical " sci-fi " work , but neither , reviewer mentioned , it well threshed out historical fiction , such neal stephenson gives us baroque cycle . other words , willis doesn't exactly transcend any genre here . rather , she mixes several together way not completely satisfactory . ironically , what rather bothers one how entertaining this book . it , like much willis fiction , heavily dependent droll , wodehousian humour . this used perfect effect works such say nothing dog . it used perfect effect here beginning where mrs. gaddison , example , much like bertie wooster aunt agatha , serves perfect comic foil droll sort wit --- but then deaths start piling up , both eras , it isn't really until we near end dunworthy becomes ill , these wry lines situational comedies ended - characters ' deaths . there distinct literary dissonance book one smirking or tittering until final , harrowing chapters . all this said , book some finer points , finest which willis evocations medieval landscape ; i reminded bit singrid unset kristin lavransdatter ( which , those who want real historical fiction this sort , definitely place turn ) . book truly manage convey christina rossetti picture " bleak midwinter long ago " quoted beginning " book two " . so , what verdict ? - doomsday book good , engrossing read , if rather flawed literary sense . i'd recommend it anyone who wants something more than mere page turner but something less than true literary fiction - , kristin lavransdatter where cast your eye .	-1

meaning get round murdoch some years but expecting fairly heavy read . fact , after first 70 pages or so which i unsure direction i taken , i found i laughing aloud much book ( rare my case ) , which not something i expected . set pieces book conceived great originality deeply quirky , irish type humour . characters themselves remain - intentionally - rather hard fathom most book , adding mildly dark sense mystery which leads us ( them ) one episode next . this also adds our questioning what direction author trying take us . inevitably , answer largely subjective - but what added my appreciation novel after i finished reading rather than attempting draw broad prescriptive lesson life , it rather celebration individual offers humour kind resolution - or least positive progress - even midst most confused unheroic lives . this picaresque novel peopled principally ( lovable ) roguish empiricists - not one those craving strong plot . i loved it . i implicit confidence this author such skill originality i shall enjoy any her remaining 25 novels ( this her first ) . even when i hugely enjoyed reading book , i rarely , if ever , looked forward reading other novels same author such confidence relish	1

i am artist trade . i grew up wanting draw comics . since getting art ( illustration)degree i used my talent mainly local adds few small book projects . but i still read comics , draw them when i . i stumbled this book barnes noble one day , flipped through it it counter part cutting edge comics . both impressed me , so i picked this one up put other my short list . anatomy tricky subject . i studied it college , decent understanding . i own several other anatomy books , even art ones seem more doctors than artists . lets face it , comic book characters arn't built like normal people . all said , i think this book wonderful job laying out muscle groups , explaining how they work , exagerating them comic book use . both scientific common terms used , everything plain english , there plenty examples . while times it seems more like referance guide than how book , isn't really problem . every great artist knows value good referances . over all art above average quality , few gems here there . while it may not flashy some best art currently published comics , it still clear , well , easily gets it point accross . i don't think young artist go wrong giving this book look .	-1

this book reasonable job overview reich life most his early work , though it fails thorough example sharaf " fury earth " . author gives his impressions reich work , philosopher discourse comparative review reich behavioral findings they relate modern ideas psychiatry psychology ... matter he reasonable job . however , what bothered me terrible misrepresentation reich biophysical research . corrington either not know , or knows but some reason fails discuss , multitude controlled studies undertaken both during reich lifetime after his death , which verified more controversial aspects his biological orgone energy discoveries . so , example , reader learn nothing : 1 ) demeo 1970s university kansas replication reich cloudbuster research , showing positive results , nor demeo global cross-cultural study " saharasia " which used standard anthropological evidence prove global accuracy reich sex-economic findings origins violence . 2 ) double-blind controlled studies . mueschenich . gebauer university marburg early 1980s , " psycho-physiological effects reich orgone accumulator " , verifying exactly reich original findings human physiological response orgone accumulator . also not mentioned , additional replication study orgone accumulator . hebenstreit university vienna . ( both these fully cited demeo " orgone accumulator handbook " ) 3 ) large number replication studies orgone accumulator effects upon plants cancer mice richard blasband , courtney baker , robert dew others published many articles journal orgonomy , annals institute orgonomic science , pulse planet ( german ) emotion journals , . 1965 up into present . 4 ) replication studies reich bions , made biologists . duteil france , who presented his results french academy science 1938 , . grad canada dew , blasband , whole list others who made replications reich biogenesis bion experiments -- none mentioned except single passing footnote ( . 280 , . 10 ) recent issue pulse planet ( subtitled " heretic notebook " ) shows color photos protocells bionous forms well path life made completely sterile previously " dead " preparations , following or building upon reich original protocols , grad , snyder demeo , equal anything published nasa nature contemporary " origins life " research . 5 ) also not mentioned , clinical studies german physicians , where " orgone accumulator therapy " shown dramatic help cancer patients against other immune-system disorders . unlike usa , where fda uses policemen courts assure pharmaceutical monopoly , germany orgone accumulator legal status similar acupuncture homeopathy , accepted form " energetic medicine " which even recommended eu german government harmonization medical practices . so . corrington academic , sympathetic reich , so he should dug into explicitly reported these matters . he also apparently got ear roger straus , head farrar , straus giroux publishers , who intimate wilhelm reich museum also claims sympathetic reich -- so both author editor " reich circles " sufficiently know these studies , or least asking some questions . why " friends reich " so systematically oblivious these facts , or unwilling mention them new books such this one ? i know fact , straus approached publish other books which gave these facts reich biophysical work , but those books politely refused . why ? why it those who interested reich therapeutic work , often denigrate ignore his biophysical work . why ? half-dozen emails author corrington senior researchers following up reich work over years would provided him abundant list such replication studies -- orgonelab.org website entire lengthy " bibliography orgonomy " online available anyone , entire separate list citations reich work many replication studies . nearly none it mentioned corrington book , save materials reich early work . why ? this glaring omission , " condemning faint praise " his later biogenesis , cancer orgone energy discoveries , it stands out like sore thumb . this book help dishonest " skeptics " once again sit comfortably their long-time disinformation outright lies reich , which responsible his death prison , burning his books , contemporary academic distortions black-out his important discoveries . this book frustrating upsetting read those who know facts	-1

i really expected enjoy this - i love dams ' dorothy martin series . i usually read first two books before making up my mind series , but this so bad i didn't heart read next . best part book evocation time place : turn-of-the century indiana perspective young swedish immigrant working maid studebakers . hilda one four johansson children sent america find themselves place then earn passage rest family . overall story rather flimsy . hilda deeply concerned immigrant , almost any immigrant , blamed when member prominent family murdered . when she learns police left patrol wagon question chinese guest notre dame , mr. kee , hilda decides she only she save him . she arrives notre dame after exhausting walk learn what lazy less righteous us would guessed ourselves : 1 . police gone ( they head start they riding wagon , pete sake ! ) 2 . priests notre dame could more him than she could , i.e. provide alibi . but very contrived sub-plot , mr. kee flees before police arrive so hilda save him later . her duties maid don't leave her much opportunity investigation . servants ' gossip network supposed hilda advantage , but she finds killer dumb , stupid , luck , during unnecessary piece folly . killer actions little hard credit : i don't want spoil story , but means opportunity important motive . i'm lot trouble figuring out how killer managed pull off crimes . why would killer so stupid confront hilda under disadvantageous circumstances ? my guess dams some scenes her head then connected them best she could often awkward seques . my last problem book hilda attitudes toward us . miserable experience immigrants major theme this book , i don't doubt lot immigrants hard lot , but why , experienced hellish american life , she her siblings trying bring rest family here ? wouldn't you think they'd saving get back sweden ? i don't expect fairy-tale , but portrayal hilda seems incomplete .	-1
i just read this book enjoyed it thoroughly . however , title somewhat misleading , this not conventional biography . other than few chapters her childhood early education , book arranged " theme " chapters , each focussing particular person or aspect her life , illustrated , heavily annotated , letters poems related theme . i ended book more questions her life than i beginning . many them barely addressed book , or just hinted . perhaps book intended readers who already very familiar biographical details . just one example , author mentions several times eye problem led one emily rare trips away her home treatement boston . i kept thinking sooner or later some further details this eye problem would revealed , but there never more than few widely scattered sentences it . perhaps there isn't enough evidence able conjecture nature problem , but author doesn't even seem think it important enough detail require weighing evidence . likewise her mother long illness , which played role emily withdrawal world , mentioned but its nature not discussed , other than mention she paralyzed near end her life . she suffer stroke ? she lucid ? since emily her primary caregiver , it would seem these details might bear her own emotional state during years this illness would warrant least some speculation . even emily own final illness remains mystery . we learn her sister blamed it ill treatment received her sister-in-law , her doctor attributed it " nerves " . however , other hints , it seems progessively debilitating illness . there never much paragraph entire book which speculates nature this fatal illness or how much she might incapacitated first attack june 1884 her death may 1885 . " nerves " seems me insufficient explanation death poet after illness eleven months . we sure fainting spell related final illness ? she ill entire eleven months ? how long she bedridden ? author doesn't even pose these questions . book 821 pages , there no index entry " illness " . " death [ ed ] " 7 widely scattered brief entries , one which footnote , one which 13-sentence entry how her death affected her brother , one which text her obituary three which describe her funeral(on pages 273 , 575 667 , show how scattered they ) . seventh entry refers her obituary , but seems mistake , i find no mention her death or obituary page cited . book especially good life her brother austin , also good her father . her mother sister remain mysterious , probably because they not much more exposed public scrutiny than emily herself . it obvious her sister nearly much recluse emily , or least perceived such their neighbors . such scattered book , there inevitably good deal repetition details . three mentions emily funeral cited above , example , mostly identical . poems also quoted part or their entirety multiple times . there index poems pages which they discussed , which useful understanding context some these , although author acknowledges dating poems presents many problems . there chronology beginning book , which really closest there temporal ordering poet life . i would suggest photocopying it using it bookmark , because there little chronological ordering , even within chapters times . i found myself asking such things , " this before her brother marriage or after ? her father still alive when this happened ? " matter fact , because i didn't chronology front me , i surprised realize , when i almost finished book , emily father still alive during period her most intense literary activity . after early chapter devoted her father life , he not often mentioned again , i somehow remained impression he died much earlier her life . much i enjoyed this book , i am left wanting book fill gaps . however , i learned enough partisanal nature her biographers wary choosing one .	-1

there few shortcomings writing editing book we should cover . first few chapters rely too heavily quotes political leaders , sometimes five or more direct quotes single page . while this works well evidence , reader would better served one or two quotes getting directly point , backed up additional cites footnotes or endnotes , followed analysis quote . it takes nothing away mr. pena analysis , but would serve make first few chapters more readable . second quibbling point mr. pena tortured analogy al qaeda quantum physics . mr. pena spends several paragraphs describing wave/particle duality light before going talk organizational structure al qaeda . but while light both wave particle same time , al qaeda not both structured hierarchical organization distributed nodal network same time . al qaeda simply distributed nodal network , only true leadership occurs ideological leadership . again , this not affect mr. pena analysis al qaeda , but it serve confuse reader this tortured analogy . use other analogies , especially focusing eastern theology , somewhat better analogy itself shorter . but i still cannot understand how al qaeda composed both yin yang . when using analogies general , it would seem better compare something not generally understood ( al qaeda ) something commonly understood reader ( not usually eastern religions or quantum physics ) . but course all these objections minor we should move more depth discussion mr. pena analysis al qaeda american policy . america focus mr. pena book contains one major assumption upon which whole book argumentation based . assumption al qaeda foremost threat america . while some may take this doctrine , others not , mr. pena not sufficient job backing up this assumption . let us take , example , al qaeda attacks directly american interests last two decades : 1 . world trade center - 1993 ( unsuccessful)2 . african embassies -19983 . uss cole - 20004 . 9/11 - 2001all them course devastating reprehensible , but only one effect doing real damage america 9/11 . yet , five years later , truly not much changed america . change greater new york itself , but five years later they still haggling over wtc site . while 3,000 deaths attack tragic , it pales comparison more than 42,000 die every single year auto accidents america . al qaeda may only group out there actually wherewithal attack america , but even their most devastating attack no means brought america down or even threatened so . it far more devastating effect not immediate deaths or impact economy , but changes it produced america foreign policy , which generated additional support our enemies far fewer friends america . truth al qaeda not actual threat america or american way life , but they threat american power influence world , bring fight american soil . such , they deserve hunted down destroyed , but we should so context broader campaign increase america power influence . america today most powerful nation earth ever seen . only current international threat still comes nuclear arsenals russia china , which only groups able actually destroy america itself . but we successfully used deterrence minimize risk those countries . biggest threat america today , through bad leadership , we misuse our power influence cause it decline . this would allow other state non-state entities arise threaten not only our dominance world affairs , but our very country . thus , while it good consider america positive influence world , we should look america power influence world affairs strong protector our freedoms our democracy . while many mr. pena suggestions excellent defeating al qaeda , he seems believe this conflict more protection " homeland " than protection american supremacy . it not " homeland " al qaeda after , it american supremacy itself . yielding supremacy al qaeda may temporarily protect homeland , but it lead lessening american interests abroad . successful presidents over past century recognized , peaceful prosperous world leads peaceful prosperous america . i discuss some strategies defeating al qaeda while simultaneously maintaining expanding american power influence later , but first let us discuss al qaeda itself more depth . nature beast mr. pena excellent job stating what al qaeda goals ambitions . he also reiterates it not america al qaeda hates , but america effects islamic world . this true , not stated often enough . al qaeda not some evil demon pits we must slay goodness world . al qaeda instead group human beings ambition ideology back up ambition . their ambition reform ( revolution ) muslim world return it " pure " state when it led caliphs . their ideology anyone who interferes this ambition not true muslim so obstacle their path . they also less stringent regard either their own lives or lives others , especially non-muslims , world . these ambitions ideologies put al qaeda into direct conflict america , which its power influence acts either maintain status quo middle east ( all assorted authoritarian unpleasantness ) or push increased democracy improved freedoms ( we , rather unsuccessfully , iraq ) . so al qaeda united states simply two groups different ambitions ideologies compete power world stage . america already vast power influence while al qaeda attempting gain its own power influence . because power differential involved this competition , one only rational choices al qaeda accomplish its ambitions conduct asymmetrical warfare . asymmetrical warfare term used often connotation vietnam describe how small , mobile , ideologically committed force used surprise , terror , propaganda defeat largest military power world . just vietnam , al qaeda not militarily defeat united states ( nor could it ) . they must simply win propaganda campaign . they use terrorism accomplish this . this because every atrocious act they commit , united states ( or their own local governments ) cracks down . these crack downs usually accompany oppression some sort because terrorists mixed among local population . oppression breeds resentment creates more recruits al qaeda who then uses those recruits more atrocious acts . thus cycle continues , al qaeda strengthening every iteration . so mr. pena absolutely right saying our continued presence middle east , especially our occupation iraq , merely leads additional recruits . but what mr. pena not focus enough al qaeda essentially guerilla group . their genius they one first such groups truly go global . while most guerillas local fighters battling local governments , al qaeda global organization battling global superpower . their ability go global aided international transport communication . understanding al qaeda guerilla organization helpful though because al qaeda relies popular support . without friends associates hide them , or without friendly local mosques recruit , al qaeda would not able function . mr. pena absolutely right while leadership important , it this popular support must destroyed order organization cease functioning . crushing al qaeda while maintaining strong america mr. pena advice dealing al qaeda fairly simple : crush leadership remove motivation . this excellent advice fact practiced successfully before countries when non-state actors rise up challenge state . key here use both iron fist velvet glove . leadership crushed example all others not repeat their folly challenging state . same time , much what ideology demanding ( al qaeda case , withdrawal america middle east ) granted order take away motivation future rabble rousing . mr. pena correctly points out american policy middle east blatantly self serving revolves around oil . our need oil something we change ( good domestic policies ) , besides which , global market oil means we need not cozy up unsightly arab regimes . main complaint arab world america movements into iraq not america trying bring democracy into region but america only seeking iraqi oil . if america wishes quiet sympathy jihadist movement , then we need act upon our principles region . this not mean overthrowing every tin pot dictator ( or saddam hussein ) . it mean not supporting tin pot dictators just because they our tin pot dictators , however . if islamic governments elected , it means supporting those governments free democracies ( providing elections free subsequent quashing freedoms not occur ) , even if we not always agree their policies . principled america america far easier support far less easy attack . principled america would also work hard minimize abuses civil liberties . while we rightly condemn actions few abu graib , we not address systematic philosophy underlying system allowed such torture occur . large part systematic philosophy seen manifested guantanamo well . locking individuals up without charges years end policy tin pot dictators , should not policy united states . if we want world believe we stand freedom democracy , then we must practice what we preach . it separation our noble words our ignoble actions gives world pause leads hatred resentment america . we must follow our noble words noble actions insure our long term security . it may slightly hamper efforts short term , but our far more important long term goal victory over terrorists hearts minds world . while perhaps mr. pena not want delve too deeply into politics here , failing mention guantanamo , which one strongest arguments against america rallying cry al qaeda , shortsighted . mr. pena also absolutely correct advocating change our methods hunting al qaeda . we no longer live world warsaw pact . troops should shifted around our military should focus not submarines , b-2 bombers , new fangled fighter jets . instead , we should focus special forces able fight insurgencies . unlike mr. pena , i not believe this requires shrinkage personnel . i believe we must stay iraq because leaving it allow terrorists home back much like afghanistan . but we need shift cold war outlook military able deal modern threats non-state actors indigenous insurgencies . special forces good localized intelligence critical tracking down leadership al qaeda bringing them justice . while mr. pena correct their organization flexible adaptable , each time we make example one their leaders , it hopefully discourage others . this aspect our operation less important , however , because it very difficult dissuade martyrs . so while we should focus catching bin laden his ilk , our main focus should eliminating his basis popular support . conclusion while book contain some shortcomings , i not think i would like live mr. pena isolationist united states , mr. pena offer us hopeful way combating al qaeda . we must bring fight them . but we must define fight fight hearts minds islamic world . we not winning fight supporting arab autocrats or invading arab lands . instead , we need adopt principled foreign policy work rebuild our support not only around region but around world . doing so , we take away critical popular support al qaeda relies upon . combined operations destroy al qaeda leadership , this offers us best chance destroying al qaeda creating stronger america process	-1

i've seen word " macabre " used lot reviews eugenides first novel , i think it appropriate , but all its darkness this certainly novel heart . bleak cynicism its portrait middle-class cluelessness ( community inability understand or care its teenage daughters ; flailing , insincere attempts " deal " tragedy through therapy both official inofficial memorials untimely death ; flimsiness individuals ' concern their neighbors , 20th-century american suburbs claim " neighborhoods , " through which desperate sense fear self-preservation constantly breaking ) balanced uncharacteristic tenderness teenage boys who observe five doomed lisbon sisters unrequited longing closest thing this lifestyle offers true love . i read eugenides second novel , middlesex , while ago , enjoyed it very much , but i think i liked virgin suicides better . i trying explain what i liked better it , fumbling how middlesex sprawling narrative-oriented this weirder somehow something other than story , but it won't quite give up what , he much better job articulating what i trying say : " it sounds , " he said , " like virgin suicides modernist , while middlesex victorian . " duh--that exactly it . then this morning , i came across interview eugenides ( his onetime student , jonathan safran foer ) , which he says , " i always say it like this : my generation writers grew up backwards . we weaned modernism only later read great 19th-century masters realism . when we began writing high school college , it experimental fiction . i think now certain kind academic experimental fiction reached dead end . middlesex postmodern book many ways , but it also very old-fashioned . reusing classical motifs fundamental postmodern practice , course , but telling story isn't always . i like narrative . i read it write it .

reading dark harbor like watching mediocre tv show you can't bothered turn off . i listened dark harbor audio book , so i don't feel too badly wasting my time it because i `read it ' while i doing other things anyway , like driving . if you looking something feels fresh new - dark harbor not you . this novel innovative episode murder she wrote . illustrate : stone barrington his cronies quickly deduce apparent suicide must murder because gun found victim wrong hand . ( i think i actually saw one murder she wrote ) woods either can't bothered come up new idea or he simply doesn't care . it clear early who responsible murders dark harbor . this isn't because clues come together any logical way , but rather because predictable nature novel . you just tell . this doesn't mean solution makes sense . fact , there huge inconsistencies plot make ending feel forced . it if woods couldn't bothered think all his plot lines through . woods compelled include his regular characters novel even though they little ( except course , sex stone ) . holly barely says word her first trip island . her second trip she obligatory romp stone then gets kidnapped remainder novel . why she kidnapped ? i don't think anyone - including woods - answer question any plausible way . my theory woods needed work holly into plot decided putting her peril would allow him fill few pages . it also allowed him include holly dad ( regular character ) her search . wood motive seems obvious . kidnapper motive however isn't - her kidnapping makes no sense . but clearly this something woods didn't think worth worrying . best i say this novel it quick easy read ( course , my case it read me ) . it may not worth time trouble actually read ( certainly not buy ) - but audio book library ( limited selection audio books choose ) it helped me pass time traffic .	1

i just read princess goblin this evening , it wonderful book which i highly recommend . this book , george macdonald , masterful story teller ( note : he not necessarily good writer , but he good story teller ) , tells story irene princess . irene embodyment innocence , macdonald book , innocence hero . not only story iteself imaginative just plain good reading , but it also point , something which many today fictional books seem lacking . point summed up something irene grandmother said : " seeing not believing : seeing only seeing . " i think george macdonald trying provide picture faith . we not believe blindly , many existentialist postmodernist church members would tell us , irene see feel string which guides her , well her grandmother . however , others , who not yet faith ( curdie ) cannot see or feel line until they believe it . effect , macdonald saying we cannot see feel ( metaphorically ) god directly until we believe him . notice , however , while curdie could not directly see string , he could see effects string . he saw evidence string existed , then he later concluded since he saw evidence string , he should believe string grandmother who gave it . then , after believing , he saw string . this very good picture conversion it should . one first sees evidence god , whether through lives christians or through arguments , or both . then one believes , only after one believes one really " know " god . macdonald " good " ( good , not his well writen books ) much better than most authors ' . . . lewis himself said george macdonald portrays good better than any other auther he knew . . . lewis ' good kind somehow , more powerful fierce , though no less loving , kind , compassionate . all truth , i prefer . . lewis ' incarnation good alsan macdonald irene grandmother , but both extremely good . somehow it seems irene grandmother not strong one would like good though . conclusion , fact george macdonald managed take topic faith , wrap it rich garb childrens story , it adored world amazing feat . i am very much looking forward reading sequel , princess curdie , which i hope very soon	1

i've this book little over month now am 20% way through . book nothing but problems , 1125 all , clear diagrams highly accurate solutions algebraic notation . goal book build up your recognition tactical patterns . achieve this , problems annotated not motif , but difficulty . goal work through all problems relatively quickly . if you get stuck , look up answer move . general problems progress difficulty , but patterns built up working earlier problems help solve harder ones later . marking difficulty allows one decide when " give up " look solution , unlike reinfeld book example , where you never know if you simply blind , or you've hit one really hard problems . this book no hints ... no " spot pin " , no " white just opened position , why this mistake ? " . so general practice it little more realistic . this book not explain motifs . if you want , try nunn " learn chess tactics " or one similar books polgar , littlewood etc . these books also better if you find you weakness particular motif want practice just one ( my favorite here , muller " chesscafe puzzle book " ) . key , though they not labelled such , problems organized motif pattern . you move through problems you come across series closely related positions . example , you might get 10 back rank mates row , then 10 knight forks . i often find i hit first these , struggle bit ( though usually first series one easier ones ) , then second one quicker because pattern starting establish itself , so . so book really contain " hints " , but my experience discovering pattern yourself cements it more than it explained then exercising series examples . me least , this approach seems work better than classic reinfeld books , " sharpen your tactics " replaced them my bedside	1

forget wagner , whose disgruntled cacophony posing music nicely dispatched oscar wilde one his plays comparative quip when somebody rings old disturbingly noisy doorbell . forget wagner because birth tragedy greatest work art criticism ever written . it also , despite print century , underexplored gold mine artists intellectuals . this nietzsche first book : it contains en ovo thoughts this great writer thinker who formative influence heidegger through him derrida , two greatest post-nietzschean philosophers . nietzsche great theme infinite possibility opened up greek culture 6th century b.c. , time heraclitus birth tragedy-the culture spawned not only democracy science but which , like brood many eggs only some which hatched ( or quantum possibility before measurement " collapses " wave function into reality)-much more besides -- culture beside whose tragedic productions ( aeschylus sophocles , not euripedes , whom nietzsche shows lost touch essence tragedy ) modern cultural productions not only not measure up , but often seem best , nietzsche says , like " caricature . " loss art traced nietzsche itself-well , not tragic , no-less than tragic : sad let us say . not only highly creative artist-like philosopher , but multilingual philologist who read ancient greek original , nietzsche beams his laser-like analysis astounding clarity into this lost realm possibility . it if he stuck bookmark into tome time , showing us very best part otherwise often dry rather bad ( perhaps overly long ! ) book which we collectively author , called culture . what crucial emphasize nietzsche conclusion ( or assumption ) ( its most famous line ) " existence only justified aesthetic phenomenon . " thus ancient greek tragedy not just random subject , or one art form among others . it aesthetic experience par excellence , greatest overcoming perils existence into worthy production art humans ever developed . nietzsche links success aeschylean sophoclean tragedy brief fruitful intercourse ( like men women , which keeps new people coming despite often-fractious sexual relationships ) two aesthetic strains . one he identifies greek messenger god sun , apollo , other dismembered god wine , dionysos . dionysos also not one god among others . rather , it him all ( originally religious ) tragedies devoted , nietzsche tells us , when other actors appeared sacred precursor greek stage they not taken realistic but avatars , idealized other versions , dionysos . now most crucial thing realize dionysos " he " split into pieces his split pieces represent fundamental , contradictory , fact universe : although all one ( borrow philosophical truism ) this one split into many . this primordial splitting ( cf . heidegger distinction individual beings ) , according nietzsche , regarded ancient greeks itself ur-source human suffering . dionysos tears came mankind , his smile gods . now nietzsche says apollinian aesthetic strain manifests clarity dreams-which show discrete-although ultimately illusory-images . these images similar those appear before chorus ( crucial tragedy but dispensed euripedes ) , before spectators , form actors tragic spectacle . thus tragical spectacle displayed shows itself dreamlike illusion culture , not representation reality per se . just , after we stare sun , we see spots before our eyes so , nietzsche says , after we stare into abyss we see tragedy its chorus ideal human characters . dionysian element nietzsche identifies drunkenness dissolution , opposite clarity dream imagery , made public greek stage . dionysian sense represents one , or movement individual ( seen la schopenhauer vedic metaphysics mayan illusion universe " i " itself ) back one ; apollinian illusory clarity skin-encapsulated individual . ( nietzsche own individuality , brain , compromised treponema spirochetes , real dionysian avatars syphilis eventually killed him . ) one most fascinating things nietzsche exquisitely crafted analysis way it shows science , no less than euripides , motivated socrates ' false humility dreams total knowledge . " who this demigod ? " nietzsche asks socrates-whose reign reasonableness , passed plato , aristotle , church scholastics-defines much modern world . socrates created secular tradition , raising knowledge over aesthetics giving mysticism bad name . nietzsche points out plato burnt his plays after coming into contact his teacher-and compromise , platonic dialogues , fact prototype new , socratized art form-the novel . thus , startlingly nietzsche suggests novel itself debased form art-a euripideanized , socratized attempt make primal aesthetic experience more representative , reasonable , realistic . euripedes ( he later recanted , but his influence went ) dispensed tragic core stagecraft , today we accept drama individual characters all their oddity imperfections-rammed us unremittingly hegemony plot wordy deus ex machina explanations aesthetically poisonous , hyperrationalistic aftermath euripides socratic capitulations . sum , today we all but forgotten dionysian origins acting-more real than realism-which originally centered around not fleeting emotions empathy , but central cosmological fact individuals tragic separation all . highly recommended	1
if you wish read something entertainment sake , then this book suffice . written english professor , this book lacks sort critical thought those us science deptartments want . purportedly ' abbreviated history western manhood , ' it rather exercise academic arcana - attempt think something through its opposite or , this case , its abuse . one hardly compelled reconsider ideas what manhood means . there nothing taylor " treatise " support such nonsense , " this specter haunted men centuries : fear manhood become , or already become , obsolete , superfluous , ridiculous , best quaint , worst disgusting . " really ? whose misandrist manifesto ? concept " western man " , after all , just - concept . there no such unified homogeneous group no such " specter " haunted it so long . men should cringe word castration less mystery than than why women should fear rape . short , taylor analysis history purposes castration sheds less light " cultural construct masculinity " than sadistic sexual abuse humiliation which males threatened subjugated . some his readers find him witty or funny times only because taylor treatment his subject often sophmoric . my view , today attitudes toward manhood males best understood terms our lacking moral sympathies toward them . taylor book no exception . we not generation influenced freud so much feminism . thus , historical abuse mutilation women subject deadly serious pertinent us while sexual abuse humiliation men treated like something never happened - , something we've misconstured , or , tayor case , given fictional reinterpretation , mocked trivalized . taylor ignorant belief ( not first person , course ) sexual prowess eunuchs one case point . case point tayor view most western history castration mark power divinity , ultimate abrogation sexual desire , wide spread currency among christian metaphysicians . this nonsense . taylor arguing anecdotally his own foregone conclusions . he wasn't there take any polls . no doubt , some christian cults managed appropriate practices sexual mutilation already place - just christian nihilism helped make slavery seem worthy . this not , however , make such practices any more agreeable hardly anyone wanted suffer either condition themselves . any case , spiritualized feelings attained some christian monks through self mutilation would appalled greeks - paragons western civilization - it most men throughout all human history . taylor book castration score few points concept cultural relativism subject now seems , best , uncontroversial or , worst , comic immature . should he chose write volumes exploring gamut humanity attitudes regarding every other form sexual nastiness , he no doubt find endless tolerance feted well . would he dare ?	1

this definitive work impracticality , impossibility immorality socialism . von mises , who observed socialism first hand before flee his home europe , who lived through age great collectivist experiments , written simply devastating critique . ( supposed ) reader below who wrote review entitled " propogating utopian fallacies " , obviously either not read book , or completely misunderstood entire thing . more ignorant review this book hardly imagined . he makes several dubious assumptions his review attributes them von mises . he makes statements like , " mises doesn't understand , " or " mises believes " then proceeds use these statements try refute idea free markets . he also fails apply his own logical excercises himself . example he states if mises consistent , he would rejected all government not just some collectivist programs . yet reviewer seems believer half-way system where markets mixed socialism , " democracy " , government intervention . i guess he must monopoly believing governments should some things leave others anarchy market . anyone familair rest mises works free market libertarian theory general can't help but laugh claims he makes . this reviewer clearly not understand property rights based , modern anarchist theory ( opposed rage against machine variety which he makes reference ) , nor he understand this book . claims he makes last paragraph his reveiw so outlandish naive they not even warrant response . important lesson gained here though . without some prior ( correct ) understanding concepts like markets , anarchy , liberty , true nature government , without some understanding logical processes , it easy fall prey such overly-simplified arguments . i would recommend this book , also reading other books authors such mises , murray rothbard , henry hazlitt , f.a. hayek	1

i highly pleased read loeb lee batman : hush . artistry rivals japanese manga story line rich internal detail . reader exposed ( me first ) insights batman mind . throughout story , we know what he feeling what he worries . there times , however , where internal narration gets way real-time events . example , batman fighting same panel , he thinking someone else . hush good story new batman fans , though . loeb new readers favor explaining new old characters albeit some may find practice boring . catwoman also need some development . much i found her intriguing , i'd like see more justice-seeking catwoman , catwoman who fights so ardently weak cannot stand see injustice prevail . also , i would disagree few reviewers regarding plot twists . maybe they meant bring many dc characters into story possible , i found this practice entertaining . it new thing see old villains used new ones show how easily old villain insecurities weaknesses exploited . this approach made old villains appear more human than plastic characters we so used seeing televised batman series . ( before you rip my head off , batman series come long way , so don't think i consider batman villains plastic they not so cartoon series they 1960 television series ) . bottom line : great read , nearly masterpiece . it easy new batman fans become acquainted this fandom since new old characters explained . we also exposed inner workings batman mind , slight oversight frank miller batman : year one , however annoying times . catwoman character bit limited her saucy flirtatious ways , though she not fail amuse . above all , great read well worth time .	1

rawls nozick responsible reinvigorating rights-based liberalism 20th century , saving political philosophy mere in-fighting among utilitarians , superstitions marxism . political philosophy since largely response rawls nozick . this work genius , though it frequently misunderstood , perhaps purpose . most readers , including important philosophers like thomas nagel , simply misunderstand argumentative structure , result many famous criticisms book irrelevant . nozick thesis minimal state justified , but more than minimal state cannot , except under unusual situations . part i book addressed other libertarians , specifically market anarchists ( also called anarcho-capitalists ) . such , nozick assumes libertarian rights self-ownership ( or self-governance ) . basically , nozick wants show market anarchists minimal state arise without violating anybody rights , where rights question things all parties debate agree we . so , he describes scenario which security companies come inevitably natural monopolies over geographic areas . after providing highly original analysis nature risk its moral implications , plus hugely important discussion side constraints moral prohibitions , nozick establishes such monopoly would legitimately prohibit other security firms independent enforcers operating its area , provided it compensates everyone involved . most natural form compensation free security . nozick then argues equilibrium occur which security all provided analogue coercive taxation . end this section , nozick , provided argument successful ( there good reasons think it not ) established agency provided court , military , police services geographic area arise without violating rights without explicit intention creating state . very common misreading nozick occurs here . many philosophers think nozick believes only state arise this manner this form ( security company private shareholders ) legitimate . nozick didn't think this isn't committed it . instead , what he believes he shown both minimal state desirable ( it would arise unintentionally result spontaneous order because it superior market anarchy ) legitimate . nozick then say this leaves open whether state democratic what way . second part book meant challenge arguments more than minimal state . it also misunderstood , even very smart people . nozick not assume libertarian rights part ii , though he refers them times . instead , his argument consists three factors . first , he primarily addresses egalitarian liberals ( hereafter e-liberals ) . e-liberals believe rights personal freedoms ( sexual activity , etc . ) justified , but hold economic activity controlled government decree . nozick examines e-liberals reasons wanting more-than-minimal state ( such welfare state or social democracy ) , debunks them drawing analogies economic activity e-liberal would regulate personal freedoms e-liberal desires leave free . if e-liberal cannot identify morally salient difference , she forced either deny personal freedom , thus becoming authoritarian , or admit economic activity should remain free , thus conceding nozick point . style argument used part ii what i call " liberal presumption " argument . liberal presumption any human activity ought remain unregulated laws unless some strong reason shown regulate activity . ( this contrasted against authoritarian presumption , which mussolini stalin held , namely any activity ought governed unless strong reason shown let it free . ) nozick addresses e-liberals , who hold liberal presumption , then attacks reasons they offer support regulating various activities . he shows reasons based misunderstandings bad arguments , thus restoring liberal presumption . last type argument not rely this presumption . nozick addresses marxists , instance , who not liberals . his arguments against them consists mostly just showing what wrong their position . instance , marxist exploitation theory crucially depends upon bad economic theory , such labor theory value , something which shown false back early 1870s . ( almost all contemporary economists would agree nozick this . marxism smart people what creationism dumb people , pseudo-science . ) result these arguments show more than minimal state cannot justified . way , part ii , nozick provides us some gems . he gives first major critique rawls . critique devastating , nozick points out mistakes rawls reasoning ( simple logical errors , etc . ) leave rawls ' project ungrounded . rawls , some reason , never responded this critique . nozick also analyzes envy , provides hypothetical histories arrive more than minimal state uncover its nature ( it logically equivalent system which we all own parts each other ) . he also sketches theory justice holdings contrast rawls , dworkin , others . this theory , entitlement theory , very rough , but it provides welcome alternative simplistic theories maintaining all there justice establishing patterns ownership . part iii least often read least understood part book . partly , it provides contractarian argument libertarianism ( see loren lomasky article david schmidtz ' book , robert nozick , contemporary philosophy focus ) . it thus contains some foundations nagel claims nozick lacks ( though this criticism based nagel mistaken reading . ) part iii , nozick asks us try construct system allows experimentation which everyone , despite their differences , find society allows them live out their conceptions good . system best approaches this libertarian framework , inside which non-libertarian communities may established provided they respect other , different communities . part iii sketchy , but contains seeds brilliant things , it too bad it hasn't explored more . overall , i would say argument part i weakest , part ii strongest , part iii most interesting ripe philosophical potential . if you care political philosophy , you owe it yourself read this book . you also owe it yourself understand it . if you find yourself thinking nozick making dumb mistake or begging question , you've misunderstood . but you'll good company	1

i rated this book " two " relation other koontz books i read . book entertaining enough , but not very unique relation other books koontz written . koontz appears somewhat formula when creating main charachters . often there primary charachter who appears rather basic beginning , but through later description becomes more complex due unusual background . koontz books often aforementioned charachter utilize their unusual background overcome difficult obstacles usually order save loved one . i believe koontz tries express certain generalties , some which moral religious undertones : end , good overcomes evil often evil its destructive nature , destroys itself . love worth fighting dieing . love stronger than evil . what not kill you , makes you stronger . evil knows no socioeconomic boundaries . key happiness love , not material gain . evil lurks where you least expect it	1

_the author _on crusade_ my favorite single volume subject knights templar- this volume worthy successor . like original it combines both fact myth blend comes across exactly right . introduction , well , " interludes " stories , excellent , readable history order , while stories themselves cover mythology legend many differing perspectives- founding order , present day , far future . _you get good overall sense what poor fellow-soldiers christ temple solomon ( later , knights temple ) really all . these men all over christiandom ( perhaps beyond ) who pledged protect pilgrims holy places their lives honor . took vow absolute poverty- individual knights owned nothing . any wealth order amassed put purpose protection pilgrims- later , all christiandom . measure their success fulfilling their original purpose lies fact , humble pilgrims kings , all knew they could trust their lives , well , their last penny templars . even infidels knew templars honorable men , they neither asked , nor accepted ransom , nor would they retreat battle ( unless out-numbered least three-t o-o ne , even then only under direct orders . ) it said even famed assassins feared payed tribute templars . _are templars still among us ?	1

franken well-known political journalist america . this book billed funny , but after i got it ways , i decide better word hilarious . franken uses humour bring out points he making while exposing political economic mismanagement other misdemeanours -- even some felonies way . this first book i read franken . he known primarily his journalism , since 2004 , his travelling radio talk show politics current events . this book provided extensive laughter , arising american political situation , always productive source humour satire . other side evil nefarious underbelly washington , corruption , dirty tricks , outright lies - not officials people -- power trades ignore weak powerless . author uncovers big deals powerful people purposely rip off american indians under guise getting them favors washington . likewise american mariana islands , bilked no less than america family man house speaker tom delay . franken manages make his points laughter while providing extensive documentation every area he deals , starting fomr presidential election 2004 . his jewish humour enhances his insightful satirical commentary american politics . self-proclaimed liberal , he provides particularly entertaining portrayal right-wing bush administration shenanigans related cronies factions . he discusses details some most unbelievable programs dishonesty dirty tricks history . i especially liked sections discussing how money certain gambling interests one state used fund church-led opposition gambling interests state . franken provides extensive documentation lines details relationships some greatest corrupt politicians washington prominent " religious " leaders like ralph reed " christian coalition . " amazing shocking , even beyond what we already could see suspicion freely public information . franken also compiled large body material related iraq war . one very interesting aspect well-documented trail plans bush administration invade iraq , before 9-11 . plan actively discussed british least early july 2002 , year before public plans made after us congress un discussions . administration insiders report administration discussions invasion possiblities early january 2001 . note this before 9-11 . actually minutes diplomatic meeting 10 downing street us uk officials published uk press discussed widely . extensive subterfuge misdirection characterizes bush plans iraq invasion , even after detailed us international evidence , there no tie al qaeda baath regime sadaam hussein . they find other reasons invade . but invasion goal , all they needed excuse . it not we didn't think these things happened , but here we it lined out heavily documented detail . it sad commentary administration whose rhetoric followed line clean-up , honesty , interests people family values . no wonder prestige credibility usa plummeted bottom under bush administrations . every american ought read evidence presented here , not just entertainment , especially when baldfaced claims right-wing [ so-called " conservative " ] media moguls provide such astonishing absurdity . but we appreciate here excellent documentation provided this conscientious patriot journalist awaken world real situation . challenging , but rewarding read .	1

yourself favor - don't waste your time this book	-1
i rarely glad finish any book i this one . it vitriolic diatribe long allegation short substance . author wellknown extreme leftist this book just more same . he hates george . bush , republicans , business people , americans general . this really nothing more than poorly smear job all kinds people mr. moore despises . it extremely poorly documented . moore uses some footnotes chapter one , but not use any throughout rest book . even footnotes he use based upon dubious sources . included among those several books written bush haters . he even cites al jazeera source . i quite surprised i didn't see national enquirer listed among his ' reliable ' sources . some moore rants so contradictory they really quite pathetic . one section he claims osama bin laden unlikely planned or directed 9/11 attacks . he said bin laden dialysis cave afghanistan ( must some cave . bat cave perhaps ? ) just few pages later , moore incensed some bin laden relatives allowed leave united states after 9/11 attacks without questioned fbi . i am wondering why they would need questioned since moore so convinced bin laden didn't direct attacks . he thinks saudi arabian government it . yet part book , moore gives us his ' plan ' getting things back track . his first item listed ' catch osama bin laden . ' why ? moore doesn't think bin laden 9/11 . why worry him ? absurdity moore rantings his claim media biased favor iraq war . i don't know where he getting his news but it sure isn't abc , cbs , nbc , cnn , washington post , new york times , or any other establishment press . moore also thinks most terrorists ' homegrown ' united states . evidently he hasn't followed current events last 30 years . excluding timothy mcveigh , moore would hard pressed list any other ' homegrown ' terrorists . yet spot , he carries long time saying there no terrorist threat . he claims any concerns terrorists just manufactured bush administration excuse violate rights everyone world , keep himself power , etc . very bizarre position moore takes this book his advocacy his ideal presidential candidate - oprah winfrey . while i'm sure she very nice person , she seems like odd choice presidential candidate . she talk show host . should she not selection , he thinks tom hanks would great choice . again , i'm sure he very nice person , but not how we pick presidents . this one position alone shows moore not serious commentator or worthy his views considered reasonable people . i could go inaccuracies this book . suffice it say , it merely rantings extreme partisan who little regard truth .	-1

i've just read through couple other reviews here ( which i sometimes ) i say i agree some more nasty reviews , though i disagree their conclusions . parker really disciplined writer , someone who writes fast ( reportedly he 20-25 pages day , now , three books plus year ) cleanly , without almost any extraneous plot or characters his work . he back form lately ( apaloosa very good ) this his latest spenser book , part what got longest running series detective fiction these days . they can't give him any more awards ( i think they made him grand master mystery writers guild or whatever it decade or so ago ) so he just soldiers , putting his grandchildren through harvard piling up cds . what makes book good one points where i agree some reviewers . i don't particularly agree susan weakness series : frankly parker portrayal spenser , what made character unique early , he * isn't * loner . departure chandler , hammett , ross john . macdonald , all other private eye writers up 60s . idea one those writers character permanent relationship almost inconceivable ( exception hammett nick nora charles , but they only thin man ) so parker breaking mold when he . it also generally agreed almost splitting detective character twain adding hawk alter ego spenser brilliant . this book avoids both those plot conventions parker , many ways more traditional book , though course setting even plot much more contemporary than any above-mentioned author books . plot rather pretty much standard parker . there school shooting , somehow one shooters got away . other caught , gave up his friend . grandmother second boy very wealthy determined , hires spenser look into matter , prove her grandson innocent . spenser , course , can't prove anything sort , but he try find out why whole thing happened , something cops can't determine . i enjoyed this book great deal . i said , it somewhat more characteristic earlier works , but i think if i read book without spenser or any other names it , i still would able tell who author . writing style very distinctive	1
i asked this book because i thought it would give advice how raise daughters -- it -- more . dr. northrup begins explaining how mothers daughters connected through generations , how we only create healthy relationship our daughter when we heal our relationship our mother . we heal ourselves , we heal all women who gone before us . this only sample some insight she offers into our relationships women . i'll admit i surprised holistic approach she takes , but am glad she offers insight , i'm only vaguely familiar some ideas/theories believe i more grow area . rather than book geared towards raising children ( i've read my share -- i thought that what this book would ) i would categorize this book self-help book geared toward strengthening creating healthy relationship your mother daughter . very pleased everything i've read	1

" book yankees red sox , " october 1964 " takes you through yankees ' cardinals ' respective seasons , regular focuses individual players , scouts , managers owners . title , then , bit misleading , you don't get october world series until near end book . that fine , except whereas " summer ' 49 " two teams fighting each other all season long al pennant , " october 1964 " follows two teams two different leagues , who didn't face each other until series . halberstam evident intent present two teams contrast : rigidly conservative , declining yankees opposed young , hustling , racially integrated cardinals . it almost works , but end it like reading two separate books - chapter or two cardinals , then back yankees , cardinals , yankees , etc ., until end , when they finally take same playing field . gives book bit disjointed feel robs it some intensity " summer ' 49 .

sadly , wright throws up facade his evangelical readership early christian resurrection stories should taken literal historically defensible . should we expect anything different someone socio-religiously tethered his own conservative community market ? wright foists upon his readers technical propaganda aimed certifying myths his modern western religious tradition . his often grossly dishonest use primary literature characterizes his overt , evangelical program book . this work not open historical inquiry , but apology sold his already deluded market . one redeeming value work wright surveys large array ancient literary sources , so one gains substantial list primary references investigation . if , however , you wish read far more balanced work topic , might i recommend . riley resurrection reconsidered . riley true classicist scholar nascent christian traditions , not traditionalist or apologist . evangelicals somehow still get away same ploy . idea goes something like this : larger my book , more erudite authoritative it its reception ( e.g. bock commentary luke larger than pacbell phone book ) . let honest one thing . wright not produced this volume larger scholarly world . he plainly written work insulate his own evangelical market realities found careful investigation question tabled . since most never read 1000 ancient works ( their original languages ) required even weigh his argument properly , evangelical world becomes falsely satisfied wright dealt matter handily .	1

most reviews i written amazon based books , dvds , cds i already own . i occasionally buy new product via amazon , but i mostly review stuff i already own . i own this book ... this play because i read it while humanities course college . i went college rather " late " life ... whatever means ... yet i derived more experience than i probably would i gone right after high school . i am one those people who believe it not college makes " well-rounded " indivividual , but life experience . if colleges universities handed out degrees based life experience , i'd probably doctorate three times over ... we given assignment reading this play seeing live production college i attending just so happened putting . my primary focus philosphy , i embraced existentialism unit we now focused upon . my best friend , who was/is " atheist " less receptive these existentialist ideas he considered strange elusive . you think he , atheist , would more open them than i who already bitten metaphysics/spirituality plague . truth told i think only reason he says he atheist because he cheapskate doesn't want shell out extra money christmas gifts . so we go see this play people getting pretty agitated . this play everything goes round round but never arrives any final conclusions i noticed how we , society , love our answers . we not soothed questions proposistions " what if ? " scenarios . we feel need latch onto something because something better than nothing . isn't it ? existentialists believe universe random , chaotic , ultimately meaningless so sense they " give " meaning meaninglessness . just like atheist believes non-belief . you see , human species cannot not give meaning his/her life ... we cannot not believe ... we " pretend " life without meaning we don't believe but everything falls onto screen our perception , take shape our perceptions . i loved this play . i loved merry-go-round type dialouge . isn't this what we all ? we get belief so engrained our heads we think it only way believe so we spend lot time trying convince someone who may not receptive our point view why it valid . what i learned over years only reason why belief valid because we ones who validate it . it doesn't make us " more right " than person who doesn't believe it , it just makes us believers belief . contrary popular opinion , more people you who also believe same way you believe not prove it any more valid than if only one person believed i t.t his play not dissolve me into puddle desperation futileness , fact it added more meaning my life which would probably make samuel beckett gag . it made me fall love even more this crazy life only i live . nobody lives proxy . each us liberated imprisoned our beliefs . best we ever hope determined what we willing believe any given time . this why it good practice sit down journal your beliefs time time question why you still believe what you believe . you may outgrown certain beliefs , certain ideas , certain ways world but don't like two " bums " play , don't keep postponing what it you eventually desire see ; see it now , live it now , it now . if you going atheist , best atheist you . if you going christian , best christian you . if you going anarchist , best anarchist you . just don't think everyone going believe exactly you believe don't make others wrong simply because they may point view . end , none us truly know what other side . yes , we've people near death experiences , but nobody ever come back after completely dead report , we just reports people who " mostly dead " . take life grain salt enjoy ride . peace blessings .	1

i truly impressed utter emptiness this new novel . but i no one else blame but myself , since i knew nothing it before shelling out over $24 . i should more guard , but i wasn't . what i found when i opened cover turned pages something like tribute cliche , celebration lame , flabby banality , festivel mediocrity , nicely tarted up " brainy cultural commentary " ( actual review quote ) . only brainy thing this book slick con job pulled off knopf marketing department . they deserve five stars . " characters " this brainy cultural commentary all seem stopped growing around age 12 . dialogue agonizingly weak it not resurrected use punctuation oddities or tinkering margins . she ain't no e.e. cummings . i kept wondering if i left television i reading this brainy cultural commentary . but it not , tinny sound two dimensional nonentities who populate this book yakking each other . this surely my top ten list truly bad novels , up there historian whatshername kostova . yourself favor move away this section bookstore " intelligence velocity " ( quote inside dust jacket .	-1

i'm significant other newly diagnosed multiple . i'm hungry information understanding . this book helped me immensely getting idea subjective experience dissociative identity disorder ( or multiple personality disorder ) , which valuable understanding what my partner dealing . however , it won't answer many practical questions what mpd , or how it treated , or what expect therapy progresses . book collection short passages written people , all organized loosely subject . it generally easy read understand , but you might expect , some passages very well written very infomative others not so fluent . , least one reviewer here mentioned , there great deal poetry , which i mostly skipped over . i cannot speak what newly diagnosed might take this book , but i imagine it could very reassuring early stages . but previous reviewer points out , there seem more passages very real pain confusion , not so many successful healing . said , though , book i think realistically hopeful treatment . but i think this lack focus successful healing result it compilation passages written people middle struggle , not necessarily people who've largely managed complete struggle . so readers might want keep mind . partner , reading this book helps me understand what going inside my partner head . it helped ease my mind somewhat , it pointed out aspects her experience i wouldn't known otherwise . every time i read book it makes want hug her protect her , give her more love she needs .	1

this best coaching book beginner intermediate coaches i ever read . i think so highly this book i feel all coaches should handed copy soon they sign up coaching job . this book basically made me coach i am today . when i first began coaching high school hockey , i sought coaching education all books i could find . but beginning coach , many these books fell short simple fact new coaches need learn bottom up . this book not only remembers teach you all aspects coaching you need get started coaching but hits lot aspects you may not even considered . this first book i read hits upon idea coaching more x o . many coaching books fail realize organization key successful coaching . practice season planning covered way new coach begin planning their season immediately . physical conditioning planning teaching plans covered way no matter what sport you coaching , you apply lessons taught . how make up your season outline how set reach your team objectives covered point where you gain confidence you need succeed . but also covered things such how avoid legal problems , how deal parents how when run meetings both parents players . these very details most hockey or coaching books seem leave out . these very things all new coaches need get information before they begin . after coaching four years high school level , i needed all information i gained this book . i not recommend this book enough . every coach every sport should own it	1

you ever get impression author trying just little too hard get attention their librarian readers ? i don't think this happens much world adult literature , but when it comes kiddie lit , writers sometimes verge shameless . now i willing look past kimberly willis holt paean glory librarians everywhere " part me " , non-fiction true tale librarian heroism , " dear miss breed " joanne oppenheim could certainly slip my watch . but recently i've doubling back rereading some children books came out early 2006 . those books , one i missed early game richard peck , " here lies librarian " , courtesy dial books . mr. peck written wham-bam , rock `em , sock `em tale hard core drag racing librarianship . though still better ( anyone who reads his books regularly tell you ) than 92% schlock printed yearly , peck latest venture carries it faintest odor familiarity . basically , if you perused enjoyed his previous book , " teacher funeral " , then there probably little reason go this title well unless you like regularly douse yourself peck pleasant wordplay . quite while now it just peewee jake , jake peewee . two siblings inseparable since death their parents together they've managed cobble living themselves out small automobile body shop . year 1914 small town indiana peewee jake anxious new paved road pass their miniscule business venture . while they wait , jake working like madman create his very own automobile so enter it one county drag races . then four librarians sweep into town everything goes goofy . you see , these aren't just any old librarians . led irresistible irene ridpath , these woman shake this sleepy little village upside down , managing way help jake his dream , aid peewee ( real name eleanor ) live life she deserves , defeat maniacal dealings no good rotten kirby brothers . hilarity ensues . actually , i'll level you here . lot librarians warning me off this book , if its less-than-perfect status relegated it lowest basement dankest library . it happens , i enjoyed it quite lot . how could i not ? you've got corpses dangling trees , independently wealthy librarians , mention pierce arrow ( car i've loved since i read " cheaper dozen " lo these many years ago ) , chills , thrills , spills , gal winning drag race backwards . peck writing just great . who else comes up descriptions like , " my flesh felt like moss bait " ?. or one less than fully intelligent villains , " his knuckles dragged ground thoughtfully " ? or oblique reference vulgarity peewee saying nasty group people , " more horses laughing . or parts horses " ? wink wink . peck comfortable his time periods , whatsoever those time periods may . that part difficulty comes reading his books . loathe include glossary terms back ( which , fair , i don't think single child reader ever consulted day their life ) he kind expects you know what " step-ins " , " clabber " , or " truss " might , amongst other archaic words phrases . yeah . so pandering your library base may not crime any sort ( " i wondered if there wasn't library science course scheming " ) but it always makes me just touch suspicious . i think " here lies librarian " quite lot fun , but i'm not entirely certain how many kids would actively seek it out . i guess just remains seen . any case , it definitely fun read . not peck strongest work , certainly , but great book get you through day . if you just happen mlis degree your own then it feels just much more familiar .	1

this book written engaging fashion younger readers , so that why i gave it 2 stars . but i found attitudes conveyed towards slavery , native americans , democrats unsettling . i think there some political motives behind this book . i think author trying indoctrinate youngsters into ultra-conservative southern republican political ideas , brand christianity makes people outside church ( you know , other people god loves ) think christ-followers hateful crazy . example , p36 it states , " although it true native americans often treated badly european settlers , they treated one worse " " we cannot feel so much pity native americans when we think all this . " they it coming ? they faught killed each other like every other group humans planet , so we shouldn't feel bad injustices perpetrated white european settlers natives never recovered ? two pages deal slavery , it mentioned slave trade profitable traders , but " hard slaves " who shipped colonies " under difficult conditions . " bit understatement . , subject civil war , " many people south not own slaves , but they knew how quickly southern economy standard living would damaged if northern politicians forced southern farmers immediately free their slaves . " yikes , what slaves ' standard living ? no where it mentioned or even alluded slavery us bad wrong . it not okay own human treat him or her like animal ( or worse ) . reason north abolished slavery ? they machines work slaves , so slaves became obsolete . i quote , " ... why slavery away northern states . reason primarily northern businessmen not need slave labor operate their stores factories because they made much greater use new machines cut down amount hand labor necessary complete job . " no mention how compassionate christians ( others ) vehemently opposed way slave owners viewed , kept treated their slaves , or what they abolish slavery . finally , treatment democrats republicans really unbalanced . only things mentioned carter ? how horrible he establishing relations china , he messed up panama canal , his debaucling iran hostage situation . " short , our country sunk new lows during carter years . " clinton claims fame creating huge government against constitution people ( who promptly reelected him ) , meddling bosnia other war-torn nations , promoting homosexuality , monica lewinsky . ( why these last two issues book 9-year-olds ? ) contrast , repubs get only positive press this text . finally , book also says p178 , " sadly , our country supreme court ruled 1962 it illegal children pray public schools . " that not true . law pertains adult-led corporate prayer , but nothing prevent child praying school . if this book line your political views , then you might want buy it . but i hard time believing anyone this day age thinks slavery really not such bad thing . reason , no one should it . this text could supplemented something more truthful regarding slavery , like parent-censored version " slave narratives , " which records hundreds interviews former slaves their lives slaves after emancipation .	1

this one awesome . i followed series inspector banks books dry season onward this one probably best so far . part reason protagonist , alan banks got fixed pretty good previous book -playing fire . this story starts him still recovering all psychological physical wounds he incurred previously . you follow his struggles through his attempt coming back place where he normal again , well rebuilding his home well his relationships his co-workers , especially annie cabbot . story then forces him re-establish or re-evaluate his relationsip his younger brother , evidence their relationship hinted throughout previous books , but this book places relationship front center . robinson once again uses his signature plot device : dual story intertwining twin narratives . whereas previously robinson used this device tell two stories which related philosophical sense , this time two murders intimately related inextricably become same investigation . robinson builds plot line tempo narrative brilliantly . this time , he little more guarded his storyline so he doesn't telegraph ending much he playing fire , which makes much more satisfying ending . this particular my personal favorite out series so far just because it involves so many emotional changes characters story line so personal banks . robinson also started flesh out other detectives eastvale , giving them points views , foiles , strengths weaknesses . it makes me care lot more story it also makes story much more complicated real	1

( 1996 newly independent uzbekistan celebrated 660th anniversary birth timur khan . ) raven , poe often employed refrains later poems . we see poe experimenting this poetic technique one his earliest efforts , lyrical poem titled song . spirits dead contemplative look death , not poem terror . dream within dream questions reality itself . i more difficulty lengthy , early poem al aaraaf . this romantic fantasy portrays visitation distant world " near four bright suns " our lovely earth , home " idea beauty " . two poems , enigma valentine , challenge reader uncover hidden names within poetry itself .

i rely heavily amazon reader reviews plan my reading list , but i'm going respectfully disagree this . here what i think happened : judy goldstein read " devil wears prada " " nanny diaries " said " hey kids ! let re-write these books but pediatrician point view " then she thought every funny case she ever seen exaggerated it , changed names . then she thought some ridiculous plot allowed her show off her extensive knowledge fancy boutiques hamptons . now i nothing against good chick-lit , but there nothing this book . heroine * so * perfect , i found her unbelievable . actually goldstein seemed afraid include any characters weren't basically amiable ( ira goes gambling sponsored coke binges ? how eccentric ! ) even bird quirky . there so many random threads this book : receptionist chemo loses her hair , well obviously then she going focus all her attention her opera kids cd , never mention cancer again . someone suggests shelley loses few pounds poof ! she goes diet she loses 30 pounds . oh fran templar party ? let run around looking her then drop it all sudden because we remember she not actually character this book . usually i'll give any book 100 pages , if i don't like it , i'll put it down guilt-free . however i felt compelled finish 24 karat kids simply so i could write this review . i'm not going ruin highly predictable ending but it seemed me like author looked book , said " ooh look 200 pages , i'm now ! " typed final 3 page chapter tied everything up	-1
this book suggested me professor ( preston allen , author fine novel hoochie mama ) , whose opinion i respect very much ; thus , i continued reading even when i felt overwhelmed emotion ultimately rewarded story really two stories . mr. banks perhaps finest writer i ever read , his prose refined point almost too self-conscious . he master making reader feel his characters . so i followed main character northeast miami , he fled his boring life found himself more trouble than he knew possible . first story , surface story , works because rich writing some semblance plot . haitian american , i serious problem second main story ( especially because banks ' fine style ) , claude vanise story . i wept . it fiction , but i wept . i remembered how i came here small boy . i remembered what happened my mother , but i won't go into . i angry because mr. banks not haitian . i kept waiting him get it wrong -- there some stereotypical things , but they minor . this story i kept wishing someone would write . both haitians cubans see miami haven poverty political oppression their countries , but america usually sees only cubans deserving refuge . i am still bit bothered banks not haitian , but selfish reasons i wish every american would read this book . i number it among my favorites all time	1
i've enjoyed inspector banks series past ( particularly " final account " which great twist last few pages ) , but " innocent graves " all talk very little pay-off . banks himself continues interesting character , robinson writing never less than superb , but this particular mystery big " who cares ? " me . mystery itself isn't really much mystery its solution more blind luck piece evidence just happens appear , like deus ex machina last moment , than it any brilliant deduction banks part . " innocent graves " seems far more interested psychology suspects ( one particular , whose story concludes all too predictable fashion ) than satisfying its readers great solution crime . i've always found this kind mystery bit bore ; give me couple corpses some brilliant twists i'm happy . there couple corpses here , but no twist ; just far too unbelievable uninteresting ending	1
originally published " buddhism tibet , or lamaism " 1885 ( w.h. allen co ., ltd ., london ) , this classic , somewhat controversial , book gone through several title changes , including very accurate " tibetan buddhism : its mystic cults , symbolism mythology , " when reprinted dover publications 1972 ( currently print , , handsomely produced volume very reasonable price , my personal choice . ) kessinger edition , reviewed here , follows one reprintings under original title . it its time landmark english-language writings tibet , it still retains some value its rich visual documentation , form photographs line drawings . ( unfortunately , kessinger editions not well-known such contents ; reports suggest individual copies their editions differ quality . ) there some remarkably clear descriptions shrines temples , costumes ritual practices , objects images . given massive destruction tibetan religious sites china well tibet , much what he recorded never seen again . unfortunately , author all too frequently confides reader his distaste religion he describing , his contempt its functionaries . i gave up book this reason when i first tried read it . some amazon reviewers ( responding other editions ) seem think waddell must known what he talking , accept his characterizations face value , which pity . part this attitude may self-defense . it seems waddell got access some his information becoming owner/patron tibetan buddhist temple peking , probably felt he make clear his pious readers back home england he not really wicked idolater . some his expressions disdain seem reflect real misunderstandings : failed grasp word " lama " means " teacher religion , " not " monk , " he scandalized discover occasional married lama . ( this response probably relates intra-christian issues well -- see below . ) then , too , there idealized image theraveda buddhism ceylon , which introduced itself europeans true , pure , original , non-superstitious buddhism , not confused those self-styled buddhisms found elsewhere . vision standard purity , versions found northern asia would automatically seem defective , waddell takes it granted . ( it should remembered mahayana , or " great vehicle , " versions buddhism , like tibet , tend refer theraveda teachings hinayana , or " lesser vehicle . " ) finally , waddell , apparently writing solidly " anti-papist " readership , sometimes seems unable distinguish images rituals mahayana buddhism , its various forms , parallel practices catholicism , glad condemn both . worth reading today ? well , book still cited , diffidence , scholars far more sympathetic subject , far better informed it , its extraordinary amount factual documentation . novice tibetan studies , i would suggest starting solid introduction , like snellgrove richardson " cultural history tibet , " those looking further information might continue responsible modern study , such giuseppe tucci " religions tibet . " you could probably turn waddell details after reading either one . those interested " sampler , " i point out waddell published 1894 similar , but much , much shorter , volume ( under 200 pages ) sikkim , " lamaism sikhim " ( his spelling ) . this long out print , but adobe reader pdf book made available set free downloads , due warning waddell biases , part bibliography section " himalayan art resources " himalayanart.org . it might helpful check out " waddell lite " before deciding bigger book . whole bibliography there may helpful , too	1

there absolutely nothing wrong this book all . it very good read , very standard binding . you get good introduction it some nice notes which helpful . this set contemporary times austen , heroine which austen least liked . emma woodhouse young , rich single . she lives life wealth privilege small village just outside london . her world , her village she queen . however there flaws her character which tested . austen liked write small things , daily life , petty things which people small communities become obsessed . so into emma life come scatter-brained harriet smith daughter " someone " who cobbles together what learning she might local ladies academy . emma adopts her tries help her make her way world finding her good match . emma fine world disrupted when first mr elton moves village , then marries rather smart but upstart woman who wishes manage everyone life . austen skill reflecting emma her machinations good , against mrs elton her machinations her own good gloriously . emma brilliant novel its themes universal timeless , it all things life which never change - love , pride , marriage , status money . don't watch dreadful movie adaptations this book ( like one gwyneth paltrow ) book much sharper , wittier subtler . it greatly enjoyable reading . introduction may ( or may not ) help you greater understanding her ability write light , sharp pen . hopefully story stand out its brilliance	1

i would never thought book titled getting most your yellow page advertising would make compelling reading , but i wrong . author former yellow page rep barry maher grabbed my interest first page held it firmly end . i would consider this book essential small business owners or anyone who interesting producing yellow page copy . though certainly geared toward business owners , writing professionals also find tremendous amount applicable information . maher gives brief history evolution yellow pages , then moves through logical progression determining need through process finished product . writing professionals , read through this then thumb through yellow pages see enormity market just screaming professional assistance . i believe this market largely untapped commercial writers . outstanding feature this book , one found far too seldom , abundance margin space making notes good , thick paper highlighting doesn't bleed through . business owners pay price this book hundred times over copywriters find resource niche market rich possibilities .	1

i no comments this particular translation republic , it only version i read . republic not live up its namesake . " socrates " says ( i think we all know socrates really just plato play dough after book 1 ) close book 9 , vision kallipolis only " exists theory " or perhaps there " model it heaven . " earlier differentiation theory practice make it clear plato only intended use kallipolis model human soul . therefore , suggested policies eugenics , infanticide , communal property , holding women children " common " probably not taken seriously . plato himself predicts inevitable unraveling such city . after reading republic second time , it occurred me it little more than self-help manual . reason should rule spirit passion . " dabbling " weakens character . understand difference necessity luxury . shatter your illusions what you think you know , etc etc . not these not important , but such ideas not require complex analogy totalitarian society . thus , i think republic slightly overrated . most compelling portion this book , my opinion , critique various constitutions . while critiques oligarchy , tyranny , timocracy democracy map nicely individual soul , they also make logical sense independently . while convention led us disregard former 3 constitutions , democracy often placed pedestal most ideal form government . plato challenges this notion succeeds vigor tearing down this pedestal . democracy , even its representative form , not much more than tyranny majority . we witness democracy inherent flaws today u.s. , issues such abortion gay marriage . this , my opinion , only significant thing republic offer modern political theorist	1

owen wister " virginian , " first published 1902 , considered many exemplify american western novel . wister certainly established code west , stereotypical figures tough but genteel courageous cowboy , ( one wearing white hat riding white horse ) , spinster schoolmarm back east , horse rustlers , corrupt villain beyond redemption . fact , novel contains scene constituting first known " shootout " american literature . our narrator easterner , man who visits judge henry , virginian employer , his ranch sunk creek fairly frequently . i came think him mr. wister himself , who travel wyoming parts west extensively . my perspective , virginian , whose true name never revealed , anything but stereotype , although many heroes modeled after him . yes , he tall , dark handsome . this description not terribly distinctive or unusual . one could definitely call him strong silent type , he marked sense honor , loyalty justice . however , born raised virginia before civil war , it realistic assume he instilled values southern gentleman . although he not manor born , his family decent hardworking , one certainly not need wealth live good book . war veteran longtime wanderer throughout western territories , he learned survival skills his mid-twenties . loose lips not desirable trait if one wanted live long healthy life . i found virginian credible character , flawed like all men , but clear unwavering sense right wrong . he man suited his environment his times , personifies rugged individual . it important note period which this novel written fully enjoy it , just it crucial understand times setting which such authors charles dickens , jane austen george eliot wrote . " virginian , " wister states : " it through declaration independence we americans acknowledged eternal equality man . it we abolished cut-and-dried aristocracy . we seen little men artificially held up high places , great men artificially held down low places , our own justice-loving hearts abhorred this violence human nature . therefore , we decreed every man should henceforth equal liberty find his own level . this very decree we acknowledged gave freedom true aristocracy , saying , ' let best man win , whoever he . ' america word . true democracy . " believing this so strongly , it any wonder character virginian created ? miss mary stark wood bennington , vermont , who calls herself spinster age 20 , she woman ahead her time . many created mary image , but she original . intelligent , independent , adventurous , full pluck , yes , pretty , she sets off teach school bear creek , wyoming , get away family pressure wed unwanted suitor , probably see more world . acquaintance correspondent miss wood , mrs. balaam , bear creek resident , wrote told young woman teaching position . mary accepts , it happens , virginian first meet her upon her arrival . he actually rescues her , primitive stagecoach she traveling mired-down creek - driver drunk quite irresponsible . she later embarrassed , remembering how tightly she clung cowboy , fright , not out flirtatiousness . he , however , cannot get her out his mind . this so much more than romance novel , although there romance aplenty , both classical nature kind man courting woman . virginian bete noir evil character named trampas . two clash throughout tale until final showdown . one books classic lines our hero responding trampas after nasty insult , " when you call me , smile . " he also betrayed trusted friend who becomes corrupt out greed weakness . law order not arrived wyoming territory it up individuals maintain civil society . mary wood calls this taking law into one own hands , or vigilantism . this issue becomes bone contention herself virginian . owen wister imbues his characters , especially virginian mary , remarkable sense depth . their relationship , well his relationship his old friend steve , depicted particular poignancy . initial reserve mary her suitor normal period . however , sexual tension them palpable . graphic love scenes not necessary here . author more kiss embrace than many modern writers accomplish all their erotica . there some terrific humor also . i found emily , hen , one most original animals fiction absolutely hilarious . wister vivid passages describing wyoming wilderness extraordinary , making it easy one visualize gorgeous landscapes . pace somewhat slow times . however , i not find narrative all tedious . time passed more slowly back then things took longer accomplish obvious reasons . this difference demonstrated way tale told . " virginian " voted western american writers 1977 greatest western novel all time . whether it or isn't debatable , but i really enjoyed it . this 100th anniversary edition max evans contributes new fascinating afterwards . highly recommend . jan	1

i'll start admitting i not read complete , unabridged , six-volume set winston churchill " second world war " . i read condensed version , which still mighty tome , twelve hundred pages small print . book fascinating many respects churchill certainly unique powerful prose stylist . you can't help but struck his phrase-making . where others might say " .. it great impoortance .. etc . " , churchill gives us immeasurably better " .. it highest consequence ... etc . " there no doubt churchill singular personality , but one reads into his account wwii , one can't help but wonder whether it true man never suffered moment self doubt , never wondered whether he making right decision ? churchill writings once criticized " triumph public over personal " it must said there some weight . only glimpses one regularly given into churchill mind his expressions frustration alarm when people disagree him prefer not take what him obviously correct path . before entry us into war , he only frustrated disagreements his military commanders he could fire them , e.g. wavell auchinleck ( churchill only really admired attacking generals it clear caution not one attributes he particularly admired ) . after us entered war churchill obliged cede considerable amount control americans , he frequently overruled his views how war should prosecuted seems , each instance remained convinced rest his life he right it terrible shame he didn't get his way . he never admits wrong anything makes one question fairness his accoun t.t he other remarkable thing this history complete omission any reference concentration camps or hitler " final solution " . friend churchill buff suggested me this because churchill embarassed not known anything camps until nearly end war but cannot correct . what strange thing leave out what intended definitive history ! all all , these great books required reading anyone who wants thorough knowledge wwii , but they seem me written man unable keep his eye off his own place history , however much he may wanted write straight factual account one defining events twentieth century .	1

first word rule st. benedict ' listen ' . this rule , composed centuries ago benedict community , continued communities across world this day , powerful way living into fullness god grace love . however , title this text esther de waal indicates , it not always easy rule , nor one immediately grasped completely understood . monastics oblates benedict orders take vows , typically poverty , obedience , chastity conversion life ( oblate vows modified reflect reality living outside enclosed monastic community , but vows derivative same root ) . it last vow , conversion life , perhaps heart this book . conversion this context not once-for-all , ' road damascus ' kind experience , but rather daily decision continue working toward new kind life . de waal first chapter deals healing - we live broken lives broken world , not just physical well-being sense . using images biblical texts such garden eden cross , prayers st. anselm text st. benedict , she weaves ideas healing , wholeness , fullness even we recognise our short-comings brokenness . god accepts us who we each point , but calls us perfection we never really attain . if this seems like paradox , you're something . next chapter entitled ' power paradox ' . monastic movement always its heart paradoxical call individual ( latin root word monastic mono , meaning ' one ' or ' singular ' ) context community . christian call world but not world , resist world yet work within world , such paradox . de waal illuminates several such paradoxes , including primary christian paradox cross , both image death life , defeat victory . ' paradox ' sometimes considered fancy word contradiction . benedict rule seems full contradiction , just life seems many times . benedict looks today primary focus activity energy , but also looks forward future most important . benedict requires life service others practice hospitality , but also emphasises need solitude withdraw world . de waal explores through rule benedict what it means live oneself , living others community , living world , both together apart . each person endowed gifts graces , potential us see christ them , if we attentive (' listen ' ) lose ourselves we might also christ-like sake others . contradictions de waal highlights include difference desert marketplace ( early desert fathers never quite removed world they might wanted ; marketplace not ' unholy ' or ' ungodly ' place necessarily , st. paul often his teaching while plying his trade tent-maker marketplace ) . whichever avenue taken , desert or marketplace , de waal emphasises necessity prayer anchor - de waal uses example thomas merton , man solitary prayer also completely involved world large . saying ' yes ' call benedict , live spiritual life , live life tensions contradictions , never simple intellectual assent , but rather one come complete person , body soul . it recognising paschal mystery both folly wisdom , recognising ourselves always repeat yes . according de waal , echoing idea conversion life ongoing task , one must say ' yes ' every day , repeating the'yes ' asking blessing each night , passing task oneself others constant basis . de waal reflections not simple easy . small-format book , if one reading words alone , text could completed matter hour or two , but this would lose richness benedict ( de waal ) insights images . this book longer-term meditation , read lectio divina , read inspirational guidance , taken small pieces like rich chocolates , savoured appreciated slowly full experience .	1

lesser known john buchan work , ' huntingtower ' ( published 1922 ) still very enjoyable adventure book which most unlikely person world fiction plays central role . he dickeson mccunn , newly retired gorcery shop owner , whose life very ' respectable .

' difference inclusion historical references post-revolution russia , ' gorbals die-hards , ' group local kids who assist jobs dickson . colorful scottish background also attarctive . book thriller , but unlike ' greenmantle , ' it not political . it more like reading scott or stevenson , sly often comical commentary contemporary social situations here there , such deft description one boy who recounts his experience joining sociliast meeting , thinking it football club . course , russian princess reminds us legend anastasia . book fails convincing when it tries show ' villains ' who only stock characters , idea putting respectable middle-class glassgow grocery store owner not work latter half book , which dickson mccunn less interesting presence than ' die-hards .
