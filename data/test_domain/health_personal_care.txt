you could get same info " percentage " body fat going online . think it : how scale " measure " your body fat ? good question . so i went website manufacturer ... surprise , surprise ... there no details how this worked . it , however , note what it supposed detect how might connect body fat . scale supposedly measures something called " electrical impedence " which sounds pretty complex but really isn't all hard understand . all it means more fat you your body , more " impedence " you higher body fat reading . electricity doesn't flow well through fat scale supposed detect . but here catch - getting accurate body fat measurement not possibly just stepping scale , especially if consumer ( buyer ) scale doesn't understand factors vital accurate measurement . what you your body when you step scale one vital factor . here just one example how easy it would get bad reading : if you dehydrated not drinking enough water or , conversely , you overhydrated drinking too much water or you haven't measured your body fat within certain amount time after exercise or you've standing too long or you've eaten recently ..... you very likely get inaccurate reading you'll confused variation readings one day next , not knowing what factor or combination factors affecting your reading . even worse , you'll no real idea your body fat . what i've seen , these scales provide accurate weight measurements . but when it comes measuring body fat , ads or website not seem indicate you get inaccurate reading if you step scale wrong time day , too soon after exercising , if you thirsty , etc . so save your money . if you working out regularly , eating right , getting shape , etc .... odds your body fat dropping you'll see signs this . you don't need this scale prove it ( although you might consider it worthwhile discover your actual body fat some other way ) . signs reduced body fat firmer muscles , looser clothes ( often ) more streamlined figure . your metabolism likely more efficient , assuming you don't overeat too much . if you absolutely know your percentage body fat , just ask your local physician , trainer or gym director how get accurate assesment when so . if you workout regularly suggested or peak training level , your body fat should go down , assuming you don't compensate eating too much . so don't count this scale give you consistency or quality detailed controlled body fat measurement . it won't .	-1

you shave anything without putting future fatherhood risk , though it takes some patience get things really smooth . i've used it repeatedly over past three months without any major problems . my skin little sensitive after first time , but no terrible pain or anything , there none all now i'm accustomed using it . it possible nick yourself if you press too hard while shaving , but if you read instructions first you should fine . couple very minor drawbacks : it rather noisy , more so than regular electric razor , if you use comb attachments , it tough remove them without also removing foil screen same time . but pops right back , so not big dea	1

well , let face it .. short any procedure invasive(botox , cosmetic surgery , etc ) , there really isnt any magic cream going reverse aging process , but there number products aid improving look , feel texture your face . i've trying out several products out there , i found " olay total effects night firming cream face neck " one best ones around . i really like this one alot because many benefits it all one jar . after using it pretty generously little over month(i've used 1/2 jar so far ) , i found it worked wonders improving look feel my skin . it minimized appearance fine lines , really hydrated my dry skin , improving firmness , absorbed deep into my skin , so using it every night , i could still feel softness next morning , left my face feeling very smooth touch . i especially felt saw visable result around my neck throat area(where i am really starting get over 50 look ) . it nice , very light scent , here best part ... price here amazon 1/2 what i paid when i purchased it my groceries market(and it even sale store ) , so around twelve dollars here right now , it real bargain . there 7 benefits listed box , some i mentioned above , others include evening skin tone , minimizes appearance pores reduces appearance blotches age spots . give this one try any these aging signs . don't expect miracle . wrinkles not vanish , but nice improvement look feel your skin , healthy glow leaves you feeling just little better yourself(and great price ) . formula includes fast absorbing skin strengthener called vitaniacin(vit b3 , vit pro-vit b5 ) , wheat protein hydrators . i like it recommend it ..... laurie	1

i say i converted . over 15 years now i lived razor . i pretty thick beard it grows fast too . i am kind guy gets 5 o'clock shadow noon . i used every single type razor out there disposable battery operated vibrating type one blade 5+1 blade . i tried all brands ended up feeling gillette brand best type razor , but now i find it not best shave . i used electric shaver several years back , it one top line norelco incorporated gel . it gave me pretty bad razor burn not get all hairs ; i ended up shave normal . -- true story -- i am manager my job my last annual review only item i marked bad my personal appearance . not i dress bad or not wear deodorant , but they felt i didn't shave often . ( i shave very least every other day , usually every day ) . so i felt i so something it . i researched electric shavers thinking i could get quick shave during my lunch hour my car or least my way work so it would last longer . i found panasonic seems leading pack moderately priced all features expensive models . instruction manual explicit saying it take 30 days get used any new shaving method they assure you love panasonic shaver once your facial hairs get used way it cut . i using it almost 30 days now , i not live without it . i never this close shave before . i actually go 2 days without getting shadow . my fianc� found new love touching my face , i seem getting more kisses too ! during first 2 weeks i get couple missed hairs my old gillette , but today officially i able through my gillette away good . ( my boss even asked what i am doing different when i told him , he went out bought one too , he also loves it now . my fianc� said she would leave me if i stopped using panasonic , it good thing panasonic around decades ) so , i am raving his product , but every good its bad ... what bad ? well , it gets couple weeks get used shave , but amount time i am planning use it money i am saving buying razors every month , i handle . cleaning system very good , but it takes very long clean ( 2-3 hrs ) it noisy since base turns shaver off during cleaning cycles . cleaning cartage said last 3 months whether you use it once day or one week . i not gotten point yet , but it very very easy clean shower some body wash . i just end up using base drying cycle , which option . batter very good . month i used it , i charged it twice but it really didn't need it it said charge good . overall ... excellent product . could there better shaver out there , maybe , i ever know ... this time , i am not worried it , i am very satisfied this panasonic , don't think it get any better . this product not include cleaning base . i recommend it even if you don't use it clean razor , you use it dry it , it help keep your blades newest condition prevent them rusting when air drying . but , if you looking save money get excellent razor , this it !	1

i not buy this product amazon , but through retailer ( cheaper ) . i my research first came across all reviews this product amazon . since it less than $40 , i decided give it shot . i own this product roughly two months now . i am stationed overseas decided cough up $40 vs . $8 haircuts once week . it more than paid itself no time . i give myself simple haircut once week ( just one length throughout ) . some user comments amazon not affect me i felt compelled tell it : 1 . binding . just keep your hair short trim often it won't bind . what else you expect cordless trimmer . they not put out power compared corded electric one . even trimmer plugged , it still bind . i found this out very first time i used it . my hair 1 1/2 inches long . yes , it bind ( first time ) . after keeping my hair setting 8 ( roughly 1/4 inch ) , it not bind anymore . 2 . setting dial gets accidently turned . i never problem . besides , way i hold shaver my thumb permanently planted dial anyway so it prevent it turning . other reviewers who this problem may holding it wrong way . it require little finesse , but you'll get hang it second or third time . 3 . ease cleaning . description not lie when it says submersible . easy clean removable blades . water not affect this trimmer all . very good water-proof design panasonic . 4 . comes little oil bottle small brush . i clean thing every single time i use it so it ready go next time . just oil blades after every use ( panasonic recommended oiling before after ) . i found too much oil make it harder clean because hair sticks more water can't simply wash it out . 3 . overall this trimmer good go . save me lot $ during my 1 year deployment . plus good thing i don't wait line anymore get 5 minute haircut !!! hope this helps	1
after reading lot reviews here , i decided try this dryer . i dryer i love , but i thought i should try find back-up inevitable time when mine dies . one i vortex dryer(with bell shaped end ) lifts hair it dries wonderful ! anyway , i can't find same model , so i tried this revlon model . oh my ... i shoulder length color treated hair , kind medium thickness i ended up fuzzy mess ! i gave up before it quite dry went back my other dryer . i wish i would time start over , but i would late work . ugh .... hate bad hair day . thing .... on/off switch bad place . i kept turning it off i using it ! my thumb kept hitting switch . so .... its not me , but ymmv(your mileage may vary )	-1

i using various shavers over 40 years . i tried most major brands . past , i preferred remington because it powerful fast . but remington irritates my skin . braun less powerful less irritating , but still irritating . i previously used norelco rotary , perhaps 15 years ago , but it too slow not close enough . however , although most shavers remain pretty much same over years , this norelco giant step improved above prior models . it shaves faster , much easier clean . old norelco difficult clean . this shaver cleaned very well just hot water . however , i use soap lubricant . ( if you use oily stuff , marketed various pre-shaves , which basically puts film oil your face , there tendency gunk accumulate under blades . i recommend just using ordinary soap . ) this new model norelco larger blades , better shape , allowing closer faster shave . also , it much quieter than back forth models . think inefficiency ramming blades ordinary shaver back forth . rotary energy here more efficiently quietly goes shaving beard . i aged , my beard become less dense . if you tough beard , thick beard , you may prefer alternative . however , if you want close shave , quiet mechanism , which relatively easy clean , i recommend this norelco . you may not need well designed cleaning bay , may prefer just shaver charger . i hardly use cleaning system because just hot water works so well , using soap lubricant . interesting , brochure recommends just clean , dry face . i found soap works better . anyway , i would recommend this shaver one best available . long trial period suggests manufacturer own confidence its product	1

this great item . i purchased one each bathrooms my condo i love them . installation breeze , took all 5 minutes . plus directions give you option take out " low-flow " filter areas ( such area i live ) already low water pressure . old shower heads i didn't give me this option so i low water pressure plus low flow filters - which meant virtually trickle shower . so nice take real shower again !	1
some pens fat , some thin , most people preference . if you like fat pen , this handsome black-and-chrome item good candidate . it satisfyingly heavy reasonably wel balanced . i think cross great job satin black finishes generous chrome appointments give this pen bold appearance without becoming gauche . writing quality good , though you find better higher price . consider this pen audi a6 writing instruments , entry-level luxury may not compete mercedes but certainly fun drive	1
i can't use this bracelets , it makes them too big they slide off my wrist . also , clasp really heavy so if i use it necklace , it always hanging front , it not attractive . waste money , i never actually used it .	-1
i'm guy , this review coming guy point view . i absolutely loathe cleaning . i live studio apartment really shouldn't too hard clean , but it me becuase how much i love ie : hate ) cleaning . anything could make this easier great thing my opinion . so i got this magicreach kit , figuring it'd ok , maybe little better than my swiffer . i say i really like it . very simple , easy put togehter , overall just nice device . kit i got came mop pads tub tile pads . tub tile pads need moistened prior use then soap needs rinsed . mopping pads pre-moistened left dry . reading instructions helps you figure this out quickly , but i guess its easier skip step then get angry write one star reviews . maybe that more satisfying . its true mop pads drip few drops you put them device . somehow getting few drops cleaning solution surface you're mop doesn't seem like problem , but what i know ? i suppose those drops give away plan attack , taking away element surprise . my guess your dirt won't able run fast enough , even advance warning . if your dirt outrun you , then i suggest you find cleaner place live , consider changing few personal habits too . if you take few seconds read instructions use little brain power before using this thing i think you'll find you'll love this device	1

i experienced some tooth sensitivity this product , but much less than crest whitestrips . read other reviews - sensitivity vary person person . i like this product better than strips because it covers more teeth . no , it not cover all them - you would get zoom treatment your dentist or some other full treatment . however , this kit fast cheap . i noticed difference tooth color after using it twice two weeks . so , you may need buy multiple kits more effect . also , avoid getting it your gums rinse thoroughly after use . i burned my lower gumline little first time because i didn't wash it out well enough .	1
i purchased this shaver gift my husband he submitted following review : i older norelco not pivoting head extra shaving slots . i thought new shaver would one-up my older norelco so i ordered 9160xl . well , my opinion , there no difference quality shave nor reduction shaving time . so i returned shaver continue use my less featured , older model . i would , however , ordered very satisfied 9160xl if i didn't already norelco i feel it best electric shaver market --- i've tried most all them	1

there no 100% accurate scale . so you just get best one money . i've used different scales i'm happy taylor . i've seen this scale $50.00 most websites . i know lot people rated this scale kind poor . however , it not this scale only , all scales get rated poor . scale offensive object . it tells things people don't want know . people complain inaccuracy measuring fat . it approximate , all scales work same way . so wether you buy plus $100.00 scale , or this low price taylor , it same accuracy . one thing you got ask yourself although measuring fat approximate , approximate amount help you lose weight ? my answer would yes . so spend extra few dollars get fat analyzer scale . finding scale lifetime warranty very hard . scales wear out use , so i'm surprised this company offer . negative : it took me 10 minutes program scale reading instructions 4 times . so it not easiest instructions follow	1

i am big fan regular clic reading glasses . i own several pairs think they great . however , sport goggles not get my vote confidence . they three problems which make them unusable me : 1 ) all clic products there all important stem adjustment adjusts length stems properly fit glasses onto your head . however , unlike very cool regular reading glasses clic , sport googles not adjust properly so goggles run very tight if you need even slightly above average stem legnth , 2 ) there also extra foam padding sport googles make them very snug , but because tight stems foam padding makes these glasses far too tight enjoy 3)the maker doesn't make it clear they should their description ... irridium ( red)colored lens some sports goggles far too intensely tinted dark any kind regular light conditions or applications like morning driving ... or even safe walking rocky path . sorry clic , but your success reading glasses went your head ... you needed more user testing comfort vision sports goggles . i would like return them larger size lighter colored lens ... too bad me !	-1

i'm 26m , 6 ' 185 growing . work out regularly , mostly weights basketball . i'm allergic peanuts , which makes most protein bars off-limits me . this only bar i've found where non-peanut flavors don't contain trace amounts peanuts set off my allergies . incredible , if only reason . but there more . 20g protein . wow . this meal replacement if you're road or it mid-morning , early-evening or even late-night snack , especially if you're trying build lean muscle shooting 1.5 or more grams protein per pound body weight . it easy 20 . carbs real , review says . it clean energy , effective either before or after workout . i prefer take liquid protein after workout , body absorbs it faster , but pinch this would great choice . beyond it little crispy little chewy , there physical satisfaction eating it makes experience complete . but , review said , this isn't intended diet bar , it men women who work hard use lots energy throughout day , hence name " builders bar . " i guess if you ate half one instead meal , it might work way . finally taste outstanding , when stacked against other bars ( although i haven't tried many , due peanut allergies ) . if you close your eyes pretend , it really could dessert . i stick cookies cream or chocolate . chocolate yummy dunked hot coffee mid-morning . i buy box every two weeks keep stocked home , work oftentimes one car just case i get hungry . review said outside chocolate got crumbly , this true , if it gets hot melted . when things solidify they crumble . doesn't change taste but it messy . keep them cool you're good shape . i've even tried putting them freezer prior eating , not bad but no significant difference . thank you clif	1

excellent scale- ever since i bought it , i've losing weight since i accurately tell how much i weigh . it must weight loss . i weighed 176 day i got it , i'm 157 right now . water percentage , it worthless- long you're over 50% ( male ) , your fine . it related body fat % . body fat % fluctuates too much great . it good rough estimate- but i go 16-19% depending when i weigh myself . i find i'm 16% when i follow recommended advice ( don't eat 2 hours then weight yourself ) , but that definitely too low my opinion . i still got small beer belly . 19% seems more accurate i get after i eat . but body fat percentage definitely gone down since i lost weight , so like i said -it good estimate , but don't worry 3% fluctuations . i think key this scale note your lowest weight ( morning when you get up , just weigh only option ) . way if weight goes down , you know you lost weight ! it amazing how many pounds you gain right after your eat ( clothes weight 2-5 pounds depending jeans/pajamas , etc .	-1

i bought this product hopes shave less often dual epilator/shaver feature . over all i am very pleased . like other reviewers i think legs armpits it works best shower when you nice lathered up soap - lather helps get rid friction head moves over skin it much smoother shave . i found without lather movement somewhat jerky , head didn't slide over skin smoothly it more painful . legs especially shins , it still painful although not painful epilator i tried . it works absolutely great ( when lathered up ) armpits . i both them quickly , completely very little pain - i think your armpits must less sensitive . i my bikini area - again definately works better hurts less when your skin lathered up . i say this definately painful process . while it still works great this area , i think waxing may stil best couple reasons . 1 ) waxing whole area one fell swoop therefore you only pain moment opposed several minutes epilator ; because your bikini line so sensitive , this makes big difference . 2 ) it nearly impossible epilate " shape " your grooming because bulkiness head . unless you're removing all hair it would difficult just certain area . ( this reason i gave four stars not five)i happend few mutant hairs my chin i pluck every now again ; just giggles i tried it my face ( dry ) . it worked awesome . i ran over my chin only couple times it got even smallest thinest hairs you couldn't really see . overall great product but not best bikini area	-1

i tried using my mom old hot rollers once ( heavy kind , spikes pins ) because i wanted curly hair , but easily discouraged because they really hard put they hurt my head . not so these rollers caruso ! steam itself heats up 1 minute or less rollers also heat up fast ( 1 roller time , 10 seconds or less ) , they're so easy put . they're foam , so they don't hurt my head , they're not too hot handle , shields hold each roller place securely so they don't fall out . you also use combs help wrap shorter pieces hair . i medium-length , thick hair , probably left rollers 45 minutes , although directions say you really only need leave them 15 minutes after putting last roller . longer doesn't hurt , though . neither blow drying speed up process . smaller rollers gave me look i going . they made my hair soft , manageable , curly . i skeptical first , but am pleasantly surprised results . it worth money . i would highly recommend this product	1

centrum-brand vitamins made quality company , which important buying vitamins . since vitamin industry not regulated fda , manufacturers put just anything label sell their product , many ! oft times supposed ingredients not even product , this why name-brand product essential . centrum-brand one consumer trust . centrum-silver product targeted adults those older than 55 years age . however , this vitamin formulation taken any adult effectiveness . vitamins elements chemical compounds help body cells function better , mostly area cell/body metabolism . if one eats balanced diet high greens fruits , extra store-bought vitamins probably not essential , vitamins supplied adequate quantities food consumed . however , typical american diet notorious high sugars low veggies fruits , therefore making supplemental vitamins important . diets high sugars demand more vitamin compounds help metabolize sugars . since average american consumes more than 110 pounds dietary ( table sugar : , sucrose ) sugars each year , supplemental vitamins important if not essential take daily basis . when selecting vitamin product , it important get basic vitamins , such a e , but it also important get minerals trace elements too , these compounds elements essential metabolism cellular health body various functions including immune system . this product all basics covered more , why i like it . most vitamin companies when formulating their vitamin compound give 100% rda or more . i am not believer mega-vitamins ( formulations provide many times more than rda ) because body only use so much extra generally excreted urine . only exception this rule fat-soluble vitamins , ( vitamin , , ) . fat-soluble vitamins stored excess body reach toxic levels . this mind , it makes no sense continually consume fat-soluble vitamins excess . one final thing : many manufacturers make claims their vitamin product going make you " feel " better , sensation vitality noticable . perhaps if you state malnutrition many years , this claim may valid some , but i taken vitamins most my life , i feel same whether i take them or not . rather than judge effectiveness vitamins how they " feel " , judge them instead knowing you all bases covered terms cell metabolism , once this covered , your cells healthy nutrition make them . jim " konedog " koeni	1

reading magnifiers i ordered 09/29/04 finally arrived 10/19/04 after call seller . ( original order shipped amazon.com so it reshipped me . ) it only took 5 minutes or so assemble one reading magnifiers , it possible adjust it just any position clever arm . weighted base keep it falling over . unfortunately , thin plastic lense such poor quality it very difficult receive any benefit device . if user turned adjustment knob too far , it nut holds it together would fall off . nut small must inserted into outside adjustment knob assemble device . knob actually turns nut onto screw . presumably device someone low vision . if small nut falls floor , i'm not sure someone low vision would able find it . my advice save your money buy quality device nice glass lens .... if possible , try device out before buying .	1

razor blades expensive enough it , trend " more better " reached almost ludicrous points industry . what ? five blades , you say ? why , it must better than four ! meh . i fine stubble which grows varying angles across my neck . good news , while other razors always unable remove all my stubble first try , this blade , fact , take care problem . addition this , it aggravated skin quite bit ( this might much vibrating action five blades ) . precious soothing-aloe strip little no effect my skin ( particularly neck area ) . if you sensitive skin all , this might not razor you . contrary experience others , however , extra " trimming " blade worked well me when getting spots edge my mouth , under my nose , when shaping my vast hedge-like sideburns . however , five blades other side dulled remarkably fast . considering my rather fine hairs , i'm used exchanging blades once every week or so . now i'm exchanging them twice week . seeing how this product already so much more expensive than competitors ' products , seeing how it designed work exclusively fusion razor ( vice versa ) , seeing how its lavish wealth cutting action clawed my skin , i find it hard recommend	1
i would give this product negative 50 stars if i could . i paid beaucoup several very plain bras ( no lace or other embelishments ) didn't wear or wash bras until i received brababy . i assumed brababy would protect my bras wash , that what product claims . imagine my suprise when i pulled my bras out washer ( out their respective " bra demolition cages " ) find them ruined . i'm talking not wearable . straps both brand new , never worn , previously mint condition bras hanging out all over place looked like they chewed animal . both bras dents molded cups . then i saw one bras two noticeable rips cup ! i nearly flipped out ! i think my bras would've better " washed " i thrown them into center pack rabid fighting mad dogs . only positive thing report amazon refunded my money . back hand washing my bras back mall i go replace ripped bra . perhaps other it dented cups suitable halloween ?	-1

these hair topia pills nothing but garbage ! pure nonsense ! trust me , i know this because i used buy them . i first bought these pills last year june 2005 after hair formula 37 unsuccessful promise producing longer stronger hair four months usage . well , these pills not expensive previous brand mentioned , promised also change dry brittle hair into long healthy , it absolute nothing . i said myself , like hair formula 37 , maybe i just need give this more time , so i bought 2-month supply gave it 3 months all there no difference all . this product might just work others , which it , but it certainly didn't work me . i must admit i brought this myself , my mother warned me not buy these ridiculously expensive pill since they nothing hair grows naturally anyway , if you really want get hair pills then just buy them whole lot cheaper regular stores like giant or even hair vitamins damn dollar store ! thus , i am here warn others not waste their precious money . if you going , please don't it this site-you buy this product little cheaper hairboutique.com .	-1

i disappointed getting this product because i've read previous reviews majority written positive feedback this hair iron . i actually prefer cheaper conair ceremanic irons w/o wet on/off feature over this one . it doesn't clamp down well my hair ( i've got thick frizzy hair ) . results me aren't great , it straightens my hair little but it still frizzy . it lightweight which nice . i don't care wet hair option because it takes me twice long straighten my hair . i definitely prefer other models over this one .	1
i this model , or least it looked same , few years it worked exceptionally well . it finally broke down recently i thought i lucky enough find it again , but they must changed product significantly because it not work very well all . actually , it virtually useless it only partially gets job , which , course like not it all	-1
hello , i recently bought this blood pressure monitor ..... it functions all well ...... but it gives incorrect readings ....... i mean readings vary significantly ........ not once , twice ... but many many times ...... i am never sure validity readings ..... purchase this your own risk ..... my recommnedation would get manual blood pressure monitor like one doctors ..... atleast u know readings genuine ... u always find someone who spare 5 minutes help u get readings ...... take care stay healthy ......	1

tylenol over-the-counter medication contains its active ingredient " acetaminophen " . acetaminophen analgesic drug treats mild moderate pain , making it great headache reliever , or medication treats mild strains , sprains , toothaches , etc . it also acts reduce fever . acetaminophen commonly used place aspirin those allergic aspirin . one drawback acetaminophen it not reduce inflammation ( therefore , it limited use arthritis swelling reduction ) . it few side-effects . those liver disease should avoid acetaminophen , it hard liver . tylenol ( acetaminophen ) came into great prominence when aspirin fell out favor due incidence reye syndrome aspirin children . tylenol manufacturer proprietary name acetaminophen . there generic form acetaminophen also sold over counter , this version much cheaper than " tylenol " , container usually contains more tablets/pills , etc . generic form acetaminophen just effective tylenol , just cheaper priced . sometimes acetaminophen combined other medications dual action . example , tylenol pm diphenhydramine ( active ingredient benadryl ) , which causes sedation acts like good sleeping pill . diphenhydramine also anti-histamine , so it work itching allergies too . tylenol packaged different strengths : extra-strength 500 mg per tablet , standard ( 325 mg per tablet ) , children dose 80 mg . tylenol may also packaged timed-release version , called " extended release " . rather than tablet dissolving all once stomach , tablet slowly releases acetaminophen throughout digestive tract . all all , acetaminophen great product . if you want " name brand " acetaminophen , tylenol your brand ( although it cost more ) . my choice generic brand it cheaper dozen . jim " konedog " koenig	1

this review oral-b flexisoft replacement heads . coupled braun electric toothbrushes , this one most effective aids oral hygiene ever developed . my introduction oral-b goes back over 27 years usaf basic training briefing ; dental technician held up oral-b toothbrush medium bristles said " this toothbrush you need if you want keep your teeth " or some such statement like . well , i haven't lost one yet . motorized mechanicals toothbrush most work while you guide oscillating round head around over your pearly whites . while heads undeniably pricey when looked just dollars cents , there value fact total package actually makes rather mundane chore little more fun while actually living up claim it better job your teeth than manual brushing . since i've always believed entire surface area toothbrush head meant covered toothpaste size head these smaller than average brush , i know i'm using less toothpaste same job . while this no big deal , long term economic benefit plaque under control , healthy gums bright smile full natural teeth . it kind hard deny it works since my dentist confirmed positive results upon direct examination . just careful what model these brush heads you selecting watch pricing . oral-b uses kind color code bristles , ones colored indicator bristles line shaft flexisoft model seems equate medium hardness . enjoy life	1

this price , we got pedometers whole family . my 9 year old son worn his every day since . it interesting see how many steps you take day . we not set pace length recommended , but other than , it ready use immediately - just clip it onto your waistband . shows steps , miles calories burned . my only complaint front cover little hard flip open	1
i really liked this product , so smooth , noiseless . very easy use also less efforts required remove hair ...... i go again it .....	1
i surprised open this pedometer page after sometime see all negative reviews it receives . i using this specific model more than 3 months now i am really satisfied it . it really accurate ( lt ; 1% declination , i performed more than four tests more than 400 steps during different times its life i seen couple cheap pedometers performing much worse ) , clips firmly belt or pants , displays time conveniently nice backlight , even radio which works , although most people said , not really its best feature . truth i am not using radio all , mostly because i believe batteries last longer it save me extra trips walmart . but i tested it it works , although nothing impressive there . course , money , i think you cannot go wrong this pedometer . one funny comment , although most people complain it cannot open very easily , after sometime it open more easily you think . actually it couple times where putting bag my shoulders or waist pouch applying some pressure it mistake , open it wide , so it not count any steps . but it not open itself anyway , needs external force this happen , so it not happen often . all all , i am sure plastic construction less than rigorous production testing result many pieces not function properly result bad reviews . maybe i lucky , maybe not , but this one best most reliable devices i carry use every day . great incentive walking exercising more	1

i exclusive norelco shaver user past 7 years . my first 6756x advantage which i still use occasionally , followed few years later norelco 8894xl spectra . both these shaver still work well . reason i purchased new 7775x because after 7 years use my 6756x only hold charge few shaves , otherwise works perfectly . although i my new 7775x shaver short time , it seems provide close shave my old unit . pros : 7775x more secure changing base than old unit ( deeper ) . message display provides good status shaver include battery charge which old unit not indicate until it near depleted . unit still maintains shaving cream/gel dispenser . this especially useful it you travel frequently like i . no more worries my shaving cream confiscated . cons : if you primarily use shaver dry then rinse indicator useful . my purchasing in/out shower shavers ability always use it wet some type cream or gel . i find closeness shave equal any bladed razor i ever used , without nicks cuts . i would not recommend suspending shaver supplied plastic hanger strap which not near secure my old unit . it looks like it could easily disconnected allowing unit fall possibly break . overall , i am very satisfied my new 7775x . i expect it provide same long life service close shave my old unit . i would recommend you keep you unit clean charged required most importantly change shaver heads once year , recommended . doing so should provide same long live close shave i enjoyed over years . happy shaving !	1
