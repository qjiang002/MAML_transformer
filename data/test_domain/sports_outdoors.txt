my first impression unit very rugged nice looking . then i tried use it . i mostly bought it altimeter thermometer . first day use i just ran out patience plan return it . here problems i altitech21 . most time buttons work fine , but several times i pressed mode button mode not change . 2 . when setting declination page 25 manual states you press set/reset/light reverse digits , but soon you press set/reset/light button unit ends calibration mode . 3 . temperature stuck 87.5 degrees hour after purchase . finally after cycling through mode buttons temperature instantly dropped 81.5 degrees . i held unit front ac vent car until car cooled down 70 degrees , i suspect air coming out vent actually cooler than 70 degrees . temperature display never budged 81.5 degrees . 4 . i constructed rudimentary chamber placed altitech2 unit digital thermometer chamber . digital thermometer registered 78 degrees , altitech2 registered 81.4 degrees . i blasted hot air chamber hair dryer . digital thermometer quickly rose 116 degrees i turned heat off . altitech2 stayed exactly 81.4 degrees . after removing chamber altitech2 slowly increased 94 degrees , went down 92.6 degrees stayed there good 5 minutes . despite room temperature 78 degrees . 5 . compass only stay 10 seconds , then display turns off conserve battery . this never seems long enough get good fix while using reference map . when display shuts down you need press start button again turn display . since this button recessed , you reposition your hand press button your fingernail ( i ) . this moves compass relation map again very frustrating constantly press start button . i'll stick my 19th century compass now . this unit might worth keeping me if altimeter reliable , but after all other trouble i i not even mess setting up altimeter i lost confidence device .	-1

if you're looking here you're obviously interested playing better golf therefore you need own this . jim hardy figured it out . forget everything else you heard golf swing listen why proper thing : - take club inside up backswing , - keeping clubface closed until you reach top wherein you rotate your forearms make clubface open , - downswing you need keep your arms behind you ( some might say " stuck " ) , while simultaneously " coming over top " get club out front your body , - swing well your left complete through swing ( i.e. never " down line . " ) yes , this sounds like exact opposite everything you've ever heard . but then again employing your current method you truly satisfied you getting most your abilities ? most cases if one honest answer " no . " so it stands reason your technique wrong instead blaming yourself it time give hardy " plane truth " try . addition video series which amazing , i would also recommend both hardy books essential material . you want get them all keep reinforcing proper fundamentals since each subtle differences description new drills , you're more likely find keys really make difference you	1

if you trying decide wood or foam yoga block , i highly recommend foam blocks beveled edges because they very comfortable . when you pressing blocks , they firm enough withstand your body weight , but not overly firm so they make your hands hurt pressure . blocks tend encourage proper form because they allow you slowly work into poses provide needed support when you can't reach floor pose . lightweight blocks easy move side side they work extension your arm . there many ways you use these blocks once i started yoga step step workouts/yoga practice sessions , i found i really need buy softer yoga blocks try some more advanced positions . ~ rebecca review	1

i purchased coleman exponent f1 ultralight stove this past spring preparation trip cascades oregon . i owned liquid fuel stove years ( msr whisperlite purchased approx 1992 ) , loved it , but i am getting older , i wanting trim my pack weight down . i found following advantages f1 ultralight . #1 . easy use . simply unscrew burner head , open pan supports , screw burner head back down , screw stove onto canister , light match , twist valve , you cooking gas . #2 . no priming . liquid fuel stoves required priming , pumping , which made them harder use than i would expected . this stove , you simply turn valve light . no waiting generator heat up . #3 . very light weight . stove assembly itself weighs less than just small fuel bottle my liquid fuel stove alone . this thing feather back . disadvantages there well . #1 . canister stoves rely low boiling point fuel force fuel vapor up out canister , temps close , or below boiling point , which close 0 fahrenheit , stove simply not work . me , where when i camp , this not issue . #2 . fuel cannot used emergency fire starter . #3 . fuel expensive compared white gas , or unleaded gasoline . owners manual claims this stove only works coleman brand canisters , but i found any threaded canister 70/30 butane / propane blend works . i used brunton , coleman , msr , some odd black canister i bought gas station oregon it , all excellent results .. compared other canister stoves such msr pocket rocket , brunton optimus crux , snow peak giga power stove , or primus yellowstone techno trail , coleman exponent f1 ultralight design made most sense me , sported lowest weight ( . 4oz lower than its nearest competitor ) , what i able determine impromptu store testing , appeared best pot stability group , pot supports spread out nice wide . one tidbit this however ... evernew 1.3 titanium cookpot , oddly shaped bottom , sits slightly odd angle f1 . i tried many other pots this only one i problem . issue whith oddly dimpled bottom evernew pot , not coleman stove ... summary . if you camp where temps aren't freezing , low weight , ease use important , cost fuel unimportant , then this stove you . however you must carry some other sort emergency fire starter lieu stove gas start wet wood . if however cost fuel going factor you , or you going go mountain climbing , or whatever , you want bypass any canister stove all , just go gasoline model instead . coleman f1 ultralight lightest group stoves i considered , best design , came price point i liked . majority backpackers out there , i would say this would best stove you .	1

my boyfriend took this last year wrestling season lost fifteen pounds without all altering his eating or exercise habits . athlete , he always gets huge amound exercise practice , lifting weights running daily but eats whatever much he wants . he started bottle weighing 195-200 6'1 '' ended weighing 178 . he maintained this weight six months too , proving it wasn't just water . he experience pretty bad side effects , however , point where he said he wouldn't take product again or recomend it anyone . taking suggested 4 pills day , he felt constantly sick , like he " all life sucked out him " actually vomited twice- pretty gross . anyways , because significant results he experienced , i've always tempted try product myself finally picked up bottle last week , my boyfriend dismay . so far , i haven't felt sick or shaky all , i think this because my daily dose ritalin all but completely numbed my body effects weaker stimulants like 200mg caffeine contained this product . i also unfortunately haven't noticed any weight loss , this may same reason :-( i'll report back when i finish bottle	1

i would actually give this product 4.5 stars since i am very happy it . only negatives small plastic piece broken upon delivery actual instructions use table very brief . assembly breeze ( broken part aside ) , constuction this table very solid . terms use , i'm little embarrassed say i burst blood vessel under my eye second day i used it , because i inverted too long relaxed position . it hurt couple days annoying , but not serious . treatment my neck back pain , however , table great . just 4 or 5 minutes day really seems help . key watch how pressure inversion feels tense your facial muscles accordingly concert other movements keep your circulation moving . don't just hang there like bat .	1

my lifetime , i probably built 14 halfpipes least 25 quarterpipes . problem i live ohio weather ruins them every year . i prefer quarterpipe because it not too obtrusive you more time prepare tricks . one biggest challenges making good quarterpipe getting bottom sheet lie flat riding surface ... especially after few rainfalls warped wood ! i hesistant buy this ramp because i never physically seen it . i watched videos read some reviews , but reviews not really give mouch specific info ... hopefully , this one ! ramp 9 foot radius bit under 3 feet high . although this sounds kind weak , it actually fun ramp . curve deceptive . if you look each panel , they almost look flat , but when you ride it , you get nice lift . its not vertical , but you airs . transisition gets you 70 degrees coping excellent . it metal fairly burly . lip tricks very fun this ramp . material ramp abs type plastic ... it not rot . i leave my ramp out rain . no issues all ramp , although there some rust coping ... i may need rpaint it , but if you grind daily , it takes care it . i am big skater ... i am 6'1 " over 220lbs . this ramp holds me ease . it never slid i drop it , rock rolls , 50/50s ollies . ramp give bit landing , but not changed its original form . top deck rather small , but it support 500 lbs allows lap over grinds . bottom ramp formed piece metal which allows smooth start ramp ... i love . ramps seems bit abrupt first , but you get use it . so ... here pluses minuses ! plus- easily taken down folded away winter ... or set up basement ! - riding surfcae fast smooth . - you link more than 1 ramp together ... fairly seamlessly . - metal support top notch all connections welded . so much nicer than wood transitions screws ! - surface ramp piece excellent ... very smooth . - it loks professional . i live nice neighborhood . i peeled off freshpark logo it looks lot less obtrusive road . minus- expensive . i bought 2 ... - not very wide . one unit only 4 feet wide . i bought two hooked them together form 8 foot wide ramp . when i just rode 4 footer , it not so fun ... not lot room . adding second ramp made it who new experience .. more room rock solid . - wheels it rolls complete garbage . i cannot believe how they skimped this . i looking replace them . they plastic no bearings ... not take any abuse . $400 piece , you think they would give you quality wheels . - ramp loud . much i love bottom piece metal allows smooth transition , it make loud clanging noise after repeated rides . i don't really mind it , but i am not sure if my neighbors thrilled it ! - heavy . this good bad . it very solid , which awesome , but when it folded up its wheels , it very heavy .. 150lbs (?) it tips easier than it should . if child this fall him , it would not good . unlikeley , but i it tilt few times i moved it . i strong enough correct it , but kid could problems . - potential theft . i think they should provide bar you attach lock so nobody fold it up take it your driveway . i bolted together 3 major bolts , so theif would work get it ... but if you only 4 footer leave it outside , it would take minutes steal . i love ramp . i looked long time ramp would allow me skate whenever i wanted , but would not require me rebuild every year . good quarterpipe costs $200 make . you relaminate every year paint etc ... this far best solution once i rationalized i would skate it many years . those plastic ramps total garbage ... i never even considered them . i hope answers any questions ramp . bottom line it costs lot money , but it best value if you want this type ramp .	1

nutshell : super food supplement like brewer yeast or lecithinover 5 times more monounsaturated fat than polyunsaturated fat ! -- -- over 20 times more monounsaturated fat than saturated fat ! but that not all --- golden flax seed ? nutritionally complex food . flax seed contains very high concentration alpha linoleic acid ( ala ) ? omega-3 essential fatty acid ? plus fiber , lignan many naturally occurring vitamins minerals . increasingly , recent studies revealed flax seed help reduce serum cholesterol levels , fights cancer controls blood glucose levels . it important buy whole flax seeds then grind them : buying flax seed unground , keeps it fresh , retains all nutrients while shelf . however , it important grind flax coffee grinder before using , otherwise flax seed most likely pass through your digestive system intact , you not received benefits consuming them . it important avoid ground flax , since no matter how wholesome , fresh flax when it ground , it loses its nutrient value , turns rancid very quickly , even when purchased vacuum sealed container . essence , vacuum sealed container only useful if you use all flax soon container opened . course assumes it sealed soon it ground first place . fyi - traditionally , " golden flax " higher oil than ordinary yellow flax which traditionally higher fiber . bottom line : one several brands i consume dailythis " now golden flax " organic food supplement which enhance human health when used daily , truly excellent value .	1

first all , i never body max 1 . so , i don't way comparing this what cathe already area . secondly , i didn't entire video once because it just too damn long . i skipped step section beginning cardio blasts , then went back them later premix . however , this fun workout gets job far weights cardio . honestly , my favorite part this video warmup . i really good time step portions warm up . yet , all cardio moves fairly simple picked up pretty easily your first or second try ... especially if you know cathe " usual " moves . hard enough make advanced exercisers sweat , but easily modified those aren't there ye t.t he best part any cathe video premixes - her videos shockingly long me , but i always find mix gets me what i want amount time i want it . i definitely recommend checking this video out	1

title pretty much stands my review . when i first bought it , i thinking , " this prolly some cheap piece chinese plastic break after 5 shots . " well , plastic part right , but 120 shots later this thing still firing like like motha ! larger-er gun . not like desert eagle or anything , but reasonable size . mag doesn't fall out when you press butting , but its not impossible reach up remove mag . base line : buy it . even if you don't think you need it . resell it some kid ( like myself ) 10 bucks . or keep it use it back-up warfare	1
i bought this because i don't like doing situps much . my feet tend move around then pretty soon i am flopping around floor not really doing any good . this solves all . you just slip it bottom door your sit-ups it . then you fold it up after use it almost completely out way . it holds your feet really well , allows you sit-ups lot easier ( well sit-ups still hard ) . it lost star because when you using it , if you putting lot pressure bar ( which you shouldn't ... but if you get tired , etc ) door pulled out . if you solid door this wouldn't much issue . also when you fold it up , bolts touch door , it possibly after it awhile you could put little dents/scratches door . overall , it makes situps pleasure again	1

suitability these gloves depends what type lifting you enjoy . padding palm fingers , your entire gripping surface cushioned . such padding common bicycling gloves where hours continuous pressure vibration cause numbness pain . yet , most serious lifters would probably forgo comfort better control provided unpadded gloves . traditional weight lifting gloves made durable but supple leather prevent calluses improve grip . latter becomes critically important when perspiring . my experience , no padding best - especially when lifting heavier weight . basically , compliance padding reduces your level control . same time , there undesirable absorption energy , albeit miniscule amount . quality materials construction harbinger 1250 gloves best i seen . clearly , expense making these gloves significantly higher than other products i owned nike gold . unfortunately , generous use thick split leather padding provides insulation causes excessive heat buildup . heat comes sweat . i find myself taking these gloves off multiple times during my workout let sweat evaporate . it would nice if there perforations or large vents back mitigate this problem . while these gloves might ideal certain lifters who prefer comfort over control , i would counsel gym rats purchase other gloves less or no padding . kudos harbinger making quality product , but these gloves aren't everyone . prossuperior materialsexcellent double stitchingcomfortable wrist wrapconsexpensiveexcessive padding no perforations dissipate heat perspiration	1
i lot reading all major jogging strollers . i 50 miles week , also own babyjogger , which i also like very much . this one our vacation home , so i didn't want spend $300+ item i would only use par t-t ime . i also didn't want size b/j , which quite long too big our little beach condo . but i wasn't sure what expect cheaper jogger . i say , this wonderful item . it just light b/j -- which real help since we also carry it up down steps -- moves almost easily . built-in drop-down rain shield real help given miami frequent showers fast-changing weather . sun-bonnet huge , very important all harsh sun down here . it very ** comfortable run or walk , maneuverable enough we even use it our regular out-and-about stroller . it assembled easily folds up pretty well -- yes , you remove wheels , which pain , but not big one . fully adjustable handlebar great , esp . since my partner i half-foot different height . my only complaint they cheap-out make you pay extra $13 storage net underneath , don't even really one fit this model -- this silly omission any item aimed serious or even semi-serious runners . but all all we're very happy it , price right , it competitive baby jogger . b/j definitely faster , but not much . i would definitely recommend this model if you want high-quality jogger budget any consideration	1
i've hooked flashlights going four years this light may ultimate culmination flashlight development driven good folks candlepower forums . i've spent up $350 flashlights frankly don't what this one namely , offer insane amount brightness out such small package . three brightness levels two strobe levels easy user interface , making this little sucker work piece cake . i believe low output setting offer something like 21 hours usable light , imagine some kind disaster need really long run time . i'm writing few my impressions because i become burned out flashlights until this one came . imagine out dark forest you hear sound , you flash your light 75 yards down trail , you light up bear then you make run it . it got two strobe ( one fast , one slow ) positions both useful emergency situations where it important attract someone attention , this littls sucker it all it literally disappears into your pocket , or you use handy belt holder it comes , what bargain . case you wondering , i don't work nothing fenix other than owning two their lights	1

cyclists recognize headlights roughly placed into two categories : ( 1 ) " see " lights provide sufficient illumination actually see where you going avoid obstacles , ( 2 ) " see me " lights really only seen front . i commute hid light much brighter than this one , but i like backup light , also like flashing helmet mounted light i point any direction get attention motorists , particularly those approaching me side . princeton tec light one few led lights i've enountered truly qualifies ( albiet , barely ) " see " light . highest setting , it produces very well collimated beam just right intensity width make it suitable night riding reasonable speeds . light less suitable medium setting , unsuitable purpose lowest setting . i same gripes kent this light . ( 1 ) it should designed use aa batteries . if it made use aa batteries instead aaa batteries , light would only marginally larger heavier , but burn time would greatly extended ... enough make it suitable ultra cycling events . ( 2 ) duty cycle " flash " mode too low . light would far more visible if flash rate increased least factor two or three . those complaints aren't knock effectiveness light itself . just suggestions improvments could make great light even better	1

' bubbles ' child back therefore out way . unlike lifejacket , this not allow child just float . they need keep moving therefore actually learn swim , first " running " water then stretching out normal swim posture . once child progresses his or her skills , ' bubbles ' halved reduced until child swim without any help	1
owning 2 ripsticks kids our household not enough : my husband i also hooked ~ ~ looks like we'll need 2 more . fun , fun , fun . best smooth surface- indoor tile or concrete , not black asphault . highly recommended ages 10-100	1
i borrowed one these campout high wyoming mountains . we large group sleeping out open . i recently purchase my own because i liked it so much . trip " burrito " consisting my sleeping bag , wool fleece blanket covered small tarp . this little baby underneath . not only it provide comfort hard ground , it provided protection keeping me off running water ground when hard rain started pelt us 2-4 hours . i think convoluted water resistant design this helped . except little bit water top opening my sleeping bag , i dry , one very few our large group . most other people drenched .	1
i purchased ripstik let me tell you , best thing ride ! whenever i go down street everyone stares ask what it . they all say they want one too . best thing all riding hills ! i even go up them but when you go down its like snowboarding . i recommend this 100	1
this belt much more comfortable than those full-back styles . it seemed too skimpy hold up my large frame water , but worked great ! i got model 4 floats , but smaller adult could probably use just 3 . this very good value	1
this great product if your child learning swim , older children 5-7 age . where parents still watching them , but it gives them alittle more freedom learn strokes , needed swimming lessons . it also grow your child they learn swim , pads come off needed . i seen these also used swim classes , use them . its confidence bilder child .	1
i found it $30 cheaper site . i liked reviews here shopped around found better deal . once it arrived , it great machine . took hour or two put together , not big deal . i took it slow patient everything fit properly . quality excellent , not thin tinny parts , but solid machinery . it whisper quiet , so you enjoy television while rowing . it small when wide open , arms fold back even farther easy storage . only problem data panel -- booklet instructions some inscrutable language , so i never learned how use buttons panel . that ok , though , because it gives you elapsed time number reps , i don't really need lot more data when i'm rowing . also , data panel kind slides top machine sits your knees . if you bump it while rowing , it get loose or pop off . but overall , this excellent machine , well worth money	-1
i bought two these canopies use outdoor craft festival , after my canopy rentals fell through . purchasing two them turned out cheaper than renting , anyway , so it actually made more sense purchase . when they arrived , they came nice , wheeled carrying cases easy transportation . they went up very easily ( once i figured out mechanism , which took all 2 minutes ) remained standing throughout 6-plus hour festival . they sturdy well made , , ultimately , i highly recommend them	1
this monitor basics some advanced features . i like alarms when i go out my set training zone . logic set up different screens takes some getting used ; just keep using it it make sense . i one workout where heart rate skyrocketed didn't read quite right , otherwise it worked perfectly . i use it biking running . only reason i didn't go 150 because i already bike computer i like .	1
quality this item acceptable . it looks like it hold up well . i never actually shake it , because it gets shaken so much during delivery battery it pretty well charged up . far brightness , i would say it bright aa battery flashlight . everyone should one emergency , because it always ready go you not go looking batterys it . you light so you go looking better flashlight :) i look around auction sites found one they selling slightly better price . it make good gift because people not seen them before . they usually real happy say they put it glovebox or whatever .	1
this tv wrist watch more like wrist tv rudimentary time/date piece top . tft active matrix color ( that right , color ! ) screen measures 1.5 " diagonal . there no speaker " watch " ; instead , you listen via included special earphones . earphones special because cord also acts tv antenna , so order watch tv this thing , you must use included earphones . i got mine website called shentech dot com . ( i'm * not * affiliated them any way . ) just sixty nine bucks only ! you should know nhj went bankrupt last year , that why tv watch clearance now . what pity . it so cool ... yeah , it really cool able watch tv watch . tv runs off built-in liion rechargable battery which last over hour , probably close two hours . recharging battery takes around 90 minutes when connected ac . you also recharge battery using four aa batteries ; or you power tv using ac or four aa alkaline batteries . tv watch really comes two pieces : tv unit , ugly plastic base wrist strap attached . but nhj also includes neckstrap , very thoughtful them , watching tv your wrist get tiring . problem , reception just not good . no , you can't hook up cable or dvd this . you just live over-the-air ( ota ) broadcast signals . earphone-antenna rather weak picking up signals . it helps if you situated close tv broadcast towers or live high floors . reception also very direction-dependent , sometimes if you hold earphone cord your hand it may help . overall , reception tv quite disappointing , but works if you willing experiment different positions . tv tuner tune channels 1 64 , but due reception limitation , you proably just get few channels look acceptable . me , jerry springer channel appears best , so i watch 2 hours jerry springer my wrist every day . not bad . anyway , this absolutely coolest gadget world , price really great . just don't expect warranty repairs if yours breaks	1

when i assembling this product i discovered not only instructions vague , product pictured not appropriately match product given , but product itself sloppily manufactured . predrilled holes only half depths instructions required them order properly assemble adjust final height . my thought ... how hard it drill hole proper depth ? luckily i own tools necessary fix their mistakes , but how much money they really saving inconveniencing their customers ? i wish i could give this product higher rating , but hopefully there better alternatives	1

when i purchased pair these gloves couple years ago , i high hopes . my hands become cold easily , i looking forward wearing gloves would actively help warming them . i admit these gloves respectable normal , unheated gloves . they fairly well insulated provide moderate degree dexterity . however , heating element ineffective . inserting batteries into gloves provided little ( if any ) increase warmth . my fingers remained cold . addition , i recently discovered thin wire connecting heating element battery one gloves become disconnected . these gloves not subjected any harsh abuse , so it disappointing find wire disconnected so easily . if you looking pair heated gloves actually make difference keep your hands ( including your fingers)warm , look elsewhere	1
i recieved this gun week ago couldn't wait it arrive . it managed arrive one day early because i live close it store california . when i recieved it i couldn't figure out why i could not mount scope . it broken . next i tried read instructions which total crap because they awfully written . i started shoot it every time i wanted use larger clip i jam it into socket every time it stopped shooting , which quite often . next i my sister shoot me it 10 feet away didn't even feel it when bb hit t-shirt . plus , aftera while shooting semi-automatic started fail it would only shoot automatic . lastly , it first cqb strap fell completely off . here main good bad this gun . good : -relatively cheap-lays down lot bb short amount time . -collapsable stock nice . -relativly accuracte close rangebad : -clips either tiny or worthless because it won't stay gun . -extremely weak-accesories may come broken . -insructions awful . -low battery life . -fire settings jam/don't work p.s i'm not really jacqueline . schmidt	1

positive : -size , good surface area -chipping netnegatives : -poor instructions -very hard set up yourself . really takes 2 people , because nothing fits tight , so you try get one side , other side pops out . -nothing locks . plastic caps hold rear poles don't fit tightly . ' male ' sticks go into ' female ' section rear poles not tight , so wind rear pushes it over . i make some modifications this item make it usable . i taped some eyelets bottom rear poles attached ring caribiners . i've tape caps onto top rear poles add some tape ends front pole make it snug	1
if you search keyword ' illuminator led flashlight ' , you'll find this same item offered varies sources wildly different prices . so naturally , you should just go lowest price , right ? not so fast ... i already bought one illuminator flashlight elsewhere ( see my " customer images ' above ) , going order few more gifts . lowest price i found here ' iggfactory handhelditems ' $7.95 . but during checkout , i found out their standard shipping handling fee $8.21 just one item . flashlight itself weights only 7 oz ., but company charges 4 lb . shipping weight . what rip-off ! such inflated shipping cost , you may better off buying this item local drug stores ( such walgreen ) $15 . least there you return item easily if you're not happy it . [ update jan 21 , 2007 ]: please check out my review garrity power lite , where i made comparison betweeen it illuminator . it my opinion garrity better flashlight .	1
this gun horrible . i bought this my friend let me tell you it waste $$$ . first off it 3/4 scale gun so it very small very light , if you drop it it would deffinitly shatter . also cocking system terrible top there lever you pull if pulled wrong spot it snap off then it would useless . when we end up shooting it bbs wentd straight 5 or 10 ft then curve down , so unless you going get within five ft person it useless , even if you get close he wont even jump fps more like 270 not 370 . also clip absolute pain load first you pour all bbs into chamber , then you pull down spring shake it upsidedown fot bbs gome onto front chambet then you release spring put clip gun . after 10-15 shots you take clip out repeat process . granted it holds 180 or so bbs you only shoot 15 time . over all this gun stinks . i bought it when it originaly 100.00 but list price 10.00 so i thought it going decent , but i wrong . spend your money elsewhere !!!!!	-1

i attracted park sun pb-pro pitchback pro because large dimensions tubing hinge assembly would allow me easily fold unit place it my garage . first unit i recieved arrived box trashed netting , hing pieces , hardware missing . i promptly recieved replacement box it contained everything i needed assemble unit . unfortunately , tolerance nipples flanges tubing pieces varies considerably . after juggling pieces around pushing tugging , i ended up two pieces should fit other pieces but absolutely not fit any pieces . one vertical piece nipple too big would not fit into any flanges ; corner piece recieving flange too small recieve any vertical pieces . also , tubing made rolled steel tubing , weld not ground off interior tubing so virtually all pieces difficult fit together . packaging insufficient several pieces came paint rubbed off rust showing through due shifting contents . there rust dust plastic sleves covering tubing , particularly tube ends . nice idea , poor execution .	1

first off , let me start saying i really like my summit watch . it large ( some may go so far call it huge ) but it surprisingly lightweight my wrist , quite comfortable wear . those bad eyesight still able see easy-to-read digital readout time , barometric pressure , altitude compass . numbers quite big , so they difficult miss . altitude reading measures increments +/- 1 foot , which good you get . i like . but what i really like highgear watches i haven't seen other brands which offer similar features , visual image face watch telling you what weather conditions or . no kidding , this watch actually show you whether or not it sunny , partly cloudy , or raining . pretty dang nifty if you ask me . barometric pressure reading only small part predicting weather , however after months use , i say my little watch way more accurate than my local tv weatherman . i'd say somewhere around 75% time what my watch says exactly what conditions actually . not bad . it feature i would very much like my suunto casio models similar functions . until then , i'll rely my trusty ( much cheaper ) highgear summit . if you considering making purchase wrist watch offers digital compass , altitude barometer functions , before making specific buy , some homework wherever possible , seek out store where you actually see watches person . able guess size particular model using picture computer possibly mess up your purchase . find best price , pull model out actually try it before you buy . me , highgear summit good purchase -- however if you would rather enjoy these same functions but smaller package , try highgear axis , or possibly more stylish but much more compact ( way more expensive ) suunto observer . either way , doing little homework pay off end . happy hiking i hope this helps you your efforts buy right product . good luck	1

this nice sword $35 ( plus tax ) . when i removed sheath , there some sort goo blade ( probaby so it wouldn't rust ) . this carbon blade , so don't leave it moist closet 1 or 5,376 years(by then rusted blade alone worth fortune ) . just dont get blade wet , ok . you rub moist towel across it get rid rust protector if you're going use it often but pretty much all you clean it without special kit . please dont brandish this sword around like bad actor kung-fu movie . you could realy hurt someone point blade . i think this shipped over seas , so dont challenge your friend violent battle day after you buy this you should fine . blue dragon actualy japanese video game no one bought . i think it based part final fantasy 2 . i don't want bore you video games , so i'll get point . put it display , dont cut your lawn it , dont play ninja it , dont ever ever ever ever ever ever try cut solid object half it ( prefrebly tin ) because cheap blade could fly off tang hurt you ( or prefrebly your neibor ) face . please don't throw blade your neibor either . p.s. i am not neil meislin , i am his son , daniel meislin . if you can't understand my numerous perenthesis , i guess you're not smarter than 5th grader .	1

i've this knife their rainbow leak model few years . all i wanted thin , small light knife i got it . blade material hard enough stay sharp while , soft enough easily sharpen but not brittle like ceramic or carbon steel knife example . i vary tip break couple times but it because i doing something foolish it ( like using it throwing knife * wink wink * ;) ) . it not best , it not worst but compete ether , witch best my opinion . shortly after i bought it speed safe spring broke , eehhh who cares it opens fine without . it vary well made it take all my fat butts weight easily when laying sideways hard surface . it vary thin profile comfortable i sometimes can't tell if i it me or not . it what looks like brass or copper washers/bushings instead cheap thin steel/plastic ones ( means no binding up , even when need oil ) . frame lock far stronger than line lock best all it deforms wares much slower meaning my knife stay ridged when opened long time . my favorite thing it fact you position clip henge up or down . i chose henge down so it ready open second it comes out my pocket . if you want nice quality availability price , kershaw worth looking	1

this machine very well put together , xtremely sturdy . it took friend i two hours put it together , so prepared . while assembly bit trying , end results worth it . 40 year old man , i wanted start working out again . i hadn't worked out since my memphis state days , i didn't want join gym . i 410lb model , it all resistance i'll ever need . i said earlier , motion smooth challenging . while power rods deliver tough resistance , it not challenging free weights . example i bench press 300lbs my x2 , but free weights i only 240lb . big difference , all exercises way too . said , i still find bowflex great homegym i'm getting results i desire . i'm not trying get huge wrestler , but bowflex changing my body adding mass . don't pay attention bowflex commercials , where guys ripped bone . just won't happen bowflex machine , i'm glad they've started showcasing real people real results . average man or woman , this machine deliver . around 100 different exercises variations , you target all your muscles : legs , chest , arms , abs , back , shoulders . i'm very please 10 months i've machine . though its kinda pricey , its worth using my tax refund it . if you thinking homegym , i highly recommend this machine . you should also upgrade least 310lb rods , because leg exercises pretty easy you'll need extra rods . guys , i think you should get 410lb rods because you'll see rapid results . i've gone benching 220 300lb less than year . there cheaper machines , free weights give you much better results . but if you're looking all one machine , last years , then try xtreme2 !	1

this best air horn you buy because , unlike aerosol air horn cans , it never rust nor run out freon . i like this model this type because it smaller membrane diaphragm protected accidental tears grid cover large end . i keep one my 16 ft . runabout boat . i take one me when i'm diving . i would like see manufacturer make one half size especially scuba divers snorklers . my only complaint lanyard came off . so i drilled small hole just below lip small end inserted new lanyard . this product works great ! really loud !!!! it quite durable , but , plastic , it breakable it subject stress cracks ageing sun damage . but if you maintain it washing it occassionally keeping it out sun not knocking it around , it should last long time . if it doesn't-- so what ? $8 or so it cheap enough buy	1
ok , i got suckered reading good reviews net , over hearing trainer gym singing praises lipo6 . so despite i never found weight loss supplement actually worked , i decided i'd give it whirl . i amused previous review which says don't take it if you're already healthy weight ! well ... she then goes mention she very healthy 5'1 " 115 lbs ! but she took it ??? should red flag me . i must only one ( don't see this side effect mentioned elsewhere ) , but this made me total bear live ( ok , not word i really want describe myself , but it pg version ) . i irritable , daily headaches , saw no movement scale whatsoever ! waste money , waste time , waste quiet evenings home ruined my annoyed mood !	-1

i love this little metal bottle . it light-weight , nasty-chemical flavor free , lovely . it quite small ( what you'd expect 20 oz ) , so i'd probably get larger size next time . also , keep mind steel excellent heat conductor ; if you put hot things bottle gets just hot touch everything it soon cools . likewise , thing chilly hands if filled icy water .	1

i don't own this tent , but i owned other eureka tents past . many good tents , seams sewn together thread , but they not " sealed . " sealing means applying sort thick glue coat threads seams so water won't come through . some tents some sort seam sealer applyed factory , they say . i usually apply some my own , too . read instructions ; it tell whether seams or sealed , recommend seam sealer if not . you buy tube most sporting goods stores . ask salesperson advice applying i t.t here sometimes lot seams coated : top cover rainfly , floor , door , etc . - anything exposed outside . especially floor , cause you end up big puddle if it rains enough . sometimes you need reapply sealer after several years . if fabric , itself , starts leak , something like thompson water sealer make it waterproof again . but it also make it stiffer change color slightly . eureka makes good tents . if prepared properly , they don't leak . heck , even cheapo tents don't leak if seams sealed . only way you would get leaks if there holes fabric . then you would need patch them . if you take care tent when handling it , holes rare . but careless use lighters or cigarettes it	1
this may ' outdoorsy ' ubergeek watch . it big , it ugly , but functions make fattest swiss army knife sit corner sobbing jealousy . overall , i like it but there couple things sound better than they . timepiece : outstanding . it hh : mm :ss dd: mmm , course , year setting avoid leap year issues . this should go without saying modern digital watch . stopwatch lap function ( not i ever use lap function , but i'm sure someone interested ) . countdown timer run up 24 hour countdown ( very easy set ) . three daily alarms . special kudos alarms , this one loudest watch alarms i've heard , i've missed too many watch alarms not appreciate this . altimeter : largely eye candy , but kind neat . over four days , my bedroom went 100m above sea level 25 below sea level ( maps , 40m asl ) . not surprising because it driven barometer , i never recalibrated it , but graphic demonstration importance calibrating it when you want/need it . barometer : yup , it barometer . part i like little display shows rising/falling trend , especially this always active ( even normal ' time ' mode ) . thermometer : take watch off get accurate reading sensor too close wrist . compass : easily best ' special ' feature . accurate , precise ( enough orienteering , not surveying ) , easy use . it programmed declination , but knowing me , i'd forget reset it , so i declination hard way . sighting notches small but servicable . spirit level bubble unique among digital watch compasses suunto , greatly enhances accuracy confidence compass . outstanding wrist compass . package : big . really , really big . but controls very easy use seem fairly resistant accidental button pressing ( problem me other watches ) . battery shortish ( 12-18 month ) life , but hatch , so you don't need take it jeweller get it replaced without ruining water resistance . display large characters high contrast back ground , display light just right , readible , even , glare free , but not emergency flashlight . personally , i'm going swap resin band velcro strap , but stock strap isn't bad , just not great . overall , not watch office or suit but very good watch , compass barometer , what you could expect thermometer altimeter . well designed , thought-out , manufactured , but really big	1

heavy bag/speed bag stand good piece equipment . heavy bag part it definitely requires add'l weight ( hint : bags sand much cheaper than amount barbell plates you'll need keep this thing moving - i use 200 pounds bags sand keep it place . i able get these $2.50 piece home depot . also sure you get double end heavy bag too ( i.e. one bottom d-ring ) , otherwise you'll get too much bag swing . try get heavy bag foam liner . some cheaper bags like punching rock , which won't wonders your workout enthusiasm . you also put true double end light bag this portion unit , which nice change pace heavy bag . ( light double end bag small inflatable two bungees holding it chest level reverberates like mad when you hit it . ) it occasionally smack center support , which makes lot noise , but otherwise no ill effects . speed bag platform bit flimsy , especially earlier versions this model where " drum " or rebound board two pieces ( latest versions this model use single piece drum ) . if you become moderately proficient speed bag any amount time you'll outgrow this aspect unit . part problem single vertical pole which speedbag drum attaches flex when you get bag moving really fast , throw off your timing . use smallest size speed bag possible minimize this inertia . lastly , speed bag platform doesn't really adjust high enough people over 6'2 " height , if you're over 6'1 " or so you're going need use small or xtra small speed bag it hang correct height ( i.e. belly bag mouth/chin level ) .	1

xodus 45 degree hyperextension bench nice exercise machine mercantila , looks great , surely cheaper than similar other benches . i assembled entire machine less than 20 minutes . i would given it 5 stars otherwise , but i am not very comfortable bend angle . i would rather preferred 55 65 degrees hyperextension bench , but i guess there non like this market , i searched it internet . anyway , if you looking hyperextention machine , you trust try this machine	1

this very heavy duty , solid piece equipment . i no complaints how it works . it works fabulously , fact . but here some things you should aware before you buy ... one , it takes up quite bit space . not only frame itself , but also amount room necessary invert goes beyond " footprint " frame . so it not something you just tuck corner someplace ; it takes some room operate . two , it very heavy . note shipping weight over 80 pounds . removing table frame ackward difficult say least . you could easily strain your back removing it , which kind goes contrary benefits machine . so don't think you're just going remove table , fold frame store this under bed easily . i mean , it . but time you all , you exhausted may strained back . so plan this thing set up ready go full-time because it just way too much trouble break down storage . again , please understand i very much like this machine , thus five star rating . but these just things might not readily apparent someone shopping online i just wanted make sure you understand what you're getting . if you don't room leave this thing set up all time , it may not what you're looking	1
it great regular wide pushups , not so great close because your wrists still get some angular stress , but minor quibble . product very well made , light but solid , nice rotation very sturdy while use . i hadnt pushups well over year so this my reintroduction them . i felt my core got nice workout , too , especially obliques . i didnt realize it time but using proper form work core quite bit . it harder than normal pushup because you dip down much lower but makes it much more effective you work more muscles . 39.95 , this great investment . consider all home exercise machines thousand dollars more not effective perfect pushups . make no mistake , you still put work sweat get results but so far this exceptional . it took two weeks get mine because demand greater than supply but wait worth it . earlier you order it , sooner you get it .	1

just two road trips this case , carrying 5 pair nordic race skis 5 pair poles . longest skis 207cm , ( wheels recessed into bottom case take out some space , so 5 pair 207 wouldn't fit ) . also length case extended very close it maximum so it starts act like hinge center which unfortunate when your packing light weight nordic racing equipment needs more support . case comes one clevis pin connect two telescoping halves alignment holes doesn't allow second . i stiffened up center drilling adding second pin . our last trip i saw several these cases mine only one got munched airport conveyor belt , two out four corners caved bit but no broken equipment . wheels center handle both worked fine . bottom line : this case great typical alpine equipment . long classic racing skis , i would buy it again but it would nice see it evolve little stiffening up center connection reinforcing corners	1

i've using no-xplode 5 weeks now , it increased my performance gym noticably . mental focus you get this amazing , all i think one word : " gym " . my sister now takes it gym cardio , though that not my cup tea it her choice , i would think it fine use cardio . nitric oxide ( no ) , crucial supplement all bodybuilders/weight lifters ; widens your blood vessels accelerates blood muscles . this extremely good working out , i would also suggest taking protein your pre post workout , maybe even little when you workout . i first blue raspberry flavor after half bottle it very hard drink because taste just seemed gross . most people not like blue raspberry ( i've read lot reviews before purchasing ) . i am now taking fruit punch which my opinion 10x better tastes good . if you very sensitive cns ( central nervous system ) , i would not take this product unless you only took 1/2 - 1 scoop . i am very sensitive anabolics so i limit myself , just careful this it get you " too hyped " if you take too much . if you comfortable cup coffee or two espresso shots then i wouldn't even concerned sensitive cns . downside many people say this product makes you go restroom very badly . well , it usually make me take trip restroom , but it not extreme people say . i actually like it , clean system before i hit gym . it not like ex-lax , if you use restroom it probably within 30 minutes . i would recommend this product anyone who serious weight lifting . i would not suggest giving this anyone under 18 , but that only my opinion - it up you . rival no-xplode sizeon , i've never tried sizeon because i've never dissapointed no-xplode .. no wonder it rated #1 product year :	1

these cards awesome . we use these our poker club they great . every high end club i played uses these cards , good reason . although any brand marked or damaged , you really would work hard deface these . they also washable , so dirt , etc ., comes right off . i play least once week , 6-7 hours , we using same cards two years they seem just fresh when we got them . i tell you if you not used these cards , you might not like way feel ..... first . but then , you love them . you should keep mind there two different sizes . one poker one bridge . bridge cards smaller help you hold them all your hand . if you used poker cards , make sure you get right size , or they feel dwarfed your hand . if you play home game , these cards must . you won't buy set unless someone burns them . long run , you save not replace your decks . also , keep mind this cards glide very easily , so go easy when you start dealing until you get used them . best luck tables .	1

if you looking this light , you probably already familiar technology . basically hid top notch light . power consumption , durability , light output etc . this light made racing mountain bikes off road night . i personally use it commuting over dark snowy bicycle trails through wisconsin winter . i little reluctant part money , but i must say it worth every cent . i also vouch crash resistant mounting design ( long story . ) if you little wealthier than me and/or if you weight queen , you may interested higher end models which pair same light lighter battery technology . smaller battery technology would also better option if you intend helmet mount light . if you night biking only infrequently areas street lights , you probably get away cheap led light which generally make you visible others . but if you need light path your biking regularly , this definitely way go . it much cheaper than getting injured , you get home faster this awesome light your bicycle . one usage hint : i found little grease mount makes it easier pop light off .	1
i am very satisfied this produc t.t hese my first gloves extended finger length , which i find now big plus especially when doing wrist curls . wrist wrap works great me weak wrists . padding very good well , without it interfering normal hand fold . i read some reviews commenting how uncomfortably warm they would get when used ; i personally not felt it ; what i agree taking gloves off not easy . i found pulling fingers out first less difficult way . i actually wanted buy newer model which allows machine wash , but amazon not size stock . these minor details not demerit 5 star rating though	1
this umbrella excellent cost/benefit ratio . it big enough days heavy rain and/or two or three persons , color great because it looks diferent most umbrellas , material good also . only complain i it little loose ends so it kind easy one them out , anyway they also easy put rigth place .	1
those who new step i , don't get frustrated ! footwork may seem very fast confusing first . just keep doing it ; steps come you eventually . point you really begin enjoy all this series offer . longest three videos 55 minute running time . i'm amazed how quickly time goes ! other two run 45 35 minutes . transfirmer series features calm , polished instructors , accurate cueing , good music , correct counts , adequate warmups cool downs , weights , aerobics , upper/lower body work , abs stretching one pleasant session . there thoroughness consistancy i found missing many other exercise videos . my only complaint bulkiness transfirmer . there not much time allotted dvd move it one position next . because its size rubber stabilizing treads , you must lift it move it rather than drag it . this could helped placing handholds or holes sides units make them easier lift . once positioned , it also critical make sure two units joined properly so you don't go flying ! i'm getting quicker this , but i still miss first few reps sometimes . please note maximum effectiveness you also need purchase set 3 , 5 , 8 lb dumbells . i prefer weights longer necks many exercises require you place weights your shoulders . i've tried many most popular exercise videos . this one far best . claims true . directed , you see feel noticeable difference your muscle tone definition after first ten sessions	1
these grips ordered my wife she likes them very much . you may work them little get them .	1

i purchased this mat place under my treadmill protect floor underneath prevent any slippage . mat well constructed large enough just any treadmill . this one larger than most would need , but i thought i needed extra length ( i don't ) . it strong enough light medium use . if you especially rough this mat you could wear it or tear it fairly easily . but it what it supposed you get what you pay . i'm very satisfied it	1
i use it everyday pocket knife . very fast sharp factory so like previous person mentioned careful when opening it first time . i bought it replace my old swiss army knife everyday pocket knife . it light relatively thin so it easy just clip it your pocket you barely feel it . very sleek-looking knife although finish seems it might get scratched easily if you're not careful	1
i purchased this watch/heart rate monitor month ago since used it pretty often . it pretty neat gadget since it combines watch , calorie counter , heart rate monitor , chronometer . it also light , which makes it nice . i bought it mainly heart rate monitor feature am pretty happy it overall . it reads heart rate fairly accurately ; my only complaint you not moving very fast order get accruate reading . if you running moderate/fast pace treadmill it hard time picking up signal sometimes it displays nothing , sometimes reading unreasonably low ( i.e. 65bpm when i know i 150s or 160s ) . but if you slow down walk where you better control over how you position your fingers over sensors , you most likely get accurate reading . overall i'm happy it use it long time	1
price this very sturdy elliptical maching . i like feature which enables you lock bars into place or use bars like tradtional elliptical . computer moniter easy use efficent . wheel design allows smooth workout , many elliptical nowhere near smooth this one . don't let shipping price keep you getting this model it well worth price . also item arrived 2 days it large heavy which explains shipping cost .	1

i recently decided i wanted retire my current swiss army knife , wenger standard issue ... i thought it would cool move up knife few more functions , but still not too many . centurion regular phillips screwdriver flat awl , unlike standard which just small flat head could handle phillips screws awl without sewing eye . this knife huge ! which my main problem . i wanted knife i could carry my pocket not weigh me down , this knife too large my taste . i would needed sheath carry it i'm not utility-belt type . ( i've already got leatherman super tool , if i wanted weight my belt , i'd just wear it there . ) blade much larger my standard , living up " folding machete " claims , but locking blade locking bottle opener/screwdriver nice features . said , this nice knife . blade sharp , it very light , it felt comfortable hand . i wasn't crazy composite scales , they feel kind cheap compared alox handles my standard , so i don't know how long they would hold up over long period time . this knife more suited residing pack outdoor activities like hunting , fishing , hiking or camping .. but it just too much every day carry item . i've also read some areas blade violates concealed carry laws . conclusion , this great knife , but not really suited my purposes	1

i seen some really dumb things my 46 years but this flashlight near top list . flashlight whose power reserve lasts only 30 minutes after 15 hours spent charging . sad thing after not much more than 3 minutes flashlight down half brightness . 8 minutes after turning it light it gives out useless such you would better turning this flashlight off allowing your eyes adjust darkness least you see more than what you this lame light . i heard some wild stories but reality this flashlight me thinking people who made this monstrosity quite totally completely insane living fantasy land . this flashlight what you buy when you just want prop take up space look good because tool illuminating space it totally , utterly profoundly useless . your good money invested this flashlight instantly becomes money wasted no hope any meaningful return whatsoever . don't say we not warn you ! this flashlight should sign it says i am awesomely pathetic buy your own risk !	-1
i purchased this item based picture . i didn't want cheap looking air-hockey table because i planned keep it long time . price seemed good looks table even though shipping $150 . arranging delivery carrier bit awkward , but not too bad , but box itself clearly abused showed general lack care handling . i don't know if abuse carrier delivering it me or prior carrier , but it me worried condition contents . i couldn't see any parts through holes tears box , so i hoped best . when i opened box , there no obvious shipping damage , however there one spot surface could caused improper packaging . assembly instructions poor quality photocopy cut top line off most pages . there separate sheet paper instructing me line up letter tags during assembly , however , tags not properly placed assembly per diagram sheet would impossible . assuming all parts symmetrical worked just well . i also disappointed quality assembly main components . alignment poor , making final assembly difficult , there excessive adhesive all over place , even playing surface . i able remove most adhesive playing surface except one spot may damage shipping . table comes 90 warranty materials workmanship , but doesn't include shipping . table surface largest component , i'm imagining it would cost most $150 shipping fee it replaced . this point , i'm not willing sink any more money into this table . after table set up , i hoping it would least play well . i disappointed there too . there some plastic guards goals make scoring very difficult . i've never seen anything like them other tables . time you get puck moving fast enough evade your opponents blocking small opening your shooting , it fly off table . fact you spend more time retrieving puck than you playing . maybe this something extra adhesive down sides playing surface , but it still ruins game . there lot excited kids when table arrived . they all played one game now table sits unused . all all , this my most disappointing online purchase . i guess there some things you see first hand before you buy	-1

i wanted bike ride around unpaved trails my few acres country . this retro designed , one speed , steel framed , coaster braked , comfort bike seemed ideal choice . when it arrived , i pulled out tool box set work assembling it . first frustration instructions assembling this bike not included manual ( which seems cover every bike but this one ) . how hard could it write up instructions ( tool specifications)for each model they manufacture ? one page flyer could trick . further complicate matters , some models manual assembled using metric tools others call standard sizes . it turned out i couldn't complete assembly , because i couldn't find tool handle quick release hardware seat attachment . i take bike bike shop complete assembly . even bike shop problems this bike , because there so little clearance fenders tires . i watched while they bend sides back fender out hand , so it wouldn't rub tire . when i got bike home , first thing i adjust seat correct height , take it out ride . within 10 seconds seat slipped all way down . quick release handle can't hold seat place weight rider it ( i'm not heavy ) . chrysler should taken retro design step farther this , drilled holes seat stem rod insert adjust seat height . rather than try dis- assemble this box it up return it ... i check see if i drill seat stem myself get seat secured ridable height . its too bad they couldn't come up workable design such essential part bike seat height adjustment ! points i give here otherwise sturdy frame , tires work well unpaved trails ... when i finally ride this .	-1

" we perfected art pitching wiffle ball , baffled many batter who tried hit us . i remember 1990 young , athletic college student who , claiming played wiffle ball throughout his childhood , challenged this old geezer ucla field behind john wooden center . well , my screwball only breaking 10 feet day , after taking it strike three dozen times , he just shook his head , i concluded whatever game he playing child , it wasn't what my brother i called , " wiffle ball . " if you never owned wiffle ball , you've never really alive , my dear friend ! although they tend crack oblong cutouts after some time ( especially if you hang too many curveballs my brother who swings great authority ) , they last countless hours baseballesque bliss excellent exercise ! they used anywhere outdoors because wiffle ball weighs only two-thirds ounce , if doug never knocked one through window , neither you ! although wiffle ball light , it not follow it should taken lightly . after san francisco giant ( man , i hate giants ! ) , kevin mitchell won 1989 national league mvp award , he publicly stated he really learned hit curveball playing lot wiffle ball previous off-season . one greatest hitters all-time , san diego padre , tony gwynn used hit wiffle balls off batting tee because he could tell spin where he struck ball . play wiffle ball you're big league company ! wiffle balls offered here regulation 9 inch variety . ( surprise ! they're still made u.s.a. day production moves communist china i'll jump . ) twelve wiffle balls currently going $14.95 , that only $1.25 per ball . you any idea how much fun you wiffle ball ? well , take my word it , you'll get more than dollar twenty-five cents worth ! now all you need get regulation , old school , plastic yellow ( " banana " ) bat . course , if you really want splurge you purchase newly invented aluminum wiffle ball bat . funny story : my dear ol ' ma bought aluminum wiffle ball bat gift my brother his birthday . but she wasn't sure what size get , so she called company .

( players fly all over country ! ) we figured even our advanced age my arthritis , we could still give those young studs all they bargained more , if we polished our long-neglected technique over next year . alas , it never happened , what work , life , all other crap gets way wiffle ball play . but doesn't mean you can't fly into phoenix next year win title ! get it , man ! get yourself dozen wiffle balls , " banana " bat start practicing . hint : ball breaks direction solid half . want throw drop ? make sure solid section bottom your release point . then get inventive ; there innumerable variations theme ! you thank me hint when you see me . you'll recognize me because i'm always guy who picks up suitcase comes around airport luggage carrousel plastic yellow bat strapped across top it !	1

i am writing this review primarily let people know what expect this product , since amazon/toys us don't seem clue - even image provided thoughtful customer . i bought this in-store toys us because sizing information not available online ( except size box , some bizarre reason ) i didn't want take chance getting wrong size . so let me share information you - this helmet suitable head sizes 20.5 " 22 " . i think overall this great set , but i marked it down point because it not include elbow protection . my own experience learning skate or even snowboard , i say i would generally fall onto my knees or heels my hands , so knee pads wrist guards would perfect me . but young child who knows ?! this my neice ( i am not parent ) whilst i am generally happy set it , i think it would nice include elbow protection ( which afterall available other sets , but not appear available separately ) make complete safety package . perhaps we supposed buy extra set so we elbow pads two sets knee pads , or perhaps i am touch too cynical	-1
bowflex replacement one older models(original , schwinn)that my husband used consistently 12 years . it came one huge box , took two us half day put together . directions diagrams pretty clear . one piece broken , but they sent out new one within week it now complete . they changed power-rod holder , so we can't salvage most old ones . my husband figure out way position two 50-lb rods into new slots so he could use more resistance . it not compact older model , but it fold up somewhat . overall , he very pleased this purchase -- we paid less this one through amazon than we 1995	1

this excellent product certain needs . it unmatched ease transport ( i easily carry four them once ) . only drawback these tables limited how much weight they hold . this makes perfect sense , course . if they sturdier , they would heavier . common sense approach usage -- place heavier objects toward ends legs rather than middle hinge -- insure safety longevity product . all all , very good value	-1

this pedometer easy set up use . i tested its accuracy local highschool track walking 1/2 mile , sure enough , my pedometer read 1/2 mile . clip sturdy , i haven't any problem device falling off . leash good extra - if it fall off , it wouldn't hit ground . my doctor gave me goal 10,000 steps per day , so i wear this all day long . it light i don't notice i am wearing it throughout day . only downfall this device ( probably true others)is your stride measured walking , so when you running or doing other cardio activity ( elliptical ) it doesn't accurately measure your distance . since your stride longer during cardio activity ( running ) , device measuring your walking stride , distance measurement falls short . however , actual number steps taken still accurately measured . i suppose you could adjust setting running stride when running bridge this gap	-1

i've this knife their rainbow leak model few years . all i wanted thin , small light knife i got it . blade material hard enough stay sharp while , soft enough easily sharpen but not brittle like ceramic or carbon steel knife example . i vary tip break couple times but it because i doing something foolish it ( like using it throwing knife * wink wink * ;) ) . it not best , it not worst but compete ether , witch best my opinion . shortly after i bought it speed safe spring broke , eehhh who cares it opens fine without . it vary well made it take all my fat butts weight easily when laying sideways hard surface . it vary thin profile comfortable i sometimes can't tell if i it me or not . it what looks like brass or copper washers/bushings instead cheap thin steel/plastic ones ( means no binding up , even when need oil ) . frame lock far stronger than line lock best all it deforms wares much slower meaning my knife stay ridged when opened long time . my favorite thing it fact you position clip henge up or down . i chose henge down so it ready open second it comes out my pocket . if you want nice quality availability price , kershaw worth looking	1

i laugh people who think any final fantasy replica sword wieldable . 1)it " china " stamped one side . since really cheap things come china , this piece stainless steel . high carbon steel more expensive than stainless steel . high carbon steel obviously lot carbon which atracts moisture causes rust , pitting , corrosion . stainless steel softer because there less carbon it , thus preventing rust , pitting , corrosion . 2 ) this sword too massive wield . any skilled martial artist easily defeat someone who tries wield it . any hardwood weapon such bokken , tonfa , staff , even nunchaku break weapon . 3 ) since this sword long heavy , it really only two easy modes slashing : vertical horizontal . if someone tried attack vertically , it blocked weapon , or doged either causing sword get stuck ground or damaged . when opponent move attack . if slashing horizontally , chances it swung somewhat hard fast . opponent easilly dodged it or block attack . 4 ) even high carbon " battle ready " sword not last long if struck against sword . if hard sword hit against something equal hard or harder it break . there reason why sword never slashed against tree . sword play seen movies purely show . swords used either : rubber , plastic , or thick stage steel . samurai tried never draw their sword unless it absolutly nessacery . " die when it right die , strike when strike right . " - bushido , warrior code 5 ) if you try imitate something like swordsmanship , fighting , or anything else staged anime video games , go home rethink your life . you really dumb if you tried anything like . same movies . you learn very little martial arts movies ( stephen chow ) . if you really want learn swordsmanship , go find nearest dojo , or least find book . i gave 5 stars because sword nice replica	1

i've several " fat " swiss army knives over years , this my favorite . highlights me three things : screwdriver socket set , pliers , pull out pen . ( i also like option get this knife blue . i so used red ones i glad change ) . first , regarding screwdriver socket pieces , they pretty well made , tiny spring loaded bearing middle . this means when you plug pieces into socket they sort lock , won't drop out when you trying use them . 4 socket bits double sided ( separate driver head each side ) . they contains 3 different sizes phillips heads , 3 hex heads ( weird , but useful off chance you need them ) , 1 octagon head ( basically " blank " ) , 1 regular screwdriver head . ( keep mind knife set also contains standard screwdriver options well , so explains why only 1 socket regular screwdriver . you also get tiny screwdriver which stored within corkscrew , larger one flips out back knife ) . second , cool set pliers . they relatively thick , so actually some use , most swiss army knives don't come this feature . third , tiny pen which you separate knife entirely . i keep this knife my car , many occasions i don't pen lying around , i grab this one help me out . finally , i am quite pleased this set not contain usb drive like some other new swiss army knives . this might initially entertaining , but 6 months it going so outdated you going wish you plain old knife ! ( imagining trying give this knife your kid 10 years . dad , what this weird thing knife ? )great stocking stuffer	1

i recently ordered this watch amazon companion ltt observer wear field . while observer more updated model they both share very similiar features ease operation . my first recommendation you order this amazon.com wary same item offered " market place sellers " . time i initially placed order amazon.com out wait estimated 3 5 weeks . since item also offered seller amazon referral system i placed order wound up wrong watch ; turns out market place seller didn't carry black face model . fortunately amazon got supply shipped my watch within 24 hours .... good service . black face little hard come . now then , watch itself . first all it big ... but very light ; almost light titanium observer i . larger face makes it easier read suunto apparently gone back leather ( waterproof ) band , which i prefer . functionally , watch full blown time keeper ( non gps ) navigation system including stop watch/chronometer functions , accurate altimeter , barometer digital compass . both compass altimeter accurate i've found analog portable units . alarms sufficiently loud ( unlike only chink observer ) my only criticism back light weak compared observer , but fault doesn't draw anything away 5 star rating . add user replaceable battery ( suunto makes kit includes battery , water/dust seal new cap ) , intuitive operating system you ultimate back country time piece . suunto first offer this type time piece , my opinion , still offers best . i've used their diving computers field compasses years am fan company many products . i don't think there clunker catalog	1

i love cathe friedrich workouts . she energetic encouraging , but not too much so ( think denise austin ... i just can't take level perky ) . plus , her workouts don't pull any punches--they're designed challenge you push you challenge yourself . i regularly several other cathe friedrich workouts ( muscle endurance , pyramid upper lower body , supersets ) . i love them all variety , but i think muscle max my favorite . it 68 minutes complete workout -- upper body , lower body , core , barbell , dumbells , resistance band . you get it all . ( you don't need barbell , however . all exercises dumbells alone . ) better yet , you choose what you want . dvd comes " premixed " workouts loaded . if you don't time 68-minute full workout , you 42-minute upper body , 23-minute lower body , or 53-minute " time saver . " or you go " mix match " section choose your own specific exercises entire dvd . " mix match " section its drawbacks -- it takes while dvd switch out program , into menu , back into program , which makes this most inconvenient options . however , it great if you want match up one premixed workouts core workout , or if you just time one small group exercises ( say , triceps . ) i love this dvd . it most comprehensive flexible strength training workout i've ever , i've bunch , including many firm series . i highly recommend this one .	1
this lightest , most reliable , most commonly used computer low end market ( $15-25 range ) . you're buying what everyone else ( which both good b/c tells you many consumers who some research agree your decision ; bad because , well , you're not hip individualistic , oh well ) . this cyclocomputer great what it . installation pretty dang easy even though instructions basic best ( really , just make sure sensor close enough magnet your spokes wires turn handlebars ) . if you're market device tell you how fast you've gone how far how long , this it . only negative comment i operation not intuitive , but instructions make it clear . really , this issue common all similar devices cateye mity 8 no better or worse than others . next step up similar model also measures " cadence " ( speed which pedals turn , measured revolutions per minute . inexperienced cyclists tend ride higher gears than they should , pedaling slower cadence ; experienced riders 70rpm range ) . again , cateye way go , expected , more features means higher cost . beyond devices include heart rate monitors . this great , but there substantial extra cost " gadget " factor . separate monitor may better ( like wrist )	1

i usually love cathe workouts . i like this , but not much her others . this quite effective ( if you make it through end ) , but usually interval training , you pick up intensity lower it only pick it up again . here you pretty much going full tilt entire way . i don't really classify this interval training . said , you get great workout this . six circuits ( each three segments ) , you work balance , agility functional fitness . you need somewhat fit already order this because otherwise you find it very discouraging may quit . each segments within circuits step aerobics , floorwork standing toning . even she tell you if you don't lot space work ( cause you'll football drills ) then ' take it higher ' . so she one tough cookie , but she give you results if you this consistantly . you looking workout well over hour . but while it tough makes you sweat , i just wouldn't call it interval training . her instruction cuing good ever i think if you fit or somewhat fit already , you lot gain this . i really like it	-1

this my third heart rate monitor ; i decided upgrade model could upload workout data pc , this least expensive polar model ability . specialized versions double bicycle computers cost only little more , but i don't ride much anymore , my road bike already computer , so i decided those capabilities worth nothing me . pro : * s610i works . period . * " wearlink " chest strap more comfortable than other chest straps i used . * it comes logging training software , you upload performance data website run polar comparing friends . * it works either " sonic " or infrared connection your pc or pda . i use infared . transferring data one-hour workout takes only couple seconds , watch store many workouts uploads . * you set watch time , date , other variables pc , which much more convenient than trying program it buttons watch itself . * it easy get extra parts , so you keep heart-strap home , gym , example . * though i never competitive athlete , i find this monitor , knowledge it logs all my workouts , help me stay motivated . i work out harder more often , i feel watch looking over my shoulder , i don't want leave blank spot automatic training diary . anti : * watch software design terrible . you click buttons over over again get anything , it not always clear which button what effect . * documentation clearly not written native speaker english , many passages opaque . you end up figuring out how use features watch trial error . i failed log most my first workout entirely because bizarrely phrased directions how pause monitor . * watch garish looks silly suit . * software pc only doesn't seem export everything if you want analyze your heart rate data other software , or machine ( it export some information recorded , including heart rates , but not others , including time stamps or workout descriptions ) . * polar usb/infrared adapter , which costs extra , completely incompatible macintosh . you buy software analyze polar data mac , but you can't use this adapter move data over . instead , you need buy serial infrared adapter , usb-serial adapter , connect them together . this slower somewhat maddening . * if polar publish all apis make their drivers software open source , they wouldn't lose dime hardware sales , people who would able make much better software their monitors , running many more platforms	-1
