we just bought this our 3 year old . i not all understand why it labled 5 over !! cute game idea- but this not well put together . first i died when i saw super cheap , barely cardboard gameboard !!!!!!! it very small board , set up like 4 piece puzzle , i predict barely stay together after few plays . jewelery , subpar . crown rings ok , rest very cheap plain . but serves it purpose just fine :) . i give this low marks educational durablity . but jewlery box spinner nice durable !! if they put same effort into whole game it may worth buying . my daughter enjoy dressing up playing game together so salvaged star game .	1
i bought this gift my daughter christmas . it not work all . it sounds like cheap transistor radio when you attempt adjust knobs . i'd like my money back	-1
this bike may cute , but it tips over too easily . my daughter it 10 minutes she tipped over several times , then would not go it . i returned it store , after reading this site it obviously common problem this bike .	-1
our almost-4 year old son loves dragons one imaginext dinosaur sets , so we thought we'd really surprise him christmas this year imaginext dragon set . while i'm very happy how happy my son it ( he playing it hours ) i feeling we're going much same boat some other reviewers . pros : - interesting color scheme- good detail most pieces- re-configurable- dragon figure really neat- trap door , rotating floor other moving parts lot fun my son operate- got it sale local toys ' us 11 dollars less than listed web site . cons- directions picture-only , much too small see fine detail . - pieces not packaged together logically , so elements set all one bag . you open every bag lay pieces out order able find everything even then there some question whether you've got right part turned right way , per above comment directions . - whole thing comes tumbling down like house cards if you bump against it lightly/during casual play . i've put it back together no less than 5 times since i initially put it together this morning . some connector pieces don't fit tightly enough into sockets other pieces , so they tend just slide out instead locking together firmly . i think next year , we'll just stick legos	1
i would give this kit zero stars if i could . instructions say it takes 6-8 weeks seeds sprout . i kept them moist peat warm temperatures over three months after recommended period refrigeration . not single seed sprouted . i finally throw out whole kit when mold took over . complete waste time money . but if you're feeling lucky , you should know most seeds this kit aren't much bigger than pinheads , they all come packaged together same tiny plastic bag . so if you want each type plant growing different section plastic tray provided kit - like shown box cover - you need separate out each seed under strong magnifying glass . even then you won't successful , most these seeds look just like ground pepper . i accidentally spilled few floor , after sweeping them all up i literally couldn't tell them other debris dustpan . way , it takes minimum 6-8 years living ideal growing conditions any plants this kit reach sizes shown box cover . these not plants simply put windowsill . they need environment not easily provided average home - lots very bright light ( 15 hours day ) , lots humidity , acidic growth medium ( such sphagnum moss ) , 80 degrees . even then , these very slow-growing plants . keep humidity level high , you'll need some kind terrarium , preferably covered keep humidity level high . but if you use incandescent bulbs provide necessary level light , amount heat they produce easily raise temperature lethal levels . this reason i recommend combination fluorescent bulbs moist/dry heating pad bottom . sure whatever heating pad you use isn't type shuts off automatically after one hour use . some warnings ... these plants flourish only very limited range environments nourishment . care you would normally give houseplant - all likelihood - kill these plants : never feed them animal protein ( like hamburger ) . fats meat aren't digestible kill them . never use tap water water them . mineral build-up kill them so use distilled water only . never feed them insects killed insecticides , like raid . carnivorous plants should fed soft-bodies insects like small slugs , ants , termites , etc ., rather than hard-shelled insects such beetles . well-stocked pet stores carry dried mealworms , but even these need cut into very small pieces . just baby needs tiny mouthfuls food , so too venus flytraps . never fertilize them . these very slow-growing plants any attempt force them grow kill them .	-1
i purchased this item christmas gift . day after christmas , i helped my son assemble this product . it worked flawlessly first day . next day , i turned it show boys ' grandmother . apparently , steel ball " wheels " under " riders " don't roll very well after initial use . riders would hoisted top , but would fail slide onto one chutes . if they make it onto chute , they would sometimes fail glide all way bottom , or would fall off chute . failure rate went 0% when first used 90% after first day . i've purchased other k'nex items before never problem	-1
i should paid attention reviewer who stated this doll " piece junk " only good thing how doll dressed ! optimistic , after first purchase doll proved disappointing ( she laughs adorably ; she makes sucking noise ; she makes contented sound , which becomes ' stuck ' mechanism her back must turned off ; she not kick her legs ; she not close her eyes when rocked ) i purchased second doll this doll lessfunctional than first one . second doll cries continually . she close her eyes that it ! i returned second one kept first one because she more functional . don't waste your dollars this one	-1
this trike useless ! our 2yr . old tips over every time she tries ride it . buy something that worth money safer ! now our daughter won't go near thing , or any other trike ! i expected much better radio flyer	-1
this very fun toy . there numerous buttons sounds my children enjoyed very much . after you close phone , it rings couple seconds later , kids loved answer it pretend talk people . unfortunately two i bought quit working within short time buying them . i bought first one last year my son , it lasted week . first recording feature stopped working . then none sounds worked . new batteries didn't help , i even opened it up see if any transistors burned out or there any shorts . didn't find any problems ... it just refused work . we bought second one christmas 06 , it already quit too . we'll try stay away this brand	-1
i bought this puzzle my kid after he solved original cube . i read review here other places stating one needed cautious when turning puzzle . however , our major problem it orange stickers ( within ten minutes playing cube ) began peel back fall off . we tried using glue ( they no stick them ) put them back but it not long after green stickers began curling back falling off well . major problem these turned out not " stickers " after all , but rather colored squares vinyl adhereing additional stickers beneath ( all white ) means static . they fall off easily . this nice puzzle show ( impressive desk ) but not actual continued use . hopefully , rubik use proper stickers or adhesive future maybe even tighten up design so this used fun puzzle	1
five kids under age 9 four leapsters house , there rarely time when someone isn't playing one ( if not all ! ) them . we 10 cartridges , this most disappointing ( followed closely spiderman ) . there simply isn't enough them it . beauty leapster ability interact games , learn while they it . watching video 2 inch screen just doesn't cut it .	-1

my daughter just turned seven we got these her birthday because she loves outside . she thought they cool few days now they sitting garage . we put appropriate number strings her weight ( 56 pounds ) but she doesn't seem bounce very high . she needs help getting them . she upset because some neighbor boys made fun her due fact they so big awkward looking . i wouldn't tell someone not buy them but i wish i would gotten something else her .	1
what disappointment ! we got this my daughter because enticing tv commercials make it appear fun , moldable not messy . however , it none those very messy ! it just cross dust sand not fun play or clean up . it stays your hands child easily wipe their eyes cause problems . go play-doh or floam instead	-1
we finally bought these barbie magic rainbow dolls our 4-year-old twin daughters after hearing them beg it repeatedly after each time commercial aired . first , they very excited play them . positives : doll durable . it encourages participants follow instructions . negatives : i notice my daughters wave doll few times before dvd " hears " instructions . positives : dvd provides clear easy understand directions , so your doll programmed your remote control . negatives : doll set off our fire alarm few times before we figured out it doll ( we check see if there really fire ! ) when dvd not , dolls control volume tv ! this very annoying when volume increases just you realize your daughters started playing dolls . my suggestion : de-program doll when your kids finished playing dvd ! or , just keep it deprogrammed use your remote -taking all control away your kids keeping them standing so close tv	1
i misunderstood dimensions listed ( 7.5 1.5 10.5 inches ) thought it would large enough my mother see handle . it isn't . apparently , dimensions include packaging . she loves wheel fortune tv , i thought this game would terrific therapy her hands . very disappointing . i'll returning it , unopened .	1
my five half year old daughter asked this particular barbie doll . she so happy when she opened her present found mermaidia elina doll . she took it out box started play it . soon enough she lost interest however . wings large , so large they actually burden . placing doll inside mermaid tail not easy little hands either . all all , this doll just " make-up " if you see what i mean . pretty but not easy play , easily forgotten . she stand my daiughter room , hasn't touched or played since christmas morning ... not worth price	1
my son thomas fanatic . this lunchbox didn't last one week without one legs snapping off , so it wouldn't stand up . then few weeks later , he dropped it handle shattered . total waste money . it shame - it nice storage box front , but quality below even what i'd expect chinese sweatshop	-1

i've owned this toy few weeks given up it . first this toy little fun i optimistic getting it handle correctly . i'd adjust top screw trim it spinning clockwise or counter clockwise everything . this gets old after doing it every time after charge . next , using forward backward control doesn't work well . also , it drop out sky or something weird every now then . all all i wouldn't buy it again , especially higher price it currently going . try smaller havoc , it seems handle little better ( youtube few movies it flying ) . [ ... ]	1

i picked this up clearance , but i still think i spent too much . older versions made much sturdier material ; cards questions printed very flimsy compared original game . questions okay , but many very obscure . trivial pursuit great game it one my favorites , but this version dud . save your money if you older version ; it still lot more fun play	-1
i consider myself very tolerable patient parent when it come toys noise , however ; this phone way too loud baby/toddler . it actually startles my 15 month old makes him cry because it so loud . plus , it powered wonderful button batteries don't last . this given gift , glad i didn't spend my money it . aware this phone annoying , really serves no purpose too loud babies ears	-1
we so much fun this game . there truth or dares all sorts fun questions ! i definatly recommend this game if you party or even just few people who want good time ! totally worth buying this one	1

i've heard no complaints either one , it hit	1
while nothing beats wood blocks ( my opinon ) we these first , they fun ! we like they flexible easy little hands manipulate , not painful if they fall you ! only downside they large , storing them bag like putting together puzzle-they just fit . storing them toy box fills box wasted space ; so we stack them 4 rows beside toy box . it worth hassle if you space them don't mind stacking them up teaching your little one	1
i bought this set my 3.5 year old . we great time putting it together several occasions last couple weeks . once put together , my son imagines adventures it included soldiers . i am not very mechanically inclined but instructions excellent , well-illustrated clear , i no problem them . ( my only quibble orange sticks manual different shade color ones our set , took moment identify . ) first my son just wanted put together foam walls , but second time around he wanted help constructing walls castle . imitating me , he able make duplicate versions some simple structures rather well . he also figured out how make soldiers all himself , their arms , legs , helmets , swords shields . through doing set i also able explain you build foundation first before you put walls floors , third time we made castle , he repeating this point me ! drawbridge really fun well-done . it raises lowers very smoothly . this particular set really only designed make castle , so it not really meant making many different things like other superstruct sets . but this our first one i no regrets . assembly time 30 minutes first time , but after you it once it seems closer 15 minutes . pieces high-quality , fit very well , generally joy handle see . castle looks great once assembled , impress any adults or kids who see it	1
fly through spanish some best software fly pen available . you write word english hear spanish translation , or write spanish word hear english translation . translator also spell out translations you ( my only complaint translations spelled bit too quickly , especially if you're trying write them down ) . cartridge even comes some games help you learn spanish words . fly through spanish also comes booklet verb conjugation charts ideas games you play . i very impressed verb charts . they actually includes all tenses chart irregular verbs . fly through spanish great tool learning practicing spanish words . please keep mind this software not teach you spanish but it wondeful downright fun addition class or self-study program . i hope leapfrog releases more languages , especially french	1

unless this product undergone some major renovations , i would think twice buying it . here what i think last year model ... we got two barbie b-books our daughters christmas last year they quite disappointing . after thirty minutes failed attempts christmas morning , our girls put them away hardly played them since . toy rated 5-8 age range , but both my daughters ( ages 5 7 ) trouble them . i didn't expect world $50 , but it certainly should better than this ! display screen tiny dark gray text light gray background very hard see , you get angle exactly right . graphics choppy look like they came program designed early 80 - all blocky angular . sound system low grade fuzzy , making it extremely difficult understand barbie instructions . it impossible tell difference when she says " " " " or " " " " . since screens so small , text scrolls across rather than displayed all once . even my seven-year-old ( who great reader ) trouble keeping up scrolling text , my kindergartner , forget it ! games poorly explained too difficult this age range . even basic spelling games ridiculous because level difficulty jumps all over place . level one , i asked spell car , map , tar , then suddenly cruise caravan ! nonsense programming like this caused my daughters much frustration worse , made them doubt their own intelligence . we don't even turn b-books anymore . my girls able get little use out them when they play office , pretending they're laptop computers . all , these expensive disappointment not worth money	-1

feeling nostalgic romanticizing educational value * classic * toys , i decided buy this one my 4 yr old son christmas . same time , my sil bought him " kid k'nex roll go pal . " i dissapointed she purchased competing toy so i defiantly broke out tinker toy first . both my children quickly bored . wood pieces very stiff hard fit together , well . . . i'm not sure how describe this but , various pieces don't make any sense . it if someone took bunch different shaped objects threw them into . they don't relate together any meaningful way . i couldn't think anything interesting build neither could my kids so , we moved onto k'nex kids playing it ever since . they made some funniest things i've ever seen . much i hate admit it , there just better toys out there than this one these days	1

my 20-month-old son adores his fire engine . it extremely durable i little fear it tearing , even when our golden retriever tries get inside play , too ! i love it easily folds up very compact size i just slide behind couch next day don't leave it up all times when he not playing it like other similar products . i wanted point out this product made quality nylon , not plastic like old review states . there no toxic smell whatsoever when we took it out box or went inside it . windows openings not covered plastic either so there plenty air circulation . there two openings top , 4 or 5 windows , plus crawl door back full size door side . both just hanging nylon doors you roll up tie if you choose so they not way . " floor " fire engine also completely open so if your tot trips knocks it over , they won't trapped inside . it very lightweight so kids should take care not lean sides , just like any other ten t-t ype toy . my son enjoys pushing it around house because it so light . it also great place stashing all his toys . he loves piles up his favorite toys inside ! it holds it shape very well despite all play time it receives . i think it steal this price hours open-ended play endless potential your child grows	1
this parachute lot fun ! kids come up all kinds uses it , but our favorite game put baby underneath parachute middle just pull it up down . he gets kick out it older kids love see his reaction . this one bigger than i thought it would , which good thing , but unfortunately we actually don't enough people play it when my husband not home . if each person holds onto 2 handles it fit 5-6 people around . but if you only 3 people play , while it still works , it more fun more people . but i guess that way all games/toys should ! definitely recommend this outdoor ( or indoor lot room ) activities lots kids	1

you can't beat this set scenery . train itself beautiful , its mountain design ; bear family sweet , i love trees cave bears . mountain tunnel attractive too , although it low enough few our taller trains ( little engine could our maple landmark name train , instance ) clearance issues . my almos t-t wo-year-old son loves engine says " blue " repeatedly when he playing it . sadly , though , this " mountain " engine lacks power handle serious hills , especially reverse . we some bigger/steeper mountains , engine usually just doesn't want pull up them , even without any cars pull . our initial battery lasted few days , but now we put new one just every day . although engine lacks power i expected , i really love mountain set ; it looks really great brio mountain tunnel comes moose , we've lot fun all components . this really great starter set or addition existing set . i recommend brio mountain tunnel moose perfect addition this set , if you find tunnel	1

this become favorite game house - kids can't get enough it . they enjoy buying property such tia dalma shack or black pearl . only things i would different instead making it traditional monopoly jail , i would put port royal prison there instead policeman , perhaps put commadore norrington or gov . course free parking space should free docking or something similar . pewter pieces pretty cool well even though there no " human " characters . definately must potc fans who also enjoy board games	1

more often than not , my wife i usually end up playing games one opposed larger group people . some games we buy end up much more fun friends family , but only limited interest two players . target not one those games ... it works beautifully two people . addition , it several other fantastic advantages over many other games : - you remove " target " cards if you'd like control length game ( just take some out if you want shorter game)- you never really " out " game , even if you seem trailing- it very , very easy learn remember rules - it makes you think strategize , but not due complicated rules- it very travel-friendly , consisting just deck cardslike other reviewers here , i love game can't recommend it enough . it our " go " game whenever we half hour relax game .	1
i bought this my son 2nd birthday . i already read other reviews so i already drill ready assembly . it really wasn't bad only took 30 minutes us put together . parts aren't numbered but it really easy tell what went where because shapes pretty unique each step . my son started climbing up it before we could even get first part together played it long we would let him afterwards . i would probably get something bigger say 5 year old but toddlers this perfect . one side open but really , who lets their toddler play outside alone	1
buyer beware ! i bought this july 2004 what came newer hasbro version this ( yellow weird-looking thing ) not transparent looking mb original picture . i disappointed first , but after i started playing this newer version while , i began understand why they designed it this way . it little bigger than i'd expected or wanted , but it this size order your hands fit comfortably not cramp . also , center button start game original gone replaced small dot-like start button , which probably placed there case your fingers missed play buttons ( which would cause you screw up game you playing ) . extra 1 inch border may increase size less-than appealing way , but it makes really easy play less cramping . i still think they should've kept old translucent casing , but yellow . i love how there 3 types games 4 levels . original 1-game , 2-3 level ones offer little variety it easy master first couple levels . this one still challenge me . i've only this week now , so i don't know durability yet . it seems well-made	1
my kids each spent all last summer version 3 around their necks , responding every little bleep their tamagochis made . now one . 4 oldest can't wait get hers . version 4 some great new features . their " critters " go school get jobs adults . there new games well . don't pay more than $15 these . patient , call some stores find them stock . don't pay twice retail price	1

considering this game only $20 , it great deal . we so much fun remembering our times arcades we brought this game out small party . guests loved it so much we could barely drag them away . yes , it stick little , but reset works well . if you wear it out , it very cheap replace . you just need remember what it ... very cheap version old arcade games . it won't like nintendo or x-box ! if you treat it well , it last . remember turn off power switch or it eat your batteries . i use rechargeables it even though it says not too it seems work fine . best feature it plugs into front most new tv , so no pulling out tv every time you want plug or unplug it . no messing 3 million cords most us seem behind tv nowadays ! those us who adults now most time , it just stored out site drawer or coffee table when you want look neat tidy . no game cartridges lose or trip over . how could you not just love it ?	1

i can't even begin explain how wonderful this toy . our 3 year old son completely entertained hours . this sand really mold like clay , but it breaks apart like sand so you reuse it over over . here some recommendations get your money worth out it : 1 . supervise your child while playing this . it great toy enjoy together your children . any parent knows young children left sand , dirt , or any type messy item make great big mess . this no reflection product ; it just what kids like . 2 . put it clean table surface play it . it helps ensure you scoop any sand somehow makes it outiside inflatable walls right back . 3 . buy additional sand packs ensure you plenty sand . while it come enough sand fill all molds , it wouldn't hurt little bit more . all all , i would highly recommend this toy , but only if you don't mind supervising your child while he/she playing it . i can't rave enough this toy	1

we just purchased this book our 4 year old son go his new leap pad writing microphone system . we wanted our son start learning write all his letters this book very great way him practice his letters . he really likes trace his letters then practice doing some his own . this one largest books i ever gotten , its over 50 pages ! it page each letter upper case lower case . well their 3 letter words learn spell sound out trace over . there games each page even some mazes play front book . my son loves new leap pad system really likes this book . we going also get other writing book pre-k . one starter books we got it page pre-k book writing letters talk make funny sounds . my little boy laughs giggles each time he traces letters . they letters don't really this book , so took little fun out it , but each time you trace letter it play cute little song or sound say good job if you traced it right way . i highly recommend it we very pleased book . it says ages 5 up , but my son 4 no trouble lettering , pre-k even easier but what i gather only upper case letters . main reason we purchased this book because i wanted both upper lower case letters him practice . next year when he starts school he able write his name address well he able write quite few 3 letter words he learned this book . leap frog products all wonderful , this book helped my son learning write ! money well spent this book ! all work books things i previously bought get my child learn write his letters , this book really was'nt too costly . if you thinking purchasing this leap pad book- you'll happy you purchased it once you see your child mastering writing skills little few hours	1

good collectables , not so good actual toys you play . my daugter broken hook off mater ( bought her new one ) , broken wheel off dynaco mcqueen , broken front axle off tractor . mater tow equipment made softer cheaper plastic than rest toy , i expect new one break any day now . without too sexist , i want point out my 4 year old daughter probably more gentle them than average boy playing them . they never entered sandbox . they not stood , nor thrown , nor monster-trucked bicycle . while i still probably buy more , my daughter loves cars movie wants own them all , ( including frank , which they not make ) i would say all : buyer beware	1
reason why i say it better than step2 deluxe kitchen which we prior this kitchen step2 uses molded plastic which takes away alot space inside make it structurally strong , nothing wrong it glad see our recycled plastic get good use , but wood you get alot more space storing cooking/food accessories same volume . assembly took me 1/2 hour , 10 mins just take out all pieces , unwrapped them placed out floor . if you cordless drill/screwdriver allen or torx bit it save you alot time . i set my torque my drill minimum that all force it needs screw it tightly . careful long bolts , they fairly thin bend very easily . plastic window oven door came broken during shipping lower corner door paint also chipped . i tried call kidkraft phone nearly impossible get anyone you leave voicemail someone call you back ( 3 hrs now no callback ) . i tried their website instead order replacement part which so much easier . bottom line though my 4 1 1/2 yrs old girls love it . my wife saying step2 kitchen sounds working light , just she said my older one made her own sound affects playing microwave buttons . i told her electronic stuff just novelty kids they lose interest it better their imagination anyways without batteries	1

tuesday , i local walmart saw full display new transformers classic line . they bunch both deluxe class ( $9.99 figures include rodimus , starscream , bumblebee astrotrain ) voyager class ( $19.99 figures optimus prime megatron)on saturday night , i bought last 2 deluxe figures they . what i've heard , these figures flying off shelves everywhere . my viewpoint , it good reason . they've brought us classic characters reasonable price all figures i seen so far very well . starscream no exception . if you've only seen this one shelf , it doesn't it true justice . jet mode ( which how it packaged ) okay , but some coloring it bit different what classic transformers fan would used . red blues bit mixed up , but it close enough . robot mode what really makes this figure shine . one look i feeling more than little nostalgic . lot ways . this figure looks much more like cartoon comic character than any figure ever before . poseability very good , only thing it lacks ability bend knees but compare it 1984 version it head shoulders above . transformation also pretty smooth once you get used it . finally , one really nice thing there aren't lot parts lose this one , again especially compared 1984 version . now if you're not old transformers fan , just want cool toy buy your kids , it fits role well , also . fact , it displays very nicely alongside jets cybertron series . plus , i always thought fighter jets made some nicest transformers molds . i've reviewed some other transformers classics line if you'd like take look	1
my inlaws purchased this game , last several times we went down visit them , they kept asking if we wanted play . until last weekend , my answer always " no thanks " . what mistake . i am not dominoes player ( fact i never played ) , but this game became my one my favorites . talk fun , frustrating game . one one tile left ( ok , i called them " chips " ) bam , someone plays wild card , hits button , you sometimes get stuck picking up more tiles than you started game . maybe this typical dominoes , but i can't help believe introduction single , double triple wildfire tiles doesn't add lot excitement game . only thing somewhat annoying honking fire engine after siren when someone hits button ... unless you're one doing it !	1

we played this game all thanksgiving weekend , really enjoyed it . you roll collection dozen or so dice out table , players combine pictures they see dice form words or short phrases . more creative you allow people what pictures represent , more fun it . fast play mode , you snatch up dice you form phrases , slow play , you study dice write down many combinations possible before time up . it actually hurts your mind you study pictures try quickly spot combinations like : " treehouse " " playtime " " car-pet " " laughing gas " " cross-dress " or " long-winded " . i found it great creative exercise may even use it next time i need get group into " brain-storm " mode . my only beef game once you played it number times you strong advantage because you quickly recognize pictures you pre-formed ideas what combinations might come up . example , grave stone cross pink dress kept coming up , people who played previous round would immediately grab them " cross-dress " . this didn't happen often enough hinder game play , however more dice would nice	1

like its cousin , trouble , game sorry quite simple design . reality , however , it both entertaining surprisingly educational board game . it now comes packaged convenient library case . this makes storage easier , it also makes it easier kids get games out shelf without parent helping . ( why it take so long someone think this ? )the simple rules : up 4 players each begin 4 tokens " start " area . players take turns drawing deck cards moving pieces indicated , trying first get all pieces " home " space . cards offer some nice twists beyond simply moving forward : 1 = move 1 space forward or move piece out start2 = move 2 spaces forward or move piece out start , draw again4 = move backward 4 spaces ( occasionally advantage)5 , 8 , 12 = move forward number spaces7 = move 1 or 2 pieces total 7 spaces forward10 = move forward 10 or backward 111 = move forward 11 or switch one your pieces opponents piece " sorry " = take piece your start replace piece your opponent , send them back start . sure say " sorry ! " way makes it clear you really aren't . that pretty much it . game simple enough most kids who count recognize numbers grasp basics . little parental coaching , younger siblings play near-equal footing their older brothers sisters ( note - older sibs not think this fair ) . however , fun ( teaching ) comes all choices . should player use all 1 2 get all 4 pieces out board , or should he focus getting one piece time safety ? should player switch places opponent piece help herself , even if helps her opponent too ? how should he split up 7 ? working through these possibilities challenge younger players , but worthwhile one . probably biggest lessons sorry teaches , though , sportsmanship , ability dealt setbacks , idea not giving up when things aren't going well ( sorry ultimate " it not over it over " game ) . piece near finish get suddendly sent back start temporarily devastating young child . don't expect them take it well first time it happens . here , parents teach best way deal disappointment their own good example . kids who learn these lessons age 6 board game less likely melt down age 7 soccer or t-ball field . all these reasons , sorry great family game . it fun , but it also educational without ever feeling like lesson . 5 stars .	1

this game put together nice concept , ctu agent help jack bauer stop terrorist attack . also , i liked fact there mole someone right next you could destroy whole game . however , interactive games such used get more clues not made well . though you try what it tells you , it doesn't seem work . since these interactive parts so simple , yet not made way one control what going , you waste your time trying them you never get end . i three college students two adults try it adn no one could seem get it work correctly . so , if some bugs worked out , this game could much bigger success	-1

carcassonne excellent game not only simple fun play , but chock full strategy planning . game great family friends , simple enough teach kids . it takes hour play , so it good after dinner game , or whenever you don't multiple hours play . said , game fun diverse enough play several games back back when you several hours hand . simple game appears , there lot strategy get involved placement your meeples . you spend game trying look like you're working your own territory , hoping other players don't notice you trying rob them their end-game points . there bit luck comes into play , it wreck your genius strategy , but that fun game . i highly recommend this game any board gamer , anyone thinking playing board games , or any gamer trying recruit friends family into joys non-electronic games	1

i currently own three these lightsabers master replicas : anakin skywalker ( blue ) blade , darth vader ( red ) blade , mace windu ( purple ) blade . more information anakin model or vader model , please check my comparisons those products darth vader fx lightsaber reviews . i loved these replicas so much one just couldn't enough ..... but because they cost average $70.00 $120.00 each , i budget myself purchase them individually over three month span . first good points : first thing i noticed saber proper weight make it feel like real thing well-detailed silver gold highlights . i loved fact it doesn't huge , bulbous on/off switch right middle hilt you others . switch would actually difficult find if i didn't yellow decal pasted it saying on/off . you must continue careful it , however , because you still accidentally turn it off while using it ( very annoying ) . now bad : bad things mace windu model requires 6 aa batteries ( others only take 3 ) . saber ignites cool snap-hiss but all sound effects identical blue anakin model ( least vader model different sound effects than others ) . i also noticed blue anakin sabers ' sounds much crisper/clearer than mace windu purple blade . brings me good point : purple blade itself not distinctive others . even low light it looks more white than purple . you hold blue blade right next purple blade really see noticable difference . could each them vary ? it possible ..... but my own saber purple color little disappointing : bright ? yes . purple ? sorta . all all , if i known all this before i made purchase i'm not sure if i would bought it ( maybe green luke skywalker model instead ) . maybe this why mace windu model cheaper than all rest ? who knows . i give this one 4 out 5 stars	-1

i really liked this item but thought i'd point out few things might make this iffy . it took me two hours assemble but because i my helpers me . i pretty much figured out instructions this item two exceptions : how double hinges went because drawing wasn't clear , fact several instances , " " screws instructions assigned not long enough . this problem silver overhead bar -- i ended up using some my own longer screws because top part wobbly using longest screws given kitchen . i liked fact this not pink still lots options playing despite it small size ; it great our local library where space premium . one other thing i noted one towel bars below overhang island ; kind weird , non-accessible place so it must just looks . plexi-glass oven door cracked broken right out box so it exchanged second one , too . if some kids breaks it throwing or hitting it right object , plexiglass sharp . if you're really concerned , you could probably remove glass right away	-1

this car pictured could base or first version defintely not worth 299.00 these going 100.00 less web . if you havent noticed differences packaging it wouldnt suprise me . lots people dont notice . heres differences below ... these 5 cars there two versions each driver(5 different drivers ) made . first versions or base version second versions or " added features " version . first versions no " added features " stickers you cannot race any two ( or more ) cars 5 different drivers ' cars same time ! dale sr. dale jr. , jeff gordon , jimmie johnson tony stewart cars first versions ( no added features ) cannot race together ! transmitter frequencys cannot changed . speed steering straight function . ( no varilable anything ) they either turn right full turn or left full turn or it goes straight . speed either it goes full or it doesnt . same reverse gear . again , each 5 different drivers ' cars made two different versions same car one more features than other . updated or " added features " versions " added features " stickers . those " added features " ... digital proportional steering ( variable steering ) , which means you turn transmitter wheel slightly car turns little . turn transmitter wheel alot car turns alot . variable speed control this means you pull back trigger little car moves little , pull back trigger all way car takes off ! this also works reverse gears well now if this isnt cool enough ... each " added features " car different frequencies different drivers ' car . transmitters cars different well . " added features " version transmitter two " trim " adjustments back remote well frequency chip side remote than changed , also changed chassis car . so if you own 2 tony stewart cars , you would frequency pack race them same time . now , two or more different drivers ' cars race together ( or five people race 5 different cars ) . no two alike cars race together unless you " frequency car transmitter " change it , or " frequency pack " team up inc . all 5 frequency chips not come car box , off shelf . this " frequency pack " sold seperately ! you also purchase tires , suspension parts body hold down clips , fully painted ready use new spare or other drivers ' teams bodies , extra rechargeable battery packs seperately ! i lots research these cars should you any questions please ask...nascarnbroncosfans@msn.co	-1

this game truly fun ! it sort " i-spy " type game competitive twist . three cards turned everyone must find corresponding images board , fast . game board made up several inter-locking pieces , which re-shuffled make it hard anyone memorize game board . game last 30 seconds , or go one forever if everyone likes it . younger kids may take longer than older ones find images , but even young ones great time . my children 5 7 both enjoy game tremendously	1
my son 2 1/2 loves this toy . he it quite awhile , still laughs until he silly everytime balls start flying everywhere . only downfall toy ball ramp tends come off alot , my son can't get it back himself . also , it only comes 5 balls , so i ordered more [ ... ] . 5 balls bag $[ ... ]	1
i like idea back pack matches leap pad . only thing i think missing more slots small game cartridges . very durable easy carry	1
i own these toys , i lot fun them . i like sneak around house listen conversations , look around binocs , use light beam sensor stay alert if my sister enters my base . binocs pretty good you adjust them so whatever your looking won't blury . light binocs turned inside binocs or they pop out more distance . batteries last fairly long , don't run out too fas t.t he spy listener thing glasses works well , you even hear people wisper . if you twist end spy listener thing while it clicked back module it pop out cool gesture into what it looks like picture provided amazon time . setback it it us very small , expensive batteries . i left mine it lost all battery power i haven't chance ask my dad get some new ones yet . overall it good device . spy light beam sensor sends out invisible beam if broken sounds alarm . you pull front out or push it sensitivity or range you want . device not work well if layed ground . therefore , you should put it something foot or two above ground . range it not very far because mine it only went 2-3 feet but maybe thats because i use it lot . i give this set 5 stars fun because i lot fun playing spy my friends . i give it 3 stars eductional value because you use your imagination . i give it 4 stars durability because all these taken big falls while playing them when i spy halloween . i give it 4 stars overall because thats what it averages out	-1

i excited try these out , what i'd heard they best . i read other reviews saying installation difficult , however our only problem because our cupboards little silicon bumper pad corner , foam sticky installation guide wasn't thick enought hit cupboard ... we just doubled two them up it fine . function these locks ... they awesome ! traditional cabinet locks allow you open them finger width order push down plastic piece open them all way ... tot lok you can't open cupboard even little bit , which eliminates any finger smashing your little one . admittedly , it hard habit get into , using key every time ... however i soon got hang remembering grab it , i also make great use " permanent unlock " bar , which you flip keep cabinet unlocked if you like . this way , if i am cleaning up need throw paper towels , old toast , leftovers , etc into garbage under sink , i just keep cupboard unlocked while i'm doing my thing . these loks completely invisible outside , not bad looking inside . hardest part introducing our new cherry cabinets drill bit ! i would buy these again again recommend them all parents	1

i love this puzzle game but i think recommended age incorrect . my two-year-old daughter already mastered this game less than 30 mins now puzzle sitting underneath all her children books .	-1
my son only 4 half . course he needs lot help build this toy , but we enjoy doing it together . this particular model took me almost 90 minutes build . when it finished it strong enough play it young kid easily put it back together if limb falls apart . i think it very original entertaining both us	1
i am second grade i just got this game hannukah . it great because you learn science , arts , geography , math , etc . it really fun play . it fun use buzzers against your opponent . you play 2 people or teams or just yourself . it fun act things out your opponent push buzzer when you acting . some questions really easy some really hard	1

out son got this santa when he 15 months still plays it almost every day age 4 . it just right size speed drive around indoors . it one his top five toys	1
overall i'm very happy purchase this rc car . optional nicad battery , this car really moves . ( i highly recommend battery pack , even over nickel metal hydride aa batteries because car really 30% faster advertised . battery pack really 8aa batteries , but car only takes 6aa when you don't use pack ) . only draw back transmitter little weak , so it range somewhat limited . 50 feet away or so , you'll lose function . however , car very quick so far very rugged well . i've jumped flipped it many times it still drives great . only $30 both car battery pack , i'd buy it again ... fact i . i decided i better backup car since like my old turbo hoppers i usually break them eventually driving them through puddle water .	-1
i thought developmental toys rip-off before we bought this toy ( his name our house barkley ) . our daughter loves this dog coo smile him hours !	1

bear big blue house always favorite our house . this first leappad book we bought my son leap frog he spent many happy play hours it . he already knows story memory enjoys playing very simple games tutter mouse over over again . recommended any bear fan	1
i loved disk 1 ,, it great , i love concept , screen scoring , old new mix movies ( all us knew something , our 10 yr old , 14 , 16 , 19 yr old us ) i get game two , got it cheap , so excited ... we just played it , least half , seemed like more , same movies represented first disk . questions different , scenes different , but once you go through same answers , it more just trying remember what last disk answers ... i sooo dissappointed .... seems though company only got rights few select movies ,,, rearrange questions come up same answers ... too bad .. i hooked .	-1
my son just turned 3 he huge thomas fan . it very thomas birthday he got this set my aunt . previous reviewer mentioned , this not very interactive toy . my son turns it loves watching thomas race around tracks . he loves making thomas stop tower more water pumping it . sounds steam his favorite part . i found instructions lacking , though . pictures aren't very clear text convoluted . i'm reasonably intelligent woman i got very frustrated trying put batteries understand how whole thing worked . pump-action didn't work very well first , but after few false starts we got it filling up thomas wonderfully ( quite few spills , though , because hole so small ) . i give set four stars because my son enjoys watching it . he doesn't really " play " it same way he lego set wooden train sets - it not designed . if you're looking something use your child imagination - go either those sets instead . i'm probably going set this one up under our christmas tree this year	-1
i bought whole set geo trax my sons 3rd birthday , he hasn't stopped playing it since . he gets this out every single day plays it . very durable toys . i highly recommend this toy . must . my son loves put tracks together , it easy him . my 2 year old daughter even loves play it . now they out mile high sets , my husband said we get him too . this definate toy buy ......... it lets kids use their own imagination time time again	1

we own all 4 shout movies games we just purchased first shout tv game . all games blast well worth price $19.99 . right now they buy one get one free it would well worth it picking up any you don't . they great family fun less then cost movie out , they wonderful entertainment . besides you learn some trivia way . last rating stated they no reply value , however if you put them up while after playing all 3 games you forget they then played again . they great parties well family game night ! we also 4 different scene it games , they really fun also , but we like shout games better . we family 5 everyone able answer some questions . my 11 year old really well , even though game rated oulder age	1
my son recieved older version this game 7 years ago his second birthday . it one toy he kept playing over over again . mix it up little he'd race his other hotwheels his brother . some cars didn't work very well , some went faster than original cars which added fun . i am buying it little boy hoping he'll enjoy it much my two boys .	-1
bout this rc helicopter , it great gags stuff . really can't keep one spot very long , so i wouldn't say this heli hover . not inless you mod it some here their , but mostly won't beable move much . havoc more new start helicopter . why ? well it gose up down , you omost full control , sup you can't front or backs movement , least here their you ' ' keep it steady hover sometime . if your very good it . sure all helicopter fans stuff , it brake rotors stuff . but it called ' new ' . so it you're first time flying chopper . i would say buy havoc first , before moving reflex or any other chopper . again . every flying chopper or helicopter.is not little kids . let your mom or dad get use flying it before you let 5yearold play any chopper or helicopter , you putting you're $$ toy line when you send it you're little kids . i would say age 12+ flying these or any chopper/helicopter or adult	1
we purchased this our 10 year-old he loves it . he most thrilled see it really run bathtub . i think he would only happier if it came remote control so he could steer it	1

things i don't care bubble solution spills out when my daughter picks it up back handle . i wouldn't mind too much if i used this outside but we it indoors . also , intercom isn't easy play . when she pulls it cord stretch only few inches then pop back into place . maybe i just don't know how fix . overall i love this toy am very glad we bought this our kid . she plays it every day whether it sitting it or opening seat using it storage place . when she opened it up her birthday party several other kids rode it they ages 2-4 .	1

my granddaughter ( 24 mos ) absolutely loves this toy !! it pretty heavy , so we place it location where she could sit right down floor play it , but it one few toys holds her attention . it fun watching her figure out how open close various locks ; then drop figures through openings . i'm going order one my 24 month old " grand " niece !!	1
there plenty good reasons why ultra-pro recognized one safest best pagemakers sport fantasy card business . their pages pvc-free , which means there no oils pages eat away your collection . also , pages very sturdy handle your collection quite well . one note , however , i wouldn't put more than two cards per sleeve . fact , i'd only put more than one card sleeve if you're concerned space . one card per page best . i personally purchase hardboxes keep my doubles . overall , one , if not best , card page you purchase . fits all standard sized sports cards bulk fantasy card games lot kids enjoy these days . highly recommended	-1
we purchased this almost 2 years ago when my daughter 4 . it very durable , folds unfolds easily - it dragged all around house retained it shape nicely . it light weght so my daughter move it around set it back up herself . 6 years old , it still gets used but i think it close it end use . now she prefers make forts sheets but requires mom help so this still works when mom isn't available . our only complaint it bit small . even four , her friend could just sit it . it doesn't fit two kids bunch dolls - which what she really wanted why forts chairs sheets won out . but it used lot ' snack room ' . it used lot i would recommend it but if you find something similar slightly larger , i would say purchased instead	-1
my five year old thrilled his new lunch box . there plenty room pack balanced lunch , we really like canteen pop-up straw . perfect kindergarten set	1
this toy awesome 15 minuets ! however i think age specification this toy way wrong . this toy more collectors or " big " boys ! you know " look but not touch type " toy ! my son received this his 5th birthday he " loves " all his trucks very careful construction toys ! boom or arm excavator broke after 20 minutes play time it no longer lift anything ! rubber tracks fall off very easy well ! we taken toy apart it little plastic toothed disc moves arm ( plastic gear i guess ) , well it shattered . box not come parts list or place where get replacement parts . now i sad 5 year old who cannot play this huge costly toy ! very dissapointed even though " real " cat equipment durable , this " cat " not !	-1

i love this game years . so many words make such variety who you play against what letters might come up , it always different game every time you play it . only drawback noise when shaking up letters their box . i would like see version wasn't so irritating respect . tip , if noise bothers you you play game lot so it worth effort , put some thin felt strips box top ( kind self-adhesive backing ) so when you shake it , it makes less noise .	-1
okay i 2 these sets they very , very cute ! what i really like there magnet platform inside exercise wheel hamster actually stick ! why they don't put magnets into more littlest pet shop playsets i just don't know . they put little magnet inside every little pet ! so why not include them playsets well ? i just can't figure out . oh well ! this set one it very cute . you make your hamster use exercise wheel he sticks platform . cool	1

i bought aquarium cars because * i * really liked them . my son likes them too but its difficult tell which way they supposed face . my son 18 mos old gets frustrated when magnets not aligned properly they repel one rather than attract . he gets mad throws them when this happens so i attest their durability ! they few nicks but thats it	-1
this all kinds fun children ( young 4 ) adults alike ! it simple requires no reading but not boring adults . it deserves award it received	1
my 4 yr old daughter received this christmas . end day , dolphin section chariot pieces all over living room- it not stay rest it just got annoying try keep it together . however , she loves carriage part fun putting ariel her barbie friends seat . aware ariel doll sold separately- make sure child who getting chariot already one , or you should get her one chariot . it would probably no fun without ariel doll put it .	-1
wanting your child learn math equations acurately , this not toy them . adding two numbers such 8 + 8 , should equal 16 , correct ? no , not this computer . you must first type 6 then 1 , backwards . i don't feel if child should learn math this manner . real sense , this should 61 not 16 . two digit numbers should entered way they suppose ! problem i dislike this laptop screen so small . i've also problem game : " next trend " when making mistake two digit number sequence computer pop up correct answer screen but say answer backwards . i find math games very frustrating	-1
this toy allows u see dark red led shines where u want it go its just really cool i dont noe how other person said it sucke	1
this definitely great product . my 2 1/2 year old daughter really seems enjoy it , especially little toaster ( toast ) tea set two . unfortunately , our food processor juicer combo appliance arrived defective . we tried different batteries thinking we purchased bad ones , but didn't seem case . i thought it little pointless 2 water pitchers , 2 scales 3 milk cartons when manufacturer could included purhaps something more practical like pot , skillet or pan . i also thought toy milk , water , butter flour boxes bit small side . i wouldn't expect them normal size toy kitchen but these items much smaller than even toy fruit . even though my comments critical , i think this fun , well made , creative product . i no regrets selecting it	-1
i like play legos . this looks like good deal only $9 . i see one problem this item . title says there 500pc description says there 200pc . so how many you get ?	1

i cannot understand why others found this toy so good , i don't . i live south fl , area where my indoor stereo picks up radio signals very well , but when i take this aqua radio outside , it almost impossible pick up station , once radio pool -- forget it ! volume above-water speaker minimal , apart sound so distorted we cannot hear thing . lucky me , i bought this discounted price under $6 , so it no huge loss trash it , which i already -- it not worth hassle cost send it back	-1
i old edition this wonderful game wanted get one my son his children . quality pieces really deteriorated since i got our original one many years ago . pieces very light weight . it unfortunate , but i think that just sign times	-1
this wonderful toy . it very easy play extremely durable . a++++	1
awesome . i've never owned version megatron even though my allegance always decepticons since i've intrest series . beggining my favorite starscream , i decided it time own version strongest spark found cybertron . i never liked his lugar versions first consepts , always thought it just stupid he could just change size when he became robot show . this year megatron one best transformers ive got , my favorite version him yet [ including his galvatron " tank " alter-ego , t-rex beast forms ] he transforms gun again , but this time its big chunky blaster scope instead lugar originally . this allows much better look robot form , good movement well placed joints , which often biggest problem transformers . it surprized me how evened out his robot form compared how contorted it form his gun mode . only unsymmetrical point his gun giant scope doubles giant blaster him robot form , it built into him so he all one very nice complex piece . sides gun become his wings , which little too heavy him stand striaght up , my only problem it . if your one who likes figure them out without instructions first [ like me ] it easy form him robot after little thought , then i clueless how get him back gun mode [ peek instructions ] . all i say his robot form much cooler but his gun mode feels little more useful second toy then other cars jets , collector or just getting into series , this definitly one you'll enjoy	1
we got this our son his second birthday . he loved it but we problems right away it didn't recognize when it dump truck or fire engine like it suppose would just go off no reason . course we awful time trying sneak it away our son . we went store get one they didn't work either . buy your own risk	-1

i hoped get this home sodor fire crew engines i already owned . it pretty good destination it came adapter you use rails or road . reason why i give this destination 4 stars instead 5 because fire truck slow come out garage times , you may want glue fire truck hose roof pieces so they not get lost ( i ) . despite this , i think it pretty good destination , it would make good addition your collection	-1
i just bought this my tea-party loving daughter . it perfect . yes , tea bags small but they perfectly sized child tea party . anything bigger would not fit into child tea cup/tea set . it sized scale . i would not buy adult size tea set my daughter ; therefore , i would not but adult size tea bags . we love them . perfect tea party dollie teddy	1

my oldest mr potato head when toy story came out . course cardboard box didn't last long pieces scattered lost but this set container plastic it easier keep pieces together hold their attention longer . it now played child # 3 , so i would say it definitely worth money . my only complaint would container could little bigger allow little hands put accessories away easier . but all all , it great toy	1
i bought this game play my 5 , 7 9 year old nephews . it easy them learn understand . they didn't tire playing it kept asking play game . best all , 7 year old just much chance winning adults . i bit disappointed quality cards , graphics began rub off around edges after only one day play	-1

this cute bubble machine . but honestly it isn't most well made toy all . handle becomes defective stays down . solution leaks bottom you don't get much bubbles coming out product	-1
i tried all " plug-n-play " handhelds -this one best . it very tough get money tournaments . i like programming because players more aggressive(they usually semi-loose semi-tight ) . i prefer play against aggressive opponents because it forces you make tougher decisions . if you really into graphics more than game you may find it substandard . even its few flaws youll find this game highly addictive entertaining .	1
this item works perfectly night light , probably one coolest night light out there . it perfect kids afraid dark . it left any phase moon , which helps control amount light emitted . it also set automatically change phases every five seconds . course , it also learning device , showing various phases moon up close comes cd , which we haven't listened yet . i like automatic shut off feature , so it doesn't matter if it left , which handy night . my first thought it appeared cheap could slightly more realistic , so 4 stars .	-1
this fun because one player gets host . if you know game well , you play just like tv show .	-1
we bought this my four year old christmas . there ton games choose . some games little hard him , but we help him he still loves it . it makes all sorts noise when you start it up sides slide out - it really cool little toy . i would highly recommend this toy any batman lover	1

if you serious playing cards you get these cards . there nothing else like them available . they extremely durable should last years home setting . they just like cards used wsop wpt . you won't regret buying these	1
this cutest top i've ever seen . it makes realistic train sounds train crossing gate lifts train pass . i given this toy several different children gift . it loud , therefore , bit scary very young child ( six months ) , but it very appropriate older baby or toddler . parent course pumping , but two or three year old should able it their own .	1
girls love all versions bratz . mom , i think bratz dolls look too mature their presumed ages . makeup way over top their clothing only compare " ladies night " . babyz underware only described thongs . however , finally kidz version improved upon . makeup still strong , but more acceptable . clothing closer what kid would wear overall look more innocent than other bratz dolls . if you've also found bratz dolls objectionable ( even though i still buy them ) , kidz version much more acceptable my 7 y.o. daughter seems like these better than any other version .	1
this home run leap frog . my three year old loves this game . he even plays it buy himself . he knows characters well other leap frog products so he comfortable it right away . it great teaching product i really think it would asset your collection . one thing i disappointed quality packaging . board ripped half it not store neatly . other than i give it a+	-1

my son wanted this toy himself ... he just turned 7 . i felt he too old it but let him get it anyways . i right , he lost interest it after just couple days . luckily , my 2 year old niece loves it ! it first toy she goes when she comes visit every day . it great imaginary play sounds , while pretty realistic	-1
i got this train my 8 yr old . it originally xmas present but came too late . her initial reaction quot ; this all ? quot ; , but after they started playing i t-t hey played hours ! it suck battery juice but it run auto well . it also doesn't corner well , it gets hung up . but we not any problems it not climbing hills amp ; even gotten it pull up 8 cars . money , i thought it well worth it	1
my son 6 years old i set it up him it worked great !!!! he kept it up 1 month it never fell over . i just took it down yesterday because he hiding dirty clothes it but other then i no complaints !!! i would definately recommend it	1
we pleased this doll , she really cute dress much nicer looking person , photo didnt it justice . super cute name also	1
i bought these my son , who now 3 1/2 , last summer . now , year half later he still plays them regular basis my daughter , who 21 months , loves them well . they stand up well thrown kicked sounds not too noisy . after year half noises sound same first day	1
i used this fake barf fooled my friends family . looks real it big . not sure what other reviewers bought but this one looks gross it works	1
my 4 year old son got this his birthday , even though he doesn't whole thomas set all tracks he lots fun it . he drives it all over house without any tracks just like he his matchbox cars . he used some his other duplos it built train stations , even incorporated it into his duplo castle . knights suddenly advanced quickly transportation department they now don't rely only their four legged winged friends carry them . granted all tracks etc . would probably excite him , so he'll get them christmas , but even it own this fantastic toy . pieces very durable easy little hands put together most importantly course take apart . it seems my son always likes toys he take apart put back together best . big plus all you mom out there , they're easy clean . unlike regular lego parts these easy just run under some water or wipe off because there actually enough it hold . even my 5 year old daughter who girly girl loves play this toy . this great toy	1
i bought this my 4 yo son store his leapster cartridges . it great job - big main compartment inside pockets , plus small outside pocket . problem strap - it supposed fit across body like messenger bag , but we can't seem get it fit him right no matter how we tighten it . it always sliding around his neck shoulder . price , i should purchased regular backpack . we always end up carrying pack hanging loop instead wearing it	-1
i picked this up closeout price ( too good mention ) because i loved both these games sega genisis . they still move just fast , playability still same . graphics pretty good remembering what genisis like , few details harder see . also names players not there , but ok . this great combination . i just hope they put together college football package , my alltime favorite ea game . check this out , price dropping you can't go wrong . this travels me play when i'm call . excellent toy all ages .	1
my 5year old this doll last year christmas , she got it then never really played it . it didnt make lot noises ( plus mom but not so much little girl wants cooing baby)it would ok if it wasnt 35 bucks it didnt come anything	1
while my son loves scoop lofty plays them ton , there basically nothing else this set , pieces you left won't build much anything . you see box you only able barely build facade house window two roof pieces , frame building . you least get caravan/little house door , windows , stairs travis set , my pick best series . even muck set comes recycling bins chute offers more play value . all vehicles , you can't play heavy them , pieces usually pop off . this set very pricey , so i would only get it if your child these two characters , becauase that all you paying . it should come little something better build , especially price	-1
i purchased this laptop my daugher 2 years ago paid almost double price . it well worth every penny ! over above any other education tool i bought her , she goes it first . when taking long car trips , it goes her . rainy days she can't play outside , she takes it her room . very educational she learned lot , especially foreign language tutor ( spanish , french , italian porteguese ) . it also helped her keyboarding skills which very important her school . she loves beating each level seeing how high she go . i hope they develop new product match her skill level she outgrows this one . definite must buy	1
this one best toys i bought my daughter . we bought it 6 months ago she still interested it . it so many things keep babys interest	1
my daughter loves this light . it saved me long nights fear sleeping dark . my daughter much more content night now . thank you very much !!!!	1
my son very disappointed when he received this item . it looks nothing like picture . picture shows whole container viewers you receive one baby blue view swirly sticker instead eye picture . i believe this false advertising , everyone should aware this . i wanted give it half star , but it not available	-1
this game system horrible . my son anted it xmas he played it once cause its so bad . graphics like ps1 best load times unbearable . im ' talking good 5 minutes just get started ... stay away this .	-1
this really fun product my son ; only problem i it placement alphabet squares one side . these placed so if little finger pushes far enough top or bottom " unlucky " angle , then pulls back , squares actually trap finger smash it bit . i only help my son get his finger out once , but i tried it after , it trapped my finger just easily . other than , again , it really fun kid-occupying toy	-1
these magnets gift we thought they would great . i agree other reviewer . their magnets not strong enough , one slides down fridge hits floor . activities too hard . you press everything really hard ... too hard little kids . one plays music doesn't play music either .... probably because it one slid down fridge hit floor several times . they look good theorey but reality not worth money . only redeeming quality two them my son likes slide them around , take them off , etc . but they no way actually anything they should . i suppose you could use one hold grocery list fridge ... but you get free magnets . i am just glad i didn't pay them	-1
we play this game so much we wearing out board . seriously ! even my husband likes play it . it really improved our daughters analysis strategy . it simple , cute , fun . i not say enough cute things this board game . we've played this game almost every single day since she gotten it , which x-mas . 4 year old child lifetime she still loves it just same first time we played it . now if isn't great game , we all family truly like playing then i dont know what . kudos manufacturer . simple , virtually unbreakable parts , simple memory based game . we however alter game , we let player win landing empty space well landing directly winning spot ( easier understand when played ) . this just makes it less frustrating little ones , but we re-instated original rules once tenacity game began . seriously ... buy this game . they get more out it then game like candyland . ( which we also enjoy play .	1
this model horse set looks like lot fun ! but glue comes it stinks use fabric glue instead these set comes cute dapple grey model horse three carrots blanket set throhy	1

i loved stilts kid , now i love them again ! i am little too tall them , but i still use them . my sister her boyfriend who 25 even tried them bbq we they ball ! my kids 12 10 watching them their friends use them such blast . i put 5 stars throughout since coordination it takes learn them great kids durability isn't even thought . they won't break ! least not everyday dropping them ground . great , fun exercise choice	1
product just promised , kids love it . quite durable . last long time	1
i teach preschool class many books tell you " put items bag kids identify them using only touch " . this game so much more ! there many cards you use each pictures 2-4 items category you need find . beginning , you should only use 1/2 items/cards it really hard kids adults . you spin spinner whatever card you land one you need find objects . you set 30 sec . timer reach try find items using only touch . back container see-through , so rest players see where you reaching . honest , i thought it would really easy adults , but my 6 year old doing better than several adults who tried it . it works right side your brain , so " right brained " people definitely advantage , but it fun all ages !	1
very durable , my daughter cannot destroy it , which plus ! great pictures great way get kids excited animals	1
although this purchased our 8 month old , kids all ages ( adults too ) find this toy very interesting . it fabulous teething toy well offering manipulative activity . favorite haba toy this age discovery blocks	1
i got this toy my 4 year old daughter . it great it comes twistable crayons ( perfect those us hate million broken crayons our childs crayon box ) , markers three stamp markers . stamps not stamp perfectly but hasn't stopped my daughter putting smiley face stamp all her art work . map pencils aren't her favorite color , but she loves write all different colors . it great take go holds everything perfectly place . i feel it absolutely great buy	1
this thing tips over very easily ! don't like it ! very hard pedal manage	-1
x-23 pretty nice figure . those die-hard x-men fans out there going ones who really know story behind her . she younger , female clone wolverine some different touches . most notably she only two adamantium claws coming out each hand claw comes out each foo t--t he latter feature nicely toybiz . claw manipulated so it folds back underneath figure foot . she new body sculpt very good this character . she supposed look more " girl " than " woman " . she not too tall or too " developed " . articulation pretty good , too . joints tight well concealed . head sculpt good considering past female characters . paint job looks nice clean . she also comes copy x-men #451 comic . it ok job showing you who x-23 -- you definitely see her action against wolverine . there version this figure available . it exactly same figure comic except head sculpt different her costume all black instead purple . plus , black one easier find . both very nice , but i am more pleased black version . this series called apocalypse series because , past series , 6 figures piece 7th , larger figure-apocalypse . apocalypse 5,000 -year-old mutant arch nemesis x-men . he turns out 14 inches tall he looks really , really good when he all assembled . he best one series . most people probably won't consider character selection this series best , so it good idea toybiz release these figures this way . personally , i love character selection idea building , larger figure . they should continue it future releases . everyone want put together their own apocalypse since he very hard get when he made his 6-inch appearance marvel legends 7 . two versions x-23 out there , it should easy purchase one or other , so if you want her apocalypse piece or not , you're still getting great action figure plays displays nicely .	-1
" must buy " . it only game i play my 9-year-old daughter we both enjoy . she developes her deductive reasoning skills fun . neither us get bored it . if you older parent like me ( 43 yrs ) it hard patience play children toys - especially bratz barbie . most board games designed children too easy adults . this strikes right balance . best all its not tie-in movie or cartoon chatacters .... shameless commercialisation , it really too much these days	1
this one better legendary riders he comes vehicle both makes sense , looks great . we finally true " villian " our two ( or three depending whether or not you count series vii varaint seperate figure ) ghost rider figures ml lines . vengeance looks great , i agree bone coloring package promotional photos looks great , but purple more comic acurate . one decent rider figures , one not overly hard find	-1
this toy fun combined two other bionicles set which include kopaka lewa , but this toy only educational value fact you build it . it very durable , ( only way it breaks if it falls apart)and i think it many good aspects , high rating deserved toy	1
my one year old i love these blocks . they light , soft provide endless opportunity imagination . however , they extremely expensive inferior quality construction . when we opened box , we found several blocks not cut straight edge making them difficult stack . also , several identical shape blocks not exactly same size leading stacking problems . one blocks peeling one corner . these blocks such great idea i find it hard believe no other companies making them	-1
i got this product my daughter . password feature difficult program voice recognition so precise it almost impossible reproduce right voice inflection pattern journal recognize . my daughter often could not make journal open . after frunstrating week or two , she stopped playing it altogether	-1
i feeling this toy would trouble when i saw delivery guy walking up our front steps weird grin his face . evidently , box vrooming , vibrating shrieking throughout his rounds , he only too glad end his term its temporary steward . my two-year-old largely lost interest this toy ; he doesn't mind shaking noise , but more often than not it just vrooms then doesn't go anywhere . my advice : buy matchbox , or hot wheels ... or something more reliable volume control . this probably our next load donations ... thrift shoppers beware .	-1
santa got this castle my five year old son christmas . i agree many other reviewers , though it visually appealing it very flimsy painstaking put together . despite all my son seems enjoying . this toy fun child but not parents .	-1

i didn't know you line up arrows motor part so we installed it incorrectly it rotated counterclockwise ; my husband took whole thing apart reversed battery terminals so it would turn clockwise , then it worked just fine . instructions don't mention you align motor terminals certain fashion or it turn backwards . but once you get it lined up right it works fine hershey syrup . great starter fountain my chocaholic 2nd grader	-1
my sone loves this trike , but not able use it much due fact it keeps breaking . first one i got broken steering wheel lock - it kept slipping into lock position my son couldn't turn wheel anymore ! so i called radio flyer they graciously sent out new one(i not provide proof purchase or anything ) . new one , parent handle would not lock into place . so i called again they sent out new parent handle . i replaced it everything seemed work fine until we went up or down slight incline which case handle would come unlocked again . i called radio flyer again . this point , they sending new one which quality control supposed look over first , they want old one back take look it . i really like this trike , but quality not great . if you purchase it problems , definitely call radio flyer get one works correctly . don't even bother return it store . radio flyer send parts or replacements free charge you don't hassle going back store	-1

i picked this item up my 6 year old nephew who loves science . we put it together one night i surprised find base volcano incredibly thin plastic crack under any pressure all . plaster/sand mixture impossible work , it just balled up into clumps there no real way spreading it around smoothly . we both ended up plaster all over us . once it dried , he excited get paint it . soon he began paint , parts plaster started breaking off chunks . hooking plastic tubing up not major problem but i issues keeping it hooked together . " pump " system supposed send vinegar into baking soda chamber push up into volcano . instead " pump " ( which squeeze bottle ) pushed vinegar weakly upwards then once it hit baking soda chamber it clogged up . when it finally made its way out through volcano after me squeezing bottle hard possible , it barely trickled out . once it trickled enough , rest plaster fell off it got wet . he his sisters just looked me asked " it ? " after three tries we trashed whole thing . also , " rock samples " they give you kit size tip your fingernail . i'm geologist these not rare , expensive rocks . there no reason not include larger samples . he very disappointed whole thing so i . i can't believe smithsonian put their name this product . we'll go back our plaster volcano vinegar baking soda	-1
sure wish my mother-in-law read these reviews before giving this me christmas . tried play it once my parents , who also big 24 fans , few nights later sorely disappointed . this game obviously just shoved out door feed off popularity 24 show not garner any popularity its own right . mini-games exercise extreme frustration . problem dvd not ideal those mini-games . whenever you try move there only two subsequent animations : successful one unsuccessful one , which made it seem like it just moving random . other than it seemed like game going pretty linear , clue cards contained no useful information , board completely superfluous , unless apparently you masochistic enough get bonus level	-1
this junk , cheap plastic , no instructions , arrived some pieces broken ( not shipping ); much better products available cost . description , i expected much better product . this not it ; bargain 1/3 price , maybe	-1
ummm ... i am huge fan bratz , but this piece junk absolutely terrible . first all , eyes super ugly . i can't believe they would make such ugly product ! lips fine . but i could reconsider making better , cuter eyes ! they broke when i it after five minutes . they not blink . they try , but don't succeed . not buy !! second , features horrible . they made so bad , i tried make it walk since it couldn't it won ! it not walk . note . also , it head not move . it broken mine it made it fall down neck , while trying move , muffled song . also , unless you wanna hear same 20 second " bratz catz " song over over again , not buy this product . it dissapoint your daughter like it me . i am daughter , but am very dissapointed . i returned mine not get new one , either . i got some bratz babyz which cuter than this junk ! i am warning you , this cat brainwashed should not continued . not buy this product unless you want crying daughter it !!! thank you your patience gratuity reading this grievance . love , brownie , baby doll lover . get babies instead , they're cute !	-1
anyone who buys this toy , keep box receipt handy . we may odd one out , but we purchased this toy it didn't work . legs manny pulled back fire rubber ball . this didn't happen . rapid pushing pulling his legs produces ' rapid fire ' , if we lucky one would shoot out - after great effort . it comes three foam balls , two which fit , third slightly too big would jam . ours going back store today .	-1

just wanted let others know this info i found out after reading tip given reviewer getting table lot cheaper costco ... i called costco they carried kidkraft art table two stools back january 2006 , no longer carrying it . you find it walmart $66 plus shipping , just check website . table not same however -- dimensions different , sides tables slightly different ( one side kidcraft table two cups mesh basket two cups , other side space where little legos snap onto ) . stools also tiny compared ones come this table . overall it looks little less substantial , but since i haven't seen it person , i really can't give my opinion . hope helps someone	1
lot people look this figure say ' he no wings!' . while this true , i still recommend this toy , excellant hair sculpt goku famous ' i no idea what going , but happy anyway!'look . wings actually really cool , although halo job staying . 0verall this great toy definate purchase any dbz fan or toy collector	1
this game set it amazing quality . every piece so much detail it just looks good without doing anything ! dubloons best part , like others said , make best clinking sound when you drop pile into your hand . this game definately worth buying .... if you come up some new rules make game more interesting . gameplay very uninteresting , boring , brainless . my wife never passes up opportunity tell me how boring it , even her younger ( 12 year old ) sister thought it boring more fun playing pieces . my wife says i should bought us settlers catan instead spending my money this ( before we got our own set ... now we one ) , but when i bought it i knew it would just game pieces . i am brewing up some good rules change gameplay dramatically make it much more interesting . she likes settlers so much .. maybe i get some trade spices into game whatnot . anyways , if you creative good idea ship game , then definately get this game set . it high quality beautiful . but , if you don't interest make your own game , then pass this one up because you would most likely love play any other game you own before this	1
my sister said her 3yo son loved able play it his 1yo brother ! i don't really know how durable it , she lives state but said they liked it alot	1
muffet vs spider ! this one cool looking figure since accessory spider big muffet makes it kick butt scene . again turn sm pink black leather bondage look , similar spiked outfit red riding hood . this certainly not image your mind conjures up nursery rhyme but it great display piece . downfall five stars when setup , muffet almost obscured spider . both pieces look great detail but slightly different pose may improved figures	1

nephews loved it . we sent it them other gifts christmas . turns out twin 8 year olds found this their favorite gift . light up part pretty cool but they some trouble bouncing ball . when lights went out fun really happened . everything went well even when it turned into tackle-basketball . not their mom favorite sport but no harm ... no foul .	1
i don't know why poor scrat got so many bad reviews . my kids absolutely love this toy . they laugh hysterically every time they're 4 1/2 7 . he tendency fall down doesn't scoot very well . but laugh factor alone makes this well worth money .	1

we this sandbox five years . it durable my two kids ages 3 5 just love it . color plastic still bright under sun years . sometimes water seeps when it rains but this makes sand play even funner kids . we tend put rock top lid keep it place though it cover box perfectly . it also nice lid attached box itself easy kids remove put back when . kids usually sit outside it though it accomodate 1-2 small kids inside it well . i find most kids dont want get sand all over end up sitting outside it regardless . overall good investment kids love it	1

build figure ( baf ) program marvel legends keeps rocking . this time build giant 14 " apocalypse . this baf big cool , super articulated , sculpt paint fine enough sculpture . apocalypse 5 stars . iron fist ... well he super articulated come mighty booty ( that buttocks ) apocalypse , but really weakest figure this series . lot just charater design though . green tights open v-neck green shirt , what tattoo supposed anyway , ballet slippers dew-rag ? pretty horrible looking . if you , try find red suit variant , least that little cool . also , accesories ( besides booty ) two rubbery flames fit into his hands give fire fist effect . good luck . they kind flimsy hard place hands . once you get them you better not touch figure again or they fall off . overall , not quatlity figure or accesories i'd expect . but rest figures series make up this one , plus you still get booty	1
i bought this toy my 3 year old son before his baby brother born . he absolutely loves this doll ! i babysit during day he took care his baby right me while i cared baby i keep . he regressed started wetting his pants again when i began babysitting but now going bathroom his own again after getting this doll his own baby care ! yawn some other reviewers said sound bit weird but it only doll ! if baby not attended properly make her stop fussing or put her sleep then she'll eventually just it her own so it not frustrating my son , great younger kids . my husband not want our son " girl " doll i can't find any clothes fit doll turn it into boy so my only wish this doll also made boy or least boy clothes sold her .	1
we this toy both our daughters . my 3yr old still enjoys playing it , but because it so low ground my baby ( almost year ) one really loves it . my first daughter loved it just much when she age also . we like shapes basic pots open closing doors such . it difficult put things fridge them stay , but isn't such big deal because they play all other compartments . time my oldest two she ready bigger kitchen , but it great entertainment younger !	1
deluxe edition quite nice it holders different cards money	1
i wish there few more tatoos this kit , but you continue use markers draw free hand tattos when they gone . they easy apply fun color kids . i little skeptical after reading few reviews , but i am glad i decided purchase this anyway .	1
if you your friends just too crazy conventional board games , give i've never - game truth try . object game simple , players move around board answering highly personal potentially defamatory questions , take shots or drink beer while playing . questions formatted " i've never .... " ( example , " i've never skinny-dipping " ) . if this true you , you get move forward designated number spaces . if it false , you pay consequence ( generally you must take drink ) . some spaces game board automatically force you drink . many people find questions far too offensive overly personal , uncomfortable playing this game . if this you , don't feel bad , you're not only one . however , group close friends , this game total laugh riot . this game perfect bachelor or bachelorette party , or just regular party group friends who crazy you	1
it beautiful kitchen - my 3yo loves it - i bought lot food stuff go it she gets total kick out it . microwave plastic came cracked it so involved putting it togetherthat we didn't bother un assembling it sending it back	1
okay , original b-wing little under-scaled wasn't very accurate movie . lego gained alot popularity over years , alot more than before . alot people asking new b-wing because : 1 . they weren't fans time get it . 2 . b-wing just so cool . here my review : b-wing , well , just looks so nice ! i don't know why it called b-wing , since it resembles more than anything else . oh well , still cool ship . you get two minifigures , b-wing pilot dressed nice looking red . you get sullustan pilot named ten numb . ( yes ten numb real star wars character , he dressed red return jedi . ) i think ten numb looks great . if you see his actual picture , i think you would agree . b-wing pilot classic smily face what looks racing helmet . shweet ! two pilots you only need one . b-wing masterpiece . not only it look more accurate than it previous self , it more accurate . b-wing itself very sturdy . two cons come b-wing though . one them missiles shown not fire properly . you must tilt b-wing so , which very annoying . those dreaded stickers . you never really get them right . oh well , i don't even put stickers anyway . b-wing comes nice yellow black service station tools so you display b-wing . i don't use it because reality , b-wing lands horizontally . but it still nice used other sets if you like . all all , this b-wing literally destroys old . you get two pilots when you only need one . price isn't bad considering pieces . i think every fan should own least one these . i'm still trying figure out shape though ..	1
this wonderful wood puzzle toddler who finds baby wood puzzles too easy but who doesn't quite dexterity ( or patience ) fit together classic puzzle shaped pieces . because it all wood , it stand up wear tear toddler . my son ( 20 months ) found this hard first , but thrilled challenge would not stop working it days until he could it easily . picture underneath pieces . one my son very favorite toys all time ! he also loves school bus one similar same company	1

box said it came 10 refillable paint containers , but ours only 9 bottles , one those empty . no matter , really , it just small amount paint start , but why not give people what you tell them you ? color selection all right , but not super - you don't get roygbiv or anything . it may vary , course , but we lot light green . some them glitter , which extra cool good job making whole picture sparkle if you add it last . it also comes small assortment ( 40 pieces ) paper -- both large small sizes -- which you encouraged reserve last one template trace make new ones . poster board seems same thickness original paper . smaller " bonus " machine go fast if you pump button down repeatedly . doing this , it actually go faster than battery operated one paint distributes spatters very well . instruction manual , if you call it , pretty limited . it shows 3 pictures how put everything together operate it . no tips or hints how make neat designs . it least detailed set instructions i seen art toy . it comes apart easy rinsing/wiping . i've always this immediately after paint session , units still clean they first time out box . my kids love it . they want spin pictures every day	1

my son always tried " cook " real pots pans always asked spoon stir his food so order keep our real stuff clean , i decided get him his own kitchen christmas this year . when he woke up chrismtas morning , he went straight this toy played it hour before even looking other toys presents . it only took maybe 5 minutes assemble -- quite bonus christmas eve . reasons i chose this one because it primary colors so it ok boys girls , it doesn't take up much space it reasonably priced . others mentioned it easy tip over since it small especially younger kids ( like my son ) who really want reach top storage area but bit too short . i've started make sure it against wall or refrigerator so it can't get knocked over . reference reviewer mentioning oven door not staying closed , you push it hard close it all way but then it stay closed . overall , i'm very happy this purchase since my son totaly love it it compact enough we keep it kitchen all time without it getting way	1

i think this great toy . i bought this my 3 1/2 y.o. daughter . she not able put animals together herself but she fix them make them me . my 5 1/2 year old son great time playing it well . he already adept lego yet he finds animals fun challenging . you must save cardboard pictures animals box wrapped so you refer pictures building . my two suggestions duplo would they include book pictures how build animals they include just few more pieces so you build all animals refreshment stand . this set allows you build all animals but if you want build refreshment stand you take few pieces animal or duplo set . overall - i would recommend this toy anyone girls or boys ages 3-6 .	1

first , let me say , this first rc plane any type i ever flown . after thouroghly reading instructions last night , this afternoon i took supes his maiden voyage . i some crashes , but after 10 - 20 minutes trial error , i started getting some decent flights . i admit i skeptical first , but this thing actualy fly ! it tendency veer right , but once i got hang it i able fairly easily compensate it steering other direction ( i not tried using included weights balance it yet ) . keys successful flight : 1 ) needs large open area : example , we used soccer field 2)wind must relatively calm 3)follow instructions proper release/launch . when you're flying you'll probably want keep it over soft grassy area , supes earned few battle scars landing road ( nothing major though ) . i must say , my son i blast watching him fly ! note : it may little too difficult younger kids fly themselves .	1

great game entire family , especially kids 8 or older ! strategy what makes it fun -- but you play fun even without " thinking " too much	1
this handheld dond game isn't totally bad $15 it cost . here my review , i hope get user pic up online my unit too . pros - i like off button top , alot these handheld games just don't one , so its nice feature . you option turning game sound or off , even during game , there no volume control , but " duct tape " fix everything , you could always cut small piece duct tape place it over speaker if you wanted sound , but didnt want it loud ! or other methods just covering speaker w/a napkin or something .. game quite addictive you always seem want play , " just one more " game before finally determining there other things life ! ( nbc dond game you play online much quicker visually better)cons : i really dont like numbers so small , it makes it very hard see if you don't light right angle . it would nice if backlight , would make those late night games alot easier ! i wish there screen contrast adjustment , especially bottom , case numbers select 3 or 4 rows , font size maybe 5 or less just very small , they all start off black numbers when you arrow select one , case you land flashes black light grey , once you select case it turns light grey show you already selected one . it would really help if they ever make newer version this game , it wouldn't bad if game itself little bigger enable visually friendly screen . ------------------------------------------------------------ ah , its not big deal there really no vocal sounds , music kinda cheesy , but all all its fun game $ 15 . it fun , all game chance really , hey my 3rd time playing it , i actually picked 1,000,000 case ! got million , no bells or whistles happened after , scrolling marquee top , which where it gives you instructions deal offers say something like " sweet ! " i stop middle game something once game waiting me select cases it said marquee " let go already .. " guess it impatient!wouldn't hurt buy this game , $ 15 won't really break bank it fun pastime .	1
it seems like every christmas there one toy top list major bust , this year it love licks puppy !!! this only thing my 5 year old daughter really wanted , she so disappointed we can't get it anything than bark ( or whine it really sounds) ! she sad feeling like it her fault , like she not ' loving it enough ' . i thought maybe we just gotten one lemon , but it looks like they all like this . i can't believe manufacturer would put this out set up so many kids disappointment . major disappointment !! don't waste your money or set your kids up extremely disappointed	-1
this item ok . . . maybe it just me , but we some issues it . it ok first ( age 1 ) , because my son couldn't reach pedals , his feet just kind dangled . but he got little older , he always seemed loss what his feet . ( there nowhere rest them . ) he would try rest them pedals , inevitably jam them his foot . now he reach pedals ( age 2 ) , but hasn't mastered them yet . but his feet dragging ground . i guess i raise seat up , but this still won't solve his dangling problem . secondly , canopy cup holder useless , our bike doesn't steer particularly straight , even though we tried correct this . my sister son same age mine , she same problems . it very cute , we always get compliments it , but not nearly functional . wish i gotten something else	-1
this game amazingly addictive . it whole-family christmas gift hit season . everybody took turn most us spent many hours it over week . it provides lot fun not only rider , but all others who watch cheer . 4-year-olds grandparents , all blas t.t he game pretty simple , hard part learning how work controller pull off tricks . its one those things that easy get started , but hard master . there number courses three characters keep things interesting . we mostly half-pipe which seemed most fun . this thing built , they say , like tank . you use your back foot control turns you lean forward/backward control your speed . weight rating something like 240 or 280 -- we number grown-ups pounded it , one particular jumped board like maniac . it really impressive it didn't just crumble bits under punishment . ( you imagine enteretainment provides . ) this great game groups gather round some fun . its also whole lot more active than your typical console or pc game . you certainly work up sweat playing . get this game , get give it chance . it takes while learn how control board , but you it , once you , you really get hooked	1

pit possibly loudest family game ever . it just bunch cards little bell , but action turns your dining room table into trading floor . everyone screaming numbers across table each other holding up fingers trying trade cards it get pretty boisterous . my experience , this not good game all families . some folks more subdued prefer quieter evenings discussion relaxation . others like it loud , those people i recommend this game . it loud , but it blast . frenzy shouting card trading 4 minutes then it all over you play again . big fun	1

this review ruff stuff air blasters motorized mech tommy 20 dart blaster . gun comparable range other nerf type guns . what gun lacks accuracy it makes up rapid fire shots 20 dart capacity . motor little bit noisy but so pumping those other guns too right ? also , you this gun really fun when you use nerf dart tag velcro bullets . only problem you cut ends off those bullets because they too long this gun . overall , pretty decent gun .	1

i write this i 3 little girls ( ages 3 , 4 5 -- my 2 daughters friend ) entranced this set . they sitting together playing it very nicely , they don't usually all get this well ! my daughter just received this her 5th birthday -- she " pretend sleepover " party , it perfect gift . it really cute se t--t he current amazon picture doesn't show this clearly , but it comes 5 different kelly-sized dolls their pajamas , blankets , pillows , eye masks , many tiny accessories go theme -- little bowl popcorn , bottle soda , glasses , toothbrushes , cd dvd ( dvd recent barbie movies , like 12 dancing princesses mermaidia -- they neat ! ) box dolls come turned into little carrying purse set -- just open it carefully ! girls loving i t--t hey acting out sleepover dolls ( " time brush our teeth " " let watch movie " " it morning -- wake up ! " ) i'm sure many these little pieces inevitably get lost or vacuumed up , but that not fault toy . it adorable , i bet most 3-6 year-old girls love it	1
my daughter received this her first birthday . she absolutely loves it . she 16 months old now , it become her favorite toy . she climb into her toy box , over all her other stuff , get it . it keeps her busy good 20 minutes time while she experiments all different songs musical instrument sounds . we still haven't replace batteries , which definite plus	1

i bought this kit face painting my daughters 4th birthday . i wish i would opened it week before then i would realized it awful . " paints " transferred almost no color , small sponge applicators useless b/c amount pressure needed pick up any color caused them pop off .

my son earned some money doing chores bought three fusion crew figures dollar store . december 17 . he loved them so much santa sent fusion crew dome ( currently available here through etoys reasonable price ) . now son ( 6 years old ) his brother ( 8 years old ) blast playing this set . despite other , more expensive toys ( transformer $50 ! ouch ! ) , this surprise hit christmas . based others ' reviews , i told them careful scanner bars . they aren't too rough their toys , so this should not big problem . if your kids ( boys , probably ) love pokemon -- where they " battle " -- you want other options beyond card games , then i recommend this great toy ! prepared search figures though . right now , fisherprice.com some them , too	1

i just bought two these my kids [ ... ] ( boy ) ( girl ) . i expecting guns would relatively low quality would not overall great toy , but i wanted encourage my kids get outside run around . i figured i'd give lazer tag try . i very surprised find they really work . i mean they really accurate very good , solidly built toys . there variety games you program into gun which keeps things bit different each time ( nice ! ) . my daughter doesn't play too much anymore though , but she never really into gun thing anyway . not problem . my son still loves play me we run around shoot it up great time together . rocket really works great also . it launches very far shoots out infrared ( or whatever ) shots all directions impact . very neat effect . my only concerns rocket it made nerf-type material break/tear if not taken care . we just lost one ( actually , i think my wife lost it , not really kids ) . we also bought two individual " taggers " ( guns ) they add even more fun . we teams play it adds few new games mix including our favorite , " own zone " , where one handguns " zone generator " it emits zone infrared which you try move into stay there score points . very hard , lots running game . batteries seems last long time . we played several hours one day single charge no problem . then kids played over several days shorter bursts still same batteries . i would estimate least few days play per set batteries . we bought rechargables all them too--it'll same money long run . i think all guns quite durable , made seemingly sturdy plastic . i think kids could rough them up they'd still ok . i've read other reviews people dropping them concrete still fine . one day , though , my son pumping up gun preparation shoot rocket ( built air pump-thing ) but so he stuck muzzle gun dirt . this got mud/dirt all over dual lazer lenses front gun then he couldn't hit me 10 minutes until we realized it cleaned them off . no permanent damage though . ideally , i think best ages these guns 10+ , but coordinated slightly younger kids could ok also . it essential kids other people play though you need enough guns go around everyone . still , we got 4 guns rechargable batteries under $100.00 . not bad really . oh , i've read some people complaining difficulty programming game modes guns . yes , it takes 20-30 minutes become proficient really should initially handled adult , but now we fly through it no problem . kids probably wouldn't able figure it out themselves ( little kids i mean ) . overall , i recommend lazer tag brand guns . very good so far we expect only more fun come now spring here . even my wife out playing us last time !!! go buy them -- you won't disappointed . ps : i only gave them 3 educational value because it really more running sport type toy . sure , you learn teamwork strategy , but it not chess you know . you get point	1
this excellent game play group friends . its fun rules simple easy follow .	1
my daughter loves this swing . we bought it ot put variety climber swing set extension . she'd love swing all afternoon if she could . i agree other reviewers , swing tend swing diagnol , but it happens when child seat isn't centered seat if they leaning one side or other . you only small adjustments swing because it only comes rope . no extra chain etc . really fix diagnol swing , but you barely tell it swings way . it not taken away fun value grace doesn't seem care one bit . it safe buckle easy get out once you it couple times . i would buy this swing again , diagnol swinging all .	1

we bought this doll our 4 year old daughter christmas three months later she still loves this doll !!! she thinks it great doll cries , giggles , kicks her feet like real baby . my daughter best time trying figure out what make doll stop " fussing " . sometimes doll wants blanket , sometimes bottle , sometimes she needs diaper change . it continuous mystery . one draw back this parent perspective only my daughter doesn't see this problem . :-) only draw back doll somewhat loud doesn't stop making noise until you figure out why she crying or just turn her off . but overall i recommend this doll any little girl loves babies .	1

uno excellent game any age 7 up ( according makers ; i've watched sharp 4 yr old enjoy playing only slightly modified rules ) . it easy learn but continues provide challenging play years . rules easily modified accomodate diffenent skill levels or time available . this one doesn't need bells whistles , it great it . although mattel would not encourage this ( or even suggest it ) playing points lends itself modest wagers , extent , allows handicaping players different skill levels . educational value not obvious , but significant . it teaches players think ahead , consider branches sequels actions , strategy . compact size ( like two standard poker decks ) allows this one travel well , played trains , planes , boats , buses , tents .	1

back when i student va tech , me my roomies used play this ( sega genesis nhl 95 ) all time ... well , maybe not all time . after graduation i aquired pc version , nhl hockey 95 , which i still , but unfortunately it doesn't play well xp ( haven't able get sound working , one thing .... yea , tried vds , etc , etc ) . my cousin i used play this one all time ... well , anyway . until this came out i hadn't played game 2-3 years , but contemplating buying old laptop use just this game so when i home holidays my cousin i could play once again . then this thing comes . we both like " cool !! " forget football , but hockey worth price alone . i almost completed season week i it ... very addicitive .... fun . only drawback they took out player names ... but all stats there . i don't remember everything original , but it seems they took out some other stuff too , like skill level ( rookie , pro , all-star ... maybe some other stuff ) . i think they just used all-star level this game , because its harder than i remember ... defense very tough . i really fight hard points . it just makes win all more fun ... loss all more devastating . anyway , i would recommend this anyone who fan old game ... or fan hockey . it doesn't all fancy graphics stuff ... but gameplay fun-factor there spades	1

i agree many other reviewers ... sole fact product " after market " or " not recommended manufacturer " certainly not diminish its worth my mind ! certainly this product could installed too tightly , but if you're going ask your " certified car seat installation expert " one thing typically wrong way nearly all car seats installed , they'll tell you most not installed tight enough ! our minivan leather seats predates latch systems , but our carseats new britax very heavy ... it not possible us get them installed without them sliding several inches , base , side side , unless we use mighty tite . it bulky , we rented minivan this summer made its use impossible ; your car seat , check out use this product ( should you choose use it ) your car seat before accepting rental vehicle or making new vehicle purchase . all this brouhaha over certification mightytite reminds me faa not " approving " baby b'air in-flight safety vest lap children airplanes ... it approved use years europe , but usa they'll tell me i cannot my child this vest during takeoff landing - this make my child safer held my arms ? i think not . use your noggin - if you need way secure your car seat so it not move around too much , this might good fit you	1

hats off fisher price designers ! roundhouse several neat features : 1 . it automatically disconnects all cars off train engines ( since there room only one engine turn table)2 . gates go up down automatically when turn table not aligned main track3 . turn table pauses each possible branches 5-10 seconds , which makes it easy little engineers line engine up next trackif you not familiar geomotion system : lever each building selects either let trains drive through , or stop trains use train motor ( based gear tooth bottom train ) drive some mechanical feature building . you gotta see it yourself ; it very clever system . my 3 yo loves it .	1
i got this game christmas . first time we played it , we found it hard hear what gatekeeper saying if we talking . you couldn't pause dvd or rewind it , so if we missed what he said , we out luck . it also kind stressful trying beat clock when we didn't know what we doing . second time we played it , it little bit easier because we understood game better . we found it impossible beat gatekeeper allotted amount time . next time we play , we going make blank spaces into spaces where you earn key , make it possible someone chance win .	1

well , cute this doll ... it really pratical baby hair ? so what if it toy , can't company make it little more realistic ? i'm also going address skimpy little clothes they put dolls . why can't they just wear diapers or long frilly dresses like normal babies ? overall i think this whole bratz baby thing quite strange . i'm big fan regular bratz , but i give bratz babies 2 thumbs down . when i got this birthday present i rushed right back store returned it	-1

this " toy " teaches spacial relationships , structural integrity , design aesthetics , just name few benefits . it lot fun , o.o ne note - you never too many pieces , especially if you building anything beyond basic structures . it get fairly expensive build large collection . we're building ours set time , eventually we'll probably 3,000 pieces or so . we put all pieces all our sets plastic bin you buy just anywhere . it easy transport store , rooom many thousands pieces . throw away boxes styrofoam come set . better still , recycle them . choose bin locks tight stays shut .	1
