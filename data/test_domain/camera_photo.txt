amazon aggressive marketing tacticts now include shipping you goods when you called them cancel it . i never buy amazon again . i bought over 100 items over 5 years . i purchased camera 1 day delivery plan . they then just ship 4-5 day completely insensitive photographer needs . i cancelled order 2 days before it ships , they say sorry we cannot cancel . 2 days ??? come-on . i guess $3000 just creates nice interes t.t he end me amazon , i not like this kind " aggressive marketing " . good advice , rather buy direct bh photo , pay double if you like , but you get what you pay there , not aggressive marketing shoving product down your throat their terms . i am truly annoyed . run , hide .	-1
it takes around 3-4 seconds take picture after i click button !! then 8-10 seconds just store picture sd card !! so basically , i cant take picture until atleast 10-15 seconds one picture !!	-1

this my third digital camera , i bought it after my tot dunked my previous camera under water . i lot research before i bought this it highly rated consumer reports . after few months ok pictures ( macro setting not very good though ) lens cover started sticking but i learned live it . i would manually open up lens cover each time . then lens cover got stuck open position i learning live . but now camera almost completely dead . it not power up properly sometimes it beeps . i'm not sure but i think i am out warranty period this . i not buy canon camera . this camera made too cheaply . i wish things not made break right away	-1

not too long after i purchased this camera screen turned white when i turned it . i would turn it off nothing would help . finally i would take batteries out put them back . this seemed fix problem few times . after i thought it just operator error . but it wasn't . camera finally gave out white screen never went away . so after annoyed i left camera alone awhile . event came up month later . i got my camera tried turn it . nothing happened . so i changed batteries . still nothing happened . i'm not sure what happened . i believe i purchased lemon camera . i'm hoping resolve these issues samsung . it one cheapest cameras market time . so i guess you get what you pay !	-1
i bought 743 wife christmas . i 6330 i very happy . so 743 should better right ? every time she went use it batteries dead . we finally figured out new set would go dead two days without ever turning it ! after several mails they told me call service . i got someone india could not understand me i really hard time figuring out what he saying . they made it very dificult get it sent . i sent it today , but i not expect much example their service so far . i hope it comes back least .	-1

i got mine today , it returned today . i high hopes , given reviews so far supposed improvement low light sensitivity . i hoping all-in-one device stills video . here my results : 1 ) stills . pictures not too bad , but not compare similar 7mp canon sd500 which i own . zoom works well , focusing ok , but slow . pictures themselves quite bit noticeable noise them , flash or not , like they all taken high iso setting regular digital cam . so slight disappointment here . 2 ) video . if this improved low light sensitivity , i would not liked see results hd1 ! video not even come close comparing my regular sony dv camera . focusing hit or miss , shake much more evident high zoom than my sony . i really hoping all end all combo device , but hd2 neither very well . ergonomically it beautiful fits one hand very well . finish great buttons well placed . but it doesn't justify price or quality misses photos video themselves	-1
i s5000 but it dropped it broke . so i decided buy this model since i loved s5000 so much . they took away so many great options quality s5000 ... so now i just use small fuji pocket digital camera this one sits shelf . it very blurry low light very little shake control . i would suggest going s5000 even lower megapixels it much better quality	-1

i owned this sony single day before i returned it amazon . first off , it records mpeg2 format which fairly compressed , looks it once you upload your computer . it also not natively supported mac without 20$ additional quicktime mpeg2 plugin . which converted before editing . which makes it slow , tedious affair . also , included software , surprise , pc only . other problems , not computer related - chroma shift " night mode " intense , making healthiest complexions appear sickly . i'm not expectant miracles night modes , but it seems like simple solution production side(sony ) . auto white balance could also use same attention . like previous reviewer pointed out , not bad camera money if you're not serious editing you're using pc . lcd touch screen nice addition easy use . all all , i would go canon	-1
we this camera year until thanksgiving day while out town it broke . lense just froze while middle taking picture wouldnt ever go back into camera . we ran out best buy purchased it again because it just simple use basic camera me my dad . ( 2 years later old cameras lense still wont go back into camera yet camera still turn .. weird . ) first we liked camera it took good pictures . they look great when we got them developed ( costco.com best place upload them 1 hour later you pick them up , super cheap too ) quality good . within last year camera turned into piece crap . evvvvvery picture comes out blurry it seems . inside or outside . i am constantly telling people who take pics me take 2 or 3 pictures because i know one or two blurry great shot i miss because it . also flash quality horrible . it takes okay pictures people dark but if it object ( anything really , just not person ) it comes out pitch black . inside lighting bad too . camera never focus it just annoying . i also went through 2 or 3 memory sticks made sony no reason just broke . one them broke while store getting them developed ( little machine ) erased all my pictures which very dissapointing . people said there no way it their machine , it default memory stick . also camera pretty big clunky . time it actually smaller camera market , now it huge ! i am looking into now buying canon powershot 6 .	-1
my wife got this me christmas . i thrilled thought it great idea . i charged device transferred pictures it . i work technology , so i agree many other reviewers software terrible -- delete any photos , you delete them device , not software . image quality ok , but not good enough " sharing " people . after few days sorting through pictures transferring deleting them , it got bit old . other than looking it " straight-on " , nobody either side you see image . it back-lit , which fine ... but it doesn't help much . unfortunately , battery didn't last all long . device refused charge after two months , eventually it died altogether . only way make unit work plug usb cable ; battery would not charge . so i contacted " support " got basic run-around , telling me you " shouldn't charge battery more than 2-3 hours " time , i could request rma return it replacement . warranty no good , it can't returned . i'm holding onto it because i'll probably take it apart use internal parts build desktop " photocube " , so it run off usb cable . but i agree others -- even if this worked longer than 2 months -- it just novelty gets tedious quickly	-1

i guess i really shouldn't complain because my husband won camera office rally . but pictures it takes disgraceful samsung product every two three pictures blurred unrecognizably-where you can't even tell what you taken . if you found yourself among fortunate few who actually found success this camera thank your lucky stars . even if it less expensive choice versus other cameras market today spend extra money it would worth it not miss any family moments like my family , this useless piece crap	-1

i bought this camera after owning olympus digital camera years . i extremely happy my olympus , but wanted something smaller would fit my purse or diaper bag since i'm expecting . this camera such disappointment . just every single picture i took huge white blobs all over it . ( this only happened when using flash . i must admit camera takes great pictures broad daylight without flash . ) plus , if you used zoom all , pictures came out fuzzy . first digital camera i ever owned ( 7 years ago ) took better pictures ! store i bought camera wouldn't take it back because i waited two days past 14-day return policy . so , i sold camera took $100 loss . i'd much rather lose $[ ... ] than keep this camera	-1

i recently bought new celestron nexstar 4se telescope this eyepiece accessory kit . much my disappointment , eyepieces this kit not fit very well into eyepiece holder telescope , when cold ( nights colorado 25-45f ) , eyepieces not fit all . celestron customer service horrible not pay attention my problem not follow up email promised . when i called second time , they no clue construction eyepieces no thoughts how fix this problem . amazon replaced kit ( thank you amazon ! ) , but replacements not fit either . i'm returning kit too . i finally bought kit meade ( 3 eyepieces moon filter ) fit properly very easy use . fair , if these eyepieces fit your telescope then they tremendous value ( hence rating 2 stars rather than 1 ) . meade kit worse value , but because they work my nice new scope , they best anyone using nexstar 4se	-1

i read many reviews fredmiranda.com before i purchased this lens i not dissapointed one bit . i lucky enough receive very sharp copy this lens first try . macro shots very sharp contrasty . center part already reaching near maximum sharpness 2.8 anything beyond f4 tack sharp . carefull this lens though . dof 2.8 extremely narrow . don't mistaken out focus shots unsharp . focus properly crank up aperture you'll get some very satisfying macro shots . only thing i wish this lens image stabilizer . canon , how 100mm macro ?	1
this camera excellent one !! really when you compare its price its results level quality you get you know why this best its category , i'm getting very professional results using it lot styles .. highly recommended	1
got lowero slingshot 100 2 months ago , it really coming handy . main area , it holds my pentax digital slr one lens mounted , 1 rather small lens 1 decently big zoom lens ( 80-320mm ) , plus sigma ef-500 super flash . it packed there , flash just barely fits , but i don't need much more room . top compartment holds extra batteries , recharger , etc . really easy access main pocket when it my back ... just pulling case my front ( no need take it off my back ) . well made . zippers strong so i don't worry one loosening my equipment falling out . perfect amateur semi-pro photographer .	1
when i bought this camera sales people tried get me buy battery . they said one came it would only good 20 minutes . now i bought alot items my lifetime , 20 min battery camera just doesnt seem like very good " business " choice . so i said no . so i got camera , charged battery until light went green ( which sucked because i wanted play it right when i got it ) started taking pictures ( oh i also got 2g cf ) worked great .... so i planned go up mountain take soem scenery shots . keeping mind what sales person told me i pocketed charger just incase . well , 6000 ' , 300 pictures , 5 hours later camera still running strong , still 200 shots left trip home , battery life indicator hasnt budged off full button . so all all , i think battery life great , now i see if your taking say thousands pictures all row you may need but just going trip shooting few pictures every stop point , original work fine . quality photos ..... i love them	1
careful when you use this lens because it not ( image stabilizer ) so if you shaky hands exposure any more than 1/8 second you going going get some blur . this why lens so cheap . this especially bad when you far end spectrum this lens . if you really zoomed it cloudy then you should know use tripod just case . this goes any lens , but if you using 300-mm end this then use tripod . it common sense , but i've loaned out this lens they complained me afterwards	1
i trying find way easily carry lot camera equipment quite some time . i tried backpacks , shoulder bags , duffel bags , but none them really worked all well . then i saw lowepro street field system completely customizable pouches , vests , belts , accessories . it works great , you only get pouches you need so there no waisted space you organize them however you want according how often they used ( put frequently used items easier access places . ) variety alone this system worth investment , but quality ease use also very high which big plus . you get case any lens , camera body , or accessory you . i even cases my cell phone water bottle . one word caution , sure measure your lens lens hood backwards if you use them make sure entire thing fit into pouch , because sometimes lens fit , but then lens lens hood not . i often carry 5-6 lenses , extension tubes , teleconverters , extra memory cards batteries , bunch cleaning supplies other gadgets , which weights ton . but when they evenly distributed this vest/belt lowepro system it actually very manageable . only down side everyone staring you because you thousands dollars camera equipment strapped your body . but if you overlook , this way go . i used this system many zoos without ever problems , fact just unzipping single lens switching seems safer me than opening entire bag equipment every time you want switch lenses . many cases also come built rain/snow cover so if weather changes all your equipment not destroyed . you also put just few pouches normal belt when you just going take photos back yard or don't need take all your equipment , which nice . i really can't say enough how much easier this makes traveling lot equipment , if you hopelessly searching better solution , consider this , you won't regret it .	1

bought this camera replace my 35mm camera . am pleased trade up i made . shape similar my old film camera . thought this would make it easier adjust smaller size it . it made transition relatively smooth . i'm sure there smaller cameras out there , but this one small enough . display also good size - bigger than most i looked . i am not genius computers , so i concerned i would need adapt downloading pictures camera pc . but , all i need plug cord click button . very easy follow any instructions . i notice display " freezes " second or two after picture taken . this not generally problem me most pictures posed shots . i run into some lag time during easter egg hunt this past weekend , but still managed get dozen good shots . overall , i like camera only wish i gotten up courage go digital sooner	1
i looked this camera panasonic hvx200 , sonys , jvc 200 , even canon bigger brother x1 . i found this one fantastic reviews dvinfo.net, great video forum . my concerns 24f vs 24p addressed my satisfaction- there really isn't difference . i like tape vs hvx expensive storage solutions . one concern i , it look like pro camera ? important some situations where your equipment gives you added credibilty clients talent . soon i opened box i love ! this really substantial camera . especially opt wide angle canon matte box provided , this not look like your mama camcorder . i really like manual controls , so you don't go thru menus change parameters . layout everything great . i really like dual on/off zoom controls- top handle plus rear right side . holding handle low or medium height shots very , very comfortable controls perfectly positioned . only down side- it incidental . matte box bit flimsy- lightweight plastic . helps weight , but i worry breaking it . some may say hdv codec not good dvcpro , but my eye not see it . colors magnificent it blows away many other cams low-light . if you looking point shoot , this not your baby , but if you want pro quality camera really great price- this it	1

less than $200 this great camera . it no means spectacular , but price , it good job . i own canon powershot s60 well , canon outdoes this camera some ways , but it not pocketable . f20 easy use , menu interface fairly simple self-descriptive , it powers up ready take picture quickly , shutter lag seems average ( close s60 ) . however , only way eliminate shutter lag buy dslr . " anti-shake " mechanism not really useful all , it merely boosts iso 2000 which makes image unprintable ( least indoors ) . i yet try it this feature outside . i've also found dialing down exposure compensation helps lowlights , especially outdoors . manually setting iso 100-400 , i hope , make more printable , usable pictures . i actually thought returning this little camera , but then realized i could find nothing , price , would able compete . i really wanted 28mm lens , only found more expensive models like canon sd800is , or lumix ( which apparently tons noise low iso ) . it pocketable , portable , little tinkering you get what you want it .	1

i purchased this camera my son . he doctoral student needed photograph items his research . he able learn use it quickly . battery life phenomenal	1
reasons buy it : 1 . cheap , mere $140.2 . packed features . complete auto mode ( point shoot ) fully manual mode . 4mp 3x optical zoom good enough most situations . 3 . picture quality good . it better than other two cameras i own ( olympus c720 uz sony dsc s600 ) . 4 . compact . it smaller than it looks stock photo . 5 . fast . switches ready first shot within 1.5 seconds . other things i liked camera : - good ergonomics . fits nicely my hand , all buttons well placed easy access . i even switch camera take pictures one hand . - powerful flash . enough fill up moderate size room . - great video mode sound . it also comes audio video cable so you connect camera your tv watch vidoes pictures your tv . - lcd decent size fairly bright , which means it even visible outdoors daytime . things i didn't like camera : - manual could more detailed . there bsaic manual sort quick start guide . but there no 40 page booklet which explained each every feature detail . - auto focus illuminator ( help focussing low light ) little bright annoying sometimes . but upside you get good focus even really low light conditions . - not come battery charger . i bought rechargeable batteries charger separately . i owned olympus c720 uz newer sony dsc s600 , but i think this camera better than both them .	1
this camera very similar fuji f30 , but face detection ( fd ) autofocuses faces photo . great taking pictures yourself , or snapshots you don't time compose . excellent quality photos dim light . 3200 iso , photos washed out noisy , but still good capturing image you would otherwise miss . option limit iso 1600 , or 400 . camera use any speed up limit . 400 iso extremely good . good my canon digital rebel xti . usual modes i never use ( flower , landscape , etc . ) , but one unique mode i use all time : no flash/flash . camera takes picture without flash up 3200 iso , then takes picture flash immediately after . usually takes less than one second capture both images . no flash doesn't surprise anyone ruin candid shot , while following flash guarantees you'll get image , even if " warm glow candlelight " ruined . i always camera set this mode . uses xd cards , which i hate , but if you buy 1 gb card you'll able take 400 - 500 photos without ever needing change card . also , battery life unbelieveable ! fully charge camera over several hours , you'll able take 400 photos , half flash , before battery drained . fuji-brand underwater housing optional , watertight 40m ( 121 ft . ) camera comes underwater setting intensify non-blue colours , still keep intense blue water . literally * every * diver should one these cameras . i recommend this camera without hesitation . there simply isn't anything else like it market .	1

i see lot people trouble tracking baseballs this thing . i've owned one 3 years it works pretty well . i give some tips it : !!! if you throw respectable speed , don't follow correct procedure it not work - there no reading !! 1 ) don't stand behind metal fence . chain links plastic coating over them work , but whatever reason exposed metal interferes signal . 2 ) focus beam radar gun very narrow . whole idea keep beam ball long possible . just ball pass through radar beam not enough . you need keep beam ball practically whole pitch . 3 ) use rechargable batteries ... this isn't save money . some better energizer rechargable high amperage , 1350 ma up . gun tends respond better this , its pretty power hungry . you get more consistant readings better batteries . non-rechargable batteries cannot provide same level current ( usually 850 ma or less ) , which seem effect gun . so , how would you properly use gun ? one way stand behind mound pitcher throws . forget using it during game , behind backstop . it wont work . try line up pitchers release point plate , then situate your gun so it fires this imaginary line ( connecting pitchers hand target . you may slightly change angle gun track pitch , which slightly tricky . follow ball gun long you . sure fire way clock throw , get cheap net stand behind it . you register it every time . you also most accurate reading	1

i got this lens my 300d ( digital rebel ) kit enjoyed it ever since . solid , durable , reliable , good most light situations . lots success wide-angle landscape photos . i'm typically using this 18mm end it produced beautiful images , especially sunset indoors flash . also very light small , i just toss it my bag i'm set . pretty decent close-up stuff well like flowers , etc . overall it good starter lens if you're getting it kit , but you could probably grab it used $60 i would guess if you're just looking good all-around lens	1
great product . compact , easy use ( took couple trys ) , feels good able put two large digital cameras , four lenses room more . love it	1
this great camera . plenty resolution . excellent shot speed . sturdy frame . kit lense doesn't camera justice . buy body separate add better lense . bad side , i small glitch camera firmware soon after purchase return it fix . it two months before camera returned . sorry , canon ... you lose star	1
i keep it short sweet . very sharp - quick autofocus . i use it my canon 20d .	1
i just received canon bge2 battery grip yesterday already it attached my eos 30d ( nice ) . unit fits very well very secure . i no trouble aligning tightening grip camera body . i also found additional shutter release very handy . addition , shape unit allows solid " grip " vertical orientation well . i too already extra battery pack , two batteries required . please note unit comes canon bgm-e2 battery holder , which allows you use aa batteries . there no need buy this accessory ( unless you want second aa battery magazine ) . one accessory compliments battery grip very well canon hand strap e1 . this strap designed work neck strap yet provides added security control battery grip ( well worth $25-$30 )	1
i owned this lens year before upgrading image stabilized f/ 2.8 version . overall i very happy f/4 lens miss it available because significantly lower weight . sharpness amazing comparable both lenses , f/4 provide plenty background blur . if you shooting mostly outdoors i would recommend f/4 .	1
i bought this camera $249 new which marked down $499 retail . this older model new models just come out . money this good camera , but i am very particular not blown away . images good , but i expecting more vibrance . colors bit weak . it not take focused shot indoors unless flash , flash way bright closer shots . image often over exposed , i find myself placing piece paper over flash get more correct shot . i upgraded canon a40 2 megapixel camera ( amazing camera ! ) , images very similar quality , except new sd500 captures them bigger , 7 megapixel chip , hence little better detail . i like small size , battery lasts long time charges . holds lots pictures 1 gig card i purchased seperatly . video quality quite good still camera .	1
i enjoy i get closer shot now . its quality good . i am happy purchas	1
this same canon grip , made same factory . i don't know how they get away it , but it consumer gain here . through 2 batteries your over hundred bucks ahead --- spend all those lenses you'll end up getting xti/400d .	1
i'm not sure why " rkm001 " so many issues this product . i owned one two months now use it very heavily . it cuts straight line me everytime i never something " stick " cutting strip . i actually bought this one replace very worn ( more expensive trimmer/cutter ) i years , wish i it sooner	1
i bought my camera few months ago , so i chance figure out most its features , not all lol , but i consider good thing ( extra features means more messing around it ^-^ . well anyways it excellent camera , it all things i want it too , its half price rebel . video it takes amazing record till there no space sd card . me i sandisk 1g securememory sd card i take 27 minutes it which plenty . 38 secounds 38mb internal drive . i take 329 pictures 1g sd 10 internal . battery great it , i used it countless hours havent gotten one bar go down , so 2-3 days use run it down . so i asume 8-10 hours . i never it die me , out me intentually letting it ( i guess its better let battery run out then charge it ) focus zoom feature fun play camera comes really handy ( extra zoom there zoom button top left camera , so you really dont need buy one those cameras 10x ) what else ? well manual features ( biggest reason i got camera)so play ap ., iso , shutter speed they so fun mess , even hue photo which i didnt expect like , i actually got off really good shots . auto features come handy too , just click shoot ! macro neat feature , get close its amazing your shots beautiful ! screen good , crowd around me most still see image screen ( i take video my boyfriend friends sparing)the mic top , it its job ( when its windy you actually block wind without even knowing because your hand while " , off-shoot " button covers it ( good design)uploads pic quickly computer deleting picutres extremely quick easy . af ( auto-focus ) , focus , ae easy get quick fixs other then focus front camera . flash good . well i hope my long drawn out review helpful . i hope you enjoy your camera . i shortly purchasing smaller camera v-logs possible canon sd630 . but yes buy kodak p880 mega-pix simply amazing	1
my mom lost her usb cable her digital camera amazon always everything i need so i order it her	1
this also correct lens hood new ef 70-300mm f4- 5.6 usm lens . 4 stars because it $40 piece plastic should included both its intended lenses . shame your cheap ways , canon	1
unlike some other reviewers , i've no problems this battery ... i've it over year . i'm pro photographer , so it recharged over over over still holds charge . maybe it better because i tend totally drain my batteries before recharging ? i also use this battery dual battery grip alongside canon other off brand batteries	1
obviously , i am enamored nikon d80 . one who extensively used d100 , d70s , d200 , i curious how d80 would " shake out " comparison these fine cameras . answer it very well indeed . most obvious improvement d80 over d70s d100 upgrade 6.1 10.2 megapixels -- same its " big brother , " d200 this not major issue many users , 6.1 mp image ( uncropped ) looks essentially exactly same 10.2 mp image . however , if user intends crop images post-processing , larger amount resolution becomes importan t--t he more megapixels more detail when images cropped . shooters wildlife , example , appreciate additional resolution d80 , it often necessary photograph wildlife distance then crop image cause subject dominate frame . other very obvious d80 improvements larger viewfinder larger rear-lcd . these very welcome improvements , also borrowed d200 . viewfinder wide , bright , literal joy use . combined 11-point autofocus system ( basically same d200 although some differences options ) viewfinder makes d80 powerhouse camera moving subjects , or framing subject places other than center image . autofocus fast sure . i literally never use manual focus d80 -- autofocus just too good not use almost every conceivable situation . 2.5 inch rear lcd bright vivid -- joy use . this too , mentioned above , borrowed d200 . menu selections d80 closely track those d200 largely pretty intuitive anyone who somewhat familiar nikon system . few nits . first all , d80 not selection focus-priority continuous focus mode . this unfortunate , such option ( present d200 ) allows fast action shots using continuous-focus surety subject , fact , focus . happily , this absence ( which i predict hope nikon correct later firmware revision ) not huge loss . i shot hundreds images fast-flying birds using continuous focus d80 images almost all perfectly focused . user trust d80 continuous focus mode , focus priority or no . nikon chose equip d80 sd cards rather than cf cards . why nikon this mystery many us d80 clearly upgrade wonderful d70s , which uses cf cards . further , d80 fantastic backup camera d200 users , d200 , course , also uses cf cards rather than sd cards . cf cards would more logical choice my opinion d80 . fortunately , cost these media dropping so fast this less issue than it would few years ago . d80 sucks up power lot faster than d70s . 2.5 inch lcd entails higher power use price . most users want own spare battery . ergonomics , d80 terrific ! i just finished 8 day stay maui , hawaii , during which my d80 literally always me . weight camera low , its bulk , reasonable . there no digital slr i would rather carry extended period than compact d80 . placement various controls excellent , pretty intuitive . quality d80 body construction standard nikon-prosumer grade , which say , excellent albeit not heavy-duty metal-body d200 . overall , d80 destined become one great nikon cameras find place users all over world	1
i got this much safety anything . if i should drop my lens , solid lens hood help . plastic construction absorb some impact without transmitting all it , metal hood would . hopefully it eliminate occurances flair , although canon 50mm 1.4 lens , that not big issue begin . it also keep dust debris off lens surface if you're shooting less-than-ideal environment . it twists off lens easily . when it , it very snug secure . kind pricy piece plastic , but canon business make money .	1
what i say ? it fits place overpriced canon nb3l battery my sd500 lasts longer than oem battery . quality battery external very good . no sloppy glued edges or ill-fitting parts . battery works very well camera lasts longer one hundred or so shots . i use gig card so i tend shot alot once . even flash battery life comparable canon or even longer . i bought two instead single canon battery i not dissappointed	1
wow all there say no problems it perfect casual picture take	1
fairly decent . produces pictures optical blur edges if you use zoom . leaves black semicircle pictures taken flash 1/5 way up bottom picture because flash isn't tall enough miss wide lens . other than .. it capture few more degrees . if you going pick this or telephoto attachment , get this .	1
i used this lens over 6 months now over 1k shots through it . it fantastic others note herein . 2.8 through focus range really great . superb . vr function really neat trick . it super fun play . drawbacks size weight . after 1/2 hour shooting , your arms get tired . remember careful hold lens not camera . this lens definately heavy enough bend/warp camera body	1
this what i discovered when i've used my brand new 1d markiinwell , i say i am truly impressed this camera . friend mine got his month ago , so i played it little bit , but since i got mine thursday , i really gotten explore many features performance differences beween this camera 20d i upgraded . used few original 1d cameras , 1d mark ii , 20d battery grip 5d , size weight this camera really doesnt bother me ( i heard so many people complain size weight before ... ) i actually really like feel 1d mark ii . there only slight difference original 1d mark ii feel , but if you hold them side side you notice it . autofocus absolutely stunning . used 20d year half , i forgotten how nice it those 45 highly sensitive autofocus points ! soon you pick up this camera hold shutter button half way down , you realize why this #1 choice many best photojournalists . body construction highest quality i ever seen camera , but course very similar , if not identical other 1d series cameras . compared 20d 5d though , this thing just feels solid . stunning feature , course , speed which 1d mark ii capture images ... 8.5 frames per second ! just 1d 1d mark ii past few years , this camera holds its own all other cameras its class , 22 frame raw bursts 8.5 frames per second . i hardly ever shoot jpeg , but i test it found 48 frame buffer quite impressive . packing two 2 gig sandisk ultra ii cards ( cf sd ) i capacity 450 total shots . screen , course , fantastic , blows any nikon camera menu image review quality out water . 1.3 crop factor certainly improvement over 20d 1.6 , bigger sensor definitely yields better image quality low light due lower signal-to-noise ratio . overall , color reproduction , metering , exposure sharpness all much better than 20d . since i love wildlife photography i able get 75% more caption information than i ever my pervious camerasthe camera performs great studio , images beautiful , would expected . i yet make any photographic prints this camera , but i'm sure they look stunning .	1
i digital cameras 5 years still own olympus 5 megapixel , casio 7 megapixel . seems like megamixels alone just don't cut it me . i read rebel xt magazine looked up user reviews here amazon . i decided go buy one though i am really novice , i am extremely impressed . i never seen such stunning quality or realistic colors point shoot . i started basic settings love results . i am slowly progressing more advanced settings am getting better everyday . even novice who just wants stunning photography amazed this camera . i also bought tamron 75-300 autofocus zoom lens ( look it here amazon.com ) after lots practice , able take some great pictures . i brother uk who also into digital photography , after seeing some ( full reso ) photos i sent him , he rushed out bought xti ( called eos 400d across pond)and amazed it . i still lot learn but really cannot fault this camera . included software also excellent . record , some reviews seem think it too small hold , i big hands don't any problems all . i admit though this first slr i ever owned . i still keep point shoot keep my travel bag spontaneous photography but i am love my rebel xt !! this camera costs quite chunk change but i think it well worth it i recommend it everyone	1
ive used this product twice dont really any major complaints . my pictures came out great . i used it drag strip needed it taking pictures cars flying nighttime i able capture them nicely due no camera shake ( using tripod course well ) . only thing i dont particularly like it goes into lock position quite easily taking extra pictures arent needed , also small hole wire inserted packing doesnt really hold it well wire just kinda unravels , but i would recommend it anyone who need it	1
i received case quickly love it ! it perfect fit sd700is protects it nicely . it also nice quality leather looks nice well	1
i gave this my wife her birthday , so far no complaints all . camera plenty functions you play , but it also work point shoot situations . good quality pictures , it looks feels top notch	1
i am not photographer , but i enjoy taking good pictures . i never digital slr before ; camera i before d50 nikon coolpix ( compact one ) . i thought this would good camera someone who enjoys good pictures without pro . i realized it even better than what i expected ( maybe because i coming nikon coolpix ) . colors amazing quality picture extremely good . d50 among cheapest digital slr , , same time , it very serious product . i don't think d50 much inferior canon rebel , even if canon 2 more megapixels resolution . i used both d50 ( which i own ) rebel ( my school ) i think d50 feels much more like " pro camera " when you hold it your hands , while rebel feels more like toy . lenses provided package good , but basic . according me 18-55 better than 28-80 , but i think i should bought 55-200 well : 18 200 covers most pictures you take . also 18-135 nikon sells d80 looks good me , but they don't make kit those lenses d50 . last thing really amazes me . nef format ( nikon raw format ) . it impressive how quickly you improve . nef picture your computer just very few clicks mouse . if you want good camera , you don't want spend too much money it i think this best choice	1
it would cost you more buy these separately . battery alone could cost this much . rest accessories come handy . i originally wanted this only battery , but now , i options . great value . buy it	1
i trying find way easily carry lot camera equipment quite some time . i tried backpacks , shoulder bags , duffel bags , but none them really worked all well . then i saw lowepro street field system completely customizable pouches , vests , belts , accessories . it works great , you only get pouches you need so there no waisted space you organize them however you want according how often they used ( put frequently used items easier access places . ) variety alone this system worth investment , but quality ease use also very high which big plus . you get case any lens , camera body , or accessory you . i even cases my cell phone water bottle . one word caution , sure measure your lens lens hood backwards if you use them make sure entire thing fit into pouch , because sometimes lens fit , but then lens lens hood not . i often carry 5-6 lenses , extension tubes , teleconverters , extra memory cards batteries , bunch cleaning supplies other gadgets , which weights ton . but when they evenly distributed this vest/belt lowepro system it actually very manageable . only down side everyone staring you because you thousands dollars camera equipment strapped your body . but if you overlook , this way go . i used this system many zoos without ever problems , fact just unzipping single lens switching seems safer me than opening entire bag equipment every time you want switch lenses . many cases also come built rain/snow cover so if weather changes all your equipment not destroyed . you also put just few pouches normal belt when you just going take photos back yard or don't need take all your equipment , which nice . i really can't say enough how much easier this makes traveling lot equipment , if you hopelessly searching better solution , consider this , you won't regret it .	1
jim . made great review ..... i just wanted let you know i agree . this great . it very light weight . only reason why i gave it 4 stars you need zoom bit or else you get burnout effect ( circle where corners dark because it getting inside lens ) . annoying , forces you remove extender when you want take closer photos . distance though , it great . pictures come out great . i highly recommend this ..... i would given it 4.5 stars if it option	1
i find these ph160 packages toner cartridges photo paper best deal me . i take lot pictures print them off send postcards friends all over usa . this way i plenty photo paper hand good supply toner cartridges don't constantly run store buy single toner cartridge package photo paper . i wish however you could just buy toner cartridges without photo paper i always more paper than what i use number toner cartridges	1
i decided get this after buying rebel xti already owning rebel xt ( this works both . ) i already corded shutter release which nice when doing long exposures or macro work where even little camera shake make huge difference . but this goes new level , you set camera up get everything focus then step back take many shots you want without any risk touching camera . make sure cover eyepiece when using this so stray light doesn't ruin your exposure . this also handy when you want take pictures you them . i even used it two cameras once get multiple angles same shot . i am thinking setting up blind setting up camera tripod try get some close up pictures wildlife would not possible otherwise . basically if you ever need take pictures without holding camera this your solution	1
this great lens . i use it full-frame film digital slrs , love getting ultrawide shots . however , if you cash , you'll probably happier 16-35/ 2.8 lens , f4 pretty slow indoors	1
i not trust any batteries except canon my canon cameras . i found " compatible " batteries not always charge incanon charger , not last long camera	1
i purchased this camera year ago ( summer 05 ) . definitely great upgrade over original rebel , although new xti larger screen which one aspect this camera not perfect . there other sites perform more comprehensive reviews this camera , but after year mine still working perfectly	1
i'm not sure why " rkm001 " so many issues this product . i owned one two months now use it very heavily . it cuts straight line me everytime i never something " stick " cutting strip . i actually bought this one replace very worn ( more expensive trimmer/cutter ) i years , wish i it sooner	1
this my second " " lens other 70-200l f4 both exceptional . if you looking professional results you need good equipment used within it limits .	1
this product served its purpose ; it same cord hooking up camera pc one came my camera	1
this good , affordable uv filter protecting your expensive lenses . i leave it my lens all time . this particular filter ( l-39 sharp cut ) especially good wide angle lenses ( lt ; 24mm focal length ) , because its ultrathin profile , which prevents vignetting . i used regular filters wide angle lenses , very bad results . although this filter not multi-coated , i not found it big deal pictures i've taken . multi-coated uv filters cost 2x or 3x price this one , which i don't think worthwhile . all all , i recommend this filter canon or non-canon lenses	1
amazon states ; product dimensions : 13.0 10.0 7.0 inchesthere no photo ( until i uploaded one ) so i thought this size stated , but turned out one little keychain bags 5x5 cloth inside . works fine , just not what i thought it , didn't want someone else think it large also . see my photo actual size next some keys . update 4/8/2006 i see they added photo what i thought i getting when i ordered .. see my uploaded photo " customer " photos see what they sent . not sure which you would get this point .. edit 07/29/2006i see now then price i paid jumps $5 $20 some strange reason .. i add it good product @ $5 but not $20	1
may i introduce you one least know yet most superb lenses canon makes . you probably even stumbled this page accident , looking canon lens , looking various macros , or even just intrigued this higher-priced lens you've probably never even considered . let me just say this this lens : ultra sharp . ultra colorful . ultra contrast . ultra solid . like everybody else , i initially bought this lens its macro . 60mm 100mm options lot cheaper , but my collection entirely l-class i'd learned trust putting gobs money into lenses red ring . so i put my money where my l-faith went this lens . needless say , my faith rewarded again . yeah , sure it got 1.0 macro capability , this important . but what i wasn't expecting image quality . it unbelievably good . now i'm not somebody who taking his first trip into land comparing this lens $300 run-of-the-mill glass . i've used six l-class lenses significantly i'm comparing this lens ' image quality those . you find yourself using this lens much its 180mm focal length f/ 3.5 aperture dictates . lens versatile both super-fine telephoto 1.0 macro . macro capability main feature . 1.0 macro literally means 35mm wide object completely fill 35mm frame . basically , it small microscope . if you dare dial aperture wide-open f/ 3.5 , dof approximately thickness two sheets writing paper 1.0 . needless say , you'll need tripod , preferably macro rails slide forwards rearwards ultimate control . ( those you new macro , focusing lens changes magnification factor . so one focuses object , object size viewfinder changes . this why i mention macro rails , they allow you achieve focus physically move lens/camera out reachieve desired composition . ) telephoto , due this lens ' superb image quality , it actually produces images much greater quality than 70-200mm f/ 2.8 . ( i know firsthand , i own it too ) difference 70-200mm versatility . if light drops too low , f/ 2.8 bests f/ 3.5 quite rapidly . if distance subjects change quickly or you unable move your feet frame images , 180mm too constricting zoom win . but under conditions where 180mm f/ 3.5 perform unhindered ( such airshow or out flower hunting ) , it consistantly produce brighter , more saturated , sharper images than 70-200mm f/ 2.8 . there complaint circulates slow speed which this lens autofocuses , expecially annoying when trying used telephoto . this actually incorrect . lens ' autofocus drive infact move very quickly , but it must traverse all way infinity 4 " front lens find subject . this where wait time comes into effect . here solution : utilizing af limiter switch allows you limit af search only infinity 5 ' front lens . consequently , this range 10% focus range ( other 90% 5 ' 4 " ) . i no longer experience af " hunting " problems when trying use 180mm telephoto . some other info this lens : front objective element actually concave . i think this only lens canon makes concave front element . it probablyexpensive replace if accident should occur , so utilize uv filter ( 72mm filter size ) . i recommend only b+w or hoya multi-coated brands . ( yes they're pricey , but worth it)the hood this lens actually little too small my opnion . if shooting backlit object , i sometimes get heavy orange glow viewfinder soi am forced use my hand " hood extender " block sunlight . its size , this lens relatively lightweight . it much lighter than 70-200mm f/ 2.8 easily handholdable extended periods time . this lens compatible canon extenders . i personally used it 1.4 extender . results excellent . while ca sharpness degrade noticeably 70-200mm , this lens shows barely difference image quality , except change designation 252mm f/5 , course . add fact macro capability now gone 1.0 1.4 , big bonus . so whom this lens apply ? -those who neither macro or telephoto prime who desire single piece handle both aspects excellent results . -those who plan performing professional product photography . -those looking into serious nature photography ( packing this lens wide-angle pretty much all you'll need day hike ) . what this lens not well : -low-light photography . -event photography . -landscapes . alternatives : -60mm/100mm : lesser image quality , less telephoto compression macro images , no real double-duty telephoto , but whole lot cheaper wider aperture . -mp-e 65mm : much greater magnification ( 5.0 ) , lower image quality , no telephoto capability , odd design means studio use almost exclusivel	1
if you intermediate level photography need camera bag strong comfortable this bag may you . i fit my canon s2is , adapter , two filters or lens this bag . this all i expected what i read this product . if you slr multiple lenses ,,, sorry ,,, you spend more bucks bigger bag .	1

manufactured soft gray felt like material , tough leather bottom , draw string closure top , this lens pouch helps protect your lens dust elements . i store my lenses camera bag , these cases fit nicely around lens taking up little precious space . this case meant use canon 28 135mm 3.5 - 5.6 usm , 28 200mm 3.5 - 5.6 usm ef lenses . these lenses not normally come case when sold new . amazon often suggests purchasing one your lens , worth considering depending how you store your lenses . pros : protects your glass investment cons : i cannot think	1
this case perfect carrying protecting my camera . can't imagine not it	1
while it isn't fashionable use anything but zoom lens anymore , this series 135mm fixed focus lens " real deal " . it superbly sharp , fast , easy use . i took it africa me astounded its brilliant clarity . great portraits ... anything requiring mid-length telephoto . highly recommended	1
i recently purchased used canon 300mm f4 it didn't case . this lightweight case perfect this lens . it fits snugly , but not too tigh t.t he case lined 1/2 " high density foam . i'm pretty sure this case would adequately protect heavy series lens 4-5 foot fall . case used my tamarac mas bag , but most time i sling lens case over my shoulder using attached shoulder strap . this very secure , reasonably priced lens case provides excellent protection your valuable lenses .	1
i am very happy gotten this flash .. it works pretty well , i like its performance	1
good quality filter set great price . i so happy it i purchased sets all my lenses cameras ! same filters my local camera store more than double price	1
i this camera little over year i still can't put it down . it wonderful . i two little boys move this camera takes their picture hardly any delay . just snap go . i bought my dad xp march he loves it too .	1
i highly recommend raynox dcr 1540pro teleconverter canon s2 instead canon branded one . hoya makes 67mm uv filter this both available lensmate.com . canon wc-dc58a wide angle converter however really good . tiffen made better one but it seems not available anymore . way , function s2 provides settings using lens adaptors teleconvertors adjust autofocus function camera necessary unless you wish try focus yourself using manual focus which , my mind , because lcd both screen well viewfinder lower resolution than optical viewfinder , iffy best . trust camera ..... it really excellent job . one final note , i would recommend using focus bracketing option lower light situations auto focus weak those situations .	1
i really pleased my item ! amazon shipped phenomenal packaging ! thanks ...	1
yes , this lens already legend , no , it not just bunch people trying justify spending whole lot cash lens . make no mistake , this lens big expensive . it not fitting into your travel bag nor it home friend party . bring 18-70mm , 28-200g or just bring cheaper ps type camera case you spill beer it ! 70-200 vr pro level lens gets almost everything right . it size byproduct optical design really makes few , if any compromises . this lens sharp ... sharp my 50mm prime sharper wide open you might believe or expect . d70 focus lightening fast quite exact . color rendition best i've seen . i much less post processing when this baby d70 . problematic side , this lens big . it heavy way , though reasonably easy grasp . i added harbortronics portrait grip handling/balance improved . it needs big bag focuses down bit under 5 feet . while it fantastic portrait lens , you need room get most out it . my first shots this lens put my more experienced lenses shame . bokeh , or quality out-of-focus areas creamy pleasing . subjects 3d quality them . vr system exactly what you'd expect . i sat my couch , framed text my dvd player 8 feet away shot f/ 2.8 iso 200 1/2 second exposure . 200mm ( 300mm d70 ) image sharp . without vr i got big blur . real question : you need 1700 dollar lens ? answer : only if you want it . quality all there level people talking this lens like it magic . i friends who shoot pro canon nikon . even canon users say 70-200vr best it kind . sell kidney buy one	1
ive gotten used disposable kodaks i got checkout isle walmart . problem those , though , they run out pictures pretty quick . last straw when we ran out film family reunion just cousin billy show us how catch lizard rubber band twinky . point i knew i needed upgrade . i ordered canon eos-1ds mark ii next day , [ ... ] feature first caught my attention powerful zoom . now when i take family picture , i like step back mile or two , then zoom snap high-resolution masterpeice . my wife always complains i zoom too close into big pores her nose , which i respond suggesting she use clean clear pore cleansing strips ( watch her upcoming review those soon ) . useful feature this camera continuous shooting mode . this where camera automatically takes pictures rapid succession , 5 per second . other day i set camera dresser , turned macarena , got wild . i then took individual pictures strung them together into animated flipbook . now watching myself macarena mere flip book away . man i dance . summarize , you lot fun this cam like i . definitely worth [ ... ] ! but remember , there [ ... ] comes it ; so make sure you fill item number clearly [ ... ] card , make sure you stay within space alloted form otherwise [ ... ] wont go through	1

i used this sb-600 my fuji s3 digital camera friend wedding . i found you need diffuser ( such omni bounce ) , otherwise you get shadows . it works great bouncing off ceiling fill whole room . this flash easy use , reliable batteries didn't die until picture #637 . i no instances it not going off when i took picture ever	1
i'm recreational photographer , i love this camera . this my 7th month beast -- since i pre-ordered it early amazon mistake . ( long story)before buying 1d mii , you should know few things : 1 . it easy overlook spec camera usb connection 1.1 not 2.0 . this 40 times slower , canon clearly intended mark ii connected via firewire . said , i occasionally use it my laptop road , which only usb connection . it convenient port there , but my 1gb cf card takes good half hour empty . 2 . time you've attached solid series or comparable lens this camera , it weighs enough lugging it around your shoulder , even without camera bag full tricks , quite burden . also , i talking professional photographer who wouldn't buy model just because cameras this heavy give her wrist trouble . if you've never held camera this size your hand , i recommend borrowing one first or checking our your local camera store , even if you ultimately buy amazon . 3 . camera conveniently supports both sd cf cards . unfortunately there no way copy two cards using camera . it not gigantic deal , but there times i wait get home trip free up sd card when i didn't camera cable , but just external cf reader . those really only 3 things i wish i'd known before i bought camera ... but would they affected my purchase ? probably not ! i said , i bought camera mistake . it loads fun ? definitely . i prints almost good medium format - 100 times convenience .	1
received some christmas cash , i put it good use purchase this lens . it works great my digital rebel certainly fine choice any eos canons . sure , it pricey little heavy , but if you want fast , wide-angle zoom lens , there little else equivalent . zoom range takes you wide scenics excellent indoor flash shots 35mm ( canon speedlite ex accessory ) . usm focusing motor quiet very quick . comes canon lens hood . don't forget add 77mm uv filter protect optics full time !	1
i bought this camera my wife christmas 04 ' i thought i ordered it too late it arrive time christmas , but these people great ! they got it me time we love this camera we use it all time - we several accs . item it quality picture wonderful . thanks mark christian	1
let me first start off saying - long time canon user . i own 6 or 7 lenses , including three series lenses , this far one my favorites - if not my absolute favorite . i shoot mostly glamour erotica type work 20d . so right there , this lens not true 15mm me - but 1.6 x15mm . it sharp tack . it light weight . it very short ( i call it nub lens ) . it autofocus amazing . very little barrel distortion ... highly recommended . this lens probably sharp ( if not sharper ) than my 24-70 2.8 or my 17-40 4.0 lens .	1
i wish there also photo showed backside this camera case . if there i would known this excellent quality case unfortunately not belt loop which what i looking this product . great quality nevertheless	1
though lenses my nikon d50 not expensive some they still several hundred dollars this uv protection filter protecting lens glass made whole lot sense . i feel less stress when i clean filter lens than if i wiping dust dirt actual lens glass . this size , 52mm , what specified my d50 it fits perfectly , it should . i no complaints all manufacturer or seller . if you new digital slr like i then get this filter protect your lens . spend your time worrying sensor when you need switch out your lens .	1
i not repeat what other reviews stated already , all reviews below pretty much correct this camera high quality easy use etc etc . only issue focusing small target such name brand logo inside rolex watch . it hard even manual mode ( i actually alot digital camera experience ) . forget trying focus auto mode , it won't happen .. least not without alot tinkering stress . if you need take alot close up pictures small detailed items ( jewelery , insects , etc . ) then i recommend buying digital slr camera , nikon d50 good one ! this fuji you looking here perfect taking pictures normal things like people , cars , buildings , sites , etc	1
i always used third party lenses before but after trying this canon i say i am impressed quality , it feels like solid piece equipment rather than hunk lightweight plastic . i find my photos much sharper due lens itself . i tremors my hands so difficult time normal lens but helped tremendously . i like range zoom it pretty much all purpose me ( used kit lens only once since i got this lens when i needed wider angle ) . i could occasionally/rarely use little more distance but nothing perfect . my only complaint lens heavy pretty much doubles weight my camera ( rebel xt ) . you know it around your neck after few hours shooting . i haven't any focus hunting problems , which i constantly 3rd party lenses . lens very quiet which imo good thing . reasonably priced lens it well worth money	1
i no investment dslr but narrowed my choices canon 30d nikon d200 . i always wanted nikon . d200 definitely joy hold it take good pictures ( i tried both camera store before i bought 30d ) . i lot research ( more than i care admit ! ) there no conclusive evidence one camera clear edge over other . depending your specific needs , one camera may " slightly better " than other . after trying out both cameras , i convinced 30d good fit my needs d200 . " value money " 30d clear winner over d200 ( i got mine when canon cash canon promotion going ) . also , beginner slr i found 30d its fully automatic scene modes easy start out . i don't expect use scene modes or full auto mode after week or two . i expect quickly graduate creative control zones . but use family camera , quick scene modes very helpful . if you expect use it more professional basis it'd probably not matter . additionally , when i checked it out store , i noticed canon 30d focused sharply almost every time . d200 not least few times . i'd take this grain salt though since it brief trial store . but i thought i'd share my experience . it may just anomaly actual equipment i tried out . i still find nikon d200 great camera ? absolutely ! i regret bought canon 30d ? absolutely not ! decision swinger my case really " money factor " . i more than willing spend up $300 more nikon d200 . but when difference became $550 it no longer became justifiable my christmas gift myself :-) my purchases included canon 30d [ ... ] , canon 17-85mm ef-s usm lens [ ... ] , sandisk extreme iii 2gb compact flash card [ ... ] i plan add external flash this soon , consider eventual lenses after i determine camera long-term keeper .	1
i my research before purchasing this particular frame found lot praise philips brand digital frames . i've not dissapointed all ! it really easy set up photo resolution incredible . i actually bought kodak version originally , returned it because it seemed low quality . philips major upgrade kodak	1
camera works fine i record performances various bands i play . sound ok ( just remember keep your fingers away mike ) , it records fairly well most nightclub situations , but if it dark , video dark well . usb connection great thing , but remember it needs disconnected via software before you jerk camera away computer . i damaged hard drive my very first use , now i only record 16min . video before i'm full . it my fault	1
i love this camera . so far its best digital camera i've owned . only problem this camera it eats batteries like crazy . its best buy rechargable batteries so you dont spend so much money	1
initially i wary after reading few reports this case may leak , but so far i no problems all . i tested it 12 feet bottom my swimming pool ( 1lb lead weight inside make it sink ) then took it 130 feet several dives following day my trusty s400 camera . great pictures , clear video , what great product . my dive buddy taken his over 200 feet it still works fine . only problem may finding source replacement o-rings .	1
canon powershot a540 6mp digital camera worked great right out box . it very easy use delivers great pictures . view screen very large i really like option using view finder take pictures . i took 330 pictures my first set batteries came camera . price point $175 , i not think there better camera market	1
i use this filter my nikon n80 . works great . under $10 , this great buy	1
this just worked . no other way say it . needed protect my hdr-hc3 during some planned water shooting while windsurfing cape hatteras . figured less than $200 , this worth shot . never got open box before trip , but took it anyway , just case . temptation too strong , i decided go field . managed configure camera housing front seat my car beach , close it up , shoot some great water video 20 kt day canadian hole . too cool . only two minor issues , neither worth star ... 1 ) instructions where/how mount camera housing little tough follow . only because sony put one set directions like 50 different languages very large fold out sheet made very lightweight paper . didn't help i trying it car cold hands windy day . but still , directions not all ergonomic . functional ? completely . user friendly ? no ... 2 ) reflective viewfinder worked well enough , but you shield ambient light or you couldn't very well see what you shooting . admittedly , this extreme test environment bright mid-day sun surface water lots reflection due wind wave action ( including lots'o'whitecaps ) . mainly requires adjustment your shooting posture , specifically put your face up against housing , which little awkward first , but then completely endurable ... added bonus , which surprised me : audio take while housing quite good . conversations those filmed observers nearby completely intelligible . didn't expect , but very pleasantly surprised . means your color commentary continue unabated ..	1
i digital camera owner since 640x480 days when digi cams size bricks , now i one that small deck cards ... sd300 . i've it almost year now , it keeps kicking . i read all reviews cracked lcd screens all , but i took my chances anyways ... quite frankly , screen itself taken beating me , it all scratched up my pocket , banging around my keys coins , etc . i applied thin screen protector it fixes cosmetic blemishes ( added scratch glare sunlight ) due scratches . picture quality awesome , i've made large prints costco they look immaculate . i use 512mb sd card which able hold around 200 pictures " superfine " 4.0 megapixel mode ( there 3 modes each 4 available resolutions ; coarse , fine , superfine ) . it durable too , i've dropped it numerous times , it still works beautifully . metal casing doesn't only look good , it truly serves its purpose protecting camera vital internal components . i don't see myself buying camera long time i usually make 4x6 8x10 prints , which come out great images taken this camera . size adds even more incentive one buy this camera or any powershot sd series , it allows one easily slip it into their pocket or purse . one then whip it out , power it up , ready snap photo under 9 seconds ... seriously . power-up load time extremely fast , even faster if you buy sd card faster write capability . also , i able purchase extra nb-4l batteries this camera pricegrabber.com only $4.99 piece , can't beat . i'd give this camera 6 star rating if i could =	1
this camera great ! it takes amazing pictures incredible quality . videos it takes equally impressive great zoom clarity . this camera absolutely perfect college or any recreational use very easy use . i actually needed head shot audition i set automatic timer take picture myself cropped it . when i picked up my pictures , lady working said i needed copyright release form because pictures looked too professional . she finally gave them me , but i guess proves camera takes professional quality pictures	1
i every friend amazed capability this scanner . matter seconds i plug usb my macbook pro just press button scanner it starts immediately . no waiting , no heating up lamp , etc . it scans all documents no matter side you place it , adobe pdf software ( included ) automatically flips page if you placed it wrong side few seconds it job . you get character recognition pdf so you search words inside pdf , even osx spotlight , you find everything ! both sides page one pass . i'm very happy this new hardware ... ive it 3 weeks i scanned shredded 500 pages . 500 pages few hours work no more storage my office ! all sizes papers accepted , i scan every voucher my credit card i get my shopping , invoices , mail ... everything ! i believe every office find it extremely helpful you happy you got it . i forgot price once i enjoying great uses it . welcome future every office . tip : it takes some patience get this amazon . they get it sells out stock matter hours . check frequently you get it	1
camera works quite well , what says it ( senses movement then blinks red led while swiveling back-and-forth ) , very low cost . it actually * * look like small , low-cost surveillance camera . only negative aspect you relatively close " camera " ( around ten feet lighted situation ) make it activate normal ( not exaggerated ) body movements -- it won't trigger all low light situations . all-in-all though , great buy device may prevent burglary your home or apartment	1
this product so cool . whatever your situation , if you lot digital pictures , then i recommend going out getting sd card ... preferably up 1gb ( or even 512mb ) , use this this product . even if your camera doesn't use sd , you plop sd card right into picture frame upload photos your computer card ! it like little computer , this frame . big suggestion i find program online resizes your photos dimensions frame ( photo size explained other reviews ) . ( i downloaded visualizer photo resize ) . this take photos down its original size ( e.g. 1.8 mb ) smaller size ( e.g. 500kb ) . this let your store dramatically more photos . so far i fit over 1700 photos 430mb worth 1gb sd card i ! picture quality very good frame swivel basically any angle could used horizontally or vertically . plus , it philips , which great brand . i philips hd tv well it my baby ... i love it . this great present anyone ! how you go wrong picture frame replaces its picture any time you want	1
i found no problems these binoculars . well worth small amount money spent . images clear , focusing very simple . great buy someone not wanting spend ton $ .	1
i used this cannon a85 . it worked very well . i got some nice shots kennedy space center ( where you cannot always get close sites ) . shortcoming when camera low magnification ( zoom level where standard lens would work ) , shot not fill up screen . it like you looking down tube . so if you going back forth close shots far away shots , you need change lenses	1
i bit worried first tiny size , but it tres powerful ! i bought it school trip amazon forest i sighted way more birds animals than everyone else which helped get me course . yes , these binoculars rock !	1
i purchased optional weight kit my wp-dc80 underwater housing ( canon sd550 ) . following instructions make camera housing neutrally buoyant , i attached one weights tripod attachment spot botton housing . it worked perfectly	1
this product all it claims it doing excellent job me . there just no other way photograph highly polished silver or sparkling stone or crystal jewelry . because camera stationary position all pictures same size proportion ; product doesn't appear larger or smaller than it actually . attached carrying case tremendous convenience keeping all components together when not use it very easy set-up take-down . i bit hesitant choose this seller because theirs lowest price ; however , quality exceeds my expectations . postage very minimal i received equipment within 2 days purchase . so , needless say , i am very pleased both seller product .	1
i purchased this camera 2 or 3 years ago , still use it if brand new today . this camera excellent amateur hobby photographers like myself , it lot functions accessed click dial , such shutter speed , aperture priority , manual function , etc . honest , camera so many functions i don't even understand how utilize it its full potential . if you well versed photography , this camera you . if you just point shoot kind person , this camera too many functions it wouldn't worth it . i purchased 1g memory card store over 1000 pictures ( camera comes one only saves like 20 photos ) . software easy use nice photo viewing editing capability . only caveat size makes it too bulky take everywhere so it only used planned outings , not something you carry around you daily , thus stripping you your random photo op . one other thing i trouble if settings not perfectly adjusted some low light situations , pictures come out blurry . but it take really great flash photos some settings make night look like daytime . you really just play around settings if you amateur like me , but once you get hang it , it awesome . i love this camera quality photos near professional .	1
it very disappointing 40 pages paper only able print little over half number cartridge comes it . i now three unopened packages paper i no cartridge . i think we should able buy just cartridge when we need . it sure would nice . why i am only rating one star . otherwise , it would five .... thanks , marsh	-1
we bought this camcorder 2006 , it perfect us ! hard-drive store many hours video zoom great ! 12x zoom so good 1mp still shots actually look somewhat impressive ( but don't get rid your digital still camera ! ) i can't imagine how awesome 25x zoom must new 2007 models . dcr-sr60 easy use , so don't worry if you're not very tech savy . it simple transfer video hard drive pc , not too tough burn video onto dvd external dvd burner . our only complaint it sometimes takes second or 2 color adjust when light changes , video look little funky during those times . we don't use camera dark areas much , so we've happy overall performance	1
i used this product few months now . i like fact it uses sd card technology . i simply remove card read pictures my card reader . used it college football game last weekend it worked great . i could see close ups players even take some action pictures . it take little practice keep action shots blurring but they appear working fine . shots band nice clear . it would nice if you could see actual picture you taking but probably taking technolgy place this price point won't allow . i also like way they knob adjusts people shots distance shots . still experimenting see when use which adjustment . quality fine they appear sturdy waterproof which help when working them outdoors where binoculars really designed used . i'll grant camera probably not one professional photographer would like but price get binoculars camera together they good product good bargain	1

some years ago i bought canon rebel , one earlier ones , it not so great , kept if while then sold it . i into digital some time now , but , its great , but it not film , not any chance . i very old point shoot , i started taking pictures either kodak fuji film , i then brought it into my one hour developer negs developed digitized onto cd . results gorgeous , point it time new slr , there not so many left right now . i saw eos rebel t2 28-90 mark iii zoom lens , it impressive , light , but just touch heft , great grip , viewfinder , very fast autofocus , it even looks great . so forgetting my previous experience rebel long time ago i bough t.t his superb camera , this just no way praise it , i love this camera . since getting it i , ve shot 10 rolls film , all digitized onto disc , touched up where i felt they needed it , ( simple procedure . i shot roll hanger former naval aviation base here , all kinds aircraft different stages reconstruction , it photographers paradise . results i am getting better than very expensive digital camera . i cannot recommend t2 even more , if you want one get it now , i think these cameras gone soon . canon you great job .	1
this awesome piece equipment ! this cam produces some most stunning video right now price deal decade ! dvd format outstanding it really best both worlds . i use -rw discs copy my video my computer then reformat disc ( which takes 7 seconds ) use it over over again so price media virtually nothing , unlike tape which you keep buying buying . other benefit unlike hard disk based cam i dont worry drive filling up while i'm vacation no place offload video . unlike tape based cam i dont all problems associated tape like head cleaning trying dig out tape wrapped up inside cam or endure hours tedious capturing or properly tension tape before use or how big box i need store all those old tapes or worrying recording over something i already shot . i could go it but tape just old unreliable pain rear . you tell i bad experiences tape based cam so enough . avchd codec very efficient you 4.5 gb per hour video compared 13gb per hour video tape based hdv cam it records audio dolby 5.1 surround which alot better than stereo only you get hdv . others mentioned short recording time i suppose it may issue someone but it not me . think it when you watching tv or movie how many times cam just sit there pointed one thing without break longer than minute ( or even few seconds) ? there nothing i think i record more than 20 minutes ( hq mode ) straight i would want sit down watch anyways . now if you record something like childs school play sure maybe couple times your childs life you need hour shot but i dont even if event took say 1 hour straight it only takes 15 seconds change out disc recording again so 1 hour i would change twice miss 30 seconds video , not big deal . most all stuff i shoot like 1-3 minutes tops i'm next scene . i shot wedding i able get all it time bride walks time couple walks out all 1 20 minute disc . i think most people complain short recording times just lazy change disc ! far video noisy low light well give me break , it but so every other cam priced south $ 3,500 . 00 ! besides they make these things called lights ! daylight there no noise all video when played back my hdtv , just beautiful high def video . bottom line me this cam far best bang buck available today . nothing this price range even comes close video quality this cam produces . it snap record brilliant video transfer it computer . editing options limited right now but they exist more way so editing thing non issue well . it pro type features just not found other cams i especially like manual adjustment ring i would never own cam again not least 3.5 " lcd screen . used smaller 2.7 " screens before i tell you big screen way better especially when you trying manually adjust elements like focus exposure . big screen you actually tell what your video look like , small screens just dont show enough detail . this cam also takes beautiful still pictuers , i could keep going but truth i really enjoy everthing this cam offer i would not trade it anything else	1

waist level finders always appealed me whether using slr or medium format camera . so when r1 combined waist level capable finder giant cmos imager wide zeiss lens , i give it try . i am not disappointed . while it not fastest focusing camera out there , it great anything short quick moving subjects . images sharp , sharp , sharp . image stabilzation would nice , well faster focus . but even these shortcomings .. r1 worth every bit its price . am now hoping r2 upgrade r1 --- it like white rice	1
this battery getting hard find . i found just wnat i needed . good price delivered time .........	1
anyone who says this isnt great piece equipment talking complete rubbish ! price size it excellent . good quality stills camcorder when needed . yes , if you want very small very high quality camera - then simple , buy camera ! but 2 1 this best market . i took my one first real use disney , florida recently it lived up all expectations easy carry , all i asked i came back some very good shots ( 482 ) great deal footage which easy play around through my pc . 99% shots perfect good my small canon sd400 . yes , year or two i am sure something better around ( previous reviewer says ) but isnt there always ??? go it	1

friend work just asking advice camera she early digital compact very un-user friendly . conversation inspired me post review this camera so easy use takes fantastic photos . pros : - easy use- picture quality great- video pretty good ( not amazing but better than most out there)- size good - not tiny but not big quality you get- stylish ; looks nice- you buy waterproof casing itcons : - only thing probably case all compacts its not super fast taking photo . if you used slr this little annoying but overall its not great problem something you get used automatic focus . i've very very happy this camera using it travel family shots . thumbs up	1

display this digital frame crisp bright , displays photos fairly well . i would consider 800x600 minimum resolution screen this size . i intend use this displaying pictures only , i didn't test video or music functions . initial settings annoying ; thing automatically started slide show random cheesy screen-wipe effects , file information permanently on-screen . i changed settings manual slideshow only , no info display , long delay , full-screen transition only . location buttons frame mean you can't see screen buttons same time ... given inclusion remote , this small issue . buttons oddly placed , though ... left , right , enter , up , down . this straight line left right ... not exactly good interface design . menu options comprehensive surprisingly feature-rich ... no complaints there . included colored frames okay ; my opinion , black looks rather flat bland , while cherry-wood colored frame gives whole assembly more interesting look . card support this frame excellent ; support all standard card types , including xd , definitely bonus my book . included leaning stand sub-par ... it basically gives frame bent plastic peg lean , angle adjustments limited . option hang it wall welcome , but then you're stuck problem what big wall wart end power cord . hopefully this specific my particular order , but when i opened this up , frame looked dusty dirty , there clearly visible fingerprints plastic screen cover . round plastic " seal " box untouched far i could tell , but i suspect occasional refurbished item may slipping into packaging line . plastic cover meant removed anyway , everything seemed working fine , so i haven't bothered seek rma	1

i owned this camera now month since buying it here amazon . it great camera i am very happy it . photos it takes amazing . video also very good . it also very easy operate . only thing downer what others wrote lcd daytime , it hard see when its sunny	1
performance viewing stabilization very good . this 3rd pair these binoculars i used stabilizing mechanisim what stops working . i use these employee abc sports college football so they get quite bit use - but it also major problem when mechanism stops working during broadcast	1
i think point lot people not mentioning d200 quite obvious . let me first say main reason i bought d200 over d80 increase my credibility prestige amateur photographer , make other photographers jealous my kit , brag obscene amount money i spend camera equipment while my co-workers can't even pay their rent . i bought grip because i thought it looked really cool , it increased size visibility my camera other people . question really sold me d200 : strangers i might want photograph more likely say yes standing other side d80 or d200 ? people less doubts me holding this thing opposed smaller model ? which one looks cooler ? if i completely loaded would i buy d2xs ? without second thought . course i talked lot camera people making minimum wage hoping they would some technical insight purchasing nikon or other camera . course they let me down said lot bogus things me most saying something like : " d200 way much camera me . " none them knew how change exposure settings , they contented wheel " child mode , " top d80 recited this me several times if i looked like soccer mom . usual i offended human experience buying real world , especially atrocious mark up several hundred dollars , i refused help pay those employees wages . breaking point i think time associate instructed me buy one camera over other because , " when she dropped this camera it broke other one didn't . " so i turned internet where i only say hi ups man he leaves . i studied studied all things technical , sometimes just staring pictures cameras long periods time without blinking . i poured over thousands photographs taken all kinds cameras amassed photographic library while i decided . basically i went way overboard let decision buying camera engulf my life until i dreaming it . so one night i just bought d200 after fence over d80 or d200 . after two days it arrived i impressed it . thing literally cold hard photographic machine . after broken d50 i firstly impressed size , then secondly all dials switches change things i used dig through menu get . thirdly i liked blazing fast 2 frame rate . when i go out night i snap 50mm f/ 1.8 onto it crank iso up . lot people forms complaining noise high iso d200 but i thought it fine . i feel most people camp want perfect clarity all way up into highest isos but i think artistically limiting . i read one scathing review written veteran film user saying basically high iso digital lot less graininess than film basically saying d200 step up but some people still want complain . far d200 goes versus d50 iso 1600 it leaps bounds better my opinion . noise way reduced without nr there isn't pixel chunkiness i found d50 high isos . thing stands out d200 enhanced colors . reality ultra vivid setting d200 makes lot things look sort fake , but it make people who don't sun tan look like they one which plus my opinion . it make your dull green lawn look like lush paradise , skies ultra blue , reds spectacular . i remember when i used d50 i would steer away photographing violets red roses because it would blow them out , not so d200 . some reason coming point shoot it always used annoy my d50 didn't bw or sepia . d200 bw but no sepia . nerds forums would just say , " use cs2 , or photo editor , " but i say no because i should able everything camera . viewfinder so awesome . i literally hated electronic viewfinders d50 viewfinder so small it hindered my framing times . d200 big bright viewfinder huge lcd sucks down batteries like nothing . far my evolution goes photography sometimes i feel like i literally climb into viewfinder because its so big compared what i used . like i said grip awesome i really like it . i kind like many accessories possible kind steered me away d2xs into d200 . watching percentage marks count down batteries drain always fun . best thing d200 little things like because they make me feel like i greater control over my pictures because i know exactly how many i take . conclusion buy d200 over d80 i am really happy it i am not happy anything . if you're trouble considering what you want photographically try pull yourself away forums outside sources really consider what got you into photography first place where you intend go it , i think important part . advertising gear collecting never made anyone better artist	1
you better money . image quality below average low light really bad , even novice camcorder . i'm glad see price come down . camcorder not come software needed capture video or even play dvd my computer(it really should ) . i would more research choose camera right you . i found many online camcorder review sites very helpful . i returned it bought panasonic 3ccd technology . it much better picture quality . if you want really good night vision go sony . i would not recomend this camcorder anyone	-1
we just got these trip alaska . i love them ! they so easy share . sharpness image amazing ! my dad wears glasses i don't . no problem . we both see clearly ! amazing part he doesn't need his glasses ! my husbands eyesight completely different than mine , same story . very cool item ! very well constructed . highly recommended	1
i looking prime wide angle my nikon d-50 settled sigma 10-20mm instead . used it trip spain shooting close interiors architectural shots well landscapes . worked well nikon d-50 . photos sharp - good image quality expected distortion 10mm some vignetting when used lens hood . best quality 14 20mm . this lens great addition . i used it together " normal " 18-70 70-300 ( tamaron ) . these three lenses all you need when road . one major annoyance cheapo lens cover kept falling off . useless . all all good choice get decent wide angle digital	1
this good scope well known brand - night owl , should work well most . i prefer it cyclops well - it much nicer shape	1
i just purchased this unit found it extremely useful course . i " shaky " hands distance it difficult view flag distance but i've found if i use scan mode just scan area flag i view flag second it give distance which all i need . other items like bunkers , trees edges water , it breeze . it light easy use .	1
this tripod stable , fairly light remote controls handle perfectly interact my sony hdr-fx1 hdv camera . using lanc connection i zoom out variable speed / start stop camera without actually touching camera . well worth money !	1
one best investments i made . well worth cost . adds enjoyment game . would reccomend all - easy use ! very accurate	1
this little beauty really everything it claims . there so many shooting formats you spoilt choice . only problem i there so many formats it take me lot practice able pull fast point shoot anything other than normal light . i tend better less choices but many people undoubtedly love it . however , internal guide very helpful -- it choose format you need if you few moments consult it . its size perfect body feels good your hand . huge viewscreen size . 1 gig card extra battery , i'm set travel	1
after reading every review i could lay hands , i finally took plunged ordered this amazon . all i say , reviews not kidding , amazing deal . quality eyepieces surprised me this price , i especially like 32mm eyepiece , great field view !. case solid , extra room more bits i get them . i haven't tried filters yet , but even if they half what they promise , everything else box i am very happy	1
this not case frills . camera fits snugly inside but there no room anything else such battery charger or even case memory card . it feels flimsier than i expected but so far i no problems workmanship , so attribute may just my interpretation .	1
this charger great , well worth extra 20 or 30 bucks it costs over knockoff . 1 . it small , it plugs right into wall , plug prongs fold . 2 . there no brick end cord truck all over . no cord all actually . 3 . you know it quality , wont damage expensive batteries . you spend 40 or 50 bucks battery , then go ebay find cheapest pos charger you find . they dont charge well , quickly , some batteries , they just dont charge all . this charger charges all batteries i much better charge , 1/4 size . this one small enough go right into my camera bag . love it	1
i really like this camera ! it fairly simple use , takes great pictures packed features . it fits nicely hand compact enough slip coat pocket or purse . we bought this camera our daughter birthday . she using it ease especially loves movie sound option . my opinion , camera winner any adult or kid wanting good all around digital camera . my only negative it battery hog . most digital cameras , you want make sure you get rechargeable batteries large memory card	1
i would like seen it constructed out heavier material but i also guess it would cause price go up .. but tell ya what , i love my equipment !!!!!!!! great job i would order this company again ...	1
i this over 6 months now i cant really complain it . its compact easy use . however , people glasses would trouble using it . i use it without my glasses(there power caliberation you match ur eye power ) then its very clear . easy carry around solid . very good its price	1
this great board cam light . it great use same batteries your camcorder ( fp series ) , although you need use least fp-f770 ( not original comes cameras ) light both bulbs . it just great	1
this high quality product . i experience military used third generation nvg many many times while driving humvees night w/only nvg night vision . this product comparable military nvg/s fraction cost . second or third generation night vision cost you thousand/s dollars minimal return performance . later generations last longer course , due first generation tubes burning out somewhat quicker than later generations . if you factor how many first generation units you could buy second generation units this mute point . later generations allow viewing longer distances lower ambient light levels however . majority people however , first generation acceptable . when you pick up this unit you feel quality . it all metal majority " armored " quality rubber shell . controls easy use , ir effective most uses . it comes w/storage bag , nice bonus . it uses 123 series lithium camera batteries longer run time longer storage time . they expensive however , 6-7 dollars apiece . there some distortion perimeter your viewing , but small price pay price/performace this product . whatever you buy this product , whether viewing wildlife , security , or just cool gadget around , this finest first generation night vision product around . yes , amazon best deal you find . usual , fast shipping excellent service w/amazon . when second/third generation products come down price , i first buy one , until then however .... this simply finest you buy . only complaints i w/this product omission tripod mount it seems they could designed battery compartment latch better . minor details otherwise excellent product . kudos night owl amazon	1
i bought this unit ritz camera $399.00 , price it great value . noted reviewer there no memory card thankfully i few home . photos i shot first time stunning . again if offered $399.00 it no brainer 8mp digital camera	1
i tired trying keep up tapes , charging , carrying , etc . my old ( 2001 ) video camera . whenever we wanted use our old video camera , it such hassle it heavy ! friend showed me her psv-352 i instantly hooked . it soooooooo easy tiny i just throw it my purse or backpack kids we're off . we keep it basket counter so it accessible moment notice . downloading 60 minutes video onto cd easy because software camera itself it automatically loads . video quality amazing , plus , it runs 2 aa batteries so no charging !!!! it great tape kids singing happy birthday grandma grandpa send it them via email birthday card . you just scroll through each video view kids love seeing themselves instantly more eager " perform . " busy working mother two , this joy use i highly recommend it . :	1
some years ago i bought canon rebel , one earlier ones , it not so great , kept if while then sold it . i into digital some time now , but , its great , but it not film , not any chance . i very old point shoot , i started taking pictures either kodak fuji film , i then brought it into my one hour developer negs developed digitized onto cd . results gorgeous , point it time new slr , there not so many left right now . i saw eos rebel t2 28-90 mark iii zoom lens , it impressive , light , but just touch heft , great grip , viewfinder , very fast autofocus , it even looks great . so forgetting my previous experience rebel long time ago i bough t.t his superb camera , this just no way praise it , i love this camera . since getting it i , ve shot 10 rolls film , all digitized onto disc , touched up where i felt they needed it , ( simple procedure . i shot roll hanger former naval aviation base here , all kinds aircraft different stages reconstruction , it photographers paradise . results i am getting better than very expensive digital camera . i cannot recommend t2 even more , if you want one get it now , i think these cameras gone soon . canon you great job .	1
i purchased this product because my last digital camera zeis lens took great pictures . i am thrilled this camera . it takes such crisp , clean clear pictures . screen huge so easy zoom in/out side side . there so many cool features camera itself no need download computer make changes . battery life seems last long time . you also capability save pictures camera itself without memory stick . i think it only saved 5 pictures but it nice test . i disappointed memory stick i my previous sony camera not compatible this camera . i bought 2 meg pro card it holds tons pictures . battery needs charged outside camera not directly while camera . camera isn't cheap but it well worth every penny picture freak like me .	1
i use this my olympus e-500 it works perfectly every time . i'm not going get into much techie stuff here , but if your fence this flash , don't . buy it , it works great	1
i own two these little cameras . first purchased work i liked it so much i purchased one family . second one i purchased ( christmas 06 ) already bit dust ! not long after , 1st one started issues . i sent 2nd one repair over month ago haven't heard word ! not sure if it worth sending 1st one or not .... not mention support their website joke time waster !! if you buy this camera ... hope you better luck than i ! i've canon slr over five years it never any issues or malfunctions !!!	-1
usaul , just wish you could ship direct me holland . i it sent my daughter us then forwarde	1
this good case , but i would prefer one it little bit small , because bulky . but overall , very good adquisition people wants take underwater photography	1
after reading horror stories underwater housings , i decided spend extra little bit get brand name kit well kit made canon ( same maker my camera [ a610 ]) . i careful read follow directions , but could only test it my kitchen sink . so , little confidence , i took it caribbean last week sank it 15 feet half hour . i impressed kit worked perfectly . not single leak or anything . i ended up taking it out three different days clean all salt water sand each night , but long i keep it clean lubricate gasket each time , i'm hopeful it give me many months/years service . my friend calls it " chick magnet " ? i brought it me margaritaville grand turk after snorkeling got lot attention	1
i lot research digital cameras before making purchase . probably 50 hours [ ... ] [ ... ] price checks 10 different websites asked everyone i knew what they liked didn't like their cameras . i am so happy i picked this one . it very lightweight yet durable , sleek attractive if that what you want . large viewfinder great asset . great zoom capabilities although i say picture quality ( screen , anyway ) somewhat compromised ( gets little grainy ) max zoom . i probably only use 6 or 7 " best shot " modes regular basis but it fun experiment them all . very long battery life . i took this camera 7-night cruise didn't recharge it all . i 2 friends who ready buy new cameras they going get this one	1
this camera great . it got really clear images , i like macro feature so much . lcd screen very cool .. it big clear . only con size camera little big compare some other brands like sony . but overall i like it lot	1
i lot research camcorders , i mean lot !! i spent weeks reading all professional user reviews , which left me even more undecided then when i started search . i finally narrowed it down canon elura 100 zr 850 . elura discontinued therefore difficult find reasonable price , so i chose this one ! first all , zoom works well this camcorder . it very powerful , image stays fairly clear until you reach 80% zoom . motor noise not bad , it not noticable all if there other background noise . image quality good , just steer clear low light situations . image gets very grainy low light . size this camera very nice . available features suit me very well . overall , this good camera money .	1
pretty good small bag . although little tight camera body since it positioned near top where pack curved , there plenty padding tight fit not cause any harm camera . pads wear little fit gets better over time , so this not really big deal , but it make me worry initially . padded velcro dividers bag positioned just anywhere make any combination compartments . bag also ton extra pockets compartments able handle all my storage media , cables , batteries , etc . i room camera , two other lenses , lens hoods inside . i am still trying figure out if i include my compact conventional film camera bag somewhere . great thing design pack bag readily accepts other velcro attached accessories water bottles , film , or other gear . i may see if my other camera fit way . there two issues might problem . 1 pros bag too small handle larger lenses professional gear . 2 beginner it 1/2 size regular backpack not convenient plain 35mm camera case if you just headed out family picnic . one general gripe straps defninitely pain those prefer carry it tote rather than wear it . they not detachable . if they , this would nearly perfect my needs . said , i'm pretty happy it i won't looking any other cases	1
pretty comfortable . could more practical couple inner pockets	1
it original nikon , so no qualms swapping it battery came camera while one recharging	1
i received this christmas present . this digital camera works fine still shots , pictures my family , etc , but action shots , kids playing outside , basketball games , etc . it big disappointment . i took 47 pictures my son playing basketball our school gym only 5 them worth keeping . i've taken several games/activities try it out . i've tried using different functions , adjusting manual setting , playing zoom but nothing worked . many shots blurred , shadows ( because movement ) , or so dark people can't seen . i wish i would known this before i asked this camera .	-1
i deal major brand cameras panasonic cameras my personal favorite ! i've seen people whine " noise " they make many times but never found it problem . i own fz10 fx01 my personal cameras . fx01 very fast camera takes great pics ! i love 28mm wide lens . compared most cameras i've used fx01 real good job metering light exposing images . i love panasonic solid build reliability . they may not popular canon or sony but my opinion every bit good .	1
i bought two these dock kits christmas gifts my mom grandma who received cameras gifts earlier year . great prices dock kits too . dock great people who trouble getting pictures off their camera onto their computer . or those who always take their camera drugstore retrieve edit their pictures ! i'm very happy this purchase	1
sony wide angle works advertised . i am very happy it .	1
this second time i bought this item , great quality not too big . good one	1
i went canon batteries charger avoid any problems canon digital camera they used . whenever i've used rechargeable batteries electronic device , they never seem last long enough . so camera , i went same brand batteries . i've taken probably 100 photos , use flash zoom often , camera almost two hours straight photography class batteries still don't show any loss power respect camera battery status indicator . since this kit comes 4 batteries , i always 2 charged spares . maybe cheaper rechargeables would work , but it wasn't worth risk hassle if they failed right when i needed them	1
i older model this wanted upgrade . i love both them , but am very glad i upgraded . pictures clearer . i love casio cameras . small , user friendly , holds up well . great all around	1
this pouch nifty real cute size . i'm glad i purchased it	1
i olympus 770 sw ( not 720 sw ) , sure ... i like it . i five digital cameras before , this one terrific . considering it sub-compact pocket camera , image quality fine ( not equal digital slr , but i don't want carry around big box like dslr ) . shadow detail especially impressive . operation smooth intuitive . screen fine , even outdoors . shutter lag , big concern mine i like photograph my kids sports , minimal zero if you prefocus . number custom scene settings impressive . i bought it because waterproofing shockproofing , because prior good experience olympus over years , but i'm just happy pictures it takes under normal circumstances too . few gripes stop me giving camera 5 stars : 1 . battery cannot recharged when it camera . total $80 or so , you get external power source cable , together they let camera run long time without draining battery , but they don't charge battery . battery life fine day normal shooting , but if you use camera actively , every single night you pretty much unlock case , take out battery charge it , then remember put battery back next day . each charge takes 5 hours . i'm going take same $80 instead buy two extra batteries comfortable -- one camera , one reserve me , charging home . even so , it take some planning thinking keep batteries ready all time vacation . it would much nicer holster or charging socket case . 2 . case actually smaller than it needs . it could significantly bigger still fit my shirt pocket , which my standard size requirement . it , advanced engineering impressive pack all features tiny box , but camera more expensive than need , lens smaller than it should ( depending zoom position , lens f/ 3.5 f/ 5.0 , which pretty weak ) , it harder hold camera than need , if case bigger , there would room nice little charging socket too . 3 . there indeed background , almost mechanical noise introduced when filming videos . it probably filtered out , it very constant very low pitched , but it mildly annoying . 4 . time shots too long -- it takes several seconds save each shot full resolution . 5 . you use internal memory only if there no memory card slot . given slow transfer speed card , it sure would nice able save dozen or so shots very quickly internal memory then transfer them memory when you time . all , though , i'm really looking forward using this camera forthcoming sea kayaking snorkeling trip this summer . one camera , i'll able take snapshots above below water , also modest videos underwater ( there special scene selection just )	1
tad hard get into out ... but high quality quite protectiv	1
this very well made camera case - fits our finepix s3000 very well . its only drawback , one which clearly identifiable its picture - therefore it no surprise us , it no storage space any batteries or other items .	1

i purchased this camcorder just over two weeks ago must say i am more than pleased w/ its performance . after reading countless reviews camcorders handling several local stores , i selected sdr-s150 based : - size - reviewed video performance - sdhc recording format i wanted camcorder very compact so i wouldn't mind carrying it anywhere . size average digital camera , sdr-s150 fits bill nicely . video performance very good . able pop sd card into card reader my computer makes transfering videos pretty much effortless . this camcorder costs bit more than others out there , but i feel extra $$ well spent due it video quality , ease use expected durability . since it doesn't tapes jam or hard drives crash , it should long life v.s. other units . one concern i prior purchasing this camcorder whether it could used indoors , reviewers said it suffers more than some low light situations . my concerns put rest after seeing my first indoor video . it works just fine under normal indoor lighting . concern i whether i would enough recording time using sd cards . happily , i find there little if any difference ( my eye ) best quality medium quality modes . i tend record using medium quality setting , giving twice recording time over highest quality setting . my 8 gig card = 4 hrs recording . i highly recommend this camcorder if size video quality matters you .	1
i bought this my teen age daughter xmas , she loves it . it easy use takes super great pictures . thanks helping my make her happy	1
i think it very much worth it , function dollar , i listen loud music , i am very active , i use this mp3 , snapping photo my buddies , lithium ion battery lasts while what i use it " go " when i plug it into pc it charges i load photo so , nice . i purchased previous version they took quite beating . i stick this brand camera ease use . it going no directions , read up advanced functions . i say they great job . only con little door connector , seems flimsy , but even my abuse still there . if you own one , you know	1
i bought this monopod 3 weeks ago after reading reviews here . i'm not sure if i got defective unit but i've these problems gitgo : -i noticed 2 lower sections not open close smoothly , they would get stuck 2-3 inches lock you'd need force expand/retract them . very interestingly , if section right above one i'm trying expand/retract unlocked then operation smooth flawless ! -the ballhead not support my nikon d80 lightest lens ( 18-55mm ) less than 2 lbs combo , which much lighter than 4.4 lbs weight limit indicated specs . camera just slumps one direction or regardless how hard i try make sure ballhead locked tightly . again , it might defective unit , but i thought i'd point my observations out anyway . i wanted buy this amazon , it wasn't stock , it sitting my shopping cart when it became available amazon bumped price $40+ , so i went elsewhere got it $30 .	1
last march ( 2002 ) i bought this camera it wonderful , although it " refurbished " canon it worked perfectly . i bought also new battery 48mb compactflash memory card everything working fine . 6 months later camera electrical problems warranty expired . now cost fix this problem far bigger than buy new camera because warranty period " refurbished " items less than 6 months	-1

it looks great , genuine leather , much better than synthetic . like brand named leather wallet . but there no where you tie case camera . hence you hold onto it hand when you pull camera out take photos . there no where put essential accessories ( battery memory stick ) . there no way clip belt . like return if if not hassle mailing associated cost . bought handy synthetic case afterwards	1

i super-excited get this camera , very disappointed it once i . pictures blurry far more often than not , even when resting camera table or solid object . additionally , it so slow taking them any movement ( eyes blinking , etc ) likes like massive blur . video skips all time . it just misses entire parts . i would highly recommend not getting this camera .	-1
great features , right ? i just returned it after very disappointing results . here just few issues : 1 . if you use tripod ( you need ) , you can't plug ac adapter save short battery life , because mounting it tripod covers access ac connection . 2 . battery life very short . 3 . if you want protect lens , you need buy lens adapter then buy protective lens . 4 . you can't take still photos flash if you using lens adapter because adapter casts shadow flash onto your pictures . 5 . automatic settings horrible . auto focus , auto white balance , auto anything give you worst results if shooting indoors . 6 . you cannot adjust manual focus or anything else once you begin recording . 7 . quality very poor when recording indoors without enormous amount light . save your money . buy camera better features . i am waiting panasonic hdc-sd1 due march	-1
i bought sd300 take me touring motorcycle . it so small , i just put it belt case always it . appropriate sd card i take huge number pictures high quality setting . pictures turn out great , but . eight months after i bought it , lcd screen suddenly went all crazed when turned , tho there no visible damage . i returned it repair , no problem , no expense , it back two weeks . less than 3 months later , same thing . i know i not drop or bump it , it went down 10 minutes showing some pictures one person , then , indoors . i called , told it still under warranty previous repair , got return label . then i got e-mail saying i would pay $97 repairs lcd screen caused impact damage . i replied e-mail protest , ignored . i finaly called , told tho warranty still force , this damage not covered . checking aroun web , i found this common problem , not damage . unfortunately , i already authorized repair when i found this out , so i guess i am stuck . i several canon products , not buy any more	1
ok , i hasty this purchase . first glance it seemed small price pay camera case ... $14 , shipping included . then i got camera case found dimensions somewhat lacking space requirement camera i ordered . you see , dimensions listed under " more details " outside case , not inside ( but it doesn't say interior nor exterior , just gives dimensions ) . turns out , not only you click " more details , " ( fine print ) you also click " more technical details . " ( finer print ) wish i now . just wasted $9 shipping 6 oz camera case . electrogalaxy not refund shipping charges , they charge %20 restocking fee . so , most , after i pay return shipping , ( case only $4 ) i might get back $2 . so , yeah i hasty , but i also robbed	-1

there serious design flaw this camera it even acknowledged faq section sony website . " if there dust particles floating air , they illuminated strong light flash sometimes appear recorded image white , round glare spots . this symptom tends occur low-light environments when using compact digital camera due close proximity flash lens assembly . however , this not malfunction . " read : your low-light pictures spots all over them ! sony not think this problem . it design flaw . if you only going use this camera full sun , then it fantastic but seriously , there many other cameras out there much better job !	-1

i bought this camera after my 3-year-old broke my kodak z700 . i loved my z700 , even though it only 4mp didn't lot features newer cameras . i figured buying newer kodak model upgrading 6mp would no-brainer , but i disappointed 2 major areas . first , lag time so slow c653 , when i took pictures my kids i rarely got what i expecting see . smile or look i saw when flash went long gone time it captures . we experimented tons settings there no difference . other disappointing area low-light picture quality . anything i shot indoors grainy except where flash hit . every background grainy . terrible . using low-light settings fixed problem , but then your subject blurry because you're not " sports " or " kids " mode anymore ( which we used all time z700 taking pics kids ) . my z700 ( which only $150 now ) , i could set it forget it . set it " action " , it took perfect pics indoors , or out , moving or stationary . that what i thought i getting c653 , but i wrong . i ended up returning camera	1
if you're looking capture " decisive moment " nikon coolpix 8400 , stop --- not buy this camera !!! matter , carefully check any digicam or other camera which you want capture " action , " because what you think you see , may not what camera ability capture image . let me briefly explain where i'm coming : i made my living field photojournalist 40 years . time i retired out business i probably created something like million color bw film images . i owned used mostly nikon equipment all those years ( although i sure liked working leica rangefinder cameras short focal length lenses ) , starting original nikon slr ( which i still ) finishing up n90s probably ten different lenses varying focal lengths . i like nikon equipment lot . i decided begin working digital images last year . i attracted coolpix 8400 because " spread " zoom lens 35mm camera equivalent 24mm -- 85mm . when i worked film i probably used my 24mm 105mm nikkors more than any others my bag , so this little coolpix beauty just what i looking one package . let me say while problems viewfinder shutter lag make this camera absolutely useless editorial photojournalism , it , nevertheless , marvel human ingenuity . many other uses --- such taking pictures fire hydrants or cows standing pasture ( put way , things don't move ) , it works wonderfully well . seriously , i shot assignment here tucson essentially architectual nature . images only described superb ( if i say so myself ) . i worked only camera tripod shoot . working inside i simply changed light balance within menu 8400 ( which you pretty much any digital camera these days ) , not check scene separate exposure meter , etc . point film i often carried bunch light balancing filters sometimes separate gossen exposure meter all sorts lights shoot assignment . even then , i'd sweat blood until i could get processed film light table . course digital , i ( you ) don't worry any stuff . one check image immediately know instantly if you're good go . alas , shutter lag this , many other digital cameras made these days , " downcheck " which makes me unable recommend 8400 . there also delay electronic viewfinder deal . combination shutter viewfinder lag make it absolutely impossible capture image , precise composition which lasts only split-second . i taken many good pictures people working , " action " shots like , but it only taking large numbers images any given activity then retaining one or two said what i intended i achieved my purpose . essentially , my shooting eye ( which pretty damned good ) nothing it . it like soldier trying kill enemy machine-gun --- if he fires enough rounds , one them going hit other guy . marksmanship nothing it . same-same shooting electronic viewfinders shutter lag . if you shoot enough images , statistically you're probably going get good one . but it not very good way things . so if you're looking capture what henri cartier-bresson ( i'm not sure i've spelled his name correctly ) so artfully described " decisive moment , " look digital single-lens reflexes , or wait improvements digicams .	1
i used canon elura 70 , which excellent camcorder but firewire transfer didn't work so i decided replace it elura 100 only find canon discontinued elura line . i really wanted elura improved video quality over low-end zr models . so compromise i purchased zr 850 which 1mp ccd , not good elura ( 1.3 mp ) but better than other zr ( . 640mp ) . video quality wasn't bad but motor noise so loud i couldn't believe it . i returned first one but replacement just bad . this isn't minor hum background i'm talking , its full-on whine ! i also found zr camera difficult handle my small-ish hands video stabilisation bit disappointing . luckily i could return both cameras without incurring restocking fee found reconditioned elura 100 much more satisfactory . its mystery me how canon produce two markedly different cameras ( quality wise ) same price range opt phase out better one	1
i bought this frame display pictures my newborn daughter my desk work . i didn't really high expectations it , because it so inexpensive . soon it turned i following problems : 1 ) five seconds after i turn it , it always says " usb connected !

i already 2 smaller versions other lenses but wanted sure my efs 17-85-mm would snug bug its own pouch instead cheap felt sling thing . well , canon came through again its soft felt line lp1116 . this pouch thick same firm bottom made naugahide protects inside lens . cord strong silky doesn't open accidently way silky cord would . obviously we can't throw pouch around we careful but it really trick feels good your hand . moment i buy lens , i shall buy its matching pouch	1
this battery backwards compatible d50 , d70/70s , used d80 d200 . so if you any nikon dslr want second battery , you want get this one so when you upgrade your camera you use battery . this battery built-in circuitry tells you actual charge status battery , it accurate . this big deal ; * if you using d200 or d80 * it lets you know when your really need switch batteries or charge up . this first battery i've seen accurate this regard . kudos nikon . ( this feature not work d50/70/70s but battery otherwise works fine )	1

never ending race larger larger megapixel counts , d70s fallen behind pack . ( however , if that only measure which you're judging digital camera - you really should consider further research before plunking down several hundred dollars . ) nevertheless , it quite good camera . what i like it most : - it looks feels solid . some reviewers pan this camera feeling flimsy plasticky apparently still stuck realm pro cameras cost several thousand dollars . it not bulletproof titanium box you back hummer over , but it certainly seems outdo dslrs it category . - very good battery life . - backwards compatibility decade worth nikon slr lenses . my gripes : - latch keeps pop-up flash place broke less than week . - inability meter through older manual focus lenses . - lack full functionality flashes other than sb-600 sb-800 . - nikon raw software control software aren't included camera , imho overpriced . ( ... top , nikon split what used one overpriced software package into two overpriced software packages ... ) what would improve this camera most : - iso 100 iso 3200+ - ability store multiple custom white balance presets , then pull them up fly . - replacing " idiot modes " ( i.e. " portrait " , " landscape " , etc . ) modes you could customize	1
this replacement battery half cost canon yet offers longer life . i bought it when i first got my sd10 . when one battery runs out , spare goes . lenmar still works great while canon near end life ! i am buying two more since they so cheap ! not buy no name batteries ebay . they not last worth darn basically waste money ! don't it ..	1
just returned trip hawaii opportunity put this lens test . i very pleased results . this powerful lens , yet it relatively light weight not burdensome use . i able get some really amazing wild life shots birds , zooming distance hand held camera ( canon eos 20d ) virtually every shot keeper . feature allows you quickly zoom compose your shot fire it off image quality excellent sharp focus . usually lens this size this much power requires firm grip almost always tripod - not so this one . i shot both portrait landscape mode i didn't see any problems focus , clarity or sharpness . all images clean razor sharp . if you looking long lens ability bring distant shot without use tripods other equipment , i highly recommend this lens your arsenal .	1
i am not photographer , but i enjoy taking good pictures . i never digital slr before ; camera i before d50 nikon coolpix ( compact one ) . i thought this would good camera someone who enjoys good pictures without pro . i realized it even better than what i expected ( maybe because i coming nikon coolpix ) . colors amazing quality picture extremely good . d50 among cheapest digital slr , , same time , it very serious product . i don't think d50 much inferior canon rebel , even if canon 2 more megapixels resolution . i used both d50 ( which i own ) rebel ( my school ) i think d50 feels much more like " pro camera " when you hold it your hands , while rebel feels more like toy . lenses provided package good , but basic . according me 18-55 better than 28-80 , but i think i should bought 55-200 well : 18 200 covers most pictures you take . also 18-135 nikon sells d80 looks good me , but they don't make kit those lenses d50 . last thing really amazes me . nef format ( nikon raw format ) . it impressive how quickly you improve . nef picture your computer just very few clicks mouse . if you want good camera , you don't want spend too much money it i think this best choice	1

i bought this camera august . it really well made controls easy navigate . i think it takes really good pictures , inside outside . who cares video quality ? its camera , not camcorder , lady . i think it really nice camera . its really durable too . it looks nice . i would buy it again . i researched bunch cameras before this one i chose sony end . its one step up just taking everyday pictures . they look really pro . i'd buy it again	1
i lot research before buying this camera . we could bought higher quality digital camcorder less or higher quality minidv camcorder same price . what led our final decision purchase this camcorder fact we could record straight 8cm dvd-r , finalize disc camcorder , play it directly our dvd player or dvd-rom player our computer . we didn't want deal sticking cables wires into tv , electrical outlet , camera playback footage . we also didn't want deal cost trouble transferring footage onto dvds keep our video library future . those you who like edit , re-record , create effects , etc ., you need purchase special software separately , but dvd-ram disc , you ease convenience doing it all your dvd-rom your computer . you also download it usb cable , but it nice able just pop it dvd drive get started . if you only interested playback , dvd-r discs sufficient ; however , you can't erase or record over footage dvd-rs , only dvd-rw dvd-ram discs . picture quality camera adequate . it isn't grainy , but smooth actually very nice right lighting , especially outside sunny day . it doesn't built-in light , so you aware right surroundings environment recording . i would give picture quality 3.75 out 5 . if you want better quality , you need buy more expensive dvd camcorder . considering how far we come over years home video technology , it definitely beats those days images out focus grainy . you can't compare it tv movie camera quality , but i think it pretty darn good home videos . zoom good , but course it takes some time focus if you zoom or out too quickly . stabilizer pretty good , but i keep it off most part get better picture quality . if you plan move around lot , use function , but expect lose little quality process . what basically happens when using stabilizer ( most cameras , i believe ) image movements slightly delayed . sound quality adequate , but if you recording when it windy , you pick up lot wind sounds unless you block microphone your hand . only problem i so far discs . we bought panasonic dvd-rw discs can't get them play our computer or our dvd player . we ended up purchasing sony dvd-r discs they play no problem . when i called panasonic their dvd-rw discs , they didn't good answer . representative told me make sure dvd-rw discs compatible my players . i told her they may not compatible my dvd player , but it should my new computer software . representative just repeated herself eventually said there isn't any difference sony panasonic discs ( interesting ) . they make claim panasonic discs work best manual , but now i know better . overall , this camcorder great value ( you can't beat price this dvd technology ) , average good quality picture functions , excellent ease convenience dvd playback storage , really easy use .	1
shooting dslr great lot ways , but sensor crop kills my wide-angle capability , which , me , absolutely awful ! personally , i hate zoom lenses . i've got full set nikon primes . while i'd prefer prime lens , these zoom lenses only game town wide angle crop sensor dslr . i like this lens because it goes wide digital . i suggest you buy this lens 10mm keep it 10mm because 10mm wide end really where it reason buy this lens over alternatives . anybody considering 10mm vs 12mm wide end , unless you mostly use narrower end focal length most time , 2mm significant difference field view short lenses . focal length increases ( eg , 400mm 600mm ) , difference angle view not very large . but difference 10mm 12mm even though " only 2mm " no laughing matter , if you don't believe me , you comparison camera shop prove it yourself . if you end up deciding get 12mm , you want buy sigma 12mm ( i think it 12-24mm ? ) because lens covers full 35mm frame ( angle view got absolutely amazing) ! also , if sigma or nikon reads this review , please make 8mm or 9mm 2.8 rectilinear crop sensor prime ! if sigma reads this review , i want some 1.2 or 1.0 afd primes ! 50mm film maybe even digital sensor version some medium range focal length ! i would definitely buy ( full frame coverage course ) mid length medium wide angle short tele ! neither nikon nor canon makes anything like ( well , canon kind does/did ) , so you'd market segment dominated	1
this digital camera best . i cannot complain any aspect it . it huge amount modes settings additional features add pictures you taking them . it small enough fit into your pocket not think it ( it smaller than wallet ) . it takes excellent pictures come out looking great , all very high quality . huge screen makes it easy view what you looking great image quality . videos equally good , great sound good picture . it looks better than just any other digital camera i seen . even though i said i cannot complain , there few things slightly annoy me occasionally . first it flashes twice . remember tell this people before taking their picture ! after first flash , people tend look away , time second flash comes picture taken , moment lost . this only occurs when camera set " auto " mode . i usually press menu button choose mode . when you this , flashes occur very quickly ( you barely notice gap them ) . some features very useful . i use " backlight " mode quite often . it allows you take picture something even if there bright light background . my only other complaint those us large fingers , circular button operates pretty much every feature difficult use ( sometimes i push 2 buttons once , or complete wrong one ) . but everything else this camera cancels it out . this camera more features better quality than many larger more expensive cameras out there	1
i bought this sweet little thing because i am planning day nyc don't want bring my regular camera , which bulky . this camera nice small would fit any purse or coat pocket . it 5 mp 3x optical zoom which great price . pictures i took outside turned out outstanding . inside pics bit pixelated , but i may settings wrong . camera easy use right out box . perfect second camera keep you just case	1

i needed camera bag greater portability , comfort , security athletic venues well outdoors ( i.e. mountains , valleys , trails , etc . ) this bag delivered . i fit my two primary lenses , telephoto , external flash , colapsing tripod my camera room spare . i even attach my monopod side if needed . i like pockets so extra internal zipper pockets plus exterior side front pockets great tucking away all extras too ; like lense cleaning suplies , batteries , memory cards . backing shoulder straps nicely padded so it wears comfortably well . when i purchased backpack i planned only use it more " active outings " but since found myself using it place my original camera bag	1
bought this lens few months back shot volleyball it , occasionally used it football when it got dark . what i say or add other reviews ?? f/ 1.8 great , although lens sharper f/2 or 2.2 . i use it near wide open edge all time - indoor gyms simply not much ligh t.t he usm autofocus great - demoing it store , it seemed nearly anticipate my actions . no rotating front filter , it doesn't protrude , either . it got full time manual focus ring , so i don't worry killing my autofocus motor . combination . fn 4-1 , this killer . why four stars ? chromatic aberration lower apertures . i not know where it starts go away , because i almost never shoot good light . this most apparent shot recent football game . granted , team jerseys white , background pitch black unlit parking lot , i perform 100% crop . nevertheless , alien-like purple halo surrounded huddled offensive team . oh well , you can't it all ! volleyball pics , this lens . i regularly shoot f/ 2.2 , iso 1600 , 1/500 , but i might change soon because pushing it . photos pretty sharp usm definitely helps here . i bought this lens because my 50mm 1.8 just wasn't cutting it - i'd get shots tack sharp background beautifully bokeh'd subject - just opposite what it should . using 85mm removed 85% those shots . there still extreme instances when i swing my camera around instantly shoot when usm can't keep up , but there other instances when i am amazed it got shot focus . sidelines , 85mm too long get outside hitter nearest you , but that why you move around ! shooting volleyball requires strategy . focal length also good my 350d shooting events staying bit back subject . i'm overall pretty pleased lens . i see what many people call this " hidden lens .	1
this lens bag fine product but don't fooled into adding it accessory canon 1.4 or 2x extenders . both them come this exact pouch . amazon should remove this " suggested accessory " web pages two products above	1
i'll spare technical review 580ex flash now . i've using this new flash on-the-go shootings find it very helpful especially capabilities using multi flash units off-shoe mode . it great hard reach places where i want produce more light or fast moving subjects , i.e. wedding guests fast pets . i plan pick up least 2 more these units it compatibility most part . not only i get good light coverage subjects , but possibilities making more interesting artistic photographs defines my work . still nothing beats use higher end lighting kits like profoto acute systems . but that alot lug around .	1
i digital cameras 5 years still own olympus 5 megapixel , casio 7 megapixel . seems like megamixels alone just don't cut it me . i read rebel xt magazine looked up user reviews here amazon . i decided go buy one though i am really novice , i am extremely impressed . i never seen such stunning quality or realistic colors point shoot . i started basic settings love results . i am slowly progressing more advanced settings am getting better everyday . even novice who just wants stunning photography amazed this camera . i also bought tamron 75-300 autofocus zoom lens ( look it here amazon.com ) after lots practice , able take some great pictures . i brother uk who also into digital photography , after seeing some ( full reso ) photos i sent him , he rushed out bought xti ( called eos 400d across pond)and amazed it . i still lot learn but really cannot fault this camera . included software also excellent . record , some reviews seem think it too small hold , i big hands don't any problems all . i admit though this first slr i ever owned . i still keep point shoot keep my travel bag spontaneous photography but i am love my rebel xt !! this camera costs quite chunk change but i think it well worth it i recommend it everyone	1
this camera amazing , i couldn't asked more . just warned manual pretty terrible . it best just play around camera until you figure it out , rather than wasting time trying decipher manual	1
when this lens used 1.6 camera body such xt , 20d , or 30d it ends up giving you amazing 288mm macro or you go one step further 1.4 or 2x tc make it 403/576mm super power . course whenever doing this you must either use tripod or flash except blazing light . it little slow focus compared many other lenses canon offers , but since you most likely using manual focus lot time anyway , this not huge drawback . it also gets heavy carry after few hours you people ask you questions both your their cameras . good note parents pretty good keeping small children out your way when you this lens mounted . narrower background compared 60mm or 100mm macro lenses makes cluttered areas easier deal . extra working distance also plus when working wary insects etc . it best use shutter release mirror lockup shutter speeds longer than 1/30 if you want sharp pictures . 60mm macro wins convenience , but absolute clarity improved working distance 180 comes out top	1
first all it took me few months decide what lens buy because i so much research . my choices canon 70-200l 4 , 70-200l 2.8 70-200l 2.8 . after much investigation i opted not buy 4.0 because i knew i would shooting dim lights needed 2.8 . so save money i bought 2.8 non . lens great i travelled utah it . all great until i tried shoot deer full zoom . every one came out blurry could not use . apart it fantastic lens . result i decided fork out 2.8 lens it amaizing . it same optics non but handheld really works great . like some reviews it not make every shot focus but certainly most them picture quality amaizing . fast focus , great colours . fantastic . if you afford it buy it def worth it because lens heavy you shake bit , which noticeable full or close full zoom . hope this helps	1
i trying find way easily carry lot camera equipment quite some time . i tried backpacks , shoulder bags , duffel bags , but none them really worked all well . then i saw lowepro street field system completely customizable pouches , vests , belts , accessories . it works great , you only get pouches you need so there no waisted space you organize them however you want according how often they used ( put frequently used items easier access places . ) variety alone this system worth investment , but quality ease use also very high which big plus . you get case any lens , camera body , or accessory you . i even cases my cell phone water bottle . one word caution , sure measure your lens lens hood backwards if you use them make sure entire thing fit into pouch , because sometimes lens fit , but then lens lens hood not . i often carry 5-6 lenses , extension tubes , teleconverters , extra memory cards batteries , bunch cleaning supplies other gadgets , which weights ton . but when they evenly distributed this vest/belt lowepro system it actually very manageable . only down side everyone staring you because you thousands dollars camera equipment strapped your body . but if you overlook , this way go . i used this system many zoos without ever problems , fact just unzipping single lens switching seems safer me than opening entire bag equipment every time you want switch lenses . many cases also come built rain/snow cover so if weather changes all your equipment not destroyed . you also put just few pouches normal belt when you just going take photos back yard or don't need take all your equipment , which nice . i really can't say enough how much easier this makes traveling lot equipment , if you hopelessly searching better solution , consider this , you won't regret it .	1
there very little doubt this one better canon lenses available . however , why buy amazon when it price increase $73 soon canon starts 2006 fall rebate program . amazon officially become most expensive online retailer this lens .	1
well , it canon , so there no doubt quality . only downside -- because it doesn't string cap very easy misplace . always put it your pocket everytime you remove it camera shoot pictures	1
other reviewers complained plastic foot flash-bracket end cracking or breaking off . solution metal " sacrificial foot " screws into 1/4 " -20 threads bottom . bogen/manfrotto 3298 ( bo3298 ) works perfectly . no amazon vendor carries it this date , but you find it bhphotovideo.com . their listing says it nikon , but it works canon off camera shoe cord 2 well	1
someone make sense this me please ? """ smaller maximum aperture , smaller lighter lens . """ wtf ? anyway ... it affordable range those us real world explore . it gets 4 stars price vs usability joe soaps jane like me out there	1

i am impressed quality photos this camera . occaisionally when i turn it lense doiesn't slide out , which little disconcerting . however , if i tap it , or turn it off turn it o again , it comes out operational position . i enjoy using it , amd wouldn't hesitate purchase one	1
i am professional photographer , i owned this camera nearly two years . i also d70 backup . batteries go forever , it very quick respond , images beautiful , it typical nikon durability reliability . if you already nikon user , controls fall easily hand . said , computer software this camera joke . best image quality shoot raw files , color balance grey card , render images software like capture one le . uselessness included software only reason this camera gets four instead five stars . come , nikon , real !!! shortly after i got my first d70 , i shot model small photo side bar catalog . i got ugly feeling my gut when i told designer taken shot 3/4 figure , cropped head shoulders , enlarged image cover 8.5 11 catalog . time i found out , it already printer . it turned out , i pleasantly surprised : cover shot looked great . after incident , i trusted this camera always pleased results . this camera better than 35 mm every way except response shutter button . resolution color reproduction it more comparable medium format film camera . it imperative shoot raw process files properly get most out this camera . i can't wait try d80	1
this review personal experience . i recently picked up d200 replace my d70 . this past weekend i took photos my sister wedding . i shot full functionality using lcd review every shot using nikon 18-200 vr lens . over course wedding reception i took 295 photos fine jpeg mode reviewed them while shooting . end afternoon , i still battery life left very likely could taken 100 more photos . given features capability d200 , i absolutely no issue many photos . i pick up second battery back up soon someone some stock . i could not agree more previous reviewer . if you not personal experience this product , there no need attempt review it based hearsay or something you might read elsewhere	1
case made high quality material fits my canon powershot a700 perfectly . i would given it 5 stars if case seperate compartment carrying extra set batteries . there just enough room carry camera extra memory chip . no extra batteries .	1
after noting captions exceptional photographs appeared nature photography magazines often shot this lens , i began read reviews . based uniformly excellent reviews , i bought this lens spent two weeks this january florida everglades taking pictures birds . based upon my experience lens , i would rate this second sharpness contrast only 300 mm 2.8 canon series lens . lens handholdable short periods shoot birds flight , but it best suited use solid tripod wimberley tripod head allow tracking birds flight	1
i didn't think it would , but this lens winds up my rebel xt most time . lens compact performs well indoors low light - best use autofocus set center point only . 35mm focal length nice general purpose focal length 1.6 crop dslr . this lens sharp 2.0 really sharp 2.5 -f 2.8 . i lot experience test my lenses tripod/mirror lockup , i'm not just saying sharp 2.0 - it sharp . i considered 24mm 2.8 , but 2.8 pretty slow prime wider focal lengths - loses lot low light advantage . i am impressed colors i getting this lens , wasn't really expecting colors so good such low price point - doesn't lens coatings , but canon colors righ t.t he autofocus speed pretty good - not fast ring usm lenses - it little noisy/buzzy . i currently own 7 canon lenses ( 2 ls ) including 4 primes - this 35mm definitely top bang-for-the-buck lens . ( 28-105 3.5 - 4.5 usm zoom - i don't even like zooms)looking low-light prime ? 240 bucks amazon - just it	1
this little camera may small ( great feature ) but it loaded this goodies . this my first adventure into digital photography i would recomend this one any first time user . very easy lots fun use .	1

i initially canon s1is ( just 3mp , 10x optical , cf card ) needed upgrade same i visiting disney , la . s3is ( 6 mp , sd card ) delivered gusto its image stabilization higher iso modes . i full video reasonably good snaps disney parade during evening darkness ( switch highest iso dedicated iso button ) : 1 . amazingly low jerkiness due image stabilization . here course better than s1is . 2 . snaps came allright even maximum zoom - if there slight blurs , you maybe use software like coral adjust . others said here , yes , tripod best , but who time or patience set it up . 3 . even many disney fireworks snaps came out ok night mode maximum iso setting - though course tripod would helped darkness here , sure :) 4 . best value price . nov 2006 , nice deal would getting this camera within 350$ amazon . two things here : 1 . i would not buying videocam i planned earlier , s3is vidoes suffice most situations - sending videos afv instance . 2 . last point , i would recommend waiting 3-4 months till 4gb sd cards come into 50$ range . but others mentioned before , please least 2gb card . look amazon or fry i 35-40$ deals 2+ gb cards	1
i got this canon camera back may my birthday my husband . once i got it home it very easy learn use . i actually not even used all features yet ... because there so many . this my 3rd digital camera 1st canon ... i say i stick canon now ... i use always like kodak but canon much better . i print off pictures using my kodak printer everything still looks great ! i love canon so much i just bought canon camcorder ... i hope it just nice their digital cameras . i highly recommend this camera families ... i used it live action after you get hang image stabilizer everything turns out well ..... i feel i use this camera while when it time upgrade camera i stick w/ canon ..	1
i really looked hard various light ( sub-3 lb ) tripod options use my canon powershot s2 . lighter better , but i also really wanted 3-way pan head all little nice extras i could get : bubble level , quick set-up/tear-down , fits inside carry-on luggage , good build quality , comes bag , good hand crank , etc . it definitely fit bill perfectly , only 2 lbs ! course you don't get super strong wind-proof stability weight , but i really quite happy overall stability my recent vacation . when there strong wind , i leaned bag , backpack , or beach towel around one legs gave me more piece mind ... but i think it probably would fine ... especially when not fully extended max height . before buying it , max height actually my only real concern -- would it tall enough take good people pictures/outdoor portraits while i my vacation ? my experience says -- yes , great people shots ( so much better than typical shot you get asking passing stranger take photo you)!don't hesitate , just buy this one !	1
this camera simply amazing ! i started out canon g2 , then canon g6 , then canon 20d , now this canon 1d mark ii . i debated researched 3 months 1ds mark ii , 5d , 30d . my decision primarily narrowed down 5d this 1d mark ii . yes , i wish this camera full-frame also shared 12.8 mp like 5d , but you know what ? it practically killed me trying weigh pros cons finally i made my decision go this one i'm 110% glad i . me , this camera definitely one get because 45 point focusing , 8.5 fps , 1d pro body/interface/menu/layout , etc what really makes this camera worth it deciding factor . trust me , if you don't know how seriously fast 8.5 fps really , you need go out your camera store try it out before you decide . because this 8.5 fps alone , i'm actually able capture lot shots i normally get lucky getting my 20d . 5d 3fps , i just said forget it ... no way . i'm not even professional taking pictures living . this just purely fun hobby me stepping up 20d this camera out this world . phenomenal auto focusing , additional metering , it like i'm now playing bentley ( 1d mk2 ) coming mercedes c230 hatchback ( cheapest mercedes people buy just because it mercedes name they don't want spend any more money real mercedes ) . this camera photos truly almost help me take pictures like pro . also , i don't shoot action pictures all time , i love portrait photography , landscapes printing blowing up large sized pictures . but even 1.3 crop factor , there still huge improved difference going 1.6 crop you won't vignetting problems some lenses you'll 5d . this 1d mk2 , you still take wonderful wedding photography , landscapes , etc . much i'd like 12.8 mp like 5d , 8mp really all we need these days unless you're going blow up print photos larger than 8x10 or around there . unless you're printing extremely large posters whatnot , you pretty much everything this camera 5d . resolution mp definitely enough . plus , it also invaluable know you 8.5 fps available ready use if you need you also tone it down use slower fps if you need . extra bonuses this camera which i look secondary positive , weather seals , pro-build high quality construction body , easy use navigate menu system , you see iso information viewfinder well lcd screen all times , dual memory card capability , you shoot 2 memory cards same time one backup or use 2 separate cards independently , built-in battery grip ( you don't shell out extra this ) , longer battery life than other cameras , best customization most options you set your liking , more than 5d or 20d or 30d . i could go but definitely get this camera if you afford it . otherwise , 5d also great choice too if you need save money , all you take landscape pictures all day long , or never use fast action or need capture quick moments , don't want fast most accurate focusing system that great ai servo .	1
canon makes great underwater housing reasonable price . i purchased this recent trip grand cayman cozumel . i didn't go scuba diving this trip , but i take camera snorkeling ( diving depths ~ 20ft ) . it worked flawlessly i got some pictures i very happy ! one thing i not anticipate use camera got out water . going ac hot humid outdoors , my eos rebel fogged up ( condensation ) even after 30 minutes i couldn't take good pictures . sd110 uw housing , i just wipped housing glass portal lens tissue after it warmed up couple minutes i able take clear pictures . instructions pretty good , but it took me while figure out how take out o-ring seal cleaning/lubing . once i figured it out , it wasn't so hard . sd110 may getting little old , but it still takes decent pictures even housing i don't so much money tied up system i would devestated if it lost or stolen . i probably upgrade sd550 or sd500 ( they both use same batteries sd110 ) wp-dc80 or wp-dc70 housing some time near future , but i definitely keep sd110 wp-dc10 backups	1
using photoshop , big fan bulb exposures rs60 e3 must accesory . you use it just you would shutter button digital rebel , well lock shutter open , which very good painting small flashlight , etc . my only qualm switch shortness cord , but if you're trying take self portrait remote , then you need get infrared remote . two those combined makes perfect pair tools any remote picture taking needs	1

i use my canon 10d mainly astrophotography . most time , it involves keeping camera shutter open long periods time , anywhere few minutes tens minutes . this ack-e2adapter takes my worries away monitoring battery status or drained one , while i control camera remotely sitting inside my house . continuous power also ensures worry free writes its flashstorage . package included several ac power connectors which very useful while travelling . amazon provides wide range items choose .	1
nikon d50 my fourth digital camera , my first slr camera . i don't know why i didn't try slr earlier , but now i decided i never go back non-slr cameras ( well , i still my other 3 point shoot digital cameras which sometime more convenient carry . ) i guess i'm just trying show how much i like slr camera . now back d50 . unless you shooting sports/actions professionaly ( which then you want buy d2h or d2x faster focusing processor , faster frames per second larger memory buffer ) , d50 pretty much all you need ( equipped several lenses course ) . d50 all pre-configured settings casual photographers ( " child " mode also added d50 , night landscape mode not available ) , it usual , , , mode more serious/advance photographer . i stopped using pre-set mode now strictly uses aperture priority shutter priority mode ( far manual mode , i'm not there yet ) . this shows this camera versatile suitable all ranges skills . comparing its siblings ( d70s , d80 , d200 ) , i think whichever you want buy fine . they all great cameras . it comes down your budget . comparing other brand like canon ( rebel xt or 30d ) , or pentax or sony , it just brand preference ( what lenses you already ) . moreover , if you come point shoot camera user , any slr brand you buy i don't think you dissapointed ( just fact slr performs better most important aspect photography ) image quality d50 good which #1 factor i look digital camera . here pros cons d50 my opinion : pros : 1 . nice out camera result picture quality ( auto setting , pre-programmed setting ) 2 . fit perfectly my hand ( grip nicely ) 3 . instant take picture right away 4 . 2.5 frames per second 5 . large 2 inch lcd 6 . battery life ( take 400-2000 shots single charge depend how often you use full power flash ) 7 . uses sd card 8 . fast usb2 connection 9 . capability copy re-size pictures small size ( great email ) 10 . repeating #1 again . great image quality cons ( which mostly minor ): 1 . no backlight top panel 2 . no black white picture mode 3 . no night landscape mode 4 . no iso 100 ( iso 1600 picture grainy though still usable)5 . no depth-of-field preview button 6 . no front command dial 7 . 1/4000 max shutter speed i started using this camera landscape portrait , but later i started shooting sports/action night ( low light ) settings , hence i added nikon 50mm f/ 1.8 af-d which great prime lens i'm recommending everyone get this " fast " lens . i'm also recommending you get nikon 70-300m f/4- 5.6 af , which nice ( price ) zoom lens . if you budget then go nikon 70-200mm f/ 2.8 vr af-s which i think best zoom lens nikon currently . ( vr really works especially stationary object . if object you want photograph moving low light situation/indoor then you need " fast " lens , i.e. lens large aperture such f/ 2.8 , f/ 1.8 , or f/ 1.4 etc)happy photographing !	1
i bought battery grip , based fact my rebel xt small camera , when using it my last model shoot , someone mentioned it looked like �tourist camera�which pretty depressing , since adding grip not only i more than enough battery life my camera , it also pro look people recognize , even though i still believe it not camera , it eye behind it counts , good looking camera always welcome	1
pros : - reduces flare ghosting when shooting bright light . - helps protect your lens dirt scratches . - somewhat protects lens case fall . better break hood than front element . - makes you look more like you know what you doing helps keep others carelessly walking front you . cons : - increase lens movement windy situations , kind like sail boat . - takes up more room your bag , even when reversed they still add diameter lens . - people take more notice you , help blow your cover if you trying keep low profile .	1
i surprised heft this tele converter when it arrived . it comes pullstring pouch offers reasonable protection camera bag , purse , or other similar carying case hold lens while attached required adapter . it also comes lens cap each end . converter high quality look feel throughout , lens hood included inexpensive adapter kit ( required ) , mounting threads cut accurately enough lettering lens hood all line up perfectly top assembly . it looks i would expect canon , which say , instrument quality . ok , looks don't make good pictures , so here rest story . body made tough , lightweight materials ( frp ?, polycarbonate ? ) , so what you feel when you take lens out case weight several glass elements . glass coating well , pictures nice contrasty . flare distortion minimal , par quality slr offering . base lens s2 fairly fast , doesn't suffer defects maximum telephoto , so this converter built complement quality , it fine job . matter fact , converter lens optimized supplement only telephoto portion main camera lens range , less than moderate telephoto settings , you end up view back end converter lens , not much else . used intended , it gives you ability use your 5 mp sensor take spectacular 650 mm telephoto shots incredible sharpness , color , detail . there no comparison digital zoom all . this lens alows you " reach out touch someone " while using every pixel your sensor available , without adding eyeball noticable distortion all . top , image stabilizer camera lets you shoot 650 mm telephoto pictures handheld reasonable lighting conditions . check out price 600 mm image stabilized lens slr get back me after you recover . sure , $ 5,000 slr body/lens combo win comparison lab bench , might stop faster ( only high end though ) , but s2/teleconverter combo lets you take far better more creative pics than classic 35 mm mirror tele lens ever offer . further cropping photos your computer later simply amaze you . price , it must item . it also catches action field movie mode nosebleed seats stadium . it big lens , make your s2 look though it must slr , but combination s2 teleconverter light enough ( compared slr ) carry all day long desert without problem . it offers digicam prosumer quality glass reach used reserved higher end slr . what it adds your photographic range , it cheap , o.o ne suggestion . lens adapter/lens hood combo you need mount any three converter lenses canon offers dirt cheap . combo sells around 26 bucks everywhere . adapter attaches camera push button release bayonet mount , quick change , feels very secure . adapter also takes 58 mm filters all kinds , i like keep uv filter mounted my camera improvement contrast it offers , protect camera lens damage ( i dropped my s2 this past weekend , hoya uv filter took fall . it dented , but didn't break ) . anyway , because they so cheap , i suggest getting one s2 , each converter lens you buy . way , you switch lenses instant , keep front each lens protected it own uv filter and/or hood . oh yes . good circular polorizer filter really kills glare , brings out contrast any lens under many typical shooting conditions . tele-converter lens not front threads mount filters ( most don't ) , but i made adapter mounting 72 mm uv filter 7/16 " long cardboard masking tape core inside diamerter slipped snugly over end tele-converter . prior gluing uv filter tube section , i painted tube flat black . now , circular polorizer ( or any other 72 mm filter attaches adapter , looks like it belongs there , works perfectly . i think you enjoy this converter much i . good shooting .	1
digital rebel most amazing camera i've ever owned . my previous camera canon a90 i loved using all features it [ great camera ! ] . i decided recently maybe i should graduate slr because i starting get more creative my photography . i spent great deal time researching cameras finally decided digital rebel . after few months owning it i still am amazed . image quality fantastic , it quick responsive , every day using it i learn little more . it perfect intro slr camera me because everything makes sense it easy learn . i've gotten amazing shots i could never dream getting point shoot . if you finding yourself wanting little more than point shoot , go this camera , you wont sorry .	1
i am just hobbyist . this big purchase big step me get into this level camera . i still haven't mastered using it yet , i've it few months . it wonderful job taking pictures . if you right lenses , it take some most beautiful pictures you've ever seen . again , i'm just hobbyist/enthusiast . i use it take pictures work , too . i highly recommend getting couple very good lenses go it . don't go cheap lenses canon , tamron , sigma , etc . make this camera . yourself favor get nice zoom - spend some bucks . you'll happy you . camera itself pretty easy use if you leave it auto , but that like buying race car never shifting out first gear . auto settings great , they wonderful job , but you so much more if you learn use camera manual , av , tv , or mode . it allows you so much more creativity you'll amazed difference . 30d came out right before i bought 20d , i would probably buy it price now , but i'm very happy my 20d	1
those you who d200 wondering if you need this flash consider this . d200 built flash acting commander you use sb800 off camera . just set it up it included stand coordinate flash camera conrols you now ability capture portraits look professional . set it up behind your subject , off side , angle bounce anywhere . i am sure you get idea . just one more reason why nikon great value . think what it would cost you similiar capability your canon . this flash may seem high priced but it most sophisticated unit market my opinion . good luck !	1
this same canon grip , made same factory . i don't know how they get away it , but it consumer gain here . through 2 batteries your over hundred bucks ahead --- spend all those lenses you'll end up getting xti/400d .	1

after reading number on-line reviews , i bought this lens few weeks ago straightly its low-light photography capability . what i gotten little more than i bargained . pictures it produces made casual hobbyist like myself look like pro , least admiring eyes unsuspecting acquaintances . now only if i heart mumble-jumble few far-fetched jargons , i might new packing order firmly place . when paired my rebel xti , 80mm effective focal length wide apertures make it ideal portrait lens . it also compact , light-weigh solidly built , fast acurate auto-focus , most importantly , superb optical qualities . best part i gotten these without breaking bank nor it break my neck hauling it around . however , despite its low-light capability , very attributes make this lens outstanding portraits , i.e. , narrow angle view shallow depth field wide apertures , make it odd choice in-door group photos . also if you taking action shots , 80mm focal length may not long enough provide safe distance avoid mishaps . instead distal observer , i found myself unwilling participant middle action ducking camera ever-curious tongues my golden retriever her playmates . no wonder zoom lenses so popular . what else there not like this lens ? not much unless you proud owner one mammoth expensive prime lens . well , it come free hood wonderful soft leather pouch , doesn't it	1

i purchased this lens primarily use macro lens . since i shoot mostly wildlife ( including bugs ) i thought field view 160mm ( used my canon rebel xt ) would just ideal . reality fl not enough . i approach bugs much too close they frequently left scene quickly . pictures taken lens extremely sharp bocah ( out focus area behind subject ) very nice . i wound up selling lens ebay since it didn't meet my needs	1
i seen glowing reports this lens several magazines , most notably shutterbug . it truly splendid performer one well worth paying if photographer needs extra working distance afforded macro lens 180mm 200mm range . its performance certainly good , if not better , than nikon venerable 200mm f4 micro nikkor , which one first - if not first - telephoto macro lenses this focal length . this canon lens excels not only macro photography but also nature photography , getting close-up images animals wild without working too close disturb them . if i owned canon equipment , then this lens would essential part my kit	1

around or dinner or something , i don't need camera makes me jump through hoops get decent shot , i just want point shoot . full auto , or aperature priority , or shutter speed priority , pictures usually sharp crisp . set image size one medium or small settings you use high speed multi-shot feature get series action shots guarantee you'll get least few good ones . i no qualms setting this camera auto , handing this camera person little or no photgraphic experience , letting them click away . it easy enough learn most folks taking nice pictures less than hour , pros taking great pictures no time all . other hand , lot work i very artistic , involves using manual settings . when going perfect picture , it often necessary adjust focus , aperature , shutter speed get exact picture you want . this camera manual focus , feature i sorely missed my older powershot a80 . thing bothers me most other cameras , you wade through bewilderingly large collection menu options make smallest changes . while i understand using layer or two menus things like basic settings ( time , format cf card ) i can't see it something basic film speed or white balance . which why i love this camera . following items one button away : flash flash output levelmulti-imagetime delay photoautofocus areamacro modemanual focuswhite balancezoom / outfilm speed ( 50 400)picture mode ( auto , manual , manual preset 1 2 , av , tv , portratit , landscape , backlit , panorama , movie)my favorite things this camera : battery life excellent . i bought spare battery , but i've never actually use one came it less than day . it charges fast too . picture quality : larger lens allows better pictures low light conditions , it very clear . large ccd allows you get pictures large enough resolution print out fairly large copies them look very good . ergonomic . this very comfortable camera hold long time . it not quite same range some much more expensive units , but i've never gotten tired holding it . plus , all buttons you need hit while running it right there under your fingertips . scroll wheel under your right index finger very intuitive operate . push it change modes , roll it change settings . fold out screen allows you take pictures odd angles without ever lay down your back picture . plus , fold out screen feels very solidly built , not like it'll snap off your hands . i always worried my powershot a80 , it didn't feel very solid . it works well my computer , which runs linux . i use gtkam , great camera programit infrared remote used take pictures without worrying camera shake . this very useful group pictures you'd like yourself . user savable white balance settings . real flash shoe . this camera takes standard canon flash unit . manual focus mode puts close up center screen right middle picture you check focus . this would really bothsome composing pictures , except when you half depress shutter button , small zoomed square center disappears leaves you whole picture . rapid fire photo option very useful action shots , some candid stuff , like subway pictures . mechanical view finder more than just adornment this camera . it quite good , it changes its field view according current zoom setting . it also focus adjustment it . this very nice if you wear glasses , it lets you adjust view finder your eye , you get your eye right up it , not keep bumping your glasses into back camera . very wide open fstop 2.0 very closed off 8.0 . lastly , it remembers virtually everything you setup last time it or certain mode , reverts those settings next time you turn it or switch modes . this includes things like white balance , settings not remembered my powershot a80 . now negatives : door covers usb port / dc input , av output very easy catch swivelling / revolving fold out screen , screen takes fare bit effort revolve , it quite likely you'll snapped door half before you notice it gone gotten itself caught spinning lcd screen that passing . if it gotten little bent , it get caught every time fold out screen until you snap it off or bend it back place . flash way too close lens , which makes some pretty obvious shadows bottom right hand corner some photos . luckily , i'm not much flash usage , if i , i'd probably spring real flash sat hot shoe . still , if you're looking great built flash , this not camera you . slow focus , autofocus become confused objects within few yards , never really focus . plus , focusing pretty slow . if you looking camera very fast , nearly perfect autofocus , you might better camera . movies limited 3 minutes maximum , which seems rather arbitrary . even 5 minutes would big step up , it would allow me catch average musical performance one step . final word : this great compromise camera someone who really wants two separate cameras but can't afford them . it good snap shot camera , good big lense , big body , big ccd machine capable creating art . it not best either those categories when compared other cameras , but one both , it represents perfect compromise pretty reasonable price	1
this works just described . long flash i-red beams see eachother it works fine ... but radio controlled flash much better	1
man . what lens !!! it not cheap , i dont ' find 135mm particularly useful focal length my 20d but after seeing glowing reviews this one both [ ... ] , i decided buy one try it myself . it not cheap $900 , but it worth every penny . this one absolute stunner . i cannot believe my eyes sharpness f2 it improves very little when stopped down . bokeh unbelievable !!! i dont ' hesitate shoot f2 i don't find it necessary stop down just increase sharpness . size build perfect although i don't like canon hood design . why can't they simply make hood same crincked finish lens ?? then they would not so easily scratch . it beyond me . but that not problem lens itself whenever i use this lens , i know i one best lenses ever designed . it forces me excel myself knowing now , only limitation me , photographer not camera or lens . absolute beauty . go try it yourself . i try shoot this much possible results stunning . i just wish it came weather proofing image stablization like canon modern lenses but that just nitpicking . i love it it	1
ability combine four different delay interval modes makes this product able accommodate almost any automatic-shooting situation . you control delay until sequence starts , delay shots , total shooting time , number shots . last one , however , where glaring flaw comes : controller limited 99 shots when you use total-number-of-shots setting . correspondence i've canon , they no explanation this asinine limitation . even modest cf card these days holds more than 99 shots , even raw mode . time lapse , 99 shots woefully inadequate . you work around this defect simply letting your card fill up or doing math using total-duration setting . but sometimes you want shoot multiple sequences one card . if you know you want 300 frames ( example ) , it annoying baby-sit camera stop it manually , or math figure out how many seconds total your sequence take , convert minutes seconds , then dial into setting controller . if you then decide use different interval , you get re-do all . dumb , canon . fact , this device shouldn't necessary anyway . every camera today should come this functionality ; it technically trivial , since every one these digital slrs computer plenty on-board timers logic this task	1
i just bought digital rebel month ago . love camera , my old 380ex speedlight integrates camera but just doesn't offer enough cycle speed keep up continuous mode rebel . this flash job rebel plug external battery pack promises even better performance once i grab item . big selling point really makes this unit worth cash , it its own infrared focus assist lamp which digital rebel lacks . when this flash mounted your digital rebel , you don't get annoying set quick flashes camera set off focus low light when using built-in flash . rebel body uses infrared focus assist 550ex focus lens ; this feature alone worth big bucks this baby costs . flash tons features most us might never use , but advanced amateur i'm glad they're there so i play if i should choose try out some fancy stuff . wireless slave capability handy but you've got least one more 420ex , 550ex or 580ex use . i like digital readout back flash also two way bounce head , it important note you press button make head turn either side side or up/down --- this should make head sturdier than i've seen some units get loose after awhile drive you nuts . this unit honker -- really big , , no lightweight either . get yourself big deep camera bag if you want lug this thing around you . what difference this 580ex ? 580 very slightly faster cycle times offers some fancy new automatic flash exposure bracketing modes , me anyway it wasn't worth almost two hundred dollars more 580 . all newer eos camera bodies fully supported this unit , it also works older eos bodies but there functions available newer ones aren't there older stuff . i like this flash it covers well , cycles fast controls fairly intuitive easy use . when you get yours don't lose book , canon doesn't seem them online anywhere i find i've seen places want charge you 18 bucks new one	1
if you would like list sites reviews email gumby dontquotemeonthat dot com pros : very sharp , bright ( fast ) , versatile , excellent build quality . cons : af tends dicy low-light conditions . pros : sharp , sharp , sharp . no distortion , no ca , optically superb better cons : ef-s mount . sell it when i upgraded 5d . pros : very solid build , internal focusing fantastic , produces wonderfully saturated photos high contrast , bokeh lovely very smooth , auto focus typical ring-usm full time manual focus excellent smooth . 2.8 aperture , 52mm filter size cons : i feel canon could reduce price , however this quality i don't mind paying it . if your newbie here some info lens " fast " when it low f-stop ... ok so when you smaller number apature bigger which allows more light through , so this means you up shutter speed . still enough light reach sensor . ok so lets say you out door shot if you say f/4 lens shutter speed could 1/250 second you would get good exposer . now this lens only go f/4 but if you same outdoor setting , f/ 2.8 lens you could jump 1/500 second get same exposer . freeze action mmore effectivly , this i believe why it " fast " lens . ok fun get it	1
i sold my nikon stuff canon , i using sigma 70-200 f/ 2.8 which very nice . when i moved canon i going get sigma lens again ( shooting soccer ) i wasn't any luck finding used one reasonably priced . i researched canon 200mm f/ 2.8 decided try it . i couldn't happier . af faster more accurate . it very easily hand held(i usually put sigma monopod ) i love this lens	1
this lens exactly what it should . overall quality extremely good . take look my photos : - first photo without lens- second photo lens flash- third photo lens without flashthere few things note photos : - there substantial amount barrel distortion . this normal . try not straight lines near borders photo make it less obvious . - fringing exaggerated . you notice fringing ( purple or blue tints ) high contrast edges objects near borders . you see this regular shots but more exaggerated wide angle lens . - lens makes shadow when using built-in flash . you see shadow photo flash . darker environment , it very obvious . external flash only way fix this . couple details : - you get extender nice brushed aluminum here : http://www.lensmateonline.com/s2.html- camera setting ( converter ) indicate you lens attached . it not obvious what it but it indicated change image stabilization icon so i assume it affects way image stabilization works . overall , i recommend this lens	1
job canon e-ttl ii nice feature but i wish they would provide battery indicator like canon dslr cameras	1
i bought this camera 6 mos . ago trip europe . it great , photos come out crisp clear , optical zoom great , there several manual features , although this not camera those who enjoy extensive custom settings . what i wanted , small poin-and-shoot digital camera , this fits bill . there some areas improvement canon continue work . while i am glad they left viewfinder this model lcd bit difficult see during really sunny days . whenever i connect usb cable camera , i am afraid i am going break off little cover usb port camera . finally , i know lithium ion battery enables case smaller , but i really wish i could grab battery off shelf supermarket	1
this camera potential pictures amazing clarity colors but not straight out camera . i too disappointed after converting raw files c1 pro acr . it possible my d-rebel would better than this monster gives me neck pains made my right arm start looking like swartzenegger arm ? even glass results dissapointing . problem not camera but workflow . after using it 2 months i am getting used workflow give me results i am looking . i realize this camera not perform any processing enhancements camera because pros need it themselves . once i got over fact i would sharpen saturate colors lot more than before i content never touched d-rebel ever since . ps beware severe neck pains when attaching any zoom lens . buy hand strap or better neck strap . some photo samples found here : http://www.trekearth.com/members/nbournas/photos	1
i purchased canon off camera shoe cord use canon ex 580 weddings . i needed cord use flash braket avoid red eye . it what it supposed . no complaints .	1
this flash preforms excellence ! all nikon products i pro grade . this flash recycles fast ready when i need extra light fill main light . i purchased sb-600 d-200 am very happy it . i used it last six weddings this year shooting action shots skate boarding compitions . . wolf , atl . ga	1
wicked 8.5 frames per second , this sports/action/photojournalists dream camera . if you need speed this one . aimed squarely sports shooters photojournalists , canon it . if you looking more portrait/art/wedding camera get canon 5d	1
digital photo frame easy use software excellent . i gave item 50th birthday gift set it up very large party . frame showed slide show 65 pictures became focal point guests . everyone spent time looking pictures family throughout 50 years . many asked where get frame . it hit it worked described	1
i don't know how i ever without this little item . its indispensable taking pictures tripod . it works easily efficiently exactly describe	1
monster little pricey , everyone knows , but it good stuff . this unit attractive , works well nicely designed . only one very small drawback : unless you small pointy fingers , first battery little hard remove . i use little plastic relay tool lever it out , which i store right charger . but i stayed 5 stars this one	1
i am technology guru this camera simple use great results . touch screen awesome !!! battery life so much better than other cameras i owned . i think this one outlast perform any them . buy it now if you want quality camera make you happy !!	1
filter decent . i paid only $3 free shipping so im not expecting much out this filter . i bought it protection it perfectly . not best night shots obviously but overall good buy	1
using either ef 16-35mm lenses or ef-s 10-22mm lenses ( 20d or rebel bodies 1.6 crop factor ) this hood helps eliminate ( i mean reduce lot ) flare sunny days or certain lightning conditions ..... highly recommended those who like shot lower end ( 16mm ) these lenses .	1
i am am very happy this package . only issue , thick stainless steel neck strap . i no use it i never seen anyone using it . i would prefer extra battery or existing battery extended life one . overall , price you cannot get leather case battery combo somewhere else same price amazon . i consider neck strap unnecessary component one comes camera lighter more flexible . it also more elegant .	1
careful when you use this lens because it not ( image stabilizer ) so if you shaky hands exposure any more than 1/8 second you going going get some blur . this why lens so cheap . this especially bad when you far end spectrum this lens . if you really zoomed it cloudy then you should know use tripod just case . this goes any lens , but if you using 300-mm end this then use tripod . it common sense , but i've loaned out this lens they complained me afterwards	1
i ordered this my parents , so they watch their first grandchild all day long :) i haven't spent lot time it because i won't keeping it , but i used it enough load bunch pictures it them found it very easy use , great picture	1
i bought this year ago taken many great pictures it . it light , many features used automatic when all you want point click . i can't recommend it enough .	1
this my first purchase digital camera . features pretty standard . pictures i am able take either very good or fuzzy . fuzziness applies some pictures auto focus unusable . some reason certain situations , i am unable get af work . i said before , when af works , i get very good quality pictures ... you want get bigger memory card too	1
case fits perfectly , canon product canon product should . took camera diving several times without hitch . i'd buy heartbeat	1
i think i originally gave hd1 i bought through amazon 5 star rating . while model performed satisfactorily me , some reviews i've read suggested it failed many instances . i think oled display must cause many failures , because sanyo apparently replaced oled display more conventional lcd display . i purchased hd1a , also amazon , because i like more than one camera angle , whether i'm videoing home consumption or stock video saved not-quite-ready-for-primetime mpeg 4 video codec ... although it really better than much my standard video shot mini dv tape cameras i oun . i found purchasing 49mm sanyo adapter , i could attach 2x lens i already ouned now optically zoom quite close subjects . i also purchased polarizing filter go larger lens really saturates color , especially clear blue sky . short , i think i feel more confident hd1a purchase than hd1 camera , although it still early days this could all change	1
this my 3rd digital camera i bought this one supplement my larger 10x zoom camera . this one fits nicely into pocket or small camera bag easily take it all events or travel . i've found it takes nice photos indoors when flash used .... even when cats or dogs i'm shooting moving around . i've felt life battery set pretty good , but i've using nice rechargeable ones . definitely get set 4 , then you 2 use 2 backup set . settings pretty easy figure out change 99% my photos taken " auto " setting came out pretty good . others indicated , indoors - without flash - produce blurry photos , but that nature almost all cameras , not unique this model . glad i bought it would highly recommend it	1
well worth investing ! always battery charging so you won't find yourself ready record something special find your battery low , even worse , dead ! not bulky , very portable , simple use ! all you need electrical outlet you're all set	1
i'm still new this camera , but i find it absolutely amazing . i fuji finepix 2003 i've just given up using one because it eats batteries doesn't take high quality pictures compared my friends ' cameras . i looking sales over thanksgiving break significant other took this hint . he found this camera very good deal department store , but it display model so i didn't get manual or anything like . however , camera itself really user-friendly , i've found i use most functions without look up what they . we just took trip atlantic city this camera performed well inside hotel , outside night , down ocean night , inside casino -- all types lighting , pretty much -- so long i chose proper options . i'm excited get know this camera better , but i think it excellent choice people looking something good quality reasonable price	1
this great camera so far . there lot options i haven't gotten chance use yet , but so far it easy takes great pictures	1
this film great color reproduction performance . i would give this film 5 stars except fact fujifilm superia x-tra 400 provides similar performance cheaper price	1
we bought this camera online , refurbished . everything functioned correctly . it not offer shutter speed adjustment , which only thing annoys me , because camera chooses slow(er ) shutter speeds , unless you point thing directly lightbulb . ( which , i might add , it took excellent picture ) so action shots not it specialty . however , macro shots , pretty much everything else works great .	1
this case great my camera my needs . i usually only take me my digital camera , four extra batteries , possibly one extra sd memory card . everything fits there great , i don't worry locating anything when i need it . i know just where it . i bought this case myself december , so far it washington dc new orleans ! i take suggestion someone else made strapping it around your waist , it worked like charm ... until heightened security museums washington , dc . i wiggle out it so it could go through x-ray machine ! but other than , it very comfortable , stayed put , i no complaints	1
truly amazing little camera . i looking something small i could stick my pocket when i go out everyday but still took sharp pictures . this camera all more . its small solid still manages take gorgeous photos very nice videos . i highly recommend this camera anyone looking easy use very portable camera	1
i really like this battery charger . it very easy operate charges batteries 1 hour . i leave them unit least anothr 1/2 hour make sure they fully charged . i like fact it comes 4 rechargeable batteries very affordable price	1
what horrible horrible horrible camera this . only thing nice it looks . like other lessons life , looks aren't everything . run away !!	1
i would love camera little thinner , it bit bulky but i like it very much . i still need get know it better , play it more .	1
i bought my sony dscm-m2 wolfs camera . iwanted something small could take really good pics ability record video . not want mini cassete . want one memory card . this thing grea t.t ake really good pics video . you transfer video m2 base station vcr record it even dvd recorder . i wish it little more zoom . inferred mode . just like sony night shot or super nightshot !!!! hopefully sony make dsc-m3 . add it camera . other wise this camera rocks !!!!!!! easy flip up lcd . wish it touchscreen . sony you made really great camera some one who wants small pocket size camera.my wife loves this camera . you switch photo video so easy . touch button	1
i just recently bought sony dsc-m1 camera absolutely love it . since then , i looking nice case store it . $10-20 you get full blown padded camera case all sorts pockets , zippers , straps what-not . thing , big point this camera , just how small portable it . stuffing generic camera case much triples size i t.t hats where this case comes . its probably one cheapest feeling ( looking ) cases i've seen . essentially it feels though its made cardboard ( very thing layer polyester wrapped around it ) , honestly , it feels like this case cost sony 2 cents make , no joke . so why heck i give this 4 stars ? well , it works great what its designed . its great fit , so adds almost no extra size already tiny camera ( huge plus ) , belt loop , well metal ring .. this nice it lets you connect it your pants very easily slide camera or out .. other cases you stumblings trying squeeze camera there . i would've liked some additional compartment it ( 2nd battery or additional memory stick)finally , this camera fully enclose camera . both upper left right sides camera fully exposed . so again , those additional problems , why heck am i giving it 4 stars ? simply , it works . its way too much money what you get , you're really only paying sony name packaging . but its best case out there m1 . if you spent $600 camera like myself , you spend $30 real good case it . if you want all-in-one case , all means get one generic branded ones , you'll get lot more functionality lot less . if you're looking ' perfect fit ' designed specifically this camera , one designed keep it same exact size , get this	1
this product , so far i know , not available amazon since jan . 8 comment claimed . it wasn't available feb . 19 when i ordered it amazon competitor . it now available ( march 1 ) very competitive price . it fabulous video camera . colors accurate , low-light performance amazing , video noise non-existent , resolution blow you away . 2-hr battery provides full 2 hours recording . camera light , flexible , intuitive use . sony minidv tapes cost reasonable $10 ea ., there zero dropouts . loading couldn't easier . it'd nice if sony would stick optical zoom specs ( 10x ) , since digital zoom anything ( why stop 20x ? - go broke , 1000x ! idiots . ) steadycam - optical stablization - seems work very well . you shut it off if you're using tripod . audio okay , but it could much better . they provide jack external mike powered shoe lamp . video output flexible - usb , ilink , component , s-video . speaking flexible , user guide runs over 100 pages ! there useful content every page - it'd take months try all options available ! image quality stunning , esp . considering reasonable price . i've not tried included software , but hdmi playback my panasonic 50 " plasma just like network hd ! fantastic ! you won't disappointed . ( okay , there one little glitch . zoom speed ( rate ) not menu adjustable . there variable zoom speed provided via little lever , but you'd better steady . ) great camera overall	1
i bought this camera directly sony store paid $650 march 7 , 2007 . amazon selling it $350 more than what i paid it . buy direct sony save . guy counter tried pressure me buy extended warranty , i declined . sale guys make more money selling equipment warranty then camera itself . camera works great , i also bought $20 stand which i use my sony digital stills camera . you can't go wrong this product . bira raibirara	1
i hope give more depth review later , but wanted sure make it clear everyone firewire cable ( so-called ilink ) not included this produc t.t he camera itself intuitive easy use out box but also highly customizable . video sound quality excellent , lcd screen gorgeous uses touch screen buttons addition button bar beneath it . but sony way making fantastic products then alienating purchasers those products ( la ps3 ) . so understand order very basic essential task transferring your dv images your computer requires you shell out $35-70 more buy firewire cable . provided usb cable transferring stills memory stick only . thus , this camera only receive 4 stars due sony cheap skate approach . caveat emptor ..	1
there some very detailed reviews , most which i read before i ordered camera amazon . there ample evidence professionals find camera useful . i want take minute speak rest us . camera came month ago i've extremely happy it . let me offer some perspective my comments . last camera i bought small sony shirt-pocket-sized camera i using alot it got me back into taking pictures . i decided since i taking so many pictures i wanted camera would take much better quality shots , without my get phd picture-taking . i opted this camera 18-200mm lens . i now take same pictures i took small camera , but zoom lens i frame them better 10.2 mega pixels i blow them up frame them . there dozens ( hundreds ? ) features i grow into , but now i am delighted use this camera right out box , just minimal reading instructions . everything i remember my 35mm days ( my first camera minolta srt-101 i bought 1973 ) put use , but what i forget , camera remembers . my poin t--t his camera ready meet you wherever you grow you should you decide you want go farther out deeper	1

it certainly isn't hollywood quality , i wouldn't use it music . but interviews , sound works just fine , especially considering price . my only real complaint clip lavalier . unless you slip it into lapel hole , it generally fall off if your subject moves more than tiny bit . bottom line : i'd buy it again kind shooting i	1
i this camera six months i still find new features play . one my favorite mode sequence shots . i love its sleek design its durable shell . i carry camera my back pocket , even my tightest jeans . this great camera	1
i bought my parents each their own digital picture frame christmas . they not technical geeks any stretch imagination . they love it ! frame easy set up easy use sd card . only cons this product ... resolution isn't my standard ( but more than ample people who aren't self proclaimed photography-snobs ) . i also wish it option greater than 12 seconds pictures . 30 seconds would nice so it doesn't make you feel like you're watching powerpoint presentation all day . i would strongly recommend this product . price , you can't beat it	1
you get 200 pictures under $60.00 . or you could buy 40 pack around $28.00 . 200 bulk , better price money . can't go wrong	1
i wouldn't paid full price this but little more than cost spare battery it good buy . i two regular 8800 batteries but when traveling away charger i wanted something i could fall back aa batteries available anywhere . reason i don't know how long nikon continue carry battery designed camera . i already jvc camcorder it impossible buy battery , leaving me tied power cord it came , well few other appliances propriatary " rechargeable " batteries expired can't replaced . i attached battery pack my camera test it out using mix nimh batteries surprised how long it lasted . somebody already mentioned , battery pack camera not fit coolpix carrying case , it fit well my lowepro case i used carry around my 35mm slr cameras . batteries also add quite bit weight so you need consider if you doing lot hiking .	1
this battery got me though many shoots my many dv films . it last long it specifies . too bad i sell it i am buy new canon my pana died . it great battery though , great price	1
this cable unique usb cable nikon digital camera . only problem i couldn't find darn thing anywhere . it functional piece equipment certain but nothing super special .	1
i dubious after reading reviews frames . this frame gift my parents , who nearing 80 . it easy set up use . my expectations exceeded ! it simple plug go ! it easy insert memory card launch slideshow play music well . my parents delighted , there virtually no computer savvy required make this thing work . remote easy too , accurate . i imagine my parents setting this up their living room or family room , constant slideshow running themselves their guests	1
i bought this camcorder $300 which good price because this camera gave me tons features clear picture . great shooting family videos or amature movies like i make myself . it very small too . over all im very happy this camcorder . yes i edited my review earlier there humming noise , but it turned out my fan . i love this camcorder !	1
great handycam . fast easy use . we received it 5pm used it 7pm record concert .	1
this great little pocketable camera . i love it . get most out it , it important experiment various settings . some tips : - outdoors , set exposure middle setting , white balance sunny ( or prevailing weather , auto works well too . ) , i turn off image stabilization because it causes weird distortion warping-like effect especially if you move , make sure night shot off . i also use vga setting 640x480 tv resolution . these settings , my videos look great even my 42 inch plasma tv . but don't expect high-end results , but very good results , better than i expected price size . way , digital zoom only ok up 1.5 , after which it gets much too blurry . also , make sure set lens focus either long shot or close up , it makes big difference sharpness . you switch it even while shooting . - indoors , you use nightshot help somewhat dark room , but make sure take exposure down least one notch left middle setting . night shot helps making picture lighter , but it also causes lot blurring when things move . lowering exposure helps compensate lessen blurring . i found middle exposure setting causes too much blurring unacceptable . just turn it down notch two middle , you'll get acceptable good results . course adding more light room helps . don't use image stabilization , it distorts image too much . - photos , use same settings you'll get good results . some photos i took outside beautiful day came out stunning , look fantastic plasma tv . overall , i couldn't more pleased it . i also got 2gb sd card extra battery , which i recommend . it perfect size weight just keep your pocket catch those spur moment shots , price it can't beat	1
i agree most reviews here . it heavy not particularly quick focusing , but makes great pictures . i moved up 70-300 nikkor , it well worth it . extra 100mm wonderful ( essentially it like 600mm lens 35mm ) . vr fantastic . one best endorsements it number times i've heard " you took handheld ? " . closer minimum focusing distance would nice , but i no real complaints this lens . i posted couple photos here , but you can't really see detail . some nikon lenses feel like they're made masses . 80-400 ' pro ' feel you come expect nikon . you won't disappointed	1
perfect video camcorder outside recording . crisp picture excellent sound . wide screen mode looks great . extra battery must long vacations or shoots . not forget shoulder strap because you not want drop this baby . also excellent still photos memory stick option . easy button just easy . indoor shooting little rough without proper lighting so careful . overall , great piece electronic	1
this my first digital camera , i lot search finaly i decide dsc-w55 black , what i looking , small enough it my purse , lot functions , very easy import pictures my computer , you only connect camera usb cable you don't need install software came camera , i windows vista i didn't any problems transfering pictures , best camera price great , you choose super saver shipping save more . you love this camera too , small , very pretty , lots options , take great pictures . some one wrote review this camera feels like plastic , that not true , looks very durable me i think good product worth every single dollar you spend . easy shoot pictures auto adjustment mode , start taking pictures sooner you charge battery , because this camera internal memory you buy memory card later . well hope you lots fun taking pictures , good luck ..!	1
just took it vacation , pictures awesome . easy carry , easy use . no complaints	1

i this more than month now . installed 256 mb sd card , currently loaded 800 photos , configured my albums based trips occasions . i set photo frame slide show mode daily auto off settings . 1 week ago , i bought product , pandigital ( 7 ) w/ 128 mb built memory . philips far better picture display where pandigital acceptable photo display . when you look closely or stare photos , you immediately see philips not any grainy reproduction . it also elegant slide show transitions ; pandigital needs work their transitions . you just patient when transferring files your pc photo frame , i find myself hitting reset button more than i really would prefer . i find this no harm my pictures . this resolved just your pictures displayed straight or transferred your card . i just chose pc method because easier management what i needed transferred .	1

i won't go no brand name battery again . frankly , i don't think any battery holds charge long it should . however , this one ok but it not generic either . spend money get real thing . otherwise you'll spend same amount quantity other just get same amount time	1
i ordered 3 en-el2 batteries . they arrived before estimated delivery time great condition . i am very happy price service this company	1
i bought this scope amazing bargain just $30 christmas tree shop . i read lot it sure it great buy . soon i brought it home i took it out box gasped awe . it high quality peice looked great . this model equatorial mount so you synchronize it celestial pole(poloaris ) it gives you ability track objects across sky . it large solid tripod adjusted easily . two lenses it comes magnify objects either 45 or 125 times . when i first took telescope out my dad we found moon i amazed what i could see lunar surface just 45 times magnifacation ! moon took up nearly entire field vision lowest magnifacation detail amazing ! using other lens even better i could see craters maria all sorts amazing things . just few days ago i used my night sky magazine(which great magazine way ) able find saturn it high sky right beehive cluster close gemini right now . after few minutes searching through low power eyepiece i found it . bright blob golden light eypiece . hands trembling i carfully adjusted focusing nobs i saw it . saturn all its glory my eypeice . i could just make out rings though it small it clear sharp . i hurredly popped lens out put more powerful one i saw saturn even more detail . i could see cassini division ! fortunetly atmosphere coraperating so i could see somthing most would need large reflector see . i amazing i could see it so small telescope . my night sky magazine it says march/april issue you see nebulae , galaxies , clusters amazing things just low magnifacations such 30 or 50 times . i even see m41(the beehive cluster ) just binoculars ! i saw cluster when i looking saturn . so if you see this telescpope even 50 or 100 dollars buy it you wont disapointed	1
i used pretty good slr bw film . i thought i decent photographer could lot camera . when digital came out all automatic settings ' no thinking required ' settings , i lost enthusiasm sport . p712 brought my interest photography back life . all good things everyone else saying this camera , it ability give photographer complete control over every critical factor making photograph . not just aperture shutter speed , but white balance , ' film speed ' , quality level , color , bw or sepia , multitude other user controllable features . this camera loads fun me i enjoy messing around all settings . if you person who doesn't enjoy all playing around i just described , you assured this camera deliver best pictures possible it automatic mode . it best point shoot camera i've ever . but it so much more . i like feel p712 much better than z612 . 612 plastic/flimsy feel it , my opinion . it seems bit larger more substantial than 612 although i expect picture quality same . i am very pleased my 712	1
these binoculars amazing they completely crystal clear perfect size you going hiking or walking . i would completely recommend this product	1
i purchased s70 10 months ago travelled it throughout southeast asia through harsh climate conditions rough roads . camera flawless ! camera " build " fabulous camera quite simple operate even though it many features found digital slrs . two features i like most : 1 ) panaorama feature combination zoom browser software produce breathtaking super wide angle panoramic images 2 ) capability shooting/storing images raw format those special occassions when you know you going want print image highest quality ( its successor s80 nothave raw image feature ) . this very high quality camera if you don't want bulk digital slrs market but want very high quality images ---- this camera !! this camera turned me into canon fan ! i recommend least 1 gig memory card one extra battery . highest resolution i getting least 350 images 1 gig card . i also recommend lowepro case compatible s70 like rezo series pouches very protective holds extra batteries memory cards	1
i spent lot time researching cameras before i chose this one . overall i'm quite pleased , but i'm not through mastering this camera just yet . there only one big negative me lack image stabilization . this not best camera action shots - i get lots blurred shots when i try photograph my kids or dogs while they moving - which most time . other than , i love low light features - you get decent picture nearly totally dark room or outside under moon . i love natural setting where you take 2 pics one click , one using flash other without compare 2 . i love fact my batteries last forever !!!! i love video capabilities this camera . i may never use my vhs-c camera again ! macro awesome well , i like photograph flowers . money i think this very good camera . i don't use face detection feature much , don't really see need it , but i suppose it kind cool feature those who want it . i'd trade it more image stabilization though . i would reccomend this camera anyone who wants more than just point shoot camera but isn't ready slr or doesn't money spend slr .	1
i bought this item my last trip us it works perfectly . cartridge only print exact same # pictures it designed only con i think order cartridge work , you twist one sides your finger ( haven't think anything else ) get ink ribbon place it start printing it pretty hard so my finger hurt while . other than , this printer works like charm	1

great build quality comes solid case . job its supposed good optics	1

dsc-t100 great all round point shoot all features expected camera this class . 5x optical zoom nice given non protruding lens , allows very quick start up time around second . additionally face detection very good , once it locks subject/s it visually moves them keep focus area frame always right place . it used full auto settings or it gives access manual controls , however i found auto very good almost all situations . pictures taken very good quality although low light high iso blur little . continuous shoot mode allows almost 3 shots second out flash which leaps ahead casio i traded this . menu structure sony very intuitive feels like proper interface rather bunch options long list . all all very good , easy use , high featured compact camera . i would recommend anyone .	1
i am new digital cameras , but shooting film variety formats systems over 30 years . after much research agonizing compromises , i waited purchased this pentax optio 33wr . it small , but fits my small hands well . all controls nicely defined laid out . i began using camera prior consulting manual because camera logically engineered . manual well thorough , pentax also spells out accompanying acdsee software - not needed if you own mac . you also download manual specs this many pentax cameras directly pentax doc site - free , prior purchase if you want study this . specs available quite accurate . output great ! sharp lens , fast focus , accurate exposure , it fits my pants pocket . it lot flexibility ps fair number manual features if you need them . nicely sealed , all weather unit . solid feel ! lots positives ! negatives : came 2 inexpensive alkaline batteries instead lithium versions - i replaced them , but one find power this camera anywhere . camera comes 16mb sd memory card which good 8-10 hi-res pix , so i replaced it 64mb version ($34 ) . all-in-all , 4 stars may conservative because i like it it nearly all i need want	1
great product price . it tough hold 10x binocular steady , but when you hold down stabilize button it locks . you also pan while locked down track something moving such wild game or airplanes , etc . low light viewing not so good , but i'm not willing pay premium get , nor carry extra weight would go larger lenses .	1
i bought this camera back-up my d2x so i wouldn't change lenses much trip i'm taking alaska this summer . well let me tell you , d200 18-200mm vr lens incredible . it fast , quiet pleasure use . i've read forums 18-200 little soft . so far i totally disagree , pictures i've taken very sharp . i wish this would available when i bought my d2x . if it , i would own two d200 instead one each . highly recommended !!	1
no lens doesn't everything . but after six months my camera its go lens 90% my shots . lowlight , macro extensive tele work need something more , but everything else you just keep it . real benefit this lens its sharp contrasty 18mm up through 170mm . its main problems vignetting wide apertures distortion . most photos its not noticeable , but when it problem photoshop ptlens or dxo get you results look like pro lens because you've got inherent sharpness contrast work . its great flexibility , convenience , dust protection ( not change lenses all time ) its worth its price	1
this my second digital camera . i owned pentax optio , which very small , so i hesitant purchase this camera due its somewhat larger size . however , poster before me mentioned , this camera not only small ( not tiny though ) light weight , but it also takes really incredible pictures . under $150 this camera offers alot more than other cameras same price range better quality pics . one thing i would like mention , aside taking great standard night day pics , ability adjust picture ratio . second night out using this camera , i able fit all 6 my friends one shot , sitting comfortably sofa club ( 16:9 ratio setting ) . really blew me away . after careful research consideration , i am very pleased my purchase	1

i'm using this flash sto-fen omni-bounce diffuser it it takes flawless photos . wish it just bit more power , but still works well out 20 feet or so even diffuser while bouncing off cieling , so i can't complain	1
yes , it great buy , only depending who you . this camera perfect someone who doesn't want anything , just take picture . it many settings many different situations : indoor parties hikes cluody skies . only bad thing i found weight . it very compact , but you feel you it your pocket ( leica lenses inside quite heavy ) . happens because you amazing 10x zoom . picture quality beautiful . colors pictures almost better than real ( kinda scary ... ) . very fast processor , good battery life . screen very big . great buy	1

this kit , although not died wool professional , excellent starting point serious amateurs learn how use studio lighting effectively without spending fortune . i basic ingredients experiment produce excellent results .	1
you can't find better lens price . some people seem let down speed focusing capability this lens 200mm or above but it should expected if shooting telephoto , user would incorporate tripod . i originally thought buying tamron 18-250mm but this lens half price although you lose 10mm width , you gain 50mm length . few people who reviewed this lens put it canon 30d or similar pro digital slr , question i , why would you spend $3000 body $250 lens ???? it makes no sense ! i this lens mounted my digital rebel xti it great match . i would love faster zoom lens this range but i don't want spend thousands dollars needed . if you like me enjoy photography , hobby not make living , you should buy this lens it superior versatility . if you professional photographer need superior quality , you shouldn't even looking this lens , so please us casual photographers favor , don't review this lens	1
i bought these upcoming alaskan cruise boy i glad i . we some other 10x25 binocs i used years wanted upgrade something more substantial . these amazing ! they so clear stabilization most impressing aspect them . i used them least once day since buying them bird watching , astronomy ( moon looks amazing ) watching new housing development go 3 miles away . my parents considering getting pair cruise too , i plan share but i don't think i'll want without these long . wonderful product i plan use years come	1
i took my camera hawaii intention bringing it swimming , kayaking , snorkeling it worked like charm . clear , sharp pictures without leaking one bit water . i used it salt water it submerged least 15 minutes time swimming pacific . you grease lubriate rubber sealing ring follow directions carefully order it leakfree . it comes tube grease rubber seal , anti-fog solution you rub onto lens . you make sure seal good condition ( not twisted , completely dust free ) . you also soak case sink 30 minutes after exposure salt water . i guess you should buy new seals periodically if you detect any moisture inside . i like strap it comes buoy keep camera sinking if it falls into water . iit every control duplicated perfectly you operate camera just well if it wasn't case . zoom , menu , cursor , camera modes , power , image stabilization off , external buttons all accessible . i took movies well pictures . i think this better solution than buying camera waterproof ( e.g pentax w20 ) . you ultra small camera out case but tough dunkable camera when you need it . sony makes it very clear it not responsible if water leak , but so far , thing works well .	1
this not true black white film , it color film no color ... but results still quite nice if you ask photo lab print it true black white paper . you your prints back back next day or even 1 hour , depending lab . this much nicer than hassle true black white sent away while you wait week	1
i bought this lens my 35mm pentax camera , since i'll buying one dslr bodies sometime . it fantastic : very very sharp great saturated color . par , sharpness-wise my zuiko ( 50mm 1.4 1.8 , 85mm f/2 ) nikon primes , but better color ! contrast good well , there rumors lens underexposes bit - perhaps it , but works well film . film camera , there vignetting when you zoom wider than 21mm - but that nice special effect , sort semi-fisheye 16mm . also , using supplied lens shade isn't great idea when shooting 35mm film cameras , vignetting starts early . there no aperture ring , so if buying this film body , make sure it compatible fa-j style lenses . my pz50 body , i can't set aperture , but it works fine program shutter priority mode . overall , this super lens , best i've owned	1
i recently started small photography business doing black white shots kids their natural environment . i wanted camera took quality shots , but still cost effective . i most definitely found it . my cannon takes great shots allows me mobility needed chase kids around . very pleased .	1

i read previous comments superiority fugi film kodak ( i agree part ) , however , it should pointed out reason fugi film worked so well long island sound photo shoot because fugi film lends itself more greens blues color spectrum while kodak films lend themselves more warm yellows , oranges deep reds sunsets vermont landscapes fall . fugi film exceptional but its quility limited just kodak	1
grown up using pentax slr cameras lenses i very intrigued k100d ability reuse some my mount lenses . i am extremely impressed so far image quality , built-in flash ( no red eye problems so far ) almost instantaneous shutter camera . oppressed so long compact digital cameras i reinvigorated my love photography can't wait explore many features k100d . auto-focus very good so far just one occasion where it didn't seem adjust properly , but also could operator error	1
i bought this camera more than half year ago . my intention get decent camera images , but then also able use it filming short movies . i'm very pleased its performance . good lighting conditions , colors come out amazing . i really really not expect them so vivid sparkling ! darker conditions , well , it still works fine , not nearly bad i expected some other reviews . photos might grainy or not vivid anymore , but stuff still perfectly suitable show photos people . filming , it terrific . i mean , resolution great ( sth like 848 640 or so ) , better than what one could possibly expect regular camera . quality super awesome , looks very neat computer screen . respect . it pointed out you cannot zoom while filming , but not many cameras out there . oh , it also very small gigantic screen great battery life . great buy	1
i find this great little camera money . my needs , it just right . i find it takes clear pics , very small , so easy carry . i no problems it all . i carry it case my belt or pocket . i recommend it highly	1
this camera great our use -- i wanted high megapixel camera so i could blow up pictures frame them , that exactly what i got . i love option able turn viewfinder so it doesn't get scratched , but sometimes digital options bit difficult figure out ( i.e. changing mode , changing flash ) . once you get it , it easy get back , though ! we recommend this if you want heavy duty camera - it isn't tiny , but it fits my purse best all doesn't break first drop ! :-)	1
i got this camera replace 3.2 mp nikon coolpix ... it instantly gave me wow effect . camera so thin , it fits comfortably your pocket go anywhere . screen beyond huge ( my nikon only 1.3 inch screen , so this major upgrade ) . only disappointment would actual " resolution " image . i mean ... picture files themselves don't seem able zoomed computer much i expecting without becoming pixilated . but i guess maybe that how it supposed , 6 mp doesn't mean you zoom crop eternity ? either case , i soon got over ... because pictures always turn out great . colors accurate , pictures very clear , even variety situations , best shot modes actually useful , unlike my nikon which they didn't help very much . also i must say this camera very fast taking pictures , starting up , recovering flash going off . which great . it so annoying when you stand wait " black screen " while flash reloads or something . finally , i say included rechargeable battery awesome ! it lasts ... almost eternity . you take hundreds pictures one charge ... so great ! previously , i would always need spare aa batteries , but not anymore ! this camera fulfill needs any normal person who isn't expecting slr-camera . i would recommend it anyone . before purchasing this camera , i put lot research into it competitors . i say : buy this one . it great	1
this nice accessory kit considerably less expensive than buying all components separately . if you want olympus-branded battery you can't go wrong here because they throw neck strap case still it cheaper than buying batter alone	1
pro : this camera big screen , long-life battery , light weight , which easy carry around . con : size little big man hold one hand , let alone women	1
good product , like price . this much less expensive than current pinseeker 1500 models , i bought it ebay used $150 so you may able find it less ( look under hunting golf rangefinders this model ) . this not pinseeker feature newer models but normal mode scan mode work perfectly ranging flags no reflectors ( although you may need try more than one time relatively stable hands ) . i able range flag 270 yards , able range top telephone pole 375 yards ( but it windy so flag straight out little cloudy ) . i would estimate this work ranging flags calm sunny day ( these don't work well sunny day because laser used visible light laser gets little interference sunlight ) 215-230 yards flag ( which what i need it ) . less expensive alternative than pinseeker , i really like performance , very impressed .	1
i thought twice before buying this lens . it wasn't designed specifically my canon a620 , it required purchase adapter ring , it blocks flash . said , lens feels good camera ( even canon plastic adapter ) pictures what i hoping . i use it all time . it great assembling panoramics , doesn't suffer any unexpected distortions ( beyond horizontal bending you get any wide angle lens ) . highly recommended	1
i really like this camera ! it fairly simple use , takes great pictures packed features . it fits nicely hand compact enough slip coat pocket or purse . we bought this camera our daughter birthday . she using it ease especially loves movie sound option . my opinion , camera winner any adult or kid wanting good all around digital camera . my only negative it battery hog . most digital cameras , you want make sure you get rechargeable batteries large memory card	1

upgrading old sony trv-130 hi-8 digital camcorder . what difference every aspect . size options exposure there no comparison . what almost looked dull pale reddish , bordering black white full high grain my old 130 now comes out crisp , colorful no real visible grain hc90 . unfortunately any camera this camera perform best adequate light . my problem my trv-130 i mostly shooting indoors pro lighting setups whim unrealistic me so i make 100 watt bulbs they trick this camera . awesome color , crisp detail i really love true widescreen progressive modes . they give my videos unique film like look them . other than you love this cameras low light capability which clincher me getting this unit . all features combined make it must buy	1
this great video camera . my only complaint uncomfortable awkward hand positioning when " taping " or even while taking still pictures . i end up use two hands ( luckily i extra one ) steady camera , especially while using wide angle / telephoto feature . it even difficult press " record " button stop recording without fair amount movement .	1
these great bird watching . they make things very clear distance . good buy	1
they sent me wrong lens cover said i ordered wrong one .......... don't think so since i got copy ....... poor customer service all around .....	-1
polarizing filters used eliminate glare non-metallic surfaces like glass or water . they also used increase contrast color saturation your image . i use my polarizer not only eliminate glare , but also make skies nice shade blue or get some " pop " out clouds . there so many options consider when purchasing polarizing filter your needs . instance , linear vs . circular , film or digital versions , or quality vs . price . if you making use ttl or auto-focusing system , circular polarizers designed work those features . linear polarizers their uses , but they manufactured differently may not work . unless you certain , just get circular polarizing filter . there some digital circular polarizers market . i am not sure what makes cir-pl lens better digital opposed film . i use canon 20d digital slr see no problems caused using supposed non-digital filter digital camera . most time , when it comes filters ; you get what you pay . mean you need expensive polarizer ? course not , just sure get right filter your needs . what ever polarizing filter you get , make sure it color neutral prevent unwanted tinting . spending more color balanced filter save time post . if you need multiple filter sizes , consider saving money using step down rings . currently i use hoya pro1 filters , canon polarizing filters i previously owned without question bulkier heavier . weight might not seem like much , but when you stick all your items backpack all extra bits weight add up quickly . i spend good amount time my equipment my back so this big concern me . when it came down images , times i would see browning tint my photos . tint easy clean up photoshop cs2 , but i don't see problem hoya pro1 filter . overall , i would recommend against canon polarizing filters . i originally thought , " it canon , it must quality . " since then i replaced all my canon filters . this filter works , but comes cost disadvantages other similarly priced filters . pros : used film or digital cameras eliminates internal reflections ghosting cons : bulky heavynot neutral color balance	-1
camera worked fine ; however , after six months , it stopped working . i took it pentax authorized repairer pentax refused pay camera because dirt grit zoom mechanism . my use no way abusive . i previous canon powershot s200 lasted forever same usage , until i gave it away . i guess i should stayed canon . i bought pentax its size lightweight , but what good if it doesn't last ! don't get pentax expect long term use out it	-1
after reading many good reviews here , i too bought lenmar battery act second battery my canon digital camera . i totally pleased excellent performance many others noted . only difference i noticed lenmar oem battery lengthy continuous shooting lcd screen camera case got significantly hotter lenmar battery oem . this not problem until i shooting 101 degree day ( lenmar battery ) suddenly screen went black . i could view previously taken pictures ( lcd ok ) but any new photo i tried take black . i read later manual upper operating temperature camera 104 degrees . once camera cooled it worked again while , but black photo problem continued intermittenly few weeks then camera completely stopped taking photos , no matter what . so , it lenmar battery extra heat generation pushing camera over its temperature limit damaging circuitry ? would it happened if cooler running oem battery installed hot day ? i can't say sure , but if you use lenmar battery i would careful operating it very hot 100 degree day ( e.g. use viewfinder , not lcd since generates heat , or turn camera off lot cool down shots ) .	-1
i purchased 510 powershot summer 2005 . after couple time use zoom cameras lens wouldn't work anymore . i cound't take any picture anymore . i contacted canon over this they ask me pay shiping send camera them fix .	-1
this camera probably go down nikon history one its most over-priced disappointing cameras . i bought mine through amazon calumet january 2003 . start , colors never looked right , especially ghastly magenta-toned skin tones . i also bought sb800s ( 3 them ) , thinking cls would great addition . but system uses ir unreliable any situation except very tight environments . camera wonderful feel , viewfinder reasonably good controls . but results disappointing . sensor undersized this class camera considering what its competition ( canon ) offers . nikon finally realized this dec . 13 decided dump all these cameras lowering price $ 1,200 . it just so happened mine melville , n.y. , long list issues repaired while it still under warranty . these include bad af performance since upgrading v2 firmware , bad color , overexposure , blurry images vr lens inconsistent color balance frame frame even when using preset value . i would strongly suggest you don't buy this camera thereby reward nikon producing inferior product originally sold ridiculous price what it offers . indeed , forget nikon go canon	-1
well course i read previous reviews regarding amazon shipping grey-market version this timer figured certainly now they shipping us version ... wrong ! i just received mine today it got international warranty card users manual . i haven't decided if i'm going return it or not but figured anyone else considering ordering this item should advised it appears amazon only shipping grey-market version this unit	-1
when i received camera i thought giving it 5 star because good looking nice picture . after 6 months use , i wish i could give it 0 star . it true it looks good but it very hard hold camera . it droped twice when i took pictures . also lens too small . dirt very easy get onto lens very hard clean b/c it small . thanks dirty lens , picture quality worse than ever . battery very small too . after 6 months use , it not hold enought power shoot 10 pictures ! they put buttons here there fit small space . it not user friendly camera .	-1

unless you take picture outside , no matter what you , picture comes out blurry . flash doesn't help all- it takes more than 5 seconds it take picture , you still get blurry picture horrible quality indoors . my sister camera olympus , 5 megapixel 3x zoom too , but i found it so much easier take picture(and better one too ) one . unless you want buy your 5th grader his/her toy camera , you shouldn't consider nikon 5600 .	-1
camera feels slick . software comes it gets 4 star efficiency , though intuitiveness not its strength . while large lcd display terrific ( main reason i got it ) , it worthless high glare situation . you can't see what you shooting . it worthless ! since nikon not give you viewing lense such situations , there times whey you no idea what you shooting . while viewing wheel , rapidly cycle through shots you've taken , quite handy , rest navigation less than intuitive , often takes so long figure out you give up . pictures generally good , though conditions perfect , or you get grain or blur . there one lovely feature , but it only useful tri-pod . it function which allows you take flash photo aperture remain open little while after fill background . it creates flash shots without black void background typical such pix . i use feature lot , but its worthless without " legs " camera . i bought this whim , counting nikon reputation . i known , i would stuck canon	-1
although easy load smart card , this viewer disappointing quality . my pictures look fine my computer , but pictures dark there no instruction how change contrast etc . ( although i found it picture could adjusted , it never mentioned manual ) . manual , because comment above , disgustingly incomplete . if not going through bother returning it through amazon because i purchased it line , i would not kept it . i actually bought digital frame smaller cheaper it worse , otherwise i would given it only one star . i could purchased unit circuit city or bestbuy better off	-1
this tripod seemed very nice ... until we tried extend legs all way . two half legs worked well , third section would not stay extended . locking devices pretty poor . they made cheap plastic i believe even ones work well now , not last very long even moderate use . next time i try find tripod set screw type leg extension lock	-1

quite sometime lured media publicity i thought sony good brand . but this not all true digital cameras . i bought this p73 myself hp 4 mp camera my cousin much cheaper than sony . both 3x optical zoom . hp one far better image quality . main problem photo quality not so good . it lacks sharpness most natural occassions becomes bit hazy . this fact becomes annoying because your friend who cannon or hp camera take sharper pictures better than you any light conditions . also , same price you might look something higher than 3x optical zoom , say 5x or so other brands . also during video , every option adjusting light conditions etc shut off , irritating fact . not recommended	-1
camera takes long time pictures regenerate next picture . compared other digital camera this presented problem two users i purchased these camera . also flash not adjust correct exposure protraits within 3 5 feet . pictures too hot , over exposed no adjustment works properly .	-1
horrible camera . barely it 2 months before it went fritz . drained batteries within few pictures . so not worth more then cost disposable !! sorry kodak ... but i'll stick good ol ' reliable sony	-1
i agree two previous reviewers . there needs user manual there isn't one . fine adjustment adjust vertical angle maybe 15 degrees . this isn't very helpful star gazing . maximum height tripod only 45 inches . this uncomfortable height looking through binoculars while standing . celestron should users guide showing how their tripod binoculars supposed work together	-1
i just got this printer dock camera , printer feature real pain ! paper almost never feed no matter what i've tried . when it feed , it ends up jamming . i only successfully printed one picture tried 7 others then laminate gone . i'm very unhappy it probably send it back	-1
i tried everything . firewire , usb . there insert guide mentioned you connect cable first your pc then your camera , then turn pc then turn camera ... then wait stars align right order . if you anything different order then your camera get damaged . what kind crazy world panasonic live ? well , i followed instructions tee , downloded right drivers all yet my pc not recognize gs19 or gs9 . i used both . gs19 new purchase so this definitely going back . i thought , this model would gone away kinks but , no ! so , my panasonic recorded dvs gonna remain tape . i never able put them dvds . what joke , this camera turned out	-1
this case looks good protects camera adequately , but too bulky . it hasn't got lot room inside - i unable fit extra sd card its little case spare battery . belt clip difficult use , i end up carrying case my hand most time . there better cases this camera	-1
i've read good reviews this camera this other sites but i am not same experience . quality photos horrible so i started thinking it me i tried it different settings , tried very , very still etc but , i only get one good shot out ten . i fuji 4mp i bought 6 years ago it takes way better pictures than this . i bought this so i could give my old one my daughter but i'm gonna end up giving this one my daughter keeping my fuji . we recently snow here tucson so i took pictures mu fuji compares them canon 6 year old fuji finepix beat it hands down . i don't get it , i get defective camera or am i doing something wrong or this camera just suck	-1
night owl optics monocular major flaw soon i started using it . system uses high voltage derived 2-aa bateries . occationally unit would create large snap(arcing noise ) emit bright flash light eyepiece . if one using instrument , light actually hurts eye . i returned monocular night owl repairs . i not know result repairs it still transit . they told me ship it my expense . strange requirement instrument batteries recommended removed if not used 24 hours . other than above , monocular performed well . epilogue-night owl optics repair unit returned it .	-1
it arrived broken stand missing . i waiting replace it local discovery store	-1
i received this monitor baby shower gift , but it something i particularly wanted . i extremely disappointed when i found it didn't work all ! there so much sound interference it impossible tell if noises baby or interference . we disconnected every electronic appliance house ( cordless phone , microwave , even turned off our cell phones ) still interference there . video reception awful , supposed up 300 feet , we only roughly 20 feet away still picture terrible . i swear it supposed " night vision " - forget it , non-existent . i'm off video monitoring ; i'm on-line now buy old-fashioned voice monitor	-1
it fits s1 , but it doesn't always charge -- contacts arent same size oem version . when it doesn't charge i just re-insert batter it works , but its sort bummer	-1
i just bought this camera took it one my kid indoor soccer games . light low , but not low . you should able take picture without flash . when i took flash off , picture looked fine preview , but came out completely black . yet camera able take perfectly fine video same light level ! what disappointment . i am going try return it	-1
careful ordering this item - make sure it right one your camera . while it says it a95 , it isn't . while it doesn't say header it la-dc52c , it , a95 camera requires la-dc52d . i return wrong one reorder right one . i purchased wrong one based amazon direction when purchasing accessories don't want others make same mistake	-1
i own many sony products , including sony cybershot dsc-f717 , which i love . however , i am very disappointed this camera , sony cybershot dsc-t5 . i bought t5 my mother father present . it small , lightweight , portable ; easy use ; stylish . it take nice photos brightly lit environments , especially outside . however , after several months use , few problems become consistently evident : ( 1 ) there horrible red-eye ( white-eye ) artifact many pictures . so-called " red-eye reduction " setting nothing . ( 2 ) dim-light photography very grainy , lots noise . nigh t-t ime photography impossible . these problems not unique our camera ... you find many corroborating reviews above . overall , i am very disappointed this camera , wish i could exchange it something else . not buy this camera . other reviewers suggest t7 or t9 take much better pictures ( they still small pocket-size cameras ) .	-1
this lens extremely fast ( quiet ) focus , razor sharp . what more could you want , when photographing wildlife up close	1
i purchased this lens back march 2005 shoot static " warhammer models " my 10d . i found longer lenses such sigma 105mm , canon ef 100mm , tamron sp autofocus 90mm all " too long " 10d 1.6 focal crop would result requiring me use lot more physical space what i room get sho t.t he canon ef 50mm f/ 2.5 nearly perfect match 10d this purpose . its small , its compact , its short focal length not require i standing three feet away model i'm shooting . far shooting non-static objects , such insects , lens slow focus loud , both noise vibration , which results " startled " subjects missed shots . same also applies non-macro shots well . its slow focus makes it poor choice action photography , its loud enough draw attention you when you attempting other shots well	-1
it everything it advertised . i carry my digital camera lenses well two point shoot digital cameras . slingshot backpack , my back doesn't moan groan it other camera bags . i like feature swinging bag front get my cameras out removing backpack	1
i'm still learning use this camera all features . so far it amazing . i've taking pictures kids it looks like pro shots . i use auto mode lot it works great . zoom amazing . i love it tells me when i am focused . also it great battery life . i'm very happy this camera	1
this very easy use camera . simply using auto mode composing your pictures properly you get very good jpeg images . it also complicated you want make it . it many advanced features it . i shooting 35mm 32 years . my most recent before this one elan ii 7 years ago . it still working also . 30d my first digital i absolutely love camera . i generally work aperture priority mode tripod 100 iso when shooting landscape . but , camera very capable auto mode well without tripod . i like shoot raw so i tweek things bit , but jpeg images very acceptable . it also works extremely well portraits . it actually better than 35mm me because it very low noise even higher isos . 1600 looks like 800 film me . this very good value money my opinion	1
purchased printer dock camera bundle , local office supply store $100 . it only came 10 picture sample cartridge , so i purchsed this amazon . amazon best price around this item free shipping . it works great . no complaints . paper not quite shiny or thick epson photo glossy paper i still use some pictures , but works well my classroom , give my students . pictures not run like some inkjet pictures if you accidentally drip water them	-1
this one first lenses i purchased my rebel xt . now after taking several thousand pictures it i honestly say it well worth cost . i very rarely any unsharp pictures this lens unless it my own fault trying use too slow shutter speed without tripod . i also 180mm f/ 3.5 macro lens , which costs 3 times more than this lens , although it very clear extra reach nice times especially since it used both 1.4 2x tc , it very difficult use inside without tripod . 60mm handheld if needed very good results even if you bump your iso up little so . i also used this lens both inside outside portrait work very nice results . all-in-all , given it small size light weight i very rarely leave this lens behind when i go out because you never know when you might see great macro shot	1
my search semi pro digicam made me lot research after i shortlisted few models i find best deal . amazon helped me get deal today when i look performance camera so far .. i am amazed ... camera bound good but special thanks amazon.com helping me get one gr8 price	1
used this lens deer stand while hunting , sporting events ( indoor outdoor ) concerts . fast focusing great image stabilization ( use quite bit more power , though ) . not one problem it . solid build little heft it . it bit pricey , but i chaulk up it best market . would recommend it anyone looking top shelf lens .	1
i am very happy resulting prints this camera . i've used other brands past never such bright colors focus shots . winding mechanism easy use . finally i pictures my diving expeditions remember . it even suited kids over ten use . mine lots fun their own quick snap	1
short , i love it . xh a1 professional looking camera all features you need . it bit complex those who not true prosumers or pros , manual not consumer oriented . picture qualitity , so far , best i've seen non-pro cameras . 3 ccds 1/3 inch each truely spectacular . 2 external xlr connections reason i looked this camera . if you want mic someone via wireless or wired lav mic , this camer . just make sure you read over xlr connection settings manual few times change buttons ( unfortunately located 4 different locations camera ) right settings . set good headphones must-have when not using wonderful built-in mic . way , this built-in mic eliminated one situations where i always needed mic , close up interview situation -- built-in very sensitive accurate this type thing . downside this camera really only it not contain hdmi adapter . sadly canon not provide one ; instead they opted custom ( hdmi-looking ) adpater if you loose cable you can't run down fry or radio shack get one . :( other thing it 1440x1080 instead 1920x1080 . their new canon hv20 ( 1ccd camera due april 2007 ) 1920x1080 resolution -- just seems odd me . but then i'm guy get 10 megapixel camera simply because its better resolution . :) bottom line , don't get sony fx7 , get this one . sony seems easier use , but it doesn't external xlr jack , it uses 1/4 inch ccds , side-by-side test doesn't offer good performance low light situations this one . camera bit complicated , but if you're willing learn , it wonderful tool . if you need true point shoot , i'd wait get canon hv20	-1
i bought this camera take pictures my family friends . i if more than one year , it performed above expectations under all conditions . 1 minute video feature great , unexpected bonus ( since i didn't know it when i bought it off amazon ) . camera works great iphoto macos . i bought 512 mb card it so far it great . both my father my father law previous powershot s400 they no problems it . i figure some point i'll change battery , because lithium-ions lose 20% capacity per year , but so far it worked flawlessly .	1
i really some research digital cameras , even tried out sony , but canon brand far one best . i don't lot thinking when snapping picture this camera , it most work ! i like able think compostion my photo not iso , aperature , all jazz . settings make it so easy color photos turn out so true . digital zoom great even alert you if picture come out blurry . there so many features this camera , too many list . i even found great deal best buy 2 gig memory card , i get over 1,000 photos high resolution ! it takes alkaline batteries , but i bought rechargeable ones one charge lasts long time . i am sooo happy this camera , i take it me everywhere , even couple days work .	1
you check photos i took canon s45 this housing . it works brilliant . i just tested 10meters . also there supported extra lenses this housing ( macro , wide ) ..	1

through most 1990s , i lived overseas both europe asia . unfortunately , my number photos these times limited handful i hated looking like " tourist " my bulky camera ! nowadays , i no longer worry because cameras like this one ! i intially bought this t7 after using friend t1 impressed size it . t7 obviously considerably smaller , which even better ! i bought this camera right they coming out paid well over $400 it plus 1gb memory stick pro . both investments even this day ( over year later ) i am very happy . i taken this camera just everywhere wherever i go people love look it . i say i've probably sold least dozen these people fell love size camera quality photos it takes . far size , biggest plus it advantage . it fit anywhere . even optional case you buy it , it still easily fits trouser or jacket pocket , without even noticable bulge . far photo quality goes , most reviews note , camera very limited when it comes night time shots . i've found these shots often hit miss far what you'll get , but size lens size flash , what you expect ? after shooting few thousand photos this camera , i know what good bad night shot , playback feature , you quickly see quality your photo retake if needed . it perfect ? no , but that super tough camera this small . some reviews note difficulty trying take photo while holding camera still . i've never issue this , but i could see how it could issue , it just never one either my wife ( primary user ) or i dealt . i would venture probably vast majority buyers this camera likewise not problem . i've recorded more than few . mpg movies camera it surprisingly outperformed some my bigger ( more expensive ) point-and-shoot digital cameras . i very pleased . drawback noted many reviews lcd screen chance breaking it . i put plastic screen protector ( thin plastic sheet type held static ) it soon i bought it haven't problem . i've sat camera before ( accident , course ! ) it luggage like , but never problem . most significant drawback i've camera it take more photos ( esp 1gb card ) than battery last . buy second battery you'll more than good , but it just something keep mind . i would highly recommend this camera anyone who travels , or anyone who wants camera take quick photos . it carried anywhere vast majority shots , it all you need . i say we many photos our kids ( really good ones , too ) we would never gotten if my wife didn't regularly carry this camera her purse diaper bag ! i'm happy enough it i'm going buy second one myself ( especially now prices dropped so much ! ) so my wife use our first one entirely her own photography . i give it five stars would definately recommend it others	1

sony cybershot great camera . colors features amazing . very easy use . only thing i dont like camera zoom out button . if you zoomed you wont able zoom out .	-1
i received this camera serveral weeks . it good long zoom digital camera . i use it 18x optical zoom when i set its photo size less than 3m ez . photo isn't blur i use image stabilized . picture sharp . image quality good . however i set iso 100 or 200 . when iso 400 or above , i see noise , picture lose detail . but every camera its own defect . overall , i am satified this camera , i am enjoying using it take pictures .	1
i would like add reviews already posted , especially anyone considering this lens alternative 80-400 vr . this one only times i remember when i money buy nikon lens , but not able bring myself it . 80-400 6 years old , uses ancient mechanical ( slow ) focus , yet updated vrii technology . all , it still costs more than pro-quality canon 100-400 , which canon af-s equivalent too ! said , i like long yet portable lenses , after giving myself fits decided " settle " 70-300 because it vrii af-s . if you same boat then buy this lens , it gem its intended purpose . i get sharp results wide open 300 , light weight more than offsets slower apertures . i would loved this lens if it f/ 3.5 , but even 4.5 - 5.6 i really surprised results . save $1000+ until nikon updates 80-400 dinosaur	-1
this diffuser same quality one comes nikon sb 800 flash . it much better than other aftermarket diffusers require velcro . this made fit sb 600 perfectly . it snaps off easily . angled 75 degrees it provides excellent fill . i use it sb 600 set up slave sb 800 fill back lighting . it should included nikon original equipment but inexpensive cost effective . much better than built plastic flat diffuser	1
this camera very very easy use . i amazed colour quality even very low light . i took movie my nephew theater play i am contrasts crispness picture just perfect . zoom also very clear crisp . putting it onto my imovie also piece cake . only down point still image mode worthless , but if you need you should buy next level up which memory card slot . i highly recommend this camer	1
if you looking good small camera , no intentions ansel adams , this good camera choice . i travel alot , this camera perfect because it fit my pockets or small purse . it also takes pretty good pictures	-1
this backpack very uncomfortable . inserts stiff . it doesn't represent canon quality ( i hope )	-1
this great range use every day walk around lens . it very versatile , light produces great image sharpness throughout range . there bit vignetting wide end , which i actually like . however , f4 , this lens simply not fast enough me . i shoot lot images where i want out focus areas ( bokeh ) glassy smooth ( weddings , portraits such ) you cannot get this lens good you 24-70 2.8 . 24-105 f4 lens image stabilization which help you hand hold get shot lower light situations , but there not much get super smooth bokeh it . if you zoom all way , your dof low pretty darn smooth though my case , i just prefer look bokeh 24-70 overall rather than this lens . although 24-70 super heavy weight compared 24-105 . but i'm professional photographer so while my needs likes geared towards preferring 24-70 2.8 , this doesn't mean 24-105 isn't ideal many if not most .	-1
not much add top other reviews . only thing you should aware depth field f/ 1.8 paper thin , which excellent portraits , but requires perfect focussing . bokeh ( structure background blur ) nothing short great , easily competing much more expensive lenses . yes , it " " quality	1
i somewhat surprised receive my tc80n3 only canon international warranty .... anyone else receive grey market version this remote control ? i ordered $1000s canon products amazon.com always received canon usa warranty card items .... not sure why this item didn't carry usa warranty . i sent several emails amazon.com regarding this matter . i'll update review when i receive answer satisfactory . please note : amazon shipping replacement remote ! i'll amend again once replacement received . control itself wonderful product but this price i expect canon usa warranty card . gar	1
this great lens if you need shoot wide angle very low light siuations . if you don't need lens this exact purpose , you'd better off spending few extra dollars either 16-35l or 24-70l . these two zoom lenses cover 24mm ( more ) very reasonable 2.8 good results . they won't bag shot shadows , but they handle any decently lit scenario ease . if you just own 1.4 prime lens , 35mm 1.4 much more universally well-regarded lens than 24mm 1.4 . 50mm 1.4 1/3 price either just amazing my opinion so long you don't need wide angle . only reason i give 24mm 1.4 4 instead 5 price	-1
got it . worked per described . value money . works both front behind rabel xt(somebody wrote here it doesn't work back side camera )	1
my kids competitive tae kwon . i now used camera my wife gave me one year ago several tournaments . it able stop action take great shots even low lighting . now , we tried it when we went skiing it also worked great glare conditions snow . i bought monopod worked real well stabalize i use software called photofinale crop share photos . one year into usage i am still looking forward each chance i get play this " toy " . next options : battery grip , flash diffuser , extra remote flash ..	1
i spend most my time photographer taking macro photographs flowers other small things nature . i chose this lens over canon 50mm macro 100mm macro two reasons : ( 1 ) it constructed higher quality ud glass , so it great color contrast , it incredibly sharp all f/stops , ( 2 ) 180mm , it allows you stay farther away your subjects still focus 1:1 . this makes it easier take photographs without disturbing your subjects it allows you smaller , more blurry area background so background doesn't compete subject attention . lens also comes tripod color , which allows you conveniently change vertical horizontal , it adds stability your lens better balanced your tripod . lens ultrasonic motor , so it fast quiet when focusing , though i highly recommend setting focus limiter 1.5 m-infinity when not shooting macro photography . it speed up time it takes lens focus . only drawback i find lens it constructed only 8 blade aperture diaphram . theoretically , higher number blades , it would allow more natural blurs , but i say i've never noticed problem my photographs	1
i spent alot time evaluating this product . finally after reading reviews i dug deep spent extra dollars get this lense . it wounderful addition my canon reble . it very high quality product easy use delivers beautiful shot every time .	1
this lens takes very sharp pics . works great low light . true value price	1
great company - delivered product time . tested out lens mexico , brazil , canada . when automatic settings camera ( canon 10d ) selected pictures taken outdoors lot daylight , background overexposed . this results things like clouds not included picture . manual settings adjustments within camera remedy problem . however , there expectation lens canon should take quality pictures automatic setting . otherwise lens works great	-1
this camera pretty good , it very fast , photo quality excellent , video recording mode awesome , perfect carry everywhere since it pretty small , but after several months normal use , metal case begins look pretty rusted , that why i dont give this camera 5 star rating . but check flickr photos , you see examples great photo quality camera	-1
i originally purchased 30d low-end kit lens - me pricing didn't really make sense get either body or higher-end kit lens . i looking good all-purpose zoom full-size sensor covereage case i move up canon ranks new pro-level model future . 28-135 fits bill nicely . although it fairly heavy , difference build image quality 18-55 kit lens incomparable . this lens takes beautiful pictures operates flawlessly . i highly recommend it day-to-day lens , nice feature extending range down few stops without moving up much more expensive faster lenses	1
i love ef 70-200 f/4l usm telephoto zoom lens . price right , super quality pictures color contrast . it light weight 1.5 pounds comparing its siblings , 70-200 f/ 2.8 or without ( 3.5 pounds ) . i am think buy new model 70-200 f/4l . , i take pictures lower light conditions , which i could not it my 70-200 f/4l .	1
i like picture quality features this camera this price point so much , its third one i've purchased . my family seems hard cameras such this model only seems last year or so . point its banged around my wifes purse or accidentally dropped kids telescoping mechanism lens stops working . doing web research it seems common problem . so if you're typically more gentle than me my family seem , this great easy picture taker	-1
i this bag now over 9 months honestly say it more then surpassed my expectations . it stores everything i need when out family or friends catch all action one convenient place . center bag i following : 1 . rebel xt body2 . canon 430ex flash3 . 17mm-85mm lens4 . 75mm-300mm lens5 . sony handycam video recorder6 . power plug charging video recorderon sides i store battery chargers batteries flash , camera video camera , plus tapes video camera . front holds all manuals everything few extra memory cards lens covers . even after this , there still space bag other things . bag held up very well see no signs wear or tear after dragging this bag all over place last 9 months .	1
i got this lens my 30d found it useful walkaround lens , able handle just any situation i threw it , other than very low-light situations . even dim illumination it able function fairly well , thanks image stabilization , which let me shoot shutter speeds slow 1/4 second hand-held . i wasn't thrilled barrel distortion wide end zoom range , but i able fix this using photoshop lens correction adjustment no problem . it simply additional post processing step that necessary	-1
excellent choice make great job .	1
d70s minor update original d70 introduced 2004 , few new features slightly larger lcd . it still great camera , but expect it replaced new d80 , which 40 percent more pixels , 2.5 -inch lcd , additional useful features old price d70s . so , you probably save little money still purchase sophisticated digital slr if you wait until prices d70s stabilize new , lower level . , say , $600 , this camera would incredible bargain . d70s shined one best cameras its class since its introduction . example , it 1/500th second flash synch speed ( found no other camera but d50 ) so you keep ambient light under control avoid ghost images . its autofocus fast accurate , features both single-autofocus , continuous-autofocus ( tracking action ) , novel " automatic " autofocus mode switches af-s af-c required . if you no nikon lenses , get this camera 18-70mm kit lens , which very sharp versatile , rather than more limited 18-55 lens . you won't regret it	1
sima monopod perfect if you're looking something easy carry set up . it exends quickly quick release mount stay attached camera base . stability good , but it not sturdy feel . if you want something solid feel , you move up food chain , but sacrifice compactness light weight this product .	-1
great case . small , soft , compact , extra space batteries . however , hole camera strap center , which means if your camera strap attaches anywhere other than middle camera , it doesn't line up this case . minor detail . example , strap a530 near top camera , so strap goes out side case , unless you pull it sideways go through case hole .	-1
i bought this little camera recently amazon . thanks tremendous service speedy delivery , amazon . sony dsc-w100 terrific . it very simple operate . menu system well-organized easy understand . inserting battery memory card snap . zeiss lens system yields incredibly sharp photos even automatic setting . flash pretty powerful , too ! i took some shots rather dark restaurant , pictures came out really nice clear . macro function superb crisp , well-defined details very close range . powerup time this camera fast well time shots . there very little shutter lag , you usually get picture you intended get . autofocus little slower until it " finds " target perfectly certain situations . but this no big deal compared older digicams . i like able switch quickly viewing pictures replay mode back camera mode simply tapping shutter release button lightly . you quickly ready picture . camera not miniature weighs nearly six ounces , which not extremely light -- but comfortable carry or place purse or pocket . i also canon digital rebel xt , this little camera take sharper pictures . course , you not versatility slr , but it great everyday camera take you all shots you would otherwise miss . i highly recommend this camera recommend purchase amazon . update : i now used this camera video mode . wow . it produces incredibly sharp videos fast frame rate looks terrific our television . multi-purpose cable supplied camera allows usb 2.0 audio/video hookup . you must decide what zoom level before you start shooting your video because once you start , you cannot zoom out . if you 1 gb memory stick pro duo you take 12 minutes video . i want get 2 gb pro duo stick which allows almost 25 minutes video . this would ideal take when you want switch still video shots keep your video shots consistent consecutive order . you must use pro duo stick high quality ( fine ) video mode	1
bought this remote month ago . it what it says . you even use it behind . great little device price	1
i've considered other , higher priced digital slrs , such nikon d80 canon 30d . however , i decided i probably won't using some more advanced features offered those cameras , would rather spend money saved better lens . terms picture quality , all these slrs capable equivalent quality . currently i 3 lenses , kit 18-55mm , 50mm f/ 1.8 , 85mm f/ 1.8 . i don't use kit zoom lens anymore because i favor faster , prime lenses . i mostly take pictures my children , 85mm f/ 1.8 excellent portrait lens . it sharp , fast , produces beautiful background blur . zoom lenses unfortunately not sharp or fast , unless you're willing pay much more than cost camera body . i think all novice slr owners should buy cheap canon 50mm f/ 1.8 , discover what fast lens when you set aperture 1.8 , take some portraits . you too professional-looking results	1
i've this battery 3 months . so i don't long term experience . but so far it excellent . no better or worse then original canon battery . i would reccomend it anyone .	1

i bought canon powershot s2 year ago , taken 2,500 photos 15 video clips it . overall , i am very happy it , if i buying new camera today , i probably would get s2 or s3 . things i like s2 : * extended zoom ( 12x ) . i use it often . * image stabilization . particularly helpful when using high zoom factor , or when shooting low light low iso setting . it makes handheld shots slow shutter speeds possible . * electronic viewfinder means " what you see what you get " , just like slr . while not sharp optical viewfinder , ability frame picture without worrying parallax more than makes up it . fact , one advantage over slr there no mirror it move out way , therefore there no mirror noise when taking picture ; if you turn off electronic sound effects , it very quiet indeed ( although not completely silent ) . * screen moves rotates . i like it closed ( turned toward camera ) thus protected scratches . i used it folded out rotated forward order see myself self-timer photo . i used it take " clandestine " pictures -- holding camera down near my waist , i still see screen if i rotate it towards me . i also used it take pictures while holding camera above my head -- above crowd , instance , or over wall . * multiple-picture mode . similar motor drive film cameras , this allows me take several pictures quick succession holding down shutter release button -- 2 pictures per second . unlike some cameras , only limit number pictures amount available memory . * it used all-automatic mode , all-manual mode , or just any combination . even near-automatic mode , several exposure settings adjusted . * very good movie mode . it shoot vga-quality picture ( 640x480 ) 30fps . while results not good my 3-ccd dv video camera , i am much more likely this camera me than video camera , i really like option taking reasonably high quality video . i used it several times . * stereo microphones . decent sound video . also used adding sound memo still picture ( e.g. " this such-and-such place , blah blah blah " ) , or just recording sounds unrelated any picture . i used this couple times record " sound memory " place ; one botanical garden spot where scenery wasn't especially pretty , but sounds frogs made like nothing we heard before ! * separate buttons still pictures movies . easy remember which which . * manual pop-up flash . some people don't like flash doesn't pop up automatically when needed . i actually like this feature , because often i want shoot without flash when camera thinks i need use flash . course i force flash fire even bright daylight when camera thinks it not necessary -- although while i kept forgetting how turn feature , even though it pretty obvious ( there button right next flash ! ) . things i don't like it : * poor low-light performance . more precisely , poor performance high iso settings . camera fine low light if you leave shutter open long enough , or use flash . but if you kick up iso 200 or 400 ( equivalent " fast " film ) so you take indoor shots without flash , you end up very noticeable graininess pictures . this my number one disappointment camera . however , i don't know comparable camera better ( sample pictures i seen , s3 isn't any better ; i don't know why they bothered add iso 800 setting -- it seems completely useless me ) . i know there cameras , but they cost lot more . i saw pictures taken indoors canon 20d slr phenomenal . but besides added expense , camera like also bigger heavier , therefore less convenient . * camera too big pocket . i would love camera capable this would fit my shirt pocket , or least my coat pocket or smallish holster . i would take it more places if it wasn't so big . * yet , same time , it little too small my hand . grip just doesn't feel right . grip 20d felt great ! however , it just right woman hand -- my wife likes it fine . * no filter threads standard configuration . big lens like practically begging fingerprints or scratches . i solved adding conversion lens adapter , which filter threads ( more this below ) . * lens cap held friction . this both pro con . it good because lens extends when camera turned ; if lens cap attached lens simply push it off . it bad because cap could come off when you don't want it . this moot point conversion lens adapter , standard lens cap no longer fit . * default exposure too bright . not every review mentions this , but apparently it fairly common canon cameras . fortunately , this easily fixed setting exposure adjustment ( i set mine -2/3 stop ) . i haven't figured out how adjust exposure movies , though . i need look manual see if it possible ! if you buy s2 ( or s3 ) , i'd suggest also considering : * canon lah-dc20 lens adapter hood set . i mentioned above , this allows you add filter protect lens . currently $37.10 amazon . * 58mm skylight or uv filter screw lens adapter . * 58mm lens cap cover adapter/filter . canon 58mm snap-on lens cap currently $9.99 amazon . * high-speed sd card , least 512mb , but 1gb or 2gb would give more space movies . ( i use sandisk ultra ii plus , which added benefit able directly plug into standard usb port without adapter . ) * rechargeable nimh batteries . i don't any yet , but this next thing my list . i've gone through way too many aa batteries ! nice option available this camera tc-dc58b tele converter lens . this gives you maximum zoom equivalent 648mm 35mm camera . amazing ! i not purchased it yet because so far built-in zoom sufficient my needs . there also wc-dc58a wide converter lens taking extra-wide-angle pictures . after you get camera , you'll probably want case some type it . there * lots * cases choose . after trying few looking lot more , i finally settled tamrac velocity 4 . it may or may not what you need case , but there it fyi	-1
i used this sb-600 my fuji s3 digital camera friend wedding . i found you need diffuser ( such omni bounce ) , otherwise you get shadows . it works great bouncing off ceiling fill whole room . this flash easy use , reliable batteries didn't die until picture #637 . i no instances it not going off when i took picture ever	1
i owned this camera two months now taken 100 photographs ( keepers ) date . because i involved photography almost 35 years , i developed certain prejudices . particular , i never comfortable auto exposure even less comfortable auto focus . fact , last auto focus camera i owned nikon n8008s i ultimately sold auction because i could not adapt using various auto settings . however , i like this camera . why ? d70s very easy camera use i only refer manual check couple settings look up some features . honestly , set up takes only few minutes handling not terribly different film camera . i should point out this camera really designed auto focus lenses if you choose use your manual focus lot , you disable many camera features . because i am both stubborn cheap ( but mostly only when it comes spending money myself ) i am using my manual focus lenses this camera . it true i not get any internal exposure meter readings must rely handheld gossen or sunny 16 rule ( quite effective , really ) exposure determination . lcd preview screen thus critical determining or adjusting exposure . i should also point out depth field preview feature also lost when using manual focus lenses . i stunned when i could not stop my lens down burrowed through manual find out what i doing wrong -- which nothing except i using wrong type lens . while i really miss this feature , i am not sure how big loss it really because viewfinder . others made mention low magnification tunnel like views through finder i attest this fact . i compared finder views my trusty old fm just stunned how poorly d70 compared . ultimately best camera camera you use d70 become my camera choice . even though i am using this camera like vintage series leica -- i.e. , handheld meter presetting exposure anticipation photograph -- i find i live this level usability . some point i probably buy auto focus lens ( maybe 35 f2 ) make full use feature set . but now i content using camera old fashioned way	-1
when hood reversed lens , it blocks zoom ring tremendously when 17mm . it not end world , but you're probably better off storing this bag , not lens itself when not use	-1
when i bought digital camera , i already knew i would need rechargeable batteries it . what i didn't realize how quickly camera would eat supplied alkalines . i taken barely dozen pictures before they drained point where camera would no longer operate ! so i looked set rechargeable batteries charger quickly settled this one because previous experience monster cable products . it performs better than advertised . initial charge may taken 3 hours , but subsequent charges much quicker . i yet drain these batteries point where they won't operate camera . charger itself attractive unit appliance , led indicator lights up red charging changes green indicate fully charged . it compact enough fit comfortably camera bag plug folds into back it . i good service it highly recommend this charger	1
this uv filter it job protect lens well . build solid ( metal construction ) . glass also descent quality . performance , it absorbs some uv light . uv light absorbtion hardly noticeable , probably sky 1-a haze filter version absorb more uv light than this lens which fine me . now , one problem which internal reflection . i've heard many people say it mostly happens during night or low light shooting . i found out it not caused directly low light/night situation . internal reflection appear when there strong/bright source light comparison overall exposure ( surrounding environment ) . put it example ( which hopefully easier understand ) , when you take picture lamp during nightime light much brighter than surrounding area then you see internal reflection . you move position light closer sides/corner picture ( not center picture ) , internal reflection reduces finally dissapear ( if you move light far enough center ) . if light isn't too bright/contrast compare surrounding environment then there no internal reflection . but course most time , lamp nightime often very bright . but point i'm trying make internal reflection doesn't happen all time during low light or night time . additionally , internal reflection isn't only happening night . it also happen afternoon if you taking picture sun example . basically same rule above , how bright light source compared surrounding area , you move sun center photo near side internal reflection move side/dissapear ( also depending angle ) . but best way just remove filter during these situations . hope this explanation helps you reduce occurence internal reflection identifying correctly when internal reflection occur then remove filter during those situation ( which not hard ) . i'm actually not fan lens filter ( any filter ) i think it only degrade picture quality we added layer sensor object , but i decided use them anyway all my lens . i would recommend everyone get one this filter if you don't any filter your lens yet . i use this filter my 50mm f/ 1.8 lens my 18-55mm lens .	-1
if your camera spends any amount time connected your computer -- either copying pictures , or using remote capture program -- you should this ac adapter . it also obviously handy if you lot shooting fixed location -- instance : tripod . adaptor ingenious little contraption . there normal ac line runs power adapter , but instead running dc output dedicated jack camera body , connector shape normal battery pack . if you look closely your camera , you see little grove bottom battery compartment providing enough room wire exit . now surprise . i'm planning trip europe . i knew battery charger came camera , this ac adapter both support 100-240 volts ac , 50-60 hz input . which covers all worlds power supplies . but battery charger included camera only came us power cord . i've looking various european cords would fit charger so i could keep my batteries topped off overseas . what should i find when i open box this adaptor ? complete collection all worlds cords , which also happen fit charger . what win , now i run my camera ac , stay charged while i'm vacation	1
i own this hood canon digital rebel xt . i like hood . it works well limiting stray light well protecting lens . you hear many experienced photographers ( i'm amateur ) , they would never shoot pictures without hood lens so why would you ? all hoods expensive what they , piece plastic , but they serve necessary function . get hood if you want best your lenses , including this lens 50mm 1.8 ii . i would give it 5 stars but it pricey	-1
canon ef 75-300mm excellent product , i own expensive usm version this lense doesn't nothing jealous it , it speed focus excellent , main reason i bougth it my wildlife photography while kayaking , i wouln't take usm version my kayak , expensive get it wet , they both perform excellent , but cheap price this lense make it affordable risk proof your pocket , it little noisy but nothing affect it use , plus it intimidating peace equipment , make any person think you professional photographe	1
hoods offer several benefits photographer . primarily hood shades lens stray light may result unwanted discoloration or hazing image , or appearance lens flare . shading your lens helps improve contrast image quality . hood not required eliminate these problems , any item used shade lens provide same protection stray light . hood convenient it built offer protection while ensuring it not inadvertently find its way into your image . photographers often state protective abilities hood reason one . this hood solid petal shaped one three quarters inch long offers limited protection keeping moisture wind blown debris off lens element . when place , hood protect lens impacting solid objects . so shallow petal shaped , even this type protection limited . even if protection limited , replacing damaged hood usually cheaper than repairing expensive lens . this hood manufactured canon 24-105mm f/ 4.0 ef normally comes included lens when sold new . there no need buy one amazon often suggests . since hood wider than lens ; it easily stored attached reverse position . this doesn't add length lens , but make it wider inch . inch may not seem like lot , but tightly packed camera bag , it huge . this lens isn't unusually wide so extra inch may not problem . while protective benefits exist , they secondary limited . i find impact hood my image quality more convincing reason use hood . considering impact image quality low cost compared my other camera equipment ( except lens case ) , purchasing hood money well spent . pros : improves contrast image qualityreduces lens flare problemsoffers limited protection lens cons : takes up more space your camera bag store lenshigh price molded piece plasti	-1
very convenient . easy use . paper cartridge matched up quantities smart idea . sometimes printer jams but easy clear . i find colors bit dark skin tones not balanced most attractive . if they work these items this would fantastic device i would probably keep several office , home , garage , travel ... use lot media cartridges too . i am one those takes 800-1000 pictures two week vacation so i really would use heck out these cartridges if image quality better . i usually make 3 or 4 copies each print mail friends pictures	-1
i almost didn't buy this camera simply because plastic body ( i'm used praktica mtl3 film camera , which built like tank ) . however , i'm glad i overlooked because camera top-notch terms robust features quality it provides . startup time very quick making adjustments shutter speed aperture intuitive . if you get bundle kit lens , i highly recommend complimenting it very affordable canon ef 50mm f/ 1.8 ii lens , especially if you big fan dof lot available-light / low-light photography .	1

i use this monopod my pentax optio w20 camera panasonic video camera . i use it when camping it doubles sturdy walking stick . when i'm out wilds people think it walking stick until they see my small camera perched top it . it really improved my ability stay steady blur free my new pentax which no optical viewfinder . i like quick adjustment legs opposed screw type . i've also used this tripod stick my video camera out my sunroof cruise through new england catch autumnal leaves while driving which given some interesting results . i plan same thing rt 1 film big sur highway . only thing i need get ball head adjust angle camera . price this steal hearty deal	1
i am very happy item i ordered . shipment fast price cheaper than retai	1
i bought this camera same reason many you considering it , or already bought it--it size . it amazingly small , it hard believe all packed into this camera . i take it me everywhere , literally , it so small i am able keep it my pocket , i don't fear it get ruined my pocket because it so durable . there also small covering lens , so you need not worry lens get scratched . picture quality surprised me , when i first saw this camera i saw how small it instantly assumed picture quality would not good -- but i wrong ! picture quality this camera outstanding ( taking its ' size price into consideration ) . however , i few things complain ... first off , battery . this camera uses lithium battery , i find lithium batteries highly inconvenient ; because what if you vacation , where nearest place buy batteries just gas station -- there no way you going find lithium batteries there . not only it inconvenient , but also battery life span short . longest i've it work 1 hour 45 minutes . this isn't uncommon cameras , though , just long you bring your charger spare batteries , you should fine . problem i this camera zoom function . such small zoom length you would think zoom would silent since it hardly zooms ... wrong ! very wrong . zoom function this camera so loud sometimes you unable use it if you find yourself situation where you must quiet . even just turning camera move lens little , resulting noisy start-up . flash very weak . really dissapointing . if you inside , you can't any farther away then 10 feet lit room . last problem i found this camera macro function . auto-focus camera seems trouble focusing subject . make matters work , there no manual override overcome this problem . focus great , though , if you not taking macro sho t.t hese all flaws i found camera , it not my first choice cameras , i come across many other beginner cameras i prefer over this camera , but thing you keep mind this camera size . if you just looking something keep you all times , then this great camera choice .	-1

i bought this my nikon d70 digital slr 18-70mm nikkor lens . it works great except lens cap not work polarizer filter . it works other three filters : nd4 , nd8 , uv . price still beats buying four filters individually . i like case also	-1
if you use this lens 1.6 camera body such xt , 20d , or 30d you end up 160-640mm equivalent which impressive range any standard . you also add 1.4 tc 896mm upper limit or 2x tc amazing 1280mm . course this comes price , i'm not just talking money . you use tripod , cable release , mirror lockup lot time when using such long focal lengths . plus this thing very heavy very large people take notice . so if stealth photography your goal , go something like 70-300 . said , this amazing lens , admittedly little slow near long end , but get down f/4 would most likely doubled or tripled price weight , so it seems like acceptable trade-off . if you want sharp pictures , amazing zoom range , good workout , but don't mind center attention , this lens you	1
this one best bargains i've seen , " essentially " you get 3 filters price one . image quality these filters great , 812 ( warming ) filter far favorite giving back color richness flash photography so often washes out , unless you patience constantly tweaking your flash power . aside 812 uv protector basically clear protective filter . while it obviously advantages over clear glass , i tend not think it any different . this too great filter which i use half time because it doesn't affect color hues or change stop values too greatly while it takes worry out carrying camera around ready any candid shots may occur . finally included circular polarizer . this filter adjusts amount uv light entering camera spinning filter direction uv rays entering ( or turning thingy till things look better ) . this lens great sunny days take surface glare off lakes glass making them transparent again . it also makes colors more crisp general when photographing buildings other large " reflective " man-made things . so things sound great so far , but now why i only give this item 4 stars . while tiffen known one best photo video filters , they quality control issues no live up thier reputation . my case 812 filter arrived discoloration glass . while it didn't hurt image quality , flaw towards edge filter , i none less didn't want find situation which flaw would diminish quality . seeing it not amazon fault my first e-mail went tiffen replacement which they said they would gladly , but only after i send them filter they recieve it would they ship my replacement ( not option my circumstances ) . instead amazon wonderful customer service shown through again , within 3 days they replaced entire set . second set arrivided without flaw but since my other two filters perfect condition i traded just 812 . i havn't any other issues i'm very satisfied my filters . only other word warning would circular polorizer . while i recieved 2 flawless occassionally i read reviews customers received ones assembled backwards making lens useless . quick way check see if your cp working correctly hold it , thread facing yourself , look lcd monitor or tv spin it until picture dissapears(obviously working correctly ) . i still wouldn't pass up this deal knowing what i now , chances everything show up perfectly but none less if you're concerned order it before you need it check everything over carefully . amazon always best returns often ship replacement next day overnight shipping	-1

it seems unfair compare this camera 10d ( or 20d or 30d ) , either favorably or unfavorably . these instruments good their own right , but hardly same league 1ds mark ii . i used all three xxd , original 1ds body well . it occurs me folks who interested shelling out over 5 grand camera already idea what they want , some them asking if they should trade their 1ds body mark ii . it them i am adressing this review . remarks , i think help those who less experience line . bear me technical jargon emphais mark i vs ii comparison . i want help buyer decide if there really reason spend this kind money . first , regarding resolution : you probably won't able tell difference mark i mark ii unless you doing studio work . 8x10 image virtually indistinguishable . most us shoot . jpg mode , we don't mess raw . if you doing 17x20 wedding portrait working uncompressed files , mark ii superior . i outdoor work , so 11.6 megapixels plenty . finallyl , quality glass makes big difference ( much more than sensor resolution ) , so if you little strapped cash , buy 5d spend difference " " series lenses , or used 1ds ( mark i ) . second : ergonomics . i like histogram mark ii better than older camera , appreciate improved burst performance , storage times . small but significant differences . battery life way better , i like . i get 700 frames out charge mark ii only 200 mark ii . thank you , canon . maybe next iteration they something black brick charger . i only hope . third : sensor noise . most ofthe high-end cameras cmos now , each time we look new generation pictures we wowed decrease sensor noise high iso . i remember we praised mark i low noise up asa 400 . uninitiated , sensor noise random firing sensor due quantum effects , manifests sparkle or random changes pixel color . it more prominent low light high asa . mark i great up asa 400 , good up 800 needs some digital filtering 1200 . mark ii really good up asa 1600 , photoshop filter good 3200 . if you shoot low light , mark ii you . fourth : color balance . i always loved warm , saturated pictures mark i gives , so don't get me wrong - better color rendition not reason sell it new model . mark ii , though , improves it gives beautiful color saturation some improvement range highligts . digital photo buffs know what i mean : if you take picture broad highlights , like sky , foreground objecst underexposed . highlights clear . set exposrue foreground , sky burnt-out white . mark ii improved this much , but it still needs some work canon . now , it helps taken large number pictures get idea how set exposure . fifth : accuracy exposure . mark i annoying tendancy overexpose stop . i got used turning down exposure 1-2 stops , exposing highlights , using photoshop correct exposure . mark ii more accurate , manual exposure close metered exposure . sixth : ff/ 1.6 business . i really don't see any reason 30d better camera because 50mm lens gives image analagous 85mm lens full frame camera . advised , though , lens evaluations depend this distinction . edge performance flair may more obvious full frame instrument . both 1ds 1ds mark ii tend challenge lenses more because they work full range lens side side through apertures . my 35-135 canon lens gave great pictures 10d , but looks washed out both 1ds . before giving 1ds mark ii bum rap less than perfect pictures , ask what lens used . seventh : price . presently , non-grey-market 1ds mark ii sells around $6899 reputable dealers . used mark i around half . i would take half star away canon pounding my pocketbook taking , but i understand mark i just same price when it released . price gradient presently would tolerable those shooting low light , or raw studio work . personally , i would buy mark i over 5d improved construction . finally , some general remarks . i would liked compare this fine camera comparable nikon . unfortunately , i cannot , because all my glass canon , i no money left mul t-t housand buck purchase nikon . maybe someone else would write review . my only beefs canon sensor dust , seems appear spontaneous generation , steep learning curve i my first use . ( plan night or two reading manual ) i guess i forgive them not putting flash it . add couple hundred price purchase 580ex . canon service terrific . if you bucks , quit complaining price get one if you serious photographer . look images dpreview.com ( long , thoughtful review there ) , fredmiranda.com - they leave you breathless . this serious instrument serious photographers far it me give it less than 5 stars my petty complaints	1

camera works great us so far ... we 3 year old digital camera so this upgrade better technology ... takes much better pictures than our old one ... video great ( except very low light ) ... we've taken lot short video clips our kids grandma ( etc ) ... nobody our family wants watch more than 5 minutes any one home video anyway ... so this camera saves us buy camcorder ... ( although our 1gb card we could take 45 minutes or so continuous video medium setting ) ... touch screen great simple ... camera quick response time indoor action pictures again great pictures our kids running around or birthday parties ... i took 92 minutes video 55 pictures ( plus sharing images videos others ) before battery ran out first time ( couple weeks shooting our family ) . i guess everyone their own needs when picking digital camera , but this one works great ours	1

i tried this product out local camera store before i sold idea . two main things i concerned how it attach it add too much weight camera . attaching camera little concerning , i worried it may damage camera . but , after watching guy our local camera shop put one rebel i sold . basically you remove door battery compartment . which comes off lot easier than i anticipated . grip slides like battery you screw it bottom camera . don't worry their hole bottom grip tripod . grip add weight but its not significant i noticed it adds lot stability while holding it . since grip adds height camera its easier hold camera one hand . much like holding one more expensive models . it also adds battery life since grip holds two batteries . if you hold new grip take pictures camera its side . you pleasantly surprised see duplicate set buttons scroll wheel added new grip just purpose . it now permanent attachment i am glad i decided buy it . buttons work just well camera even 3fps . note quality canon grip much better than cheaper version .	1

" it very simple camera . it doesn't tryto pretend more than it . it very few features . but what it it well . you push big red button it records good quality video ( quality impressive price ) . i'm big fan simple products work well -- like nintendo or ipod . this camera looks bit like toy , but it durable . this would actually make good toy kid or adult . ergonomics nice . it comfortable hold . quality construction very good . i like fact it runs two ordinary aa batteries , soyou don't need charger . i would buy one these -- or maybe even few them . buy bunch them pass them out wedding . duct tape one your motorcycle helmet . tie one kite	1
filters tiffen good quality filters . this pack filters provides one great range filters allow you extend your camera capabilties	1
i this camera work , job i should take 100+ pics day document my work . yes , this camera easy use takes decent pics . bad side : it eats batteries like crazy . worst part this camera after every 4-5 pics taken succession , " processing " graphic comes up lcd screen , i need wait 30-45 seconds before i take pic . 15 co-workers who given this camera well me , they experience same issue . once processing , majority times , it goes back processing after each image taken . this really annoying . i tried using one my personal hi speed sd cards instead dollar store sd card work supplied , same result . it makes no difference whether batteries new or used . if you wish take two or three pics , then shut camera down ... this would great inexpensive camera . i sure am glad i am clock when using this camera . my personal camera needs , i'd never accept this camera ... there would too many missed shots . i'll stick my panasonic lumix personal use	-1
this isn't sony-brand battery , but it works fine . remaining time shows camcorder display , just like it sony brand . i'm pleased , price great	1

coolpix p4 received lukewarm reviews when it released spring 2006 list price $399 , but you forget all . canada this camera retails something less than $300 now , makes it tremendous value . this camera features very solid aluminum body , large 1/ 1.8 " 8.1 mp sensor , excellent nikkor optics optical vr . it even very good macro mode . most importantly , it takes great photos . vr very effective : i taken clean handheld photos slow 1/4 second . even though it point shoot auto mode fairly reliable , p4 clearly aimed advanced user , because you really need know what you're doing if you want take full advantage its capabilities . i found i got my best indoor photos when i set exposure mode aperture priority , disabled flash used " pre " function white balance . if nothing else p4 great inexpensive , go-anywhere 2nd camera dslr owner	1
camera works general good especially times when bringing larger camera not feasible . i put this camera my pocket use it anytime . i love movie mode i shoot movie until storage space run out , can't my nikon d50 slr ! 2gb memory card it equals 16 minutes . video comes complete sound after burning dvd highest quality it looks clear visible large 50 " tv . i still like my nikon d50 slr better taking regular photos though . one reason slr snap photos quick it possibly shutter or flash only thing slow it down . problem p4 when compared d50 d50 focus instantly where p4 delay so when you're ready take photo d50 takes it no delay . this really useful when subjects moving you need capture them frame before they move off . many point shoot cameras , i've used , there too long delay take photo i've ended up half person or blurred image then good shot gone . p4 slight delay because it needs time focus it worse when camera flash charging low light situations . two inch display great , great previewing images . pictures i've taken so far sharp , rich color detailed . vibration reduction good feature because i've noticed it hard not shake camera just little bit when pressing down shutter button . i suppose there may not point shoot camera without delay , but this one better than most . digital slr still best camera , i think , not only its fast shooting ability but also its exceptional picture quality . so if you need camera portability compactness then nikon coolpix p4 great camera if you don't need such small camera then go slr camera which means : single lens reflex , if you don't already know means it basically means when you look though eyepiece camera you actual looking though lens , you see exactly how photo fit look . camera such nikon slr d50 one such example . if you money buy both , point shoot slr because each camera offers advantages over other .	-1
i'm not pro any means , but this camera fantastic . zoom really impressive clarity great ( again ... i'm not pro , just someone who loves take pictures ) . folks who complained detachable lens cap ... it really not big deal . there small strap packaged camera , which very simple attach , connect lens cap camera . same strap also attaches wrist strap camera	1

i just got back my first trip using this camera , it performed excellently . two things i found very good : night shots high iso no flash outstanding . i took lot pics hong kong skyline , they just stunning . no blurry image crisp colors lines . there no need " no shake " , given these pics possible this high iso no tripod . battery endurance unbelievably long . i taking pics constantly all over hong kong two straight days , including lot night shots . battery lasted entire time . i bought second battery backup , but i rather doubt i am every going need it , this kind endurance . this best compact camera i ever owned	1

this well made battery pack adds some heft your cp8800 . wonderful camera , this battery pack adds your ability sty field longer . it takes least 300 pictures fully charged set nimh batteries . install , you take out li-lion battery twist off battery cover . don't lose this cover !! i put mine baggie stuffed it next my spare li-lion battery my camera bag . you then push pack into battery cavity screw bottom pin tripod place . it fits very neatly solidly . if you very close fitting camera bag , adding this unit may create problem , but otherwise it plus you . it fits nicely my hands if you find battery cavity cover , you now sources power . you choose which one you want back-up . now sold bh $149 , it much more reasonably priced	1
i bought this so we could get better look birds our backyard . we keep it kitchen window , find ourselves using it least once week peek feathered friend who visiting . nice clear lens , pretty easy find objects through them . certainly job we need it . don't buy this if you your birding out field - these not particularly portable nor leightweight not meant ; buy binocular specifically made purpose . only complaint , it minor , i find lens caps flimsy little hard use . we generally just keep them off	-1
case arrived promptly seems good quality . i received what i ordered . good product	1
this camera almost five star camera . disabling raw capability ( available previous model ) some clunky controls operation keep it four stars me . many you , raw makes no difference . great . but those folks who own digital slr cameras , want this camera powerful , easy-to-carry utility camera - lack raw support cripples this camera . next , other reviewers noted , side mounted mode-knob easily jostled result camera mode you not plan it when you shooting . it easy accidentally move this knob . lens cover using it power button poor design well . finally , since i seem listing problems first , like most point shoots noise level anything over 50 iso very high makes camera almost unusable settings where you would like set iso higher . basically , very low light settings compromised this inablity set iso 400 confident pictures low enough noise level usable . good . point shoot camera , this offers huge amount control over shot . you shoot aperture shutter priorities you - theory - almost anything you could dslr . your biggest limitations lens ( unchangable ) sensor ( small , high-noise high iso ) . 90% typical point shoot settings , this camera outperform your current camera . it takes beautiful pictures . wide angle lens gives you ability get more shot when you need so - making it great " vacation " camera . zoom decent , but not outstanding . colors outstanding , this typical canon strength . reading through other reviews here , i also note several people complained camera not fare well after dropped - particular emphasis large lcd cracking if you drop it . i'm not sure how respond ... i guess i would just say i would expected happen . i tend treat $500 ( when i bought it anyway ) cameras carefully . i purchased inexpensive camera case which i use always ( find easy use , since it attaches my belt ) i use camera strap when i use camera . i haven't dropped camera yet year i owned it . if i , i'd pleasantly surprised if it survived - not upset canon if it didn't . there many different types people many different expectations this world , product reviews great place see these many different attitudes ! overall , very good - almost great - point shoot camera	-1
i'm very happy this product , i bought this even though i skeptic its performance but very much satisfied money . i used it my canon sd 630 , i able take around 150 snaps around 20 mins video	-1
price , these binoculars provide unparallel carity easy focus . i like these binoculars so much i showed them couple co-workers right away . one them so impressed he ordered one his cousin birthday . great product , highly recommended	1

i bought this my teenage daughter she loved it . it easy use tiny , yet durable . some pictures i notice blueish outline around people ( their aura ??? ) which mentioned some other reviews i read , but i think this par-for-course many digital cameras tiny lens . since she primarily uses it take pictures reluctant parents , friends , family her dog , this camera just right	1
i not find anything negative say this camera . i wanted small pocket sized camera tried brands such casio exislim . even though this camera not small casio , it far superior camera . size why , it still small enough fit pocket but also big enough so it isn't awkward or difficult use . pictures this camera turn out spectacular , 10x zoom far best feauture this camera . lcd screen also very clear , unlike casio other camera similar this one . you can't go wrong this camera . highly recommended	1
i love it . easy use , easy work every area -- you love this little camera-it my second kodak so nice -- great buy	1
i purchased this camera month ago taken approximately 2,000 pictures date . i've taken indoor , outdoor , telephoto , macro , everything except video . sorry i should played too , but it not primary reason i bought this camera . i wanted camera expanded capability control my small point shoot camera , olympus c-50 ( which i am quite pleased ) . i am very happy results s9100 . this substantial camera . it feels more like my nikon 8008 , so don't plan put it your pocket when you take it trip . i three olympus digital cameras looking purchase olympus but i disappointed their offering ultra zoom class . because i already several xd cards it plus this camera gave me choice two different media types . i also liked manual zoom because this camera felt familiar , like slr . using aa batteries plus i looking . i see some folks say they disappointed battery life , but i haven't found problem . i use 2900mah nimh rechargeable battery i yet run out juice photo shoots over 200 pictures . i not used alkaline batteries , but i understand they not last nearly long . i use evf more than large digital display ( probably old habits 35mm cameras ) may something it too . i think manual zoom save lot battery power when compared some competition . there lot discussion image stabilization , i never it my other cameras , so i don't seem miss it . i haven't many blurred photos but i use mono-pod or tri-pod when it appropriate . but even hand held , this camera produces excellent images even up 1600 iso . there some noise , but i don't think it too bad . printed photos come out excellent . i several printers large format hp plotter produce 36 " 36 " prints i am very pleased results . this camera excellent versatility , zoom great macro mode gives you wonderful capability really get close . i shooting primarily . jpg but experimented . raw . what i read this format it extend my ability , but i need more time learn raw processing before i provide intelligent discussion . i like idea raw there if when i decide use it . conclusion , i am happy my purchase would buy this camera again . if you looking alternative dslr provides lot versatility control this one merits close look	1
bought this use panasonic gs 500 . it great job keeping everything tight together , no bouncing around or loose pieces . i especially like lower compartment velcro . it very handy cables , tapes , manuals , microphones , etc . whole package very sturdy comfort carry . highly recommended	1

this my third digital camera after ricoh very early model less than 1 mega pixels nikon d1 slr . i bought this one mainly because it almost impossible use d1 every occasion we like take pictures our little boy who only 2 . d1 zoom lens way too bulky , heavy sometimes hard use my wife . she loves this coolpix camera . 5.1 mega pixels , picture quality very good family photo albums . battery lasts surprisingly long than i expected i use monitor all time . i always try avoid using monitor my d1 order save battery . we carry it alot more than we would d1 now since it so small light . i never any problems camera . it works nikon view software i d1 some updates , course . only " complaint " i there delay bwteen you push button it actually actuates shutter . i am used my slr cameras ( i also nikon film slr camera ) picture taken same micro-second i press shutter release button . also af much slower than slr which expected . overall , it very well made produce good quality pictures family daily use	1

my opinion second battery essential equipment camera . camera comes external charger	1
i owned numerous digital cameras , but never found " perfect " one , until now . you simply not believe incredible photos this camera produce . it not small , but it fits great hand . i simply not able take bad picture it yet . photos aren't just little better than other cameras , they're absolutely superb . you not regret buying this camera	1
job just advertised . plus extra sure day saver	1
this original charger came my 10d . it also works d30 d60 , it not work 300 or 350 . it fast charger works well generic batteries . one advantage this charger number multinational power cords it comes , 5 different types supplied	1
you should think this pair good binoculars added bonus taking digital pictures 30 seconds video - rather than camera good zoom ( 8x ) . reason it not zoom , it fixed 8x optical magnification . setting up using binoculars very easy , much easier than normal digital camera . it took me less than 5 minutes get good handle how use it ... rather than hour or two most other digital camera . taking photos film snap . photos look really sharp . i wish it little smaller sleeker , but other than , i no complaints . it great product works perfect watching sports , outdoors , or even concert/opera . highly recommend .	1
i love this camera so very much . price excellent . this everthing i every wanted digital camera . i two digital cameras pass both plastic both doors where battery memory card goes broke , which made camera unoperable . i would recommend this camera everyone .	1
i echo previous comment . we bought this unit so we would able see our daughter her crib while she slept . reality all we able see " snow " camera we keep volume all way down so we wouldn't hear static unit . only time we able get clear picture when camera receiver same room together . i wrote their tech support all they could tell me there interference something else our house . we since spent little extra money purchased avtech solutions monitor much better results . screen bigger images much clearer . it well worth extra money	-1
this review i could not wait write . you simply can't go wrong if you're considering buying this incredibly intelligent powerful camera-the canon powershot s70 7.1 mp digital camera 3.6 optical zoom . so many brands market so many choices , where one begin find right camera their personal professional needs ? where photographer or average enthusiast start isolate camera they want buy themselves or gift ? i really hope this personal honest review help you narrow your search help you develop more faith what you're buying . i'm assuming you probably good deal experience photography or you're person appreciates great photography . so if you're looking outstanding digital camera professional level , you've found it this monumental digital camera canon . this very dependable camera , probably top all reviews i looked while doing my homework . if you're photographer , you know how great it feels put great machine your hands . canon powershot s70 sturdy comfortable they make them ! this camera always take color-rich vivid photos you-even if you make slight mistake or move your hands just tiny bit when photographing . it actually great deal technology built-in designed compensate anyone who might poor lighting situation or someone who forgets focus well before shooting picture . i typically use function allows camera call all shots . first i wasn't comfortable doing . after i took my first 2 rolls camera store developing , i soon discovered i nothing worry i dealing superb camera . canon powershot digital cameras pretty hard compare others this arena . i've powershots long time i've taken over five thousand photos them-they stand up against my accidental drops or drops rain when i've exposed camera water . aside requiring powerful batteries use good amount power , there no downside this incredible digital camera great digital camera maker . i've able these photographs enlarged poster size found them vivid ( even close up ) i could ever imagined . 7.1 megapixels , sizes like 8x10 not even concern when enlarging . canon camera business decades before digital cameras even market they've really pushed digital envelope this camera . if you're looking gift someone who avid photographer like digital photography , you've found it powershot s70 . you stop looking place your order now . your recipient extrememly satisfied ease use high quality this great camera . if you avid photographer , like myself , wish camera digital shots-this baby you'll want buy ! if you're looking take photographs you likely enlarge 5x7 , 8x10 or larger , this camera enough power technology job without looking like digital photograph . often my framed digital prints look better than my photographs taken film-something i never thought would happen ! there great deal information you read this camera canon website other review sites online . you compare camera others same category . you might find some slightly better deals other brands might offer even larger amounts megapixels . really not what you should looking . often number megapixels only possible use special software inerpolate photographs . you don't want worry all . you set canon truly delivers 7.1 vivid megapixels ! canon puts together entire kit or package when you buy digital powershot . i wanted also let you know software that included camera package fantastic literally worth price camera itself . however , you're getting super package this deal camera depend long you want own camera . i've exposed it mine rain 10 different times , i've not ever any even small incidental problem . reminds me energizer bunny-it just keeps going going going never stops ! you not disappointed your purchase warranty canon . i hope this honest review some help you it pleasure write it you .	1

battery grips become widely used accessory those who use their slr regularly . they typically add grip make vertical shooting easier expanded battery department allow longer sessions without battery changes . this grip particular takes inexpensive widely available aa batteries ( 4 ) , which save money quickly over $12 or so pair batteries these cameras take their own . rechargable batteries work fine grip . also included additional shutter release go new vertical grip . i'd love seen tripod socket line lens perhaps sensor canon remote shutter release , which isn't built into many bodies ( if it shutter release button , all would needed cheap ir sensor ) . all all , it inexpensive way add value your camera , save money batteries , simply look cooler	-1

upgrading tz3 4yr old canon 3.2 megapixel . waited few months purchase when i heard tz1 updated . tz3 , panasonic fixed main complaints tz1 which : no build lens cover , noisy images higher iso speeds . imo , build lens cover alone wirth price permium over tz1 . others said , this camera great build quality , easy operation , high-quality look . i ordered black model pleasantly surprised when i opened box . it look retro 35mm cartridge camera , which cool . chrome ( or polished stainless steel , cant tell ) , first rate looks great matte black case . lcd huge bright . camera " simple mode " great job other modes fully customizable . zoom fantastic , but you need really steady hand full zoom , even optical stabilization turned . i take some surprisingly sharp shots zoomed way my car i came across herd deer . shot shot speed really great , unless you using flash . red-eye reduction works better than any other digital camera i used . overall , i am extremely pleased . if you looking great zoom camera small form factor , you should seriously consider dmc-tz3	1
i own nikon coolpix 3100 camera no complaints it , except fact its size ( even though it fairly small ) pain carry around when you want take pictures . looking much thinner camera , i came across this one quite pleasantly surprised its size , its ability take really great shots ! i'm merely birthday - holiday type picture taker , but this camera definitely enable me take more pictures , because i'll carrying it around my pockety whennever i go somewhere might provide photo opportunity .	1
lot size price comparison this one one best size picture came it . minor annoyances = ( 1 ) always keep frame plugged into outlet , ( 2 ) resizing your pictures realy takes away quality size output frame so keeping your pictures bigger better but you get fewer numbers pictures save , ( 3 ) using menu menu buttons takes little getting used . other than , i no complaints frame . i really wanted one music go it , or alarm clock played favorite song or something affect .... but price quality images this one hard beat .	-1

i just used this camera dive mexico ( my second dive , first attempt underwater photo ) . although camera no flash , it worked perfectly fine depths up 12 meters . i guess lack flash problem some other locations or if outside not sunny day , but least cancun this camera job perfectly . wheel turns film specific noise when film correctly positioned ready new shot ; this noise different when there no more positions camera , wheel turns continuously - so if you pay attention you'll know when film over , even if position indicator may still show 1 or 2 . yes , pictures grainy ( i think it uses iso800 film so this expected ) , but they look " clean " when scaled down computer 800x600 , i think prints look acceptable , too . pictures also show vignetting , but this nothing unexpected such fixed focus disposable camera lens . out 27 positions , i got 20 pictures i consider good enough " keepers " . picture turned out crisp - only 2 them motion blured . try stay still when taking pictures you'll fine . best colors , take pictures close divers/fishes ( less than 1-2 meters away ) ... we also used non-disposable 35mm plastic camera case underwater casing , but kodak yielded better quality pictures . viewfinder , it bit harder look through it googles , but i got better framed pictures than non-disposable camera " target " sistem . if you want spend only 10-20$ don't plan investing more underwater casing digital cameras , this camera good choice . i don't regret buying it .	-1
my first professional digital slr nikon d1x . i got great pictures it but it too large heavy lug around extended periods . i also some issues its operation . but now , nikon seems solved my issues d200 . i purchased dedicated sb-800 flash 18-200 lens recommended d200 manual . whole system much improved over my other digital slr . both focus metering seem work more reliably . it works better available light . optical anti-vibration aids overall picture sharpness ( plus those us who not rock-steady ) . i am getting use button sequence required enlarge picture preview really like amount magnification possible . menuing system seems quite extensive well-organized . i would like more latitude picture quality settings ( e.g. contract , saturation , sharpness ) . help screens really tell me something when i'm confused . i appreciate " modeling " feature . it useful when attempting compose dark situation . it also lets me see reflections before they committed picture . unfortunately this feature not work using built-in flash . i wish nikon could add some type lock continuous-single-manual focus selector front camera . my finger seems move switch unknowingly . i would appreciate battery charger built plug rather than detachable cord . person who still wears thick glasses , i wish nikon could make viewfinder more like one their old n8008 . or maybe it time away pentaprisoms mechanical mirrors give us truly pro camera mimics high-end pro-sumer models electronic viewfinders adjustable view screens	-1

i liked camera lot , but it few irritating details compared gs150 . if i knew these before purchase , i probably would purchase gs150 itself . camera itself fine , but description doesn't indicate you cannot transfer video over usb cable . you separately purchase firewire cable . gs150 allows you transfer video over usb . gs150 comes software video editing , it built-in lens cap .	-1
this really great camera ( it purpose ! ) this isn't camera get if you want super-fine shots or some kind amateur photographer . if you want camera preserve memories , snap shots during travel , parties , etc , this one get . here few my favorite things camera : solid construction . thing just reeks quality . very fast startup time - not only it easy fit pocket so you grab it while other idiots unzipping their camera bags , but it starts up so fast you're taking picture before you know it . portability - i've taken this everywhere . i've gotten great pictures i'd never gotten otherwise because this camera small , unobtrusive , always available , etc . i'm very happy this purchase my next digital camera ( sooner or later people laugh 5 megapixels ) definitely card/small sized casio	1
i bit tenative writing this revierw lest world know our secret - then they'd all one too . we looking something put under our pd170 stubled upon this beauty . construction quality solid unit tripod stable . fluid head panning just good i could expect . smooth steady . tripod shoe nice cork pad protect bottom your camera . tripod would good buy just its basic features , but what sets it apart lanc remote control built into handle . its great . lanc ( or control-l ) compatable cameras made sony ( this sony product ) cannon some others . handle you on/standy switch , record button , photo button , zoom rocker . stuff we've so far its supeer . i keep my hands handle get shots i want . remote control makes makes using camcorder tripod slick experience . only thing would make this better deal if they added focus control remote . far usage - only other issue it took while get feel how much tighten tilt knob lock it down - i didn't want over-torque it break something didn't want camera slowly moving either - but once you get feel its fine . this tripod good buy . but don't feel like you run out get one . we like only cool geeky ones	1

extremely impressed tz3 . this gem should get 5 stars construction finish alone . just holding it your hands it screams quality feels like tank . love it . it seriously feels like $700 camera . no exaggeration . i little worried it not able fit my jean pockets before buying it . women may issues really tight jeans but us guys no problem . it fits fine . i seriously cant believe i carry around camera 10x zoom inside my jean pockets . truly remarkable . 3 " screen amazing . you practically enjoy your pics right screen w/o even printing them high res output . navigation so easy this camera . something not surprising though if your already coming panny ( fz7 here ) . picture quality great . i tested it out today standard i would say its just good my fz7 daylight better lowlight ( indoors ) . image quality great , if you need extra sharpness you could always use camera " vivid mode " or add little some post processing . pics standard natural mode pp very well . wide angle something new me . took some neat shots looked very nice extra viewing angle . very distinctive after this i'm not sure if i could go back . if your looking it all camera this may very well your tool choice . combine it extreme versatility coupled excellent image quality , superb lens , build , finish you yourself winner .	1
luck would it i only got use set once . but wow great eye peices . if you're just getting star gazing great way star	1
i recently bought this case my canon sd-300 . i little nervous when i saw max depth 10ft but it only case this camera so i thought i would give it shot . i took it caribbean cruise me let me just say wow . within 5 minutes i applied thin layer grease waterproof ring , slipped camera , closed it up jumped water . underwater pictures came out amazing . i even went scuba diving down 65ft no problem , besides little nervous . underwater movies also came out amazing . sometimes so clear it hard tell i water . day we hiked up waterfall , everyone jealous see me taking pictures under mist . i around 100 incredible pictures this trip i never could gotten without this case	1
my product arrived time i expected product untouched . i would recommend this service	1
i work film production , ( both photography video ) . i bought this my digital camera my camcorder . it not high tech any means , but it very useful . i don't like plastic parts , but price it sturdy enough . it worth money no doubt !!	1
this flashlight what it supposed , it good range brightness . i especially like thumb power switch/rheostat -- it easy comfortable operate . my only complaint circle illumination relatively small . i would prefer wider cone light illuminate wider area	-1
although main part case which my camera resides useful , i dismayed when i received it strap one clip broken first time i opened closed additional pocket , zipper broke . only reason i not returned it new one cost shipping would make it too expensive	-1
i got this light go my full rig i use wedding videography . some lights out these soooo expensive but i saw lot good reviews this light thought i would give it go . here goods bads . goods - works batteries go my pd150 camera so no need silly looking belt battery pack or extra batteries . it comes 10w or 20w setting . so far it also proven itself durable . not i am clumsy but i dropped it twice it survived . i understand bulbs expensive but i used it 2 years now out need change . it lightweight fits slide foot top my camera . most pro non pro cameras this too so i use this my tiny consumer camera its great there too . bads - i guess this stuff isnt really bad but folks who might pro rig these things might bum you out . no dimmer , no barn doors , so swivel . one thing i say though this thing so light i few times taken it off camera held it my hand up high angle so not shine it anyones face directly . i hope this helps	-1
this very durable , attractive case camera fits perfectly . only thing i would change belt loop stitched rather than snap case catches bus or airline seat arm rest pulls loose	-1
only knock it it needs more dampening , but covered ad nauseum other reviews magazine articles . i took photos moon this lens just stunning	-1
mac user who favors still photography , i like take bits video here there , this fits bill perfectly . only taken video indoors so far i've found video quality perfectly adequate ( no faces hidden shadows ) . sound fine , too . software included functions fine my mac ( although i think you camera plugged see video you've stored your computer ) . also imported avi files into imovie easily	1
this camera very easy use , pictures excellent . my family loves it !	1
i am definitely amateur photographer - so what it worth , i am very pleased this camera . previously owned ex-z1000 , i say this camera big step up . i buy all extra cords transferring pictures my z1000 , but this one came everything i needed . also - battery life great . plus - shutter response time much quicker than z1000 . you choose 7 different picture sizes/pixelation . up 10 megapixels ! video camera pretty sweet , too -- you zoom out during filming . one neat features audio recording - like little pocket tape-recorder . only thing , my computer doesn't automatically detect audio files when transferring -- i go manually select them . ( this might just something my computer setup , though ) . all-around , i'm very pleased this camera !	1
real bright flash , work great my camera . lights up long way , away , getting more into my pictures . camera flash isn't enough flash , 383 flash makes up what camera can't reach	1
i'm not 13 i'm 15 but i not account comment . i bought this camera through amazon my graduation present . i it already few months its good camera . its easy use , lots different settings , large nice screen , even makes long movies . its not small other more expensive cameras , but its not huge bulky . there few negetive things it : it uses batteries , charging it mean you buy new ones . i solved this problem buying rechargeble batteries , they last longer you reuse them . battery life this camera not great too . well might fault my duracel batteries . if this camera would better battery life then it would five stars . overall this great camera , great price . good teens beginners cameras plus budget friendly . i got it under $120	-1
case well designed protect camera mounted one belt or worn over shoulder ( strap camera protrudes case make shoulder use possible ) . case small holder extra battery extra sd memory card . i think i find case useful , though i bought inexpensive soft case ( $10 ) may handier than hard case . since canon g4 high-end digital camera , it may best hard case protect camera certain situations , even though soft case might handier other situations	-1
i compared this camera against gs85 gs320 , i found ois exactly same all three models , body , gs320 500 bucks give you leica lens , it true . but comparing picture these three proved me gs80 gives better blacks more colorful image , 279 , its great deal . its important note all three these cameras come firewire standard , something thats lacking camcorders almost any price range other manufacturers . firewire essential video editing , make sure whichever camcorder firewire not usb	1
i recently purchased this product my son ( marine biology student ) we used it while snorkeling caribbean recent cruise . product perfomed well very easy use . this product allowed all features canon camera used its fullest outcome some outstanding underwater shots blue tangs , parrot fish rather menacing looking barracuda taken temporary residence under dive boat st. thomas . looks like expensive piece plastic box - performs like swiss watch	1
my husband purchased this camera me my birthday last year . his aunt uncle one we thought it simply amazing . since our purchase , we've help several our friends family members buy same camera through amazon . actually , we've bought 4 other ones besides one my husband bought me my birthday . i highly recommend this camera everyone . it small , many neat features , quality pictures best i've ever seen any digital camera . don't just take my word it , buy one see yourself . it very affordable . ( best feature	1
yes , it costs bit more than disposable camera . but like other reviews siad , if you spent $400 + camera , why not underwater case . i amazed how well it built . i felt totally safe putting my camera inside it . it takes great pictures . if you ocean , waves current make it difficult take pictures , but practice makes perfect . one tip , when ocean try get close subject possible so flash help brighten colors . i came home few shots everything blue green . we live near water used this case once or twice week since we got it . it really amazing	1
i love camera , but you may want know nikon dicontinued this item . it really hard find replacement parts .	-1
so far , this best camera i've ever owned . i chose it over kodak z710 because not only it more powerful zoom , 12x opposed 10x but view screen much bigger . 2.5 inch compared 2 inch . it doesn't seem like much but that big difference view screens . also , this one came rechargeable battery charger . z710 didn't . it extremely easy focus taking pictures it breeze . battery holds up long periods time . my old camera batteries didn't hold up near long it only 3.2 megapixel camera . this camera definitely offers lot bang your buck . i would buy again heartbeat	1
camera fits perfectly . case very stylish . best all , its pink	1
i bought this camera my teenage daugther . she love it deaf . this besy buy year , she can't put it down . it space saver .	-1
i got this camera use digital photo class . it wonderful . there wasn't anything confused me when i first got it , it took great pictures . software little tricky because it moved all my photos different place gave me very little access , but easily taken care uninstalling software using usb cable itself . 10x zoom great , but if you move all your picture quite blurry . i would get tripod use when you it zoomed really far . overall it great camera takes great pictures good video	1
some years ago i bought canon rebel , one earlier ones , it not so great , kept if while then sold it . i into digital some time now , but , its great , but it not film , not any chance . i very old point shoot , i started taking pictures either kodak fuji film , i then brought it into my one hour developer negs developed digitized onto cd . results gorgeous , point it time new slr , there not so many left right now . i saw eos rebel t2 28-90 mark iii zoom lens , it impressive , light , but just touch heft , great grip , viewfinder , very fast autofocus , it even looks great . so forgetting my previous experience rebel long time ago i bough t.t his superb camera , this just no way praise it , i love this camera . since getting it i , ve shot 10 rolls film , all digitized onto disc , touched up where i felt they needed it , ( simple procedure . i shot roll hanger former naval aviation base here , all kinds aircraft different stages reconstruction , it photographers paradise . results i am getting better than very expensive digital camera . i cannot recommend t2 even more , if you want one get it now , i think these cameras gone soon . canon you great job .	1
easy set up easy use . we recently upgraded different kodak camera enjoying easyshare dock . our previous dock different kodak camera going strong after 4 years . highly recommended	1
this good camera money . don't expecting amazing 5mp pictures or anything . if you dark area , it hard see screen what you shooting . course , when you actually take picture , flash brightens area . if you not still , pictures bit fuzzy ... but 20$ tripod take care problem . small , fit purse or pocket . great kids , comes carrying strap so they don't drop it . all all , i would recomend it someone who starting out wants very basic camera , or child . if you looking high quality photos this not camera you . i bought it my 14 year old sister who uses it take pictures football game , put them her website ( which not require high quality photos ) . her photos look pretty decent when printed 3x5 size .	-1
i looked three different digital cameras thoroughly , this one i eventually chose . i'm glad i . it takes very good pictures , settings lot fun mess . pros : color choice : those you without money buy adobe photoshop , this lets you pick color picture only shows color . it really amazing , lot fun use effects . manual : it got manual settings ( some others ) those us who know how use them want little more out digital camera without buying slr . sturdy : my opinion , it good camera ; won't break easily . my dad dropped my first one onto concrete only thing broke flash ( yeah , that pretty important , but if you keep camera case , unlike i , you'll fine ) . i'm also not afraid move flip screen lot ; it doesn't feel like it fall off . 7.1 mp : this awesome . i zoom ton my computer , even if i can't my camera . i get ton detail pick out what i want , even if it really far away . i took some pictures tigers zoo i could zoom so much i could see their fur . it awesome . automatic settings : if , like me first , you dont ' know how use all those crazy manual settings , there ton other settings pick you use pretty much anything . it makes it really easy quick shots , no matter conditions . cons : no movement : if i try take picture something moving fast , most time it blurry auto settings . i go manual settings , if lighting crappy , don't even try it . shorter you make shutter speed , less light gets . focus : because it digital , you can't focus your own , camera just picks something it thinks most important . there tricks get it focus what you want , but it little hard . weight : it little heavy , but it worth it . it takes four aa batteries , but if you get rechargables , you're fine . i haven't owned any other cameras , least , this my first digital , besides family one , so i'm not knowledgable some others , but i've it quite long time , so i've gotten used it . it good camera , definitely worth money	1
i bought this camera gift my 15 year old daugheter . she loves it many reasons . it so slim , she put it her back pocket take it anywhere . it easy use she gotten lot great shots it . she doesn't print out many her photos , but emails them back forth her friends . her best friend canon elph pictures don't look any better than shots my daughter takes her new casio . only problem we ever it one time lens wouldn't close when she turned it off . we take batteries out them put them back . then it worked fine . this only happened one time she camera two months now uses it pretty often . i think this great little camera . it takes nice picture wasn't too expensive	-1
i chose this casio because price , good sho t-t o-shot speed , most important me charging cradle battery life . i got so tired running out battery middle day . all cameras should charging cradle , just like your cordless telephones	1
i bought this case together nikin 5900 digcam . case looks good compact . but main problem pockets . there two pockets sd cards main pocket one outer pocket battery . problem when you open case take camera , all pockets also open stuff fall there . specially when its your belt . i won't use this case	-1
hiii it good case sony very good but i briefer you bay case holds your camera extra battery you need it	-1
this semi-hard case very cumbersome terms handling , first i couldn't really put camera . so , it quite unusable , otherwise protection level good . i wouldn't recommend it . only if you masochist :-)	-1
i bought this camera more than half year ago . my intention get decent camera images , but then also able use it filming short movies . i'm very pleased its performance . good lighting conditions , colors come out amazing . i really really not expect them so vivid sparkling ! darker conditions , well , it still works fine , not nearly bad i expected some other reviews . photos might grainy or not vivid anymore , but stuff still perfectly suitable show photos people . filming , it terrific . i mean , resolution great ( sth like 848 640 or so ) , better than what one could possibly expect regular camera . quality super awesome , looks very neat computer screen . respect . it pointed out you cannot zoom while filming , but not many cameras out there . oh , it also very small gigantic screen great battery life . great buy	1
camera way better than sony hc1 . night shooting great colors appear natural there not much noise or smudging colors . would recommend it heartbeat . my 37 inch 1980x1080 lcd becomes window when i hook up this camera it . great buy	1
