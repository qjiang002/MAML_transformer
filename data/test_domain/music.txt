afi used pretty good band . then , they decided go emo-girlie-boy . lead singer made adramatic change smelly-goth-dude perfect-manicured-emo-girl/guy . what happened smeely-goth-dude ? some us actually like music , not " emoness " . not only , but " miss murder " waaaaay overplayed , now it encrested into my brain . i mean , come , it not even good song . afi looking appeal mainstream . there nothing wrong , if you keep your old sound , which this band failed . this , my friends , afi worst album , if not hte worst album 2006 . check out older afi stuff . " sing sorrow " okay , but if you want truley good music , you go back into their ninties albums	-1
i am 23 yr old mother 2 1/2 yr old . not only these children horrible singers , but there reason most parents don't let their children listen original songs ... they teach them things they don't need know . i thought this would " kids " version would get rid stuff when i let child i babysitting put cd ... appalled how much they talked sex other innappropriate things children . they didn't take out ! children exposed every day our world now , telling them it " normal " " ok " . parents big enough job teach their children right wrong way world today . it becomes much harder job when you give them something " kids " teaches them those things " normal " . they assume if it ok kids cd , it can't bad . i think this horrible would never spend penny it child ! some songs i like originial version listen , this cd ruined them ! but when it comes children who too young understand it just song doesn't mean what they say ok ... i think it worst thing you could buy your child	-1
i anxious hear astounding modern yet retro dance disc one my favorite girl groups 80s . unfortunately , instead picking up latest influence 80s music dance music , what we get here predominantly disco flavored tracks sound painfully dated , some latin tones now then . only semi retro/electro tracks here ( my favorites ) feel you , love bite , your love like drug , marc almond remix venus . two lead singles " move my direction " " look floor " not even strongest tracks ! remixes their singles don't make them much better . i appreciate commercial direction girls taken , but you still sound mainstream while more sophisticated than this . take listen new madonna or even kelly osbourne (!) hear some infectious melodies 80s flair don't melt down into total cheese . unfortunately , i just don't see us radio embracing any sounds this disc . but course , fans bananarama should still add this one their collection . it listenable , if not up today standards	-1
listening this cd took me back my growing-up years . i remembered all their songs i loved back then . it great homecoming	-1
although real roots lie black artists who inspired these guys , pbbb where hippy generation , ( this couple years pre-san francisco , before stones beatles began stretching their arrangements out record ) , learned just play . their next record more representative what they actually doing live time time , single greatest influence what became san francisco sound late 60 early 70 , ( really long experimental jamming ) , so this fact quot ; roots roots rootsquot ; todays jam bands guitar-heavy blues bands , mixed-race bands , , all practical purposes , white-blues-man todays ' world	1
when young artist names her first two albums not quot ; judyquot ; or quot ; collinsquot ; but quot ; maid constant sorrowquot ; quot ; golden apples sunquot ; , you know she takes herself seriously . originaly released 1961 . 1962 . their names all i knew until i saw this cd recently . quot ; who buy this ? quot ; i wondered just see only copy snatched right front me . comparisons first two baez albums inevitable ( some songs recorded both ) althought collins shows much more passion involment where baez seemingly seduces herself beauty her voice . these early albums collins frighteningly devoted keeper flame her repertoire almost exclusively traditional - which means not only ethereal beauty but also certain ( some ears , overpowering ) seriousness , cleverly mellowed inclusion joyous quot ;o daddy gayquot ; , cousin her quot ; grandfatherquot ; recorded years later . althought i honestly love these songs listen only this cd days , these early albums today much more significant seeds collins later trademarks ( voice soar much higher future , she slipped . . yeats into traditional folk collection just later blossom into first-rate art-pop singer ) they product their greenwich village times , they may sound bit dated some modern ears . but they still hauntingly beautiful me , i waited their re-release too long	1
those who watched movie jaws ( ask yourself , who hasn't ) know one many key elements made movie huge success fantastic score john williams it . this cd captures all music movie perfectly , some new elements thrown not found film . linear notes bright colourful provide some interesting information , which gives overall package nice touch . overall cd package certainly not rushed effort worth every cent . highly recommended purchase those who love their soundtracks or anyone who wants relive film through music	1
johnny truly rising star . i saw him live " accident " very happy i introduced his music . he still relatively unknown , unfortunately . he seems quite popular boston , where he originally , but even here nj , i haven't heard his music played radio yet . he deserves more than this . there way too much crappy music around that polluting our radios which almost makes it crime not give this guy sort fame he deserves his work . fact you over 40 reviews his cd most them give 5 stars certainly says something how solid , original , creative , high-quality his music . truly work art . he stands right up there many guitar greats like srv , bb king , albert king , eric clapton , others . however , contrast these guys , johnny cds all instrumentals , fact he able capture sort attention admiration he guitar instumental work both noteworthy testament his talent creativity both songwriter guitar player . his style extremely diverse , i amazed how many different tones sounds he able extract one custom-made johnny signature gibson guitar . i mean , wow . after listening this cd his other new cd , try see him live , you not sorry . johnny simply gem , i really hope his career flourishes sort fame wide recognition he deserves	1
i expecting ( er , hoping ) something closer " hounds love , " but this spacey unspooled . i appreciate change i appreciate disjointed ethereal songwriting , but this bit much me . some songs seem just spin off into nothingness , others drag . few songs much triter lyrics than i expected her , most her voice seems rambling while disregarding music behind it . i liked one or two tracks , but overall i cannot get into this	-1

well , yes , i one those kids who took tap dancing ballroom dancing lessons mostly due fred ginger movies keeping my twin brother i out mischief . but now this extraordinary double cd set ! first , there lot charming music this collection which excellent sound quality . songs include not just singing parts but also dancing parts . so , you visualize duo dancing while your eyes closed just listening . plenty excellent music included . all big hits . there also nice booklet included plenty info songs , movies fred ginger . there also plentiful " behind scenes " pictures . so ok , song " piccolino " not included this set . it just rhino records could not buy rights song " fair " price ( rhino opinion ) . but , since overall double cd set just so wonderfully put together , you don't even really notice it , folks . this real treasure song , dance memories taking you back time when only things seemed " dirty " your knees you trying dance like fred astaire . overall rating :	1
truly one great live albums all time . advice other reviewers dead : buy either two cd complete budokan or this budokan ii ( if you find it ) you not sorry . this masterpiece belongs right up there who live leeds rolling stones ' get yer ya ya out .	1
loved cd . hard believe etta james teenager when she recorded these songs . her voice flawless . i am new fan	1
feinstein love gershwins passion never made clearer than pure gershwin . michael love affair ira lyrics , his reckless abandon light-hearted spirit familiar -- lesser known -- phrases , more than makes up less polished vocal production this early album . fact , it very element sells these songs i've never heard them elsewhere . michael pulls out all stops , embracing less-than-lily-white additional verses quot ; embraceable youquot ; , unbridled passion first time lover . his duet rosie clooney arrouses my curiosity movie which this unknown number made its debut . what delightful approach michael demonstrates throughout .... oh , young exuberant life , love music again	1
its best good stuff , it even kenshin song i like so much	1
dirty mind , without doubt , best album little guy ever put out . 40 minute tour de force , uneducated elitist it sounds like mess shallow lyrics casio keyboard demos . however , open your heart album you'll soon grow love it wonder why prince doesn't sing falsetto more . it interesting once most accessible danceable albums i've ever heard fact ode perversion just general sketchiness . song topics relations his sister coercing virgin her wedding day fellatio , prince full horn dog mode here , folks . however , album seems harness power raging sexuality put it beat , creating music would guilty pleasure if it weren't so darn good . instantly shifting into gear , album starts title track , robotic funk workout might greatest song prince ever recorded , if you ask me . slowly building upon itself , song develops into layers layers pounding synthesizer beats , prince crooning every note his highest voice possible . two other highlights album ' head ' ' when you mine ' , former infectious disco funk beat , latter new wave/bubblegum rocker . prince production values grew his fanbase , he probably never record anything else like dirty mind . almost brilliant it minimalist nature , album stripped down nature no popoular musician would guts make today . short , yet sweet collection 8 songs , it essential any fan prince , nay , fan contemporary music general it their collection	1
original version this album great . remastered additional tracks , this moves into super-greatness . opening track , very end it doesn't disappoint . buy this now .	1
this cd okay first few times you listen it , but it grate you 5th time . some songs sound hillibilly twangy , sing topics not special interest kids , don't rhyme or catchy , don't teach anything	-1
i suprised when i copped this record . last two de la albums all right but this one kills em . de la back	1
edition i simply titled " live budokan " , which german/uk budget import superior/digimode . course , this stands out because greg lake brief stint here , you two-thirds elp ( yet around same time emerson lake album late cozy powell instead carl palmer , then 3 emerson palmer but not lake ) . i liked lake king crimson their first album , but i couldn't take elp . it almost unusual hear him these songs . it would've made little sense throw " lucky man " maybe even " pictures exhibition " good measure , if you're elp fan , but what would yes half think ?. i too young remember concert , yet it watershed event . asia almost many lineup changes crimson , yes , destiny child ! this rare gem , even if you only like one previous band or other	1
jane horrocks unbelievable acting vocal talent . if you've seen little voice , you know she also exceptional mimick . this c.d. furthur exhibits her mimicking talents . she sings carol channing , ethel merman , even frank sinatra ( his classic it very good year ) , every song leaves you astonished leaning over press play button again your c.d. player	1
slow train album may hard some dylan fans get into , because its christian nature . i'm not born again christian , not even very good church goer , so longest time i didn't pay this record any attention . i got giant hybrid box set . however , there couple songs , " i believe you " " precious angel " where it possible me believe dylan singing or girl than deity . however , now , i must confess , i play whole cd , start finish , music just so good , dylan voice too . it convert me ? probably not , but it still awfully good music	1
stooges may most amateur band grace rock-and-roll . unit dances line immaturity passionate recklessness , no one cannot like their maudlin , silly feel . rumor it , when they started club scene , they could barely play their respective instruments , this " let just get it " sensibility most apparent music gray area these clumsy , yet brilliantly un-hinged sound , driven fuzzy guitar aggression , lyrics shouted iggy stooge ( who would later become punk icon , iggy pop ) attitude sing/speak glee . appropriate year 1969 , " stooges " released this debut self-titled album , getting audiences gasp their sex-and-drugs themed messages their brand early punk rock music . their manner arresting bleak angst-ridden outlook this vietnam war age , tone similar " doors , " " stooges " opened floodgates announce national college student confusion aggression those power . this proto-punk album ( proto punk = punk rock before there such term ) stepping-stone appointing them sort demi-gods all those interested hard rock , thus proves rock-and-roll not anything more than fun time , truly rock ... hard . stooges played hard , fast , loud , snooty , certainly abrasive their attack audience ; there certain honesty sound , immense bravery makes them stand out era , which many other bands would also influence punk rock , bigger foot rhythm blues genre . iggy simplistic , non-literate , yet effective lyrics glint rambunctious quality , definitive rebellion against " proper society . " what makes their music so fascinating this band obviously plays their heart out , their sex-and-drugs lyrics say what they mean say , unlike beatles velvet underground , their themes apparent , not submerged metaphors , they actually balls come out say , " i wanna you dog ! " since , such songs this , music lyrics so aggressive , this case sexually aggressive , it reminds listener time when your teenage years supposed so simple , yet ironically so complex . this song , particular , one finest punk songs all time ; it angular , but punishes you , if revving chainsaw full-tilt boogie , through these raunchy lyrics , threatening beat , almost porno-film instrumentals , truly show iggy means what he says . music isn't some sort sell-out truism , but rather reflection his life , no matter how unrefined , or even how silly it sounds , there " soul " here . great number songs ' titles feel like they picked high-school student , or rather dropout ; titles like , " no fun , " " real cool time , " not right , " it shows outright there not some high-concepted art here , but rather stooges party band highest order . so , exception dull , horrid , " we fall , " undoubtedly worst song their canon , even lesser extent , " ann , " songs here punch-and-crunch into your jugular , reside your soul until kid you dies . you love " stooges " -- so , listen it good hard , fast slow , because even if they probably not really intend revolutionary , they instead showed best kind music just played fun heart , simply because they love what they . so , long live brilliant dopes , stooges . **** ( out 5	1

following their successful first recording collaboration blue night records -- " angel eyes , " jazz mandolinist don stiernberg jazz guitarist john carlini it again " george " -- wonderful collection gershwin tunes . they angel eyes , stiernberg carlini once again employ bassist jim cox drummer phil gratteau make tight , swingin ' acoustic quartet some very tasty stuff some old gershwin chestnuts . cool thing their latest effort while they've covered some very familiar material , they've also interpreted some gershwin standards some pretty hip ways . i won't give away any surprises except say , example , i blown away their samba-ized version embraceable you . nicely , gents ! if you're into work acoustic jazz duos like django reinhardt stephane grappelli , joe venuti eddie lang , jazz instrumentals homer jethro , etc ., then " george " treat you shouldn't miss	1
this cd worst " comedy " cd i ever heard . yet reviews here mostly claim it hilarious ???? ok , i've come conclusion , only people writing positive reviews amazon must people trying sell junk . i've seen this guy some tv shows , comedy central , he somewhat funny guy , but it painful listen this cd . you feel awkwardness crowd , not knowing if or when laugh . it continues throughout entire cd . there don't seem any jokes cd all . it all disconnected negative rants bitter angry human . don't believe me ? then go ahead waste your money this horrible piece junk , see yourself . like my review title says , not read positive reviews . just read negative ones , decide how credible they seem . then make your decision buy or not buy	-1
emo noisemaking christian themes . two worst elements our society combined package filled talentless musicianship . face it kids this fad . really pathetic fad . disco fad they thousands upon thousands drones listening participating disco scene . same happened hair metal nu-metal . those scenes completely dead gone so this one one day . you look back this period your life tied up this fad embarrasment your blatant stupidity . i always say my reviews , this trash should treated so accordingly . this band should take their emo wrist cutting lyrics heart kill themselves better humanity .	-1

this album really good , it kind music makes all your headaches go away . no showing off , no over-the-top voices , no see-how-hip-we-are rhythms . it like coming home after long day work . i listen hip-hop , lounge , jazz , rb , house , punk , reggae , funk , soul , everything when i go out , but when i come home , this album kind music i want hear . way , anyone ever mention similarities ray lamontagne first album ' trouble' ? yes , i know that man , but singing frasing , even musical resources both these masterpieces very similar . great tanyas	1
my humble opinion prince debut album ' you ' huge artistic success one his very best albums . but it wasn't even slightly commercial closely related rb funk . 1979 ' prince ' all changed he began his quest building hid own eclectic style mixing funk , soul , pop rock ' roll . this album far more highly polished commercial then debut featuring prince first top 10 pop entery ' i wanna your lover " , catchy funky pop tune original version ' i feel you " -a similar song structure but chaka khan took it all way bank five years later . album consists largely soft love ballads , best which dreamy " it gonna lonely " . two best cuts rockier-the big catchy guitar pop " why you wanna treat me so bad " heavy metal " bambi ' , screaming guitar tribute prince trying convince his lesbian ' girlfriend ' ' it better man ' . very nervy lyric this album alot more then firs t.t he albums funkiest song repetitive " sexy dancer " it groove hard . ' prince ' high quality collection first incarnation minneapolis sound . fact this his debut one gets hear ' purple rain'-era sound it embryonic , trial error stages . what marvelous trip it	1
this album definitely tops their first effort which mediocre best . i decided give them chance i bought album i blown away . it smooth fresh punk beat every song above average . exception basement ghost singing which sorta ' like they first album . if you love punk then you must buy album if you don't buy album . it variety smooth hard beats perfect any listener . top five tracks : 1 . car underwater2 . end fraud3 . truth heaven4 . kind perfect5 . quick little fligh	1

i rarely write reviews , but i need comment how fantastic this compilation . i four-year-old eighteen-month-old , this cd heavy rotation our house . my husband i love music least much they -- it stylish sets great mood we're making dinner doing dishes . kids love it too , needless say . my four-year-old favorites three blind mice ( she loves when farmer wife squeaks she'll give back tails ) final track peggy lee ( where she says word * poop * , " party poop " -- endless laughter ensues ) . ella fitzgerald a-tisket , a-tasket chew , chew your bubblegum priceless . all all , i highly recommend this cd -- everyone happy hear it again again	1
funny thing soundtrack jon brion pieced together " eternal sunshine spotless mind " , it so odd , yet it works so well . songs score , most part , flow seamlessly together , supporting each other great effect . my only complaint two contributions willowz , which doesn't seem fit tone album general . jon brion , if he plays his cards right , could become one most in-demand names film score world if he plays his cards right . up this point , he music films highly acclaimed , but just step or two out mainstream . ( examples include magnolia , punch-drunk love , eternal sunshine , i heart huckabees . ) his score odd , strange , slightly bizarre , surprisingly very touching . most songs good choices , notably two polyphonic spree " mr. blue sky " e.l.o. ( possibly particular group most fun song . ) also , great new recordings beck brion himself , who performs wonderful tune " strings tie you . " if you've got something open mind musically , i'd suggest soaking some " eternal sunshine . " it unique well-thought-out musical experience	1
tuva throat singing impressive enchanting . one songs this cd deepest most sonorous bass voice i think i ever heard . cd gift my yoga teacher , she equally enchanted . ( two out two ain't bad . ) cd qualiy condition beyond reproach . i'm barely resisting starting real collection tuvan music cd 	1
frankenstein drag queens form planet 13 very different sounding band . this cd quot ; viva las violencequot ; they change there directions more violent approach things , rather than their old horror genre . this cd not officially released us , no fdq cds longer sale band . get these why you , you surely enjoy it	1
1974 " odds sods " who rarities album , it great one . it jam-packed various tracks either released solely singles ( or least * intended * single release ) , or outtakes didn't make it onto original albums they recorded . this 1998 re-issue greatly expands " odds sods " whopping 23 tracks ( including previously unreleased material ) , so you're getting whole lotta great who music one disc . there not enough space here me go over every single track , but i'll mention some personal favorites : rockin ' singles " i'm face " " leaving here " ( which two who earliest recordings ) , rolling stones cover " under my thumb , " " tommy " -esque " glow girl " ( it closing line " it girl , mrs. walker , it girl " ) , all-time who classic " long live rock , " excellent " put money down , " john entwistle humorous " postcard " ( snapshot tale life road ) , groovy rock " water , " brilliant " naked eye . " admittedly , there couple throwaways : " cousin kevin model child , " which john entwistle first attempt writing his classic song " tommy , " " we close tonight , " reject " quadrophenia . " both songs listenable , but there really nothing special them ( which probably why they rejected first place ) . but hey , 21 great songs out 23 darn good score . who " odds sods " great rarities collection no who fan should without .	1
this soundtrack just good , if not , better than actual movie ! hans zimmer amazing man written perfect music this movie . soundtrack rocks beginning end . it tells movie story while taking life its own . mr. zimmer definitely deserves academy award this project ! highly recommended	1

quot ; hometimequot ; begins uncomfortably eerie note ghost dusty springfield apparently singing quot;yesterday flame , quot ; one eleven original compositions this new album , her first many years , alison moyet . but it isn't dusty , course ; she died 1999 . it moyet herself , talented chanteuse , sometime channeler dusty , who , since embarking upon solo career , seeking musical niche herself . she may not found it quot ; hometime , quot ; but she comes awfully close , esepcially gorgeous ballads like quot ; should i feel it overquot ; quot ;d o you ever wonder , quot ; which perfectly serve her husky-throated pop vocals . however , there times album , especially title track , when her voice appears coming other end telephone receiver . other places , album overproduced , moyet nearly drowned out arrangements . however , it great her back ; perhaps next time out she'll capitalize her interpretative powers give us cover like quot ; first time ever i saw your facequot ; or quot ; love lettersquot ; ( both found her quot ; singlesquot ; compilation ) not feel it necessary record only originals . big problem moyet exposure : i read this album salon.com, months after it released . she one pop music most distinctive emotive voices ; she deserves wider audience this country	1
love michael buble , but this more like home made movie someone using their camcorder audience . parts michael head cut off , then ; sometimes , his whole head cut off . most time , camera man didn't expect where michael going move you'll get jerky movement camera man trying get michael back into picture . i wish they would said description this more documentary than concert . this just home made videos . this definitely not worth $20 . if you want professional quality concert , i would recommend buying michael buble caught act . caught act worth $20 bucks . you get professional camera men who anticipated michael movements , parts his head never cut off like come fly me dvd . also , sound quality caught act way better . now , i understand why some places sold come fly me dvd word enhanced after it . dvd i received not enhanced . anyways , skip this one , get " caught act " instead	-1
if you're into angry comedians , lewis black deliver lot more than you need , probably more than any sane pearson should hear . he personification all stresses american society today , he not too shy voicing it . if you little politically correct [ wussy ] , or take offence easily , then stay clear , but if you love hearing good verbal lashing , white album leave you breathless . nothings off limits this guy , politicians southerners ozone , plus , he reveals reason we get brain anyrism . unless your cadaver , there no way you won't find yourself thoroughly entertained ... possibly partially soiled	1
my older brother thinks this best dylan album ever . it ? i don't know . " blood track , " " desire " , " highway 61 " " blonde blonde " all records i like better , but right after them , i'd but " jwh " maybe tie it " oh mercy . " don't get me wrong . jwh must own album . not only because you see here how he transitions into his country period " nashville skyline " " new morning , " but because it record plays your head long after you've turned cd player . jwh not only change direction dylan music , but it written while he recovering his motorcycle accident , so one could also assume his life taking new direction well . i'm not sure , but i would think long recovery would make you think life what it all , that what this record seems anyway . least that what i take away it	1
this albun full or steven wrights original stuff way back . absolutely hilarious	1

looking this album sleeve , one cannot miss who almost anything ' my generation ' except sing it . its photo urges you dump this cd right into garbage bin - lightyears away great dave wedgebury-portrait its british counterpart . this cd music already praised other reviews , so i won't go into now . except mentioning keith moon drumming . never heard drummer like before or since , mainly his performance makes this album stand out . 1965 -- until now	1
i'd give this album six if i could . this best hip-hop album ever created , likely ever . it timeless amazing . even ( _especially_) if you think you aren't fan hip-hop , you must spend some time this album . modern [ c]rap this album two entirely different things , this show you what hip-hop really all . poetry , positive outlooks , beats , wordplay jazz . not violence , money , wealth fame	1
i'm pretty much completely board troy collins excellent review drew gress third solo recording . my only questions why he doesn't give it fifth star , why he disparages his previous recordings . i agree this certainly best thing gress recorded , but my own view it merits highest accolades reviewer give it . let take closer look . first off , gress assembled quintessential downtown jazz ensemble : ralph alessi ( trumpet ); tim berne ( alto sax ); tom rainey ( drums ); craig taborn ( piano ) . these guys move fluid grace post-bop , free-bop , modernistic no-bop anyone planet . they consistently nail whatever musical soundscape called . second , compositions both melodic appeal post-modern smartness often lacking these downtownish sessions . really , there not loser nine selections -- entirely admirable avant-garde . i'm thinking nearly any savvy jazz enthusiast could get board esthetic going down here . third , tim berne plays attractively assertively i've ever heard him . there warmth burnished quality his delivery i've never heard him before . fourth , craig taborn proves once again he simply monster his instrument . it seems no matter what context , taborn concept chops deliver just what needed . check out his solo " bright idea " sample what i mean . fifth , i believe i say without contradiction this finest playing tom raney ever committed disc . besides his trademark polyrhythmic attack , there such deep swing rhythmic propulsion his playing one simply cannot imagine anyone else adequately filling drum chair . bottom line , this brilliant contemporary jazz absolute highest accomplishment .	1

forget purple dinosaurs inept adults dumbing down low quality music hyponotize children insincere emotion . this real stuff . this album quality authentic music children love ! my kids wear this album out better yet i like it . maybe little real tv culture . also check out woody guthries - quot ; songs mother child grow onquot ; quot ; nursery yearsquot ;	1

i found one most depressing albums all time , it under my nose . there only one real saving grace off this album , " shine you crazy diamond(part one ) " it rather dark , stark , yet beautiful piece , but i can't say second part song which you endure through 3 horrible songs just get . " welcome machine " boring well depressing it seems like it never ending like " tuesday afternoon " " cigar " also long-winded , depressing , " wish you here " it not greatest , but it also not bad either . i also realized there some conflict going group , capitol records after " dark side moon " wound up so successful , made group move over columbia records , perchance meeting former frontman syd barrett during recording this album also noted . he only 29 when he saw them again , it looked like he aged 35 years then . which same spirit i got when i heard this album all way through december 18 , 1993 . it boring saturday night florida , i nothing myself except put my brother floyd cd collection onto cassette tapes . i don't wish there again .	-1
i absoultely love this album !! i hadn't heard saving jane before kinda just found them while downloading some other songs . i downloaded come down me fell love it . i then preceeded download ever song burned them cd , it my cd player week now i listen every chance i get !! i love saving jane . can't wait next album !	1
diana krall become huge selling singer over years , which often made her target jazz " purists " who scoff anything popular sellout . perhaps she not greatest lounge-style singer pianist ever , but i would argue she very good , popularized style music her success . that not bad thing . her cd , i enjoy this one most . reviewer wrote here , it lot " swingier " than much her other material , she brings meaning lyrics , playfulness innuendo it all . this album great place start those who've liked anything they've heard diana krall . what she , this case smoky lounge music , she very well .	1
it hard describe music explosions sky without waxing poetic . no simple sentence describe music here - it shimmers gleams dances beautifully it itself kind poetry borne duel meloncholy guitars steady , forceful drums . any guitar rock enthusiast - i'm talking you mogwai , godspeed you black emperor fans - this must . listening explosions sky religious experience , invariably . just listen your hand mine try not feel glory	1
everything tool great . they just geniuses . everything guitar , baseline , drums , vocals , good , everything ! definetively worth checking them out ! it took me while get used their long intros outros , their style , but after many listens it just gets better better . best songs album me lateralus , parabola grudge	1
this cd amazing ; nothing more needs said . but those you need convincing : songs addicting glorious . i can't get these songs out my head-and i don't want . it takes six people make music this powerful . if you even considering buying this yourself favor get it ; it worth every penny	1
epiphany : best chaka khan long overdue greatest hits collection one most influential singers ever . chaka khan stamp music industry well documented . known early her career " little aretha " this sexy siren voice which such range . highs lows even some screaming key , this incredible singer . included 16 track cd some her biggest hits like touching " through fire " , mega smash prince remake " i feel you " her first solo hit " i'm every woman , " track later remade whitney houston . there also live version " tell me something good " -the stevie wonder written hit rufus chaka khan . other selections featured cd may not big hits but they definitely showcase dynamics versatility chaka voice . songs like " night tunasia " " end love affair " demonstrate what chaka when it comes jazz tune . there also heartfelt " love me still " , collaboration bruce hornsby spike lee clockers soundtrack . this best cd also features 5 new songs . these songs actually apart shelved 1995 chaka cd entitled " dare you love me . " " everywhere " fleetwood mac song chaka reworks , but instead traditional rock rhythm .... it reggae style . " never miss water " funky tune which features rb/bassist m'shelle n'degeocello .

my opinion , la pistola el corazon watershed album los lobos . their interpretations these songs including their own compositions should shown them spanish way go . my favorite los lobos albums early ones . their mastery roots-rock judicious mix songs spanish made them pleasure listen . who , latino or gringo , could not like their fabulous rendition anselma ? this album , we're given handful gems one reviewer said , only thing wrong album it too short . if you like other songs los lobos spanish , then you should definitely own this one . there variety styles display . my favorites la guacamaya , las amarillas , el gusto , incomparable que nadie cepa mi sufrir . though i not care much them first , two compositions band grew me repeated listens which revealed true depth talent here . i wish los lobos would return its roots i care little its current direction . one only hope band decides take stab music it best record album like this . legions fans thank them	1

nine inch nails only band this cd worth listening , this sound track crap	-1
this guy excellent musician but , my way thinking , this cd not good " triple stop " . cd 12 scale 1-5 . if you see this guy ( vcr/dvd/live/radar/whatever ) you'll blown away . he can't what he he sure can't it way he it . doesn't make any sense but music sure . everybody who likes guitar music or ever got past " " run ought listen him . world full good guitar pickers this guy stands out . this good cd but if you only buy one scotty anderson cd , buy " triple stop .	1
austin , tx band i love you but i've chosen darkness boasts one most unusual band names i ever encountered , it begs question : it distract music , or it complement it ? after band self-released 2003 ep , now finally comes full-fletched debut album . " fear our side " ( 12 tracks , 52 min . ) fleshes out ( matures ) sound 2003 ep , great results . if you not familiar their sound , imagine mix 80s cure-meets-nowadays-interpol . band creates mood dark yet times poppy even danceable songs , great effect . check out opener " ghost " , which sets table album . " lights " one few truly upbeat songs , " last all " . there couple instrumentals way , creating more dark ( but not scary ) mood . other highlights include " last ride together " , which truly reminiscent 80s cure sound , just great , closer " if it me " . this great album . it even translates better live setting . i saw ilubicd concert recently , these songs rocked hard , much more so then studio versions . people may scratch their heads unusual band name , but i hope they go beyond give this band chance . highly recommended	1
i very excited see this cd ep available . mentioned other reviewers , title song thanksgiving day not immediately grab you la you really got me . give it chance it definitely draw you into this quintessential ray davies character study . surface , it happy , nostalgic tale annual family feast gathering so many us grew up still look forward today . but it wouldn't great davies song without somewhat sad ironic twist . personally , i find it very moving . it touches me so many ways . it illicit wide range emotional response most people . i like both versions song though i might slight preference alternate version which track #5 . it seems draw you little quicker its choral introduction . rest ep , i immediately liked 2nd song , yours truly confused n10 its big band brass swing humorous lyric . it got very different sound . nobody confuse this song anything previously kinks . other two songs , i like storyteller its quiet , countrified charm . london song doesn't really much me . it sounds more like interesting experiment , but never really develops song . all all , nice little teaser much anticipated full cd release next february .	1
this album awesome . even though i'm pretty tight " star gun " , i give it 5 stars , if only offset negative reviews . nay-sayers ( those interested what nay-sayers say ): this album compilation morcheeba influences , not morcheeba nor it pretend . some also said it " blaxploitation " feel it , but i really don't feel . very smooth album vaguely reminiscent some unique downtempo mixes found betalounge [ ... ] . so many songs really get into your skin give you hazy , chill , but dark echoey feeling - relaxed groovy but slightly off creepy/good way . fantastic album bedroom	1
if you're sheryl crow and/or shannon mcnally fan you'll love this inspiring new singer songwriter . this cd great blend soft rock ' roll good lyrics . thanks amazon recommendation	1
reading my other reviews , it would become quite obvious i'm one neil biggest fans , yet i heard so many people tell me he really sold out went soft this album . so , though i own nearly all his albums , i always held off this one . one day , i saw it sale bought it ; man i surprised ! neil hadn't gone soft , if this him selling out album , then how come it still so great ? songs beautiful ( not word use describe anything neil very often ) , only couple moments over , but overall everything touched up perfection , rather than extravagance . vocals come across very nicely , though i unlike most love neil singing all time ( i think it raw emotional any voice there ) . neil otherwordly guitar still mix , lyrics , always young , excellent delivered perfect way only neil manage . " weekend , " " harvest , " " man needs maid " " heart gold " almost haunting their beauty . " needle damage , " among greatest tracks ever written subject drug abuse ( close second " sister morphine " stones ) , " old man " like nothing else neil catalogue great track well . other tracks great but don't stand out quite much ones specifically mentioned . this not neil greatest work , but it still masterpiece classic countryish , folk , rock . i certainly recommend album neil fans think non-neil fans may find it their favorite his albums . i positivley love this album , so don't discouraged fact i don't consider it among handful his best , it just man come out such stellar albums , one great this , falls out top 5 or so	1
tree life quieter all around : downs ' songs present more her jazzy side , tend towards less passionate riffs displays , yet smoothly evocative her mexican roots heritage . this isn't say there no spirit here : ' nuevo viento ' , example , adopts near-flamenco guitar style exhibits force downs ' vocal trills .	1
best part latest where " last mohicans " ran all way up after rahun ' leader- nice battle- if you feel soul hero then it must watch	1
first off , i love this band this album top stack essential ... positive reviews here simple hint . said , last three songs here not my personal favorites universe . they explore dissonant realms i feel conjure paranoid elements , anxiety unease . however i admire band accomplishing this . i not rule these later tracks negative light just because i find them unfriendly . this art cause un-ease well astonishment ... not easy feat ! tago mago collective showcase razor sharp musical chops fearless , brazen creativity . it feels like stream conscious work musical virtuossos unafraid fail . music encouraging , spontaneous inspirational . " halleluhwah " almost 15 minutes long never loses it captivating lock listener . it boasts infectiously simple " building block " bass line would kill dime-a-dozen reggae song wrong hands ... instead it soars . i can't tell you how many times i've repeated this track . whole album extremely artistic , including mesmerizing cover art . rhythm here heard like no other . drumming brilliant . vocals cosmic funky alive , among many adjectives spring mind .... just great album . yes , you've stumbled upon something amazing . buy it already	1
i recently bought orignal version , failed notice it missing song . i thought how bad it , but it turns out song bonus , my faviorte song film . its really amazing , so id recommend buying remastered one extra song .	1
they say when painters put their brush canvas , certain energy flows out their fingertips , through brush into paint . over time painter masters this craf t-t he energy becomes visable naked eye it clearly resides colors brushstroked canvas . this concept clearly defines wonderful gift art garfunkel . without doubt there many great singers history popular music , but what makes mr. garfunkel stand out among rest , his gift great craftsmanship . mr. garfunkel one those very few singers who knows how sign his voice song . every song he ever chosen sing , he embraced such way it always come surprise listener he didn't write song . but what no surprise , songs he continues chose sing throughout his musical career . carefully choosing rich meaningful songs such outstanding songwriters such as(paul simon , jimmy webb , mike batts stephen bishop)just name few . therefore , it no accident mr. garfunkel chose billy mann produce " everything waits noticed " . nor it any accident great talents-buddy mondlock aand maria sharp joined him this project . like master woodworker who knows when wood work when it won't- they harmoniously weave together different styles sound evoking feelings love joy feelings empathy self reflection . each song carefully threaded together colorful rhythmic melodies deep meaningful lyrics ( some which composed mr. garfunkel himself ) . obviously these recordings not meant somone who approaches music something you chew till flavor gone then trade cut-outs . appeciate such original music takes more than able hear it requires ability listen . encountering such music this not unlike making new acquaintance quietly evolves into deep meaningful relationship . leaves you feeling way only descibed words henery van dyke once said " glad life because it gives you chance love work play look up stars " .	1

' wild , innocent e-street shuffle ' bruce springteen second release , 1973 . it also , if not his very best releases definately top two one pinnacles artist . " e-street shuffle " funky groove , lot fun points out what makes e-street band so great this early point-david sancious . his keyboard work playful ( such song or simply beautiful flowing such reflective " 4'th july " or just plain good " incident 57'th street " . these songs character skethes-mostly happy ones bruce also goes little deeper into his journey musical success . although sound things bruce possition ' new dylan ' just hype-he couldn't different singer-he gutteraln yes-but also gushes out wordplay lot faster-he imparts more information time given it lot-most these songs over five minutes . this album two big highlites- " kitty back " " rosalita " -on these songs ' street ' sound born . it all classic rock ' soul here , you dance them , get into clerence clemonds sax or just listen wordplay-two greatest songs written just couple girls ! " wild billy circus party " great tuba solo very celebratory he leaves best last winding " new york serenade " -a lenghy story song sure . yes this music lot ideas styles packed into it but character tales he weaves so well mostly fun it this time out . but mainly these songs lot soul great fun rock roll kick-back basics all way , well coyly funky here there . when people refer this one bruce masterpieces isn't hype-it truth . so if you want get into more springsteen after ' born run ' , go no further then street shuffle	1
sublime good band never lived see their full potential . their self titled album their most famous album , filled such well known songs " what i got " , " santeria " , " wrong way " . album mixture reggae , hip-hop , some punk , similar debut but much , much more focused less " jammy " . spontaneity debut missed hardcore fans , theres just something way songs it(ruca , badfish , dj .. ) gel together , blending different styles music , missing makes it less fun . they still capable band this release , however , it still delivers goods overall	1
my opinion , this beautiful album . they didn't follow behind any other music time it sounds like music en vogue always . they quite nice without dawn . some songs this album could've scraped or filled song .. or reworked but majority very intriguing . highlights album : riddleno no no ( can't come back)love you crazysad but true**love won't take me outwhatever , be**beat lovethose dogs . other songs tolerable but they're not ones i listen over over like ones i listed . if someone debating buying album or not .. i think it definitely worth purchase . it your type " just sittin around relaxing , enjoying day " type album . 7.7 out 10	1
i am totally feeling this cd i mean i wanna get up get crunk everytime i play it ( e'eryday ) if you love down souf crunk ish then this cd must	1
modest mouse hard love . many their albums grating . i know they good , but life me i can't enjoy them wholly . maybe this makes me less intelligent somehow , i prefer more mainstream good news ... their other albums . but i find good news gets stuck me i just can't shake songs . this album all feels very new . it welcome mainstream radio , but remains unique . single float bit hit rightly so ... it feels good honest . it what pop should sound like . album still intensely creative , while sometimes tiring ( i get older waiting genius songs grow me ) here songs immediately catch . favorites ocean breathes salty , view , satin coffin , black cadillacs . give them chance if you haven't introduced them ... fanatics don't get all freshman music-angsty them saying they sold out . you know it good :	1
many kylie fans either hate or love this album , i am one few love it . it nothing but pure pop , no emotions or meaningful lyrics ... just fun , sexy dance music you groove . alot songs sound like those fillers very addictive fun , but no real impression . this type cd you listen while cleaning around house or driving your car some friends background music . i personally love it . there few real treasures though i believe some kylie best .. " loving days " , " chocolate " , " cruise control " just name few . it'll interesting see which direction she goes her next album .. i've heard it gonna alot more personal mature than her previous albums due events she went through . love you kylie , keep working your way up ! you're queen	1
i've always held philosophy you what you're entertained . so , those who like ludacris definitely telling themselves their views life women . speaking women ... ludacris never met one who wasn't h-o . ludacris epitome sexual hypocrisy plagues men : you demean look down women h-oes , yet you hope every woman h-o so you'll no problems getting laid . but then , you're so disgusted fact woman behaves too much like you , so you go find " nice girl " because you respect her marry her procreate her . but then you cheat her " bad girl " because h-oes need h-oes ; but then you can't respect " bad girl " because she slut , so you go back " good girl . " but she not nasty enough you , so then ... around around we go . women basically punished men not able make up their minds what heck they want us . he obsessed sex h-oes . it makes you wonder if he hang-ups it . maybe ludapis saw his mother selling herself backalley dollar it scarred his outlook women forever . i guess if she actually raised him shown him how respect women -- all women -- then he probably could grown up respectable guy instead prurient dummy he . what music like ? well i'll give him 2 stars mentioning tlc what your fantasy . that it . addendum : 7/27-07 some may wonder why i'm " wasting ' my time giving ludacris negative reviews . well , first all , if only people who liked product only ones review it , everything amazon would 5 stars , which would inaccurate sign its quality . secondly , i don't like ludacris . i would give ludacris more respect if i felt he gave my gender more respect ; but he doesn't . my diatribe above shows what my problem him , i feel argument valid . there no way critique ludacris ' music without critiquing his hypocrisy regarding women . why should i like him when he seems nothing but contempt us ? i'm biased against him because he biased against me . so he gets bad rating out s-p-i-t-e	-1
legend john scofeild playing medeski , martin wood ? whats not too like ? i guess argument it bit repetitive track-to-track leaning too [ ... ] sharp nine valid . but so what ? if you're mood some guitar driven jazz/funk this suit you just fine . calling tracks this album " throw aways " then comparing them " kind blue " ( one most prolific albums jazz history ) -- sheer [ ... ] .	1

i've known marvelled matt music almost 15 years now continue enjoy his incredible sense tone timing . it not enough monster guitar player ( he ) , but my astonishment not when somebody tries overwhelm you their skill but underwhelm you their sense musical composition steady knowledge , yes , they rip it up pretty much anybody but choose instead woo you gently through their songs . matt achieves this ; his vocal guitar style unique tom waits , greg brown , or van morrison . i occasionally hear new song played radio instantly know it matt ward , i always smile process . wonderful music calm sunsets , glass wine , wonderful companions . please check out his early works , if possible , see him live .	1
maysa delivered knock out punch this here cd ! her first venture without backing incognito she not only nailed it shut , she buried it deep , dug it up flung it out ballpark ! that how serious it ! her version ewf " head sky " enough make one run buy this cd , yet if you're still unsure , her duet downing brassy , latin tinged tune " simply life " enough make you leap before looking ! she sang " deep water " incognito , but she really went into deep end this project ! well !	1
very good , excellent fast delivery not able find shops	1
this awesome album listen when you feeling down . it renews you . most songs this album slow rather than fast . ryan definitely uses his talent this album . don't buy this album if you not like slow music , because there only few fast songs this cd like " start " , " hit me your light " , " shine " . i hope this review helped you	1
this cd fine cd , avid collector , die hard madonna fan ( like myself ) just lover 80 music . you get 5 mixes " like prayer " three " express yourself " . you also find here local mix " express yourself " , which included orginal vinyl , but not remastered cd . 1 . like prayer ( 12 " dance mix ): this great version like prayer version , one appeared immaculate collection based . 2 . like prayer : ( 12 " extended mix ): this mix wonderful , because it based orginal album version . only thing i not like it , first verse left out , best verse whole song . 3 . like prayer ( churchapella ): okay this not true apella . it softer vocals than orginal , little music . it very gorgeous version wonderful lover tame songs . 4 . like prayer ( 12 " club version ): this version my fav version like prayer , it based orginal includes first verse . 5 . like prayer ( 7 " remix/edit ): this just edit 12 " club version . 6 . express yourself ( non-stop express mix ): this version express yourself , would fondate one would make it immnaculate collection . this version very well turned out more popular than album . 7 . express yourself ( stop go dubs ): notice dub plural here , that because there two dubs here . 6 minutes first dub ends there 2second pause new one begins . how awesome ! 8 . express yourself ( local mix ): this version mix , based abum version . i like it lot , beause it based orginal album . this cd far madonna must , so you son't this cd , then click " add cart " buy it	1

last broadcast musical expression where one goes when one hides one emotional vulnerabilities into realm depths one imagination . i like every song this album including two tracks which really build ups into other songs . there goes fearwordssulphur manpoundingcaught riverand satellites ( which almost reminds me updated variation xtc " satellites " ) all songs pockets proud melancholy . deep baritone vocals reminiscent red house painters or ride . music reminiscent verve . but sound very unique album good any i've got my collection	1
if you're buying this cd because you've heard john lithgow " singing bathtub " - don't it . this not same toe-tapping , sing fun music . fact , i find it difficult hear what sung over orchestration . i can't stand listen it	-1

ah , this great album . very feel-good . contains some most rampant catchiness allowed run around disc . frontman justin pierre voice reminds me cedric bixler large , large amounts barbibtuates . his extremely pleasant singing voice . every track very good its own right , but ones i really look forward " everything alright ( 2 ) , " " when you're around ( 3 ) , " " feel like rain ( 5 ) , " " time turns fragile ( 7 ) , " " let get f'd up die ( 8 ) , " " together we'll ring new year , " " hangman " " hold me down " ( tracks 10 , 11 12 ) . but i always listen album whole way through . skipping songs ex-heroin addicts . so , even if you hate emo culture inherent , buy/burn/download this album give it least three or four spins . you'll hooked . then listen few more times tell me it doesn't put you into good mood	1
very dramatic music - felt like battle . not easy listening type music any stretch imagination	-1
i there first cd thought it really good . this even bettre . real hard hitting rock . sleazy , fun , polished . well worth wait .	1
most atdi fans i meet say this album or relationship command their best albums . i would say this , my opinion , their best album . energy emotion throughout each every song clearly heard . acrobatic tenement good start it energy emotion but what album lacked abstract lyrical content cedric some polish music . production quality better , music cleaner or more focused it obvious how much band matured hell paso ep ' 94 this album ' 98 . music lyrics not basic this album they previous work . el gran orgo not bad ep but you tell couple members leaving after first full length there not much could stood out effort . i think this what they looking . relationship maybe bit more accessible music shows even more talent them than this album but this album just captures essence what this band me . this album really got me into atdi . me there not one bad track this album . if you new atdi definitely pick this one up , it worth it . reviewer below me , some greatest voices over years sung way out tune . bob dylan , lou reed .... just name couple , they heavy influences lots people . out tune adds effect this band cause it not meant flawless album . this band not meant polished , they displayed raw energy , confusion , emotion youth . i really don't think people care how cedric voice sounds , its emotion behind it . plus you should go pick up mars volta album hear cedric wail those albums . than tell me he not good front man	1
i absolutely love this group . this album . lyrics amazing . tinged every conceivable emotion weaving endless often devasting tapestry so wrought debilitating anguish lonliness strong yet paradoxically volitile grasp hope redemption it becomes poetry , pure unfettered . music equally strong versatile , beats engaging seem remain , dancing mind long after song ends . listening futureperfect , i often feel like voyeur , gaping into deepest recesses human spirit -- its vulnerability , couragousness , acceptance inevitability cruel , mundane reality while clinging desparate hope triumph spiritual awakening . their entire discography shakespeare set music -- exploration nearly every facet human nature human condition spiritual psychological whole . this album chapter which probes most intensely dichotmoies hope despair , aspiration acquiessance , individual collective , above all , inescapable earning failure realize love	1
i , like pretty much anyone else , first saw lewis black daily show always likes his ' back black ' , mainly because he really good point out stupid things kinda show western society its downfall . course september 11 discussed even though he not first discuss airport security it remains funny , though george carlin best bit it . my favorite part end universe houston texas , where there two starbucks right across each other . it hilarious , made me think ' best show ' . if you like ' back black ' you certainly entertained this , f-word	1
after band practiced " sad wings .. " they ready release first real classic band history . still some songs sound more like normal hard rock(which no wonder , because roger glover , bass player deep purple , produced album ) but tracks like " dissident aggressor " or " starbreaker " classic priest material trademarks band . much better than first two records sign coming ( metal-)storm	1
patience virtue when delving into lot pinback work but sia more ferocity than any pinbacks earlier efforts ( except maybe offcell ep ) easy casting-off point new fans group . third full album pinback simply stunning . more " user friendly " tracks like " fortress " " non-photo blue " alongside songs like " this red book " " bloods fire " ( which more akin tracks blue screen life pinback ) , summer abaddon pleasant journey into emotional realm consisting pain longing previously left un-touched pinback often technical or even methodical style . tracks flow into one flawlessly , softer more upbeat songs placed appropriate intervals , all building climactic , drum-driven " afk " : screaming listener " remember summer abaddon " . but such remarkable moment hard forget . my only complaint album now i wait pinback next move ..	1
mr bowie should stick acting - i thought he excellent labyrinth but this spin off album which cynically tries cash success unimpressive say least . mr bowie could learn thing or two smith who both sing act . shame	-1
i love this cd . gil scott heron brilliant . i particularly like quot ; whitey moonquot ; quot ; revolution not televised . quot ; message still socially relevant today	1
this good album aly aj . tween : every song send strong message kids ( strong , stand up yourself , etc . ) , which i find it good way encourage kids . teens or older : honest , it difficult me find uniqueness each song because , i listen each song closely , i find out every song similar lyric beat/melody ( excepts rush , no one , ride , collapsed , slow down ) . there not enough element me tell each song apart . personally , good song me song you'll know right away when you hear first melody . even though , each song expresses different message but they seem use same word over over again ( ex . " something more " ) . sorry say this but i find it little disturbing . but i'm sure their song writing get better ( deeper ) they grown older . so , keep up good work , girls ! if you're tween - you'll love this album . if you're teen or older - you'll like/enjoy this album .	1
when i first listened this cd tower record sample shelf , i amazed high quality this recording . music sacred voices both pro arte singers theatre voices clean clear , you feel you listening music heaven . excellent performance	1
sure this not bruce springsteen first great album , he released two other albums before it all his early albums great , but none them define him well this one . one thing enjoyable springsteen music he very opposite glam rock phenomena over taking world early 70s . he rarely wrote glamorous life rich famous instead wrote level middle-class man trying heard world . process he creates wide range colorful characters stories range teenagers trying break free darker subjects such crime punishment . it starts album opener , " thunder road " , classic , " i wanna break free life farm " , type story . piano riff beginning creates very humble simple atmosphere leads into yearning verses love , hope , ambition better life . thats only track one . we continue through road everyday hardships songs such light-hearted , " 10th avenue freeze-out " , anthemic , " backstreets " , title track . track , " born run " , major achievement songwriting . guitar piano riff hopeful lyrics really convey sense cruising down highway , away all your troubles worries . " she one " , starts out emotional ballad before exploding into anthemic rocker . we're treated whimsical darkness , " meeting across river " , before venturing into albums final longest piece , " jungleland " . lightness hope album all comes end dark horrifying finale this song . bonnie clyde type tale ends violently but hardly inappropriately . bruce springsteen hailed savior classic rock-n-roll , steering away both more complex prog-rock fast punk-rock 70s . springsteen would go into darker subject matter his follow-up , " darkness edge town " , he would return anthemic his hit , " born usa " , but this album got him moving it always remembered one his greatess achievements	1
friend mine gave me our winter love gift when we teens i never recovered absolute beauty this instrumental . how happy i am find out soon i listening it cd ! amazon , you rule . this music start images your mind take you place ..	1
this last cd art poter made before his death he missed . this must buy	1
it holds up just well today . past few years , market flooded wrestling-themed albums , mostly containing 30 seconds generic entrance music stretched out 3 or 4 minutes create " song " . least these " real " songs , which best you say them . originals , only keepers jimmy harts suprisingly catchy " rick springfield " absurd yet moronically toe tapping " capt lou history music " . covers , hearing nikolai volkoff sing cara mia worth snicker or two , but not more than , mean gene singing all embarrassing ( although not bad his " rock roll hoochie koo " off wrestling album ii , barely ) . all wrestlers chip " land 1000 dances " , although i cant quite remember if original boasted lyrics " i'm gonna rap you my cane , you pencil neck geek " or " i'm gonna crush you my avalanche " . song patter okerland , mcmahon , ventura most part stilted unfunny . please , i abhor you , spend your hard earned money something little better	-1
writer/producer/director guru tim burton , danny elfman , johnny depp round off trio edward scissorhands seems worked well them so far ( cf . other films such sleepy hollow , charlie chocolate factory , corpse bride ) . particular , burton direction storyline here create character edward sensitive loving , child-like navit , but who grossly misunderstood feared . depp masterful acting complements story wonderfully , making viewer surprised edward uniqueness , but also compelled his sense compassion unjust treatment . elfman accompanying score delicate tender , it simply couldn't better . true elfman style , we find we both comforted his music , same time , left sense unease perhaps things aren't pristine perfect ( quaint town here edward set ) they seem . indeed , elfman score includes gentle choir , wistful strings , soft bells . every turn edward makes , elfman music there guiding your ears your mind through world new , exciting , fantastic , but somehow dark mysterious . highly recommended	1
i listened this album i actually felt cancer forming my ear drums . nelly wack hell period . he modern day version mc hammer . take look music he making now . this album commercial hell but when you slide down nelly resume it gets even more commercial . i mean how low you go ? country grammar some decent beats get professionally wasted but number one beat waster world . nelly worst rapper actor ever walk this earth . what we need people like this yank him off stage tar feather this klown . check out real hip hop like mos def immortal technique	-1
this excellent set put out philips it renowned duo cd class . almost all mozart violin works here . arthur grumiaux , one my favorites , superb job interpreting mozart works . this last weekend i played same works heifitz comparison makes interesting listening . i can't say one better than other , specially since i no formal training music , but each artist definitely leaves impression . excellent set superb value but most importantly makes valuable addition anyone collection .	1
i now purchasing my 8th personal copy this album . some reason i can't hold onto this disk if my life counted it . what more i say , i continue buy this album when it disappears my collection . truly masterpiece . thank you sublime !	1
this my fave neil young album . all his records kind loose , inspired vibe , but this one sounds like soundtrack some cold autumn night up north spent local bar where band rockin you good spiritual buzz goin . it always gets tagged precursor grunge , it may , but me its just good heavy jam album played bunch guys who really enjoying themselves . guitars distorted resonant , bass drums laying down solid rythym neil singing uninhibited inspired place . i wish more bands would make records like this because it never gets old i don't think i'll ever get tired it	1
this all very lo-fi indeed ... all arrangements very basic , even tinny times , stephin merritt voice probably acquired taste ( it brings mind formulation leo kottke came up describe his own voice : geese farts muggy day ) ... but still , this sprawling collection songs many varieties love , smooth crunchy , works impossibly well ... some cynical , many deeply moving , but even throwaways stick memory ... they're all great there're too many highlights list here , but my personal favorites ( least today ) set : " papa rodeo " , " sun goes down ... " , " i don't believe sun " , " i don't want get over you " .... yes , easily one best ' 90 	1
... i always knew their two big hits , baby now i've found you build me up buttercup radio i decided take plunge into group other music . what i discovered though hits good , they not best songs this realy good cd . bad bad old days , born live born die , baby i couln't see , take girl like you , my little chicadee , something my baby especialy ridiculously catchy stoney ground all more than enough convince any listener this group wildly underated . must sixties classic	1
radiohead not come easy me . it took few months several listens ok computer when it came out me get into them all . when kid came out , i found same thing . however , my past experience , i knew listen album few times before i could judge it . it soon became my favourite album radiohead , then my favourite album any band , then put radiohead position my favourite band . this album not collaboration songs . it much more like one single song , several movements whose contrast support each other drive album perfection(this album actually debuted mtv full , without breaks , one track immediatly after other . there no singles released u.s. album ) . this reason , i cannot name favourite songs it . i could go abuot what this means music , how this band came out post post modern work etc etc , but i dont like this album whatever " significance " it may . not i anything against those you like it . i'm jsut music itself . heres bit summary : thom his best , both lyrically sound his voice itself . he cuts disturbing images into mind lines like " cut kids half " " here im allowed everything all time " , yet paints saddest , most beautiful pictures same time . his voice ranges detached impersonal(while speaking deadly words , nonetheless ) positively dominated raw emotion i honestly couldnt describe words . apart lyrics , music itself least important wholeness album . jonny greenwood dropping guitar eerie strings dead electric instrument " how disappear completly " , sad organ " motion picture soundtrack " , sawtoothed electric bass " national anthem " ( which actually played thom , even computer vibe " kid " idioteque " seamless ... necessary , word , kid album . this album truly masterpiece , real example how new music not completly faded into catchy tunes fade memory constant imitation talentless pop whose image means more tahn their music . there creativity left popular music , radiohead kid shows it more than any other album i've heard . give it try . then give it . understanding it takes time , but it truly worth while	1
my 45+ years collecting listening popular music , j.j. cale stands out truly unique . how so ? easiest way explain this talk my ipod song list some 1700 selections . what i've create this song list choose only my favorite tracks any particular album ripped onto ipod . some albums represented one selection ; others two or three . very select few , perhaps whole album gets included my ' po d.j.j. cale prime example this kind personal special favorite musician . why ? well , we all know , there no accounting taste . each us our own musical preferences , tastes , favorite genre . me it blues based music , whether it hard blues rock jimi hendrix , early elvis " sun sessions , " or mellow country blues j.j. cale , i love blues . here what i experience j.j. : deeply felt , genuine , totally organic blues expressions . instrumentation always tight , together , groove . each musician , each track within song , each overdub blends perfectly whole . , . . ' lyrics , melodies , vocals , guitar work essential masterly glue makes it all happen . what this means , me , his music timeless quality . it doesn't get out date , it doesn't get " old , " i don't get tired listening i t.t his why when i ripped j.j. album onto my ipod , i almost always whole album . i 123 j.j. cuts ' pod , but i won't buy " very best j.j. cale . " i no need because i already all these cuts . however , if i could only own one j.j. album , it would double set " anyway wind blows . " without checking it cut cut , i'm fairly certain " blows " all best " very best . " but , " blows " you get least twice much . . this very good thing , but if aren't convinced my opinion , least try out " very best j.j. cale . " if you're able appreciate good music any genre , you just gotta dig j.j.	1
i feel pretty confident saying anyone who knows who mary lou lord knows time time , she found playing quot ; her spotquot ; mta green line . this recording some her time spent there awesome . it lot covers , which all fantastic , but i think best thing it hearing snippets conversation occasional train running ... because really adds essence mary lou lord . its just great . yes . great . wooooo	1
this album hard review . it some very strong songs it : dig down deep , i tried , blunderbuss . listen samples , they pretty good indication . they beautifully crafted , melodic , just generally wonderful . brad tuneful writer , interesting , slightly unconventional voice his credit . but among tracks some duds too . i'm unable listen cd all way through . i get impression brad didn't band , but he knew lot different musicians , almost album worth tunes when he started . album drifts pop masterpieces unfortunate rock mishaps . good tunes sound like jellyfish ... bad tunes sound like smithereens 4-track . plus , i'm not getting lot feeling out these songs . even best tunes , while well crafted musically , aren't personal all . i still no sense who brad jones . i hope hear more brad future , but , if you planning buying this album , prepared jumble . still , impressive craftsmanship good tracks , i give this album 4 stars . long i'm here , i should mention you should check out steve ward solo album ... it like this one , only more consistent definitely more heartfelt	1
if your looking something you rock , like kmfdm , pig , or slick idiot , then stay away this cd ! musically it way different then what i hoping . there variety musical styles here , non which good rockin industrial . so if you don't mind different , buy it , you'll like it , just don't expect much otherwise	-1
joe strummer streetcore one best albums ever . after few rather poor recordings during 90 , strummer came back this rock-masterpiece . it sounds good any his efforts clash or 101er . sound album hits some risky area near rock reggae , yet it couldn't classified either . it something magical only strummer could possibly conjure . why , exactly , this record rock so hard ? songs , course . album starts off rollicking track titled " coma girl " , it definitely one strummer best moments . exactly what he means rather bizarre lyrics he sings throughout song anybody guess , but music pure , genre-clashing ( excuse unintentional pun , clash-fans ) excellence , whole album only two slightly-mediocre tracks ( even they aren't bad , honest ) . those two " redemption song " " silver gold " . first cover famous bob marley song , although second doesn't fit rest cd , lyrics particular track chillingly prophetic , therefore acceptable . strummer sings , " i'm going everything silver gold , i got hurry up before i grow too old , " . it really makes you understand strummer knew end near ( strummer tragically died shortly after album release ) . this album timeless , clash / strummer fans everywhere , it strangely ( yet strongly ) emotional experience . it essential every clash library , even those who aren't huge clash fans appreciate its classic-rock sound . finally , hard-core clash / strummer fan myself , i rate this album better then any clash album except their self-titled debut london calling . it best album i've heard years , i don't think i could say enough nice things it million years . indescribable , modern , rock masterpiece ( how so many clash fans denied its existence upon its initial release beyond mortal comprehension , my opinion ) . i rate it solid 5 stars . it perfect .	1
this cd obviously one catchier dcfc releases . i love this cd . it dcfc album i go back again again . one my big complaints albums 1 good song , 2 ok songs 7 bad songs . it makes me feel like i wasted my money buying whole cd , but photo album very good collection songs . this 3rd dcfc album i own , it very good . music so amazing . these guys real talent . dcfc definately won me over long time fan . melodic pop mixed deeply emotional lyrics just what world needs more , good no nonsense music . i am looking forward next album	1

simply unreal . what happened boys ? time they took paul boutique this album very well spent . this album exudes creativity originality . it funky , it sharp , it just plain fun . boatloads fun . instrumentals real treat , but pass mic , so what'cha want , lighten up , jimmy james best tunes . seriously , folks , one best 5 hip hop albums ever . 14 years later i still listen it monthly	1
considering i'm day late dollar short review this album when it first came out i still feel it should known those who not enjoy this album it only because lack content you missing your brain , heart . i think d'angelo extremely talented ( but not so bright given his current status ) no matter what situation ability make hit album it 5 years sophomore or 10 . see what others lack content . artist out today quickly whipped up local talent shows or what you modified fabricated suite high school needs today society . d'angelo my generations smokey , al , gerald what you ... he legend . moreover , if you don't agree , just go put your back street boys or 112 ... ugh !	1
this significant improvement over mediocre uxo release . music herein moves compelling direction there internal logic what offer here sets them apart their own work well others like explosions sky knob-obsessed pelican . throughout progress tracks each disc there intriguing blend instrumentation , each passage rising organically foundations laid music progresses . i haven't heard this sophisticated stream musical consciouness since topographic days yes . while not overtly stravinsky-based anderson co , these canadians sense working much bigger canvas incredible array colours their palette . all it works . i found myself surprised when each disc ended . itself significant improvement over uxo . hopefully they shall survive working team . who knows what recognition gourmet magazine them . odd karmic twist band disdains its own success retailing efforts which it must concede . this release they establish themselves quite lot say musically dialogues among each other , i'm hoping discussion continues	1
i gave this cd lot chances . i honestly . i've it months now , but i honestly can't get into it . it not i haven't given it multiple listens feel its full , err , ' brilliance ' - it just pharrell , this album , not appeal me . i'll expand this my review . pharrell williams , we all know , one half super-producers , neptunes . i first heard neptunes ol ' dirty " got your money , " i liked their technique song . they also scored one . o . . . ' catchiest solo tracks , track " super thug , " which , while moderately annoying , still pretty decent track . fast forward few years , they're working likes jay-z snoop dogg - suddenly , everyone wants neptunes ' production . i'll quite honest , say i'm not much fan neptunes ' production techniques . i've always found most their production follows steady format - tropical beats , make you feel like you're literally living florida . fact , tropical production so authentic you nearly smell old people when listening neptunes ' typical production . sometimes they'll take different production , rely heavily drum-machines synthesizers ; tracks such this(drop it like it hot , grindin ' , mr. me too , etc ) , they succeed . otherwise , nearly all their tracks sound like rehash snoop dogg " beautiful , " which they also produced , it really makes me wonder why they're such popular demand . pharrell artist ? i very mixed feelings pharrell artist . while he actually dropped some tight guest raps other rappers ' songs , his rhyming shown off sparingly , i didn't know if i'd able tolerate entire album full rhymes like " elegible bachelor , million dollar boat ; that whiter than what spilling down your throat . " his flow interesting , he speaks much more softly than average emcee , so one his pros . pharrell singing ? honestly , i never liked pharrell crooner . his falsetto grates my nerves point i just skip track completely , entire track full nothing but pharrell singing , such " angel " (which i still can't even tolerate after multiple lessons ) , nearly like nightmare audio form me . i still gave pharrell chance despite these drawbacks , my harsh criticing him past . tracks i like " raspy **** " ( which features tight sample drop it like it hot hook ) , " keep it playa " slim thug , " take it off(dim lights ) , " " stay me " pusha-t clipse , " skateboard . presents : show you how hustle . " rest tracks , yes , all 11 them , no appeal me , even emcees like jay-z making guest appearances(and definitely below hov standards ; or average emcee , matter ) . two five tracks i liked only succeeded because guest appearance , however , other three genuine pharrell tracks i enjoyed . i give this chance , i want like it , no matter how ire i may neptunes ; honest , i don't want dislike neptunes much i , but their repetitive production work continues annoy me . this album nothing change my opinion neptunes , or pharrell , i consider quite unfortunate	-1
i read many years ago this first ever stereo cast album columbia . timing ( late 1956 ) would right . maybe someone who savvy recording history confirm or deny this . if you want see film verson ( also starring judy holiday ) it aired tcm once while . it last musical produced legendary arthur freed	1

ok go one most amazing albums past ten years . its got everything everyone ; funky , up-beat just plain fun songs , like ' c-c-c-cinnamon lips ' ' you're so damn hot ' ; ' don't take no crap no one ' anthems like ' get over it ' ' don't ask me ' ; even bittersweet tragic ballads ' shortly before end ' ' return ' . all-in-all , this disc brilliant , you would off your rocker not buy it	1
not only cole porter songs wonderful , but ella interpretation them gives them life . no one it like she . i this record album couldn't live without purchasing cd . i can't stop listening it	1
this really decent enough offering slim thug though folkz who up boss hog since way before houston became " tha spot " hip hop last year tell you he better material . far repackaging h-town sound mainstream , commercial release , " already platinum " solid consistent . " 3 kings " bun t.i. radio single most y'all probably heard ( it video too ) ... nice flows all three , but don't expect great variation topics content . you gotta know what expect what you're dealing , so those regards , it pretty easy appreciate this album strong if typical lp da south ( not meant insult ) . i'd buy this album ( again ) just track " diamonds " ... great bass , pulsating , syrupy beat highlighted slim baritone . that'll probably go down my all-time favorite slim thug track . he don't need chopped screwed ... dude voice chopped screwed ( lol ) . oh , don't sleep " miss mary .	1
i liked most song album . tracks " hold me down " , " ride you " , " want it " " stay me " my opinion , best tracks record !.. i recomended anyone likes pop music	1
if you're fan regular book musicals , this one not you !!! passion operetta style love triangle complex , poignant , beautiful . stephen sondheim brillaint score ties entrie musical together , which again helps him keep his genius status . clever weaving songs , scenes , , most interestingly , letters , make great cast album . performances , it females who own this show . marin mazzie glorious ever clara ( she even better ragtime ) , tony-winner donna murphy brings all emotion forward her portrayal fosca . those who used usual sondheim , this one may dissapoint . others , however , love this opera love	1
i own several jobim lps/cds . i love them all . this cd , however , my first real intro elis regina . i heard her once or twice brazillian compliations , never her own album . this cd highest artistry . songs , arrangements , chemistry , singing -- 360-degrees beautiful .	1

i got turned onto this album 2-3 years after it came out , it shot right up top my most-played list . thirteen years later , it still gets regular rotation my cd player car . this album stunningly good . if you like british soul/acid jazz vibe , this album you . album excellent start finish . i wish i could pick favorite song , but then i keep listing other favorites until i've listed every track album . other two d'influence albums " prayer 4 unity " " london " not measure up good 4 we , although prayer much much better than london , which i thought very weak . but please , if you don't already this album , it must you add it your collection	1
i first need say , if it weren't dvd all its features , anywhere but home would gotten three stars . i say this because , evanescence not sound good live they studio . cd : this contains audio rock band performance live paris . it also album most beautiful stand out track : " missing " . concert : overall sound balance this rock band way off this performance distorted guitars tend drown out anything form musical line . amy lee also her share troubles this performance . she sing her high loud notes pretty well , but her lower ones tend constant use pedal tones . late into performance , amy voice cracks even starts give out her . she however , know how work crowd . bands newer tracks well performed , covers they perform sound better than their own work . this good bad ; it shows evanescence play pretty well , but they need lot more practice playing live communicating each other live . best part this concert getting see beautiful amy lee perform add new very interesting introductions some band songs . awesome performances include : " thoughtless "" breathe no more "" farther away "" bring me life "" whisper " dvd features : this disc awesome because it so many features . it course evanescence performance paris . it also music videos " going under " , " bring me life " , " everybody fool " , " my immortal " . there also hidden video icon evanescence band symbol . when this activated , live performance " bring me life " played . disc also tons rehearsal , bloopers , road footage ; including evanescence tour seether . credits also audio evanescence newest track " missing " . anywhere but home interesting concert fun look into evanescence life , i recomend viewing it	1
hard one rate , but i ended up four stars you see . " money cigarettes " pretty good little album , even if it isn't one great , lost rock ' roll records . it its share good songs , though , times even bordering great , like rocking version sleepy john estes ' wonderful blues " everybody ought make change " fine " i've got rock ' roll heart " . music benefits star players like ry cooder veteran soul bassist donald " duck " dunn . couple clapton self-penned songs , like " shape you're " " pretty girl " pretty forgettable , slick 80s production doesn't help . but " ain't going down " fine rock ' roll song , " man overboard " groovy blues-rocker " man love " . great , simple yet effective blues riff one . clapton also covers classic " crosscut saw " , he band good job it , both vocally musically ( excellent rhythm guitar playing ) . all all , " money cigarettes " better than its reputation , even if it isn't " layla " . 3 1/2 stars . good enough	1
sinatra fan , i tell you this not represent his best output . i hate cynical but part me wonders if this album prompted desire squeeze just bit more cash out some tired old numbers . there no point getting sinatra re-record selection favourites - he too old his voice all but gone ( let face it ) . so why not get him croak few lines then fill gaps some lesser stars then market it duets album ? instrumental arrangements band itself great . but singing best uninteresting worst laughable . duet bono complete joke , one barbara streisand tedious uninspiring . fact , just only one all enjoyable duet summer wind julio iglesias . no , this not good album third-rate quality it highlighted rumour sinatra pre-recorded his bits others filled gaps later . i find very easy believe . there so many good sinatra albums collections around , so why would you bother this offering ? go listen him his prime	-1
son conductor , player arranger during struggling period mine closures uk , i would say this excellent cd introduce listener into subtlety brass music . striking arrangement jerusalem full-tilt william tell overture this cd gathers so much into such small space . i am happy add this my collection other grimethorpe vinyl , , even if you don't think you brass/silver band fan , i guarantee you there something here you love	1

lot greatest hits cd offer five or six great songs few lesser known hits or some filler . this collection hits alan jackson absolutely marvelous . it captures him his fresh prime during early 1990 number 1 hit after number 1 hit . there 20 cuts here there isn't bad song anywhere . my favorites : don't rock jukebox , chasin ' neon rainbow , tall tall trees , love got hold you , dallas etc . etc . well , you get idea . this one greatest " greatest hits " cds any genre . time prove this cd essential purchase what high quality neo-traditional country music all . sound also knockout .	1
this one albums people dream . i usually tire listening same thing over over but this my rotation now 3 months . every song reeking brilliance definately force reckoned	1
given some unfairly low reviews i opted rounding up . no one going putting paul wall up there nas , but say man ain't good words just ignoring his talents out distaste his subject matter , frankly , his appearance . notice who shows up most often other people cuts now out still tippin ' crew . mike jones showed up badd it . slim thug few , paul wall showing up jim jones , nelly , game , i don't know how many others . back cd , i'm reviewing mixtape version this , so there few extra tracks order isn't quite same but it all still there . now , yeah , paul wall tendency say " what it " lot we already know he likes sip oil show off his grill . so why this cd worth listening ? because if you're fan wordplay actual rapping , there lot like here . he got great knack words even when retreading subjects he phrase it new way . not everyone going talk political issues like nas talib kweli , frankly if they there wouldn't much just cruise . i sometimes think people complaining this cd poor sound systems so they only really hope words make interesting stories . this cd you pump into your subs ride . one thing makes paul wall extra impressive his skin color never part what he raps . even my personal favorite white boy rapper , haystak , tends push almost forefront ( note : white boy trilogy , though i consider him far better lyricist ) . he not around because he white , he not treated like white boy trying rap game , he just there like everyone else swishahouse crew . top songs ( since this all anyone cares ): - sittin ' sidewayz- march step- they don't know- trillbuy it , don't worry how ridiculous cd cover looks	1

i thought movie good points ( action dead what sometimes happen trucks cars accidents ) bad ( theme not all drivers bad ) . i'm trucker sometimes other drivers don't think before they things or worse they figure we all those wheels so we more brakes . not true . i liked movie because it gave people different perspective . sound track gotten me through many long miles long hours .

although i'm hard time understanding lyrics , musically these guys sound like softer , more accessible strokes . right now i'm listening track #2 " consolation prizes " , i really like rhythm this track . rousing drums guitars real americana rock sound you don't hear much these days . vocals , while not so original , not grating or overproduced . i hear some electronic synths , but they're used moderation . nothing this album over-produced or overdone . nice blend catchy tunes quirky lyrics . overall catchy easy listen album this french foursome . well	1

remember style music came out late 70 called punk ? pioneers this type music bands such clash , sex pistols , ramones talking heads . style becamse somewhat funk-influenced gut-wrentching hardcore metal influenced sounds dead kennedies ministry . even social distortion their own little sound offer . this how it went through 80 . yet , after who nirvana-mania saved music whitesnake warrent , punk , well many other sounds , seemed lost until ... green day comes around " dookie . " this continued punk sound into what we know today . so words oasis : " where it all go wrong . " it not this sounds it own bad . when blink 182 first came out , they lot fun offer . but gawd , where we draw line ? after , we ( no particular order ) sum 41 , new found glory , my chemical romance , showoff , jeez , i could go forever . they all sound so much alike . still they once tolerable . but simple plan , ( sigh ) , enough enough . i can't even tell difference sometimes these guys bowling soup . i don't easily confuse bands . really , though , these guy call themselves punk . but last time i checked , punk rebellion , anarchy , disatisfaction where humanity going , all stuff . ex sex pistols " anarchy uk " or ramones " i'm against it . " now listen some titles off this : " i'm just kid , " " god must hate me , " " i'd anything .

i can't work out what this band trying . there elements metal , punk , riot grrl , grunge , all which handled most rudimentary way . if music inconsequential you all you're looking cute unconventional singer worship , then jack off jill may band you . if you're looking good tunes you won't find them here .	-1

there just one little problem ... this not opra . least , not " tommy " originally presented . opera involves live performance including acting , costuming , stagecraft , singing actors character ... sometimes even dancing . rock band could conceivably perform cantata or oratorio , but not opera . not themselves . so call " tommy " first rock oratorio . it tells story spiritual message ( handel " messiah , " also oratorio , shares these features ) not really demand staging ( though film oliver reed ann-margaret pretty successful ) . this musicological tirade aside , i remember very thrilled old 2-lp set when i bought it hot off shelves spring 1969 . listened it more recently , it holds up very well . best songs power beauty apart whole concept , but course make more sense context . one need not follower meher baba ( townshend ) appreciate message - we all deaf , dumb /or blind ( or least asleep ) much time . apart , music really rocks . keith moon drumming seldom more expressive , pete guitar work ( mostly acoustic ) quite original time . daltrey gets little shrill times my taste , but lower register he powerful . " tommy " therefore excellent songs , fine playing , philosophical message ... probably most successful fully-realized concept album 1960s	1
this album , almost everyone knows , one new order least critically acclaimed albums . reasons very simple -- aside few more experiments drum machines , there seems virtually no new territory covered their time joy division . when you barney taking ian place , it only seems get worse . but you must consider this released year after closer . course , joy division grew leaps bounds their punk days unknown pleasures , thence closer , but this level growth could not maintained any band , especially one lost their lead singer only year before . they should applauded " moving " -- what movement all . what music ? if you fan joy division music , you likely fan this ; i hear distinct echoes ( but not rehashes ) " atrocity exhibition , " " komakino , " " insight , " " decades . " if you fan new order early singles or power , corruption lies , you probably like this , too , certain tracks looking forward " blue monday " " age consent . " this album very , even surprisingly , enjoyable despite its historically lukewarm negative reviews -- it both martin hannett atmospheric , moody mix some experiments electronica joy division already starting experiment . if anything , energy brilliance movement should convince anyone joy division not ian curtis solo act ( undoubtedly important he ) . if this viewed critics debut ( which it arguably ) instead disappointing follow-up closer , it would fair reception it deserves	1
this album introduced edwin mccain world , it wonderful amalgam rock , blues , jazz , featuring acoustic electric guitars perfectly blended saxophones woodwinds , layered edwin beautfully powerful voice . there no other album out there this particular sound . if you ever loved edwin mccain song , then you simply must get this album . unfortunately , woodwinds abruptly disappeared his next few albums , only reappear latest " scream whisper " . you'll appreciate them here	1
cover this album describes it ' leave-taking british folk revival 1970-1977 ' indeed period worth commemorating . this collection , sadly , not it justice . there only 13 tracks ( only 9 artists , 4 them appear twice ) what there no way represents best period . watersons great group , but lal waterson , singing solo two these tracks , painfully out tune . other performers this album fine , well worth listen , but you find them all better represented other albums . i realize this selection restricted recordings trailer label , but i cannot believe this best they could . both quality quantity lacking . sad leave-taking indeed .	-1

before you dismiss me stupid hater , hear me out . i personally think omarion reasonably good singer one helluva great dancer , but i swear god this one worst albums i've ever heard . this album entirely deprived emotional depth there not shred originality sight or -more importantly- sound . you've got love , sex below-average club bangers , but nothing beyond ! if there anything annoys me more than fact i bothered taking time listen this near-worthless junk , it knowing omarion fans groupies insane enough blow their hard-earned cash propel this album into #1 spot billboard album top 200 ! says alot musical standards nowadays . however , there some bright spots album show hints true potential omarion . " i wish " beautiful slow jam wishing he never fell love his certain girl , while omarion hit single , titled " o " , any girl melting slowly they listen his smooth vocals , regardless unoriginal subject matter . " touch " also highlight , combining catchy , simplistic , danceable beats smooth vocals unoriginal subject matter ( this case , lust sex ) . then again , most club bangers don't need much substance , so it no big deal this case . i personally think this track deserved more success . oh yeah , better not forget " growing pains " , touching song explains omarion break-up former hit rb/pop group b2k ! however , 3 great tracks 1 above-avergae track ( touch ) not enough save this album falling apart . rest this album utter garbage ( put it lightly ) , anyone least 1/2 brain realize how tragic this album really . omarion needs put more thought substance into his music before anybody truly begins take him seriously ! i hope omarion improves if he decides make 2nd solo album , but until then , definitely skip this !! nb : case anybody wondering why i bothered review album i consider so bad , it because i feel nobody , i mean nobody , should wasting their hard-earned cash such ridicious , mentally corruptive bubblegum cr*p like this . not only , but omarion doesn't deserve success his album got . there obviously many more artists out there who more deserving success than omarion terms solo career	-1

i found myself listening 30 seconds each song then skipping it . it nothing new . it not it bad cd , it just not very good . songs little more fast paced " pop-ish . " overall , cd departure her typical style . i felt kind like i put 50 cents soda machine coca-cola dr. pepper came out instead .	-1
however , all good material early 90 coming out i suckered into listening just every little thing . this some rather blah songs it , thing they try sound like everyone , but themselves . " dead bloated " they try sound like danzig , " sex type thing " which best song whole album they sound like alice chains , " wicked garden " " plush " they sound like pearl jam , probably only song they sound like themselves " creep " , this one i some rather bad memories this i remember this one songs i heard all time when i first moved down florida . i moved down no job , or no car , i bored out my skull , no social life either , no one seemed speak one . lyrics go " feeling uninspired ... think i'll start fire " . now i down florida full time i wasn't good time , i know even now listening this song makes me remember those hard first few months down here if they yesterday , it because times i feel it . everything else this album too perverted , or just too long-winded .	-1
its very likely mxpx never out-do their masterpiece " life general " . thats alright though , because they'll still put out quality cd such this one . building " ever passing moment " its more mature but still retains energy enthusiasm their previous cds . there many great , memorable songs here : " play it loud " deserves exactly , its perfect song crank up rock out . single " everything sucks " also standout cd " it alright " , " you make me , me " , " well adjusted " " capitol " . but i wouldn't say there bad song this cd , just couple aren't up par rest . but its solid rock cd , just don't expect " life general " or " teenage politics " .	1

this first cd i ever owned , bought me christmas present back 1993 when i 13 , i still listen it regular basis . when i younger i mostly just liked music because i liked movie , but i've grown older , i've gotten appreciate melodies emotions i feel when i listen i t.t he soundtrack composed two different composers , trevor jones randy edelman . edelman stepped finish soundtrack after jones unable complete his work due commitment film , but songs mesh together so well , you hardly tell difference work two . my two favorite songs album " kiss " " i find you " . if you ever loved instrumental music , pick this album up . you won't sorry	1

many self-proclaimed " indie people " tell you this hands down , best album belle sebastian . i've concluded through years dealing people like this they purposely choose obscure odd-sounding music claim it " awesome " try showcase themselves more understanding knowledgable music than you could ever . those people love this album more than other ones . don't get me wrong , this good album . but it much softer , times , simply weirder than 2 albums i enjoy , " boy arab strap " " tigermilk . " people love this album tell you those records bad , their reasoning basically boils down fact those albums instantly accessible enjoyable their face . you get immediate gratification listening those albums . this one , i feel like i am straining enjoy it way i enjoy those . i shouldn't feel like . musical elitists tell you otherwise	1
best schoolhouse rock ! audio cd : original titles orignial recordings . also recommended those car rides where you sing your kids . my oldest not exposed week yet , but already sing several parts . rating : 4.5 /5this collection " some schoolhouse rock songs made throughout 70s 80s . i think it great nostalgic educational point view . although , looking back it i never realized my innocent days there touch marlo thomas boy-bashing it . dr. james dobson wrote excellent book called " bringing up boys " , which i would recommend any mom or dad . read this book , you see subtle colorations schoolhouse rock ! put boys down . nonetheless , i like it basic education components , i remember many those songs ( even before we bought this , i teaching my kids ' 3 ' times tables ' 3 magic number ' song ) .	1
i've never understood slagging this album got most but not all quarters . its peaks outstrip anything face dances or new , truly lame endless wire ( pete lost his melodic muse , i'm afraid ) , compares very well who numbers who you ? some songs stand townshend best , including athena , known no war , one life enough , utterly amazing why i fall ?, which simply one best townshend songs who performances . entwistle turns some his best writing band well , it your turn dangerous . yes , there few turkeys ( cook county , one day time , excrable eminence front ) , but great songs make it worthy who album , imo	1
first track this album leaf house completely blew me away . i sat awe listen it 5 times row it even begin sink . times , its alot take . highly psychadelic extremely beautiful	1
if you're wondering whether or not buy this album , i settle your mind . you should definitely buy it . band sound this distinct only arrives every couple years . only parallel i draw 60 group chambers brothers ( hence psychedelic soul reference this review title . ) when you receive it mail , you may disappointed first . i suggest putting " dreams " ( track 3 ) repeat letting it sink . then move " staring sun " ( 2 ) , don't love you ( 7 ) ambulance ( 5 . ) album it sub-par moments , which mostly lie- i think- production . it prompted my friend remark it sounded " un-finished . " debut album , however , it surely sounds better than most , particularly considering stylistic boundaries crossed- their future albums promise very interesting indeed . if you disappointed increasingly cookie-cutter , formatted indie music released world , you find this album very satisfying release frustration .	1

god it soo perfect i cant even begin describe . every dayevery night starts " line allows progress , circle not " , song also holds album title inside its gracefull lyrics ; " this feeling always used pass , but now it every day every night . " it song someone who forgot purpose her life , someone totally lost alone , nothing but get drunk looking exit desperately . they always ; conors lyrics tell story natural , mournful way lyrics haunt you whenever you hear them your ordinary life . song pass you its haunting guitar melodies probably leave you questioning your own life , possibly tears your eyes .. then , you think if connor ever anything more touching then this one , " perfect sonnet " begin . believe me no words i say enough tell you how touching , moving , rocking , devastating this song !! song gets slower faster over over , it make you think each line connor tells , each section ; which dagger your heart , you may cry over over screaming this song nights thinking everything you wrong everything you've lost all your life . t classic bright eyes song , what i say ?!!! " then comes my way work " song questioning passing life death , way you dont really wanna like thinking abou t.t he song not great overall , but it still bright eyes , it quality turn you upside down moment you least expect , some line you've missed out before , or some piece melody you havent noticed ... new arrangement ; it resembles arienette , one greatest bright eyes song ever;it not good arienette but it like passage , preparation i t.t he most this ep resembles feversmirrors , so if it released just before it , it'd make total sense . last song , i didnt got into it yet , never even listened it all my ears but i'm sure sime time now i'll really see what song it'll effect me just like all others time . final , important note .. yes ; bright eyes songs not songs listen just , like . you need ready songs things he'll say you , otherwise they probably not make sense . i see some people giving low stars bright eyes telling not great musician or lyricist we all say , they blame him pretending sad . i just want say i know , these people just not ready , or not strong enough him , sadly some them never . but if you one those deep people , still confused way life works ends , or figuring out how love matters give meaning it all , buy this ep .. you'll not regret i promise	1

back twenty or more years ago lacy . dalton sang 16th avenue , superb country song unknowns seeking their musical fortune nashville . one verse this lyric : ah , but then one night some empty roomwhere no curtains ever hung like miracle some golden words rolled off someone tonguewell , that train . they miracle drops jupiter who knows where it came , but come it , like slap face always remained fabulous every overplayed-on-the-radio hearing .

it seems listeners don't understand this album not greg dulli , nor it fila brazillia . it entirely new synergistic beast , this why it not called " fila brazillia plays dulli " or something like . this one few albums i listen hours upon hours , this entirely result experimentation , collective vision , superb analogy lyric , instrumentation production . somehow , twilights able combine racking heartache betrayal appropriate bittersweetness create masterpiece ephemera . i constantly feel after listening i lost something deep inside -- but found marrow myself nevertheless . songs abounding soundtrack i play inside my head , tracks twilight invariably pop up out blue , i find myself humming hours . it truly complex album too -- i'm always finding note here or there i never noticed , without which songs wouldn't quite same -- hallmark excellent work . quite frankly , this beautiful album true unfettered emotion -- layering sounds only serves further amplify -- segues fantastic , rivaling perhaps second side abbey road . irony here album ability make you feel if you're falling love despite lyrics such " tell me where you . " again , bittersweetness always leaves me wanting more	1
many kylie fans either hate or love this album , i am one few love it . it nothing but pure pop , no emotions or meaningful lyrics ... just fun , sexy dance music you groove . alot songs sound like those fillers very addictive fun , but no real impression . this type cd you listen while cleaning around house or driving your car some friends background music . i personally love it . there few real treasures though i believe some kylie best ..

this one best ambient compilations i've ever heard , which surprising since most artists relatively unknown . consistency this album remarkable , only one mediocre track entire album . stand out tracks include . o . .

every year christmas , people listen christmas music watch christmas movies , while most people like peaceful christmas music , lot people like parody christmas music , anytime you want good , funny album parody christmas music , you should turn bob rivers . rivers hillarious , usually every year christmas ( last year rivers not release cd ) he release album parody christmas music . " twisted christmas " lot fun . only dissapointment this cd short , four minute skit " visit st. nicholson " , which just not very funny . rest album hillarious , topics like hangovers christmas , wrecking malls , restroom doors talking , dressing up like santa when you get out parole just plain funny . " twisted christmas " released 1987 , some music parodies this cd sound very 80 . i think i like bob rivers ' christmas music better than i like peaceful christmas music	1

john coltrane one my favorite musicians . i would give almost everything he recorded five stars . " afro blue impressions " recording really turned me trane first place , one i've listened most over years . every tune outstanding , but i particularly love " my favorite things . " this version completely different studio recording , much faster tempo , extending over 20 minutes . mccoy solo one his best , trane playing phenomenal . times he sounds like two saxophonists engaged duet . this john coltrane quartet their finest , which means it some greatest art ever produced any medium . i agree some other reviewers who criticized sound quality these two discs , but music more than makes up it . any coltrane collection incomplete without " afro blue impressions .	1
this amazing collection covers man minute midnight his life , just heartbreakingly beautiful . it like he understands exactly where he , where he going , he made peace journey . listening johnny cash , you get feeling he understands every bit pain you're experiencing - he like older brother who you go when you've dumped your girlfriend , he'll tell you everything going all right , even though she go off bloke , after telling you she loved you so many times . but it fine . johnny cash my older brother these past few days . i'm glad he there me . he someone i actually trust . his advice kept me going . god bless you , johnny	1

edwin mccain plays intelligent pop music . he appeals those good music taste while playing basic structure acoustic pop songs . what it ? maybe it his voice , fabulous . maybe it his simple songs world , written just enough creative spin make words interesting . but , whatever it , he great it . far this particular cd , it not going bring him any more popularity . there no standout single it , which probably means no radio time edwin . but , if you enjoyed his past efforts , you'll find more same this album . if you're first time listener , pick up " messenger .	1
this compilation features some wwe wrestlers performing their own songs . just fact alone , this cd doomed failure . let face it , these guys can't sing !!!!!! only tracks that're even worth listening dudley boyz ' '' we've enough '' , john cena '' basic thuganomics '' , chris jericho '' don't you wish you me '' . everything else just laughable attempts making music . stone cold skits , which stuck songs , quite funny . because music stupefyingly bad much it running time , you could almost say it so bad it funny . if you like wwe music , buy '' themeaddict '' instead .	-1

jazz , rb , rock , soul , funk , pop music all existed before 1982 , but when this album came out , it literally combined all elements paved way what music today . recordings performances worldwide sales recognition , jackson set standards it all . hundreds years now , this still looked back quite possibly one finest albums ever recorded . while quincy maintained his masterful touch all recordings , jackson lent his timeless compositions " wanna startin ' somethin '" , " beat it " , " billie jean " , songs literally become signature songs 1980s , showed world just how musical michael could . aside those recordings , master songwriter rod temperton ( " rock you " , " off wall " , " always forever " ) rb soulman james ingram contributed their own unique tracks , well . " thriller " " p.y.t. " , every song here literally changed course music whole . while some maintained there far better albums music history catalogue , i yet come across any much quality , energy , diversity , versatility this one . masterpiece	1

culture club may gotten attention largely due antics its gender-bending lead singer boy george , but group released some truly great songs back its day . sometimes dismissed fluffy cross pop , reggae , motown , culture club records soul , thanks smokey-like voice boy george . quot ; time , quot ; quot ;d o you really ... quot ; quot ; church poison mindquot ; all surface this hits collection , which compiles group hits well some solo material george . curiously , this album skips unfairly maligned quot ; waking up house fire , quot ; which decent quot ; war songquot ; quot ; mistake no . 3 , quot ; neither which here . i guess george grown embarrassed this disc , which flopped 1984 signaled demise group popularity . moving solo stuff , best quot ; everything i ownquot ; pet shop boys production quot ; crying game . quot ; more interesting club-oriented jams he released under his alias jesus loves you . all all , this disc covers considerable ground recommended , but i dock one star not including singles quot ; waking up ... quot	1
" howl " comes so close good . they capture real authentic " backporch " sound , great production . lyrics passable , singing isn't too obnoxiously affected . but there just aren't any good songs here . it like when you meet someone who dresses well , seems share some common interests , make small talk like champ . but then when you finally try substantial conversation you realize they thoroughly uninteresting , just sort suck all around . well , it musical equivalent . they set great vibe beer drinking , sitting porch , etc . just like tape whales calling each other really gives you authentic ocean feel . but nice they sound , whales don't write good music niether black rebel motorcycle club . alot people see music primary function providing nice background . i'm sure they'll pretty happy this cd . also , lot people lifeless zombies no souls .	-1

i looking billboard hot 100 last year like i every week , one point i noticed song making moves " grind me " pretty ricky . i never heard song , after i listened it , i wished i still hadn't heard song . i don't know what possessed me listen full-length album , bluestars , but i , well , i couldn't get cd out my stereo fast enough . i agree reviewer hakeem when he said all these five-star reviews must people group street team or something . pretty ricky consists four people : three rappers ( spectacular , diamond " baby blue " , slick -- i use term " rapper " loosely ) one singer ( pleasure ) . problem this album these horniest most talentless guys i ever heard , terrible combination . lead single " grind me " really called " grind me " , it one nastiest things i ever heard , but " playhouse " isn't far behind . " nothing but number " very , very statutory . also annoying their use dated lyrics , like " if lovin ' you wrong , i don't wanna right " " grind me " , or " if i'm lyin ' , i'm flyin '" " grill `em " ( what even mean , anyway ? ) . guys also habit continually yelling certain adlibs , like " back ! " " get little closer " , " yes , sir ! " " your body " . also , while pleasure singing isn't horrible , it hard listen after all wack rapping . actually , his chorus " shorty mine " sure cause you displeasure . speaking song , things equally unimpressive when guys don't talk sex , like " never let you go " , " can't live without you " , obligatory bling-blingin ' songs " chevy " " grill `em " . but long run i guess all doesn't matter because nobody cares pretty ricky any more my brother said , they're probably now back working wendy . if i ever come across bluestars cd again , words " your body " , dammit , i'll beat it up . anthony ruper	-1
overall , i think this best adiemus works . symphonic overtones add greatly richness songs	1
most singers scream mountaintops heard . others strategically position themselves taken seriously . but maysa leak , vocalist underexposed incognito , grace oozes so effortlessly , her peers must scrambling wonder how she able it . her solo debut isn't going make anyone forget incognito , but it solid album shows she able stand her own . disc mix jazz-laced soul never makes leaps bounds make statement ( heads up , alicia keyes ) doesn't stray too far her past work incognito . like kite windy october afternoon , it soars ease . favorte tracks mine quot ; black heaven , quot ; quot ; we change world ?, quot ; quot ; peace mind . quot ; maybe , one day , mainstream catch up maysa find out what it missing all these years	1
absolutly my children all-time favorite cd car ! children under three may bit young appreciate it , but once they get " sing-a-long " age they'll hooked . my kids three five when we got it , just right . though now getting " cool " ages 10 12 , they still pull this one out occasionally . theme album musical journey through buyou country , mc'ed conductor " zydeco express . " tracks he talks music songs . some reviewers felt their children didn't like or appreciate this part , but i believe they soak more it than we realize , evidenced my kids ' recall some details years later . it great introduction fun genre music	1

i first heard incubus when listening my halo 2 soundtrack . there four incubus instrumentals it , needless say , they great . so christmas i got " crow left murder . " first it difficult get into , but later i enjoyed it whole lot . incubus most unique rock band i ever heard before . their sound differs nearly every other band out there . cool thing incubus lyrics ; yes , occasionally you'll get f-word few songs , but listen lyrics--they're great ! incubus focuses multiple aspects music enhance their quality , they great job . i say right now there one track aclotm i not like all -- zee deveel . i dunno why , i guess it just didn't sound all good . other hand , its lyrics pretty good . multiple songs aclotm get points across . megalomaniac shout-out people who think they're above society . talk shows mute criticizes annoying prresence talk shows . souther girl love song . each song some sort meaning . they also all sound different . which great thing incubus : they don't restrict themselves hard rock . they aren't afraid experiment other songs . sure , you metal songs like megalomaniac priceless , but then you slower tracks such agoraphobia , southern girl , my room , talk shows mute , made tv movie . then there " in-the-middle " rock tracks like crow left murder , leech , sick sad little world , beware ! criminal , pistola . then course you strange song zee deveel . this cd totally worth listening . it one most unique albums out there , i highly recommend after you get this one , get morning view make yourself well .	1

projekt delivers compilation cd , but this time twist . what i like most this collection songs style which they delivered ... cabaret . i particularly like revue noir black tape blue girl tracks , i also find it very nice see rozz williams track this cd , which came quite surprise . overall , i think this fairly good cd , especially if you looking something different listen . my only complaint i wish it more tracks . but only six bucks , you can't beat price 45 minutes worth music . they say you get what you pay , but this case projekt delivers way more than expected . bottom line : if you like dresden dolls , you like this compilation . buy it now	1

this album 5 star album anyhow but this dvd audio just blew me away . songs like grey walls , backlash love affair you dream too much sound like brand new recordings . i mean i heard guitar tracks i never new existed . mitchell froom much criticized production works very well here hearing it 5.1 surround experience all itself . very well !!!! addition excellence this fine dvd audio you also get two bonus video tracks , i misunderstood i feel so good , which thompson amusing attempt more mainstream/mtv-ish so maybe larger audience could attracted , nonetheless it nice extra any thompson fan . this dvd audio convinced me see out more , it impressive	1
one or two hip-hop flavored tracks here kinda hamper soul this album , but there vintage omar songs here more than make up it . check out tracks your mess , get it together , feeling you(stevie it ! ) , my absolute maybe all-time omar favorite , ghana emotion , gem murders just every song i heard this year . this definitely worth buying make sure you grab prior works total omar experience .	1

hombres mujeres de todas razas ( pero del mismo coraz�n)- ' re ' es un disco que tienen que comprar . lo compr� hace un a�o ( antes de ir m�xico por primera vez ) ahora es uno de mis discos preferidos . �por qu� ? es una mezcla graciosa de estilos - hay punk , mariachi , tango - hay algo para todos , pero creo que esta m�sica no gustar�a tu madre . this album appeared so many lists ' latino all-time greats ' i buy it . caf� tacuba band same vein ' talking heads'- there something manic music , when you hear this album first time it doesn't make comfortable listening ; indeed whenever music faintly mellow you realise these boys sending up certain genre it soon going turn weird . however , immortal words dr hunter thompson ; ' when going gets weird , weird turn pro . ' this album really works . mocked sentimentality tango mariachi they laugh absurdity punk then move re-invent some other musical genre . they perhaps ultimate post-modernist rock band they deserve better known anglo-saxon world . so it came huge - thought not unexpected - disappointment find myself practically only gringo audience , when i finally caught up them shepherds bush empire other week , when they gave one funniest performances i ever experienced : they sent up boy-bands one stage elfego buend�a , vocalist now calls himself , even donned wrestler mask ! great band , new album ' cuatro caminos ' pretty damn good too . if you make it mexico city , don't miss caf� de tacuba , calle de tacuba , just north z�calo . they serve excellent breakfast .	1

i am normally not fan classical " greatest hits " type albums , but i make deserved exception this cd . this cd excellent introduction all different styles mozart famous ; it slightly over 75 minutes music contained its 25 tracks . selections largely well chosen , although nitpicky i would preferred slightly more representation his sublime horn concertos . said , i unabashedly recommend this cd anyone who wants good overall overview works mozart . my particular favorites cd " marriage figaro " , " magic flute " , horn concerto number 3 e-flat " , , course always beautiful " symphony number 40 minor . " amazing thing this cd actually not music presented , but unbelievably low asking price cd , particularly considering recording quality excellent little no background noise detectable , even fairly high volume . this cd highly recommended anyone .	1

little help my friends exceptional debut joe cocker . it contains wonderful mix covers few originals , title cut rips beatles ' original shreds any day . also not missed cocker rendition " don't let me misunderstood " , sung sound like it coming at-heart pacifist who occasionally loses his cool other people . pointing out other highlights pointless , this album should taken whole	1

owner every single chill/lounge music cd i am aware , this biggest dissapointment long time . chillout 2001 thru chillout 8 very good comparison . this cd not complete disaster , however , i could not find one song worthy 5/5 star rating . quite few 4/5 star songs however , lots 2-3 star songs . some better songs repeated older chill discs or present other series lounge discs . i think people rated this 4 or 5 stars don't own lot lounge/chill probably lot easier please . i'm very dissapointed . maybe this ' genre ' all dried up ! :) oh well ... i highly recomend any cds this set before this one . fact , chillout sessions 7 superb !!!	-1

when searching recordings south pacific , i first got original broadway cast mary martin ezio panza . while two outstanding , recording itself wornout , fuzzy , limp . i next bought 2-disc 1997 studio cast recording , which complete expertly . i thought enough , untill i heard rave reviews over this recording . it indeed surpasses every expectation . book restructured make story flow better become much more powerful . this comes out recording . two added songs , cut original , " my girl back home " superb " now time " , make recording priceless . but shining glory cd philip quast fresh invigorating lauren kennedy . lauren turned already amazing , complex , just plain fun character nellie into fresh new woman filled spirit joy beyond belief . no matter how many recordings south pacific you , no matter how many times you've or seen show , this recording bring you new perspective newly amazing masterpiece musical theatre	1
i just love lead guitar work " desolation row . " lead guitar punches up dylan voice those surreal lyrics make this song like no other . i shudder whole eleven minutes every time my husband plays this song he plays it lot . you never get tired this . mr. dylan really raised bar this one . " like rolling stone " rocker extrodinaire it goes six minutes , which big deal when it came out , because most hit records never when over something like three minutes , ten seconds . dylan really broke mold " stone " , opened up scene others record long songs . this super cd . one you just own	1
i all buddha bar cd this my favorite far . this one i play most often . it just takes you away world	1
altough this album came out many years ago , choas organized madness layers this piece still overwhelm even most hardcore tablist heads . even those outside scratch community more " public music " mindset appriciate it concept album it may still not understand audio album unless they accompany dvd film spawned album . this cd .... lack better comparison , hip hops " tommy " , its " rocky horror picture show " , or even " wall " really praise this piece . say it so few words , this not hip-hop concept album . but rather , it hip-hop epic .	1
context : first todd snider album i heard happy here 2000 . i thought " how come this guy isn't more widely known ? " while listening -- twelve or thirteen tracks -- some rock , some blues , some melancholy , among all several gems , most particularly , d.b. cooper . sardonic , tough himself easy target others his music , he reminded me randy newman , most especially , john prine . now songs daily planet comes across my scope , bringing it some partial answer my question , snider same place six years ago -- uptempo my generation skewers , well , his generation . easy money bluesy account trying get what you haven't earned . me , bit self-pity road song . turn it up , life bad , play music loud , classic this cd , you think you know somebody , far more effective take child abuse than luka whose royalties still paying suzanne vega rent . i heard these songs after i heard happy here so they seem faintly derivative . but course it other way round overall , this slightly better collection than happy here , but d.b. cooper still pick hit me	1
if you're exploring ska , five iron frenzy , or christian music general , buy this album . i garuntee you you enjoy this album immensely . this far my favorite five iron frenzy album . light-hearted , upbeat , yet superbly well written played . they give off vibe lets-just-scream-our-heads-off-and-have-fun punk band , but they all extremely good musicians , their talent shows quality their music	1

this motherlode pre-war blues reissues . it likely jsp finest release date . paramount started business wisconsin furniture manufacturer late 1800 but figured demand record playing machines ensconced wood cabinets would create new market shellac vinyl records well . spite their hamfisted business practices ( paramount bankrupt 1930 ) , they managed get whole lot fabulous afro-american talent record their label ( thanks talent scout . mayo williams ) , likes charley patton , meade lux lewis , bo weevil jackson , bumble bee slim , moanin ' bernice edwards , little brother montgomery , roosevelt sykes , charlie spand , papa charlie jackson , course , peerless geeshie ( geechie ) wiley . if you've never heard her " eagles half " , you deserve listen it now . this set 100 titles some rarest blues ever recorded just $25 . some 78 which this collection dubbed , sell collector market hundreds , even thousands dollars shot . spite poor quality shellac paramount pressed their music , virtuosity this music still comes through some 80 years later . get it . you won't regret it . similar material worthy this set contained yazoo records " stuff dreams made " , revenant records " american primitive , vols 1 2 " .	1
i looked forward this album number my favorite songs it but i disappointed songs like " hard times " " lady margaret " not sung all way end . both left off two thirds way through song . i mean if you aren't going sing complete song , why bother	-1
if you know nothing particular jazz cd but see art blakey drums , you bet it'll good one ( you say same thing jimmy cobb ) . this lineup features big names freddie hubbard wayne shorter , also well-regarded curtis fuller , cedar walton , jymie merritt . lineup promising , songs very solid . they seem pretty even me , i don't want name best worst songs , because my opinion hardly set into stone . there also bonus versions four six songs . original album 40 minutes decent length . thing makes this 4-star cd there aren't any great songs , they're merely all good . if it song like " egyptian " or " moanin '" , it'd 5-star cd	1

jeff lynne wanted quit recording albums under elo name some time . he felt formula elo limiting his abilities songwriter/producer . he stepped forward fine final album . " balance power " handful terrific songs including great " calling america " . this exapnded edition features alternate mixes " heaven only knows " introduction ( put separate track)that missing final album " secret lives " (an alternate take ) better than final released versions my opinion . " sorrow fall " alternate mix album track . we also get two sublime b-sides " destination unknown " " caught trap " . songs previous released first elo boxed set but rightfully regain their place next stronger tracks this nex t-t o-last elo album . when lynne would return elo only richard tandy would play " zoom " . here band trio lynne , long time drummer bev bevan ( who also member move lynne only member every album elo except " zoom " )and long-time collaborator richard tandy playing keyboards sythesizer strings . lynne plays both guitar bass . although production use electronic drums date album , they add charm album . while this far my favorite elo album , lynne best qualities songwriter -- strong sense melody , creative arrangements production touches dominate album . you also hear influence steve windwood " arc diver " " back high life again " richard tandy playing sythesizer similar sound winwood popular singles those albums . i'd give " balance power " 3 1/2 stars addition alternate mixes/versions inclusion two fine b-sides .	1
this skip spence oar cd really bad . hear other peoples reviews it sounded like best thing world . its no wonder why this album flop when it came out . thirty five years later it not any better .	-1
my favorite new song this new indigo girls collection " let me go easy , " wonderfully engaging meaningful songthat i keep going back again again . i avidlistener their music ten years now , i own all their studio albums , well several other collections . even this background , this song risen near top my favorites list . not missed!i've heard bootleg version " finlandia , " but version isnot nearly beautifully realized rendition included this collection . wonderful track ! " uncle john band , " which , although available perhaps other sources , not part my collection before getting this , really enjoyable song . i especially likethe pacing vocal line , " i live silver mine /and collect berrys too . " i haven't chance thoroughly digest cd yet , butother tracks stand out me so far " mona lisas mad hatters , " " i don't wanna talk it " " clampdown " ( chillingly relevant bush his ilk so much power ) . there least three songs i would loved seen included here , though : " blood quantum , " " letter eve " " wisteria . " they included , my rating probably would five stars . if you longtime indigo listener , don't miss this one . you really want " let me go easy " wonderfullyrendered " finlandia " especially .	1

much fan i claim this group , i gotten into them around early 2002 . i high school sophomore home listening music choice channel when i heard " run wild " come . when song finished , i imediately left my house walked store buy this album . judging this all others i've heard , this tha ( alkaho)liks first shot mainstream group , especially their first single " best u " produced neptunes . results : mixed feedback hardcore fans this group . this my first album , so i really no say whether it good or bad . besides two tracks i named out , second track " bar code " featuring xzibit ( who i hoped kissed made up this group ) slammin track . this album , this trio doing three things : making party music , like " l-i-k-s " " sickness " some those tracks ; showing off their lyrical skills like they've previous albums like " promote violins " featuring kurupt , " bubble " featuring king . ; humorous " 40 oz quartet " . there aren't many things i mad this album . some guests like busta rhymes defari absolutely nothing tracks they appear . also " da da da da " track little replay value . other than , this album highly recommended if you ever go house party want something listen . some people say this tha liks ' best album . i believe " likwidation " their best if you ask me . but i highly recommend you get all their albums ( heck " firewater " little dissapointing , but still recommended ) , if you like hip hop style . this album 16 year old high school kid soundtrack getting drunk . lyrics : a-production : a-guest appearances : bmusical vibes : a-overall : a-favorite tracks : bar code , run wild , l-i-k-s , sickness , best u , bubble , 151 , promote violinshonorable mention : 40 oz quartetpeace	1

bottom line : very enjoyable album anyone open mind . girlfriends , boyfriends , single people , married people , old , young , male , female . you probably already know ( like ) least 3 songs this album : " every morning " , " someday " , " falls apart " . so , you're already off great start . , those you old-school sugar ray rock fans , there plenty here you . try " personal space invader " , " aim me " , " glory " , " burning dog " if you enjoy cranking it 11 . actually , this album predominantly rock inspired ... if you've listened whole thing . hip hop fans find " live direct " featuring krs-one pleasant little surprise . 80 fans take their spiced up rendition steve miller " abracadabra " . , they've got some nice softer tunes form " ode lonely hearted " " even though " ( song which seems jumped off time machine 50 or something ... good stuff ) . , course there bits pieces trademark sugar ray humor thrown album . like they always say , sugar ray all fun . period . if things like " image " matter you , then steer clear this band . if dogmatic adherence one specific style music ( only one specific style music ) excites you then steer clear this band . but , if you like fun your music ( a.k.a. enjoying it ) if you appreciate diverse musical influences , then here ya ' go	1
avid ib fan ... i say , hell this album . this far worst pile garbage band ever put out . erik braunn million times guitar player pinera or rhino ... i'm saying braunn praise , not either latters ' detriment , they're both great . but songs unimaginitive it clear where most fire previous albums came ... 17 year old who booted out too many creative ideas his own . ib owed atlantic album after this one , but doug ingle quit band forefitted deal ... forever severing ties iron butterfly atlantic records . but considering what pile crap this album , fact they didn't follow it up should seen mercy . so , conclusion , screw this one , go get copy ball or live	-1
this box set seeks recapture magic first motown box set while it delivers great music , it doesn't quite live up its predecesor . first box defined time . motown called " sound young america " heard music . joyful , questioning , urgent , fun , pleading . 60 first box set . second set suffers fact motown not big music force 70 . music not vitality earlier decade . said , it contain some marvelous music . first 2 discs especially . motown lives this box , just not robustly it earlier one . i would recommend it , but i don't think it occupy much your time first box set . it note worthy some one hit wonders included ( like berry gordy own son who went under moniker " rockwell " ) . fun but not memorable collection	1

some critics panned this 1961 session mr. blakey jazz messengers , feeling album lacks punch such classic blakey lp like ' moanin ' or ' night tunisia ' ( blue note records version ) . this set more laid-back , blakey band , emphasizing groove over hardbop fury . but not say this album not good , though . mr. blakey gift bringing together great bands young musicians forging solid unit out them . this version featured outstanding horns lee morgan ( trumpet ) , wayne shorter ( tenor sax ) , curtis fuller ( trombone ) . mr. morgan takes quiet approach his soloing ( eg ., quot;don't you know what love isquot ;) wonderful . mr. shorter gives us glimpses things come his own blue note sessions ( eg ., ' juju ' ' night dreamer ' ) . other highlights opening quot ; alamodequot ; quot ; i hear rhapsodyquot ; . nice introduction mr. blakey , or hear more groove oriented messengers set , try this album	1

thing i like best this album exotic moods grooves this album . there everything moroccan african jamaican whole lot more . i listen this album all its different styles never tire it . some people seem think too many styles music make disjointed record , i disagree i think it keeps music interesting . it hard believe only two guys made all this cool music . emiliana torrini vocals add nice sound tracks she appears , but my favorites would more reggae type tracks . one my favorite albums moment	1

" how you resist it " little bit country rock rolled into one . it oddball out whole album this nothing like teena ever before . first i didn't like this song but it grew me . great guitar work some interesting word usage ( sorry , i'm english/writing buff ) . " since day one " showcases early 90 slow jam some good percussion work well driving laidback kinda vibe much like " cupid " " just us two " . " miracles need wings fly " hidden gem teena belting it out once more , very beautiful lyrics reggae-ish " red zone " shows teena doing her own turn doing " state world " song hence singers like marvin gaye janet jackson , name few . very inspiring lyrics make you actually ... think ! unlike today mindless crap ( exceptions alicia keys , jill scott , mary . blige blu cantrell just name few) " ivory " outstanding album , one teena best i declare , it i stated my title , poetry motion . lyrics this album some teena best it just one few albums i listen all way not skip any songs . funky , inspirational lovley journey i lady this cd . add it your collection take trip " ivory " ! star sprinkles top 51 . just us two2 . snap your fingers3 . if i bell4 . cupid real straight shooter5 . how you resist it ? actually ... whole freakin ' album good	1

there only two ways someone could not like this album : 1 . he/she lacks capacity feel emotion ie no soul . 2 . he/she deaf . while there too many great blues albums hail one greatest , i could not argue anyone thinking this peak blues . whether you blues fan or not , this album such emotion such power it transcends musical taste . musicianship , perhaps most notably guitar playing , fabulous sam ' vocals breathtaking ; he voice angel fire , meaning sweet lovely but edgy intense . music just doesn't get much better than this . i highly recommend it anyone considers his/herself fan music , partiuclarly blues , jazz , rock , or soul	1
i purchased this cd my daughter . she college age really enjoying it . it arrived quickly good condition	1
terrible , i gotten this cd high hopes because their single " we used friends " , but this cd just lacks much creative beat or rhythem or anything . it sounds like someone who morbidly depressed just singing sighs , " lalala ...... sigh .... all us ..... " i not find one song whole cd i liked , which surprising because i think their other cd pretty decent . hardcore fans may like it , but i wouldn't spend your money it . try getting it library test-driving it . i don't think you like it though .	-1
this release shows attacking krs-one blazing controversial lyrical content . why this album so slept not noticed mystery . this cd definitely worth picking up includes very tight beats	1

doc watson one premier flatpick guitar players ever , some his best albums recorded his late son merle . sittin ' here pickin ' blues draws three early mid-eighties studio albums they recorded flying fish ( one live track telluride festival tapes ) . here breakdown tracks : red rocking chair ( 1981 ): " california blues , " " you hear john hurt , " " any old time " " how long blues . " . michael coleman plays bass all tracks tom scott plays clarinet " any old time . " doc merle watson guitar album ( 1983 ): " talking casey , " " goin ' chicago blues " " john henry/worried blues . " . michael coleman plays bass all tracks mark o'connor plays fiddle . telluride festival tapes ( 1984 ): " deep river blues " pickin ' blues ( 1985 ): all twelve tracks original vinyl release included . . michael coleman plays bass all tracks sam bush plays mandolin or fiddle many ( except " st. louis blues " which doc plays solo ) . not only doc accomplished guitar player , but his son merle more than holds his own slide guitar most these tracks . my only complaint individual albums currently out print more than dozen tracks red rockin ' chair guitar album left off . this should double cd enable all three cds included their entirety . but if you're looking solid introduction music doc merle , this excellent place start . [ running time - 60:05 ] very highly recommende	1

when i first bought this vinyl some twenty years ago , i not too impressed it . i'm not sure why . maybe it because i loved ' phenomenon ' so much disappointed it didn't sound more like album . maybe it because most songs didn't catch first listen . maybe it song titles , which i don't think rank amongst their best . whatever case , i remember not liking it much foolishly traded it away . some twenty years later , i bought this cd now realize how wrong i first this album . yeah , songs not immediately likable tunes ' phenomenon ' high points aren't high , but taken it own terms , this great album . tunes didn't catch my ear first , like two opening hard rockers , ' let it roll ' ' shoot shoot ' , i now absolutely love tunes i liked first time around , such ballad ' high flyer ' crunchy hard rocker ' mother mary ' , i like even more now . this certainly more aggressive heavier album than it predecessor , but it also more diverse terms material . keyboards , courtesy ten years after keyboardist chick churchill , make their first appearance ufo album definitely add , opposed subtract , overall sound . keyboards their most effective album closing track , ' this kid ( including ' walls ' ) , particularly during last two half minutes . moment , this my favorite song album . it fades out some mournful sounding church ( or ' churchill ' ! ) organ , leaving me wanting more , which nice way end album . catchy guitar riffs , singalongable vocal melodies guitar solos abundance throughout album , even what i think some album weaker cuts such ' dance your life away ' ' love lost love ' . oh yes , i almost forgot mention pete way ' too much nothing ' , which very early alice cooper-like bass drum section middle . oh yes .. again .. i like andy parker very solid drumming ' shoot shoot ' . see , there bunch like ' force it ' ! you should buy it	1
bottom line - mr. marsalis company delivered exceptional disc baroque treasures trumpet . it obvious urtext approach not taken , but i think fine . anthony newman added some obbligato parts ( timpani , organ , etc ) apparently notated tutti ornaments strings majority pieces this collection . incidentally , bach only substantial work disc ( my reasoning 4 stars lieu 5 ) . it bach marsalis shows why he become such world-class artist . now , i am very aware he uses modern schilke piccolo this recording play rather loud , i love it ! he produces beautiful sound throughout tend steal spotlight . william bennett flute falls victim faintly heard times . neil black , great oboist , embellishes his passages way i not previously heard . english chamber orchestra provides lush accompaniment throughout . bach purists most likely discount this interpretation terms balance but cannot dispute its character virtuosity execution . my only complaint throughout choice repertoire . music ends up sounding like same story told over over again , but well told	1

sam first rate . if you like buddy guy you might like sam . if you like otis rush , you almost certainly like sam . if you like good music soul , rythm feeling- this it . not too much production , not stripped down either . it happy medium most blues fans . there isn't overboard horn section or interfering keys , or crazy looped guitar tracks . this pure taste . piano plays perfectly music [ sam learned west side soul only play best . ] one tenor saxaphone few tracks add some layers . sam plays lead some extra rythm . he only vocalist . there two tunes kinda soul/ . rest solid blues , sometimes funky , sometimes slow . sam one great blues singers innovators . this record happy medium lot respects . you got instrumental . you got guitar playing technically respectable creative but totally tasteful feel music . sam doesn't drill over music confused lines go no where particular like alot bluesmen tend . he plays his band . he solos he shines , but he doesn't ever mess up sound songs . its got slow soul , feel good , funk , everything . this album west side soul sam his peek , cream electric blues players . man all around innovator blues music , live he played bass , drums , harmonica , piano or whatever band needed , it didn't matter . he pushed cool blues ahead . he otis rush changed game . sam respect otis because he his songs , like keep loving me here my love never die west side . i tell everybody i know who likes good music- if you don't know this guy , then you missing big piece puzzle . this where it . his two major studio records only real studio lps two my favorites out hundreds albums . i can't even see how anyone could not like this	1
okay , i'm vu nutcase - must said . i bought all four their original studio albums three-week span , if you wanted any proof . i also like reed solo stuff , this great record . wonderfully twisted walk wild side lou only top 40 hit , indeed it quite song . but don't , some , overlook rockers such vicious or hangin ' ' round , satellite love ( featuring david bowie , who produced record , singing great backup vocal ); slightly overblown but still good ballad perfect day ; bizarre andy chest , which lot fun ; or hilarious new york telephone conversation . wagon wheel , i'm so free goodnight ladies weak , but overall transformer excellent record . okay , i'll admit i miss reed expiremental edge ( it interesting david bowie , man behind excellent station station album , didn't tap into ) , i said before couple songs weak . but hey , it great , sure better than overrated rock ' ' roll animal	1
young , first uk pop idol winner , gone strenght strength !!! after rather disapointing debut album he came back his second taking uk charts storm again again then vanishing !!!! but now , 2 years later , he back this latest album fantastic ! full great pop tunes great love songs , this great album playing around house relax or work . expected there some fab lyrics some reministant his last albums best song ' leave right now ' which worth checking out . highlights include unashamedly poppy ' switch it ' which great dance sing , heart rending ' all time love ' fanstasticly simple understated ballad we all relate some point our lives ..... " sometimes you pass good ones , cos you're trying too hard , too hard see them " tust me , give this album chance , you wont regret it	1
course this not ground-breaking band featured lester young basie rhythm section late 30s , but it great band , more power drive than band , just much swing . i really say ? power comes abigger band better recording techniques . lockjaw davis presence wonderful . whirlybird flight foobirds super cuts . this not first basie disk you should buy , but it #6 , since #1 -4 ( three disk set basie decca vols . 1 , 2 , 3 columbia ) my top 10 jazz disks overall , this high recommendation . best jazz issue basie superb way , if you only want buy one	1

truly great art/punk album , their darkest best work . some humour earlier recordings missing , although no album whose first song starts line : quot ; hands up ! who wants diequot ; . could called humourless . it would worth five stars except some weaker songs like six strings drew blood pleasure avalanche but both these not orginal lps so it not birthday partys fault . great album violent , rocking tottaly amoral just way i like em	1
truth told excellent album . powerfull mostly new . bastardos same qualitys . very first track you sense blues traveler ( now ) going new directions every album song . thats whats so incredible this long time band . they keep recreating themselves every second play together . we might miss mister bob sheehan but we sure love what blues traveler without him . maybe long time fans not happy this new albums ( tbt bastardos ) but can't say blues traveler not good before . i believe not better , i believe its just simple evolution . great one . this 70 rock influenced album solid record must considered one best album this year . i haven't listen like this one honest . songs like " you can't stop thinking abou me " or " can't win true love " shows evolution band not forgotten their old influences , they just add new ones . ( thanks tad kinchla ben wilson ) . they playing excellent live shows i believe this album shows band going better places . but they sure deliver us better albums , but this great attemp say " hey , we still alive better than ever " .	1

play , start , classic . i think tracks overall great arranged professionally , but also each track listened individually you still get same feeling ! 1 . honey - this top song catchy beat , i seem able listen it over over again . ( this song gets even better 118 remix single)2 . find my baby - i never used like this song , but now i think its great . my first impressions repetetive boring , but if you listen carefully appreciate song , it become favourite ! 3 . porcelain - my favourite song off album ! beautifully arranged , its gorgeous song ! if you've heard music album " animal rights " or " everything wrong " then its not what you'd expect moby , but great track . 4 . why my heart - brilliant :) simple piano pattern , blues vocals minor melody make it song you listen anytime , when your peaceful , upset , even when your just relaxing . 5 . south side - it good song , but i think gwen stefani singing takes away originality . 6 . rushing - not great but it fits atmosphere album . 7 . bodyrock - now this good song . not moby all , but damn its catchy :) 8 . natural blues - this song means alot people who appreciate good blues music . me =] 9 . machete - nice basic techno-ish beat . 10 . 7 - skip it , you wouldn't notice . although i used this cassette it first track side , which made good intro . 11 . run - i wouldn't clue what guy saying , i'm too lazy look up lyrics but its good song . i don't know why they released extended version , i think its long enough . 12 . down slow - skip this one too . or fast forward it tape = p13 . if things perfect - yeaah its okay ... 14 . everloving - my second favourite song this album !!! it so well , it starts nice acoustic builds up what soudns full symphony orchestra or somethin like . 15 . inside - not big fan but its near end cd , where its winding down . 16 - , - wow this surprisingly good song . i never used like it but i now . 17 - sky broken - sort haunting way , but still . 18 - i don't really like this track , but its perfect album closer . also , if youve seen new live hotel tour dvd , its opening sequence , which good start great concert . well theirs my extra long review . hope you read it all didnt skip boring bits like i this cd . : pby	1

i admit , i sceptical when this cd first handed me . " yes " i am firm believer some material should not covered - like " take five " example . no variation , improvisation , or arrangement could ever reach heights original . i put " love supreme " category well ... until i heard wynton brother branford live recording " love supreme " , released late 2004 . so wynton under quite some pressure deliver ... here my ten cents : i love this cd . fact , i am listening it over over again , always discovering new nuances marsalis ' smart big band arrangements . he leaves enough space each musician - including himself - show their artistic talents while never losing cohesiveness needed make this production work . it treat jazz-loving ear . appropriately challenging , yet flowing fresh . there ellingtonian grandeur recording wynton marsalis ' classcial music training certainly came handy here . incidentally , " love supreme " produced yet member marsalis family , brother delfeayo .	1

this my very first electronic cd . i picked it up local record store impulse , didn't expect much . first listen , it seemed somewhat pretentious , indulgent , artsy ... this my idea trance music general time . fact , i bought this album challenge myself : i wanted give every style music fair chance . after my 30 second scan each track , i left it alone until one fateful night . my friend ricky pulled out some nifty little toys called glowsticks ! he told me he learning how make interesting light shows out them , but only " techno " music he horrible mix tape featuring likes alice deejay , t-99 , other outdated rave-monkey acts . i shuddered every track rediculous synths over-enhanced basslines . so he noticed my copy " world " sitting my cd tower , suggested we try it . i overwhelmed difference it made play this album ricky 6,000 -dollar home stereo . i simply blown away darkly hypnotic , playfully dreamy sounds coming out speakers . i picked up glowsticks my first time i created something beautiful out this mix . now , 6 years later , i still keep coming back this mix whenever i need unwind . seriously , almost every single track here my list favorites . however , two really stand out me most north sky tears rain . i still whistle melody vangelis song my baby nephew lullaby , he loves it . summing it all up : these some most intense , uplifting , soulful pieces music i ever experienced . if you patient ear , active mind ... you enjoy this mix	1

chris , i love this album so many reasons ! not sure i put it all into words but here few : your lyrics deep give me things think they stir my spirit way makes me want draw closer god ( i know mean lot things lot people but i don't know how else word it ) . i love passion emotion you put into each song . it obvious every song genuine comes your heart . i found myself gravitating towards artists who write their own music because there so much more meaning behind it instead just fun song you like maybe first 20 times you hear it then toss it aside because it didn't impact your heart . make sense ? musically , i think this album excellent ! i love no two songs sound same . i love there lot layers songs ... i listen them over over different things stand out me i didn't notice before . i feel like there so much inside me responds your music - things go way deeper than words speak . it hard wrap my mind around it . i think big part could because it artistry , musicianship , spirit , soul , passion all intertwined together it affects me so many different levels -yet all once - it something marveled enjoyed beauty it unveils . i metioned this you your blog couple times , but i want say thank you again making such incredible music sharing it us .	1

i bought this cd already familiar dance/trance/techno scene years , listened few times never picked it up again . i picked up this cd since it tilt - i dream ( resurection remix ) - ( which only track carries captivating beat - truly awesome ) thinking rest cd would just incredible . unless your gonna get sloshed or shoot up something freak dance strobe lights amist booming sound system , don't waste your money this one . until i personally decide this myself , only then would i rate this five . sasha must better mixes out there i not yet discovered , but whatever case , this cd disappointment . rather than letting this cd uselessly spin my cd deck , i simply use it coaster . i know many disagree this review but given fact i gave this cd honest shot , i not writing this hater . i simply not impressed this one . this mix carries same monotonous beat start finish . honestly , there better mixes out there sasha ... but don't waste your ears this one . if you liked other cds like : trance mix usa , bt - movement still life , atb - dj mix , crystal method - vegas community service , any mixes dj micro , tansport paul oakenfold , dj tiesto search sunrise , or any gatecrasher mix .... this cd may not one you	-1
i love this album . i'm one relative few who bought it when it first came out 1976 . but they really shouldn't messed it when they decided release remastered version . yes , i love orson welles narration they added , but new guitar parts really annoy me . anyone who listened endlessly original lp , new guitar parts sound very 80 stand out bad way . i wish people would learn leave well enough alone . other than cheesy guitar parts ( final , totally boring , song ) , it classic album . it too bad app went commercial their next lp , but it happens best them	1
when i first heard this album i hated it . lil john new up beat flaver this album threw me off . im use melodic thug sound krayzie this album little more mainstream type beats . krayzie still always my favorite member btnh , after dissapointing thug da line album ( mostly due poor guest artists ) this album pretty good . few best songs end early though . best song album " dont know why " , incredible but it ends right when story reaches its peak . get cha twisted very good well . more sentimental songs this album good . my favorite those " i remember " which talks all days he remembers chillin other members btnh . overall , its good album but keep open mind new type beats displayed this album	1

artie shaw , still alive kicking ( age 91 , born 23 may , 1910 ) this writing , perhaps most brilliantly intellectual all great big band leaders . genius whose moody , perfectionist personality won him beautiful wives such lana turner ava gardner , shaw my favourite leader fabled big band era . his 1936 orchestra included strings which highly unusual jazz band those days ; his version quot ; japanese sandmanquot ; instance surprisingly very good . artie 1937 orchestra , my opinion just awful . horrible . tinny , screechy musically inept ; he trying too hard , i suspect . teen-ager , i owned his ' 37 recordings quot ; night dayquot ; quot ; non-stop flightquot ; ( his 1938 version this instrumental opus which he wrote himself terrific ! ) quot ; i surrender , dearquot ; among others . early 1938 , however , artie re-organized his band it band which remains public favourite : quot ; begin beguinequot ; flip side record which bigger seller : quot ; indian love callquot ; . one night late 1939 , while performing audience bandstand , artie simply took off headed mexico vowing never return music business . shaw re-appeared several months later ( he actually sick rare disease ) brand-new 31 piece orchestra which included string section flutes ; quot ; frenesiquot ; introduced ecstatic response artie back rare form . personally , i liked string studded band even more than his great ' 38 band because it more demension . quot ; frenesiquot ; quot ; temptationquot ; quot ; star dustquot ; his classic interpretation quot ; moonglowquot ; solid gold . ( listen part where piano meets jack jenney trombone solo quot ; moonglowquot ; you'll discover where they got idea quot ; moonglow theme picnicquot ; some 15 years later	1

if you've made it this far dictators fan , shame you even needing review convince you buy this ! you hesitating because price ? how much you spent dictators albums last 25 years ? maybe you're hesitating because you're concerned terrible sound or lousy performance . well , sound suberb ( great production job shernoff ) performance flat out rocks . ( i'd like add ..... this not ipod music . this 200 watts channel least 10 " woofers move some serious air music ) . major bonus here killer versions " go girl crazy " songs . even remastered version studio album leaves much diesired . songs this live album finally those 25 year old tracks justice . satisfied ? so add it cart now or go zshops save few cents . if you've made it this far curiosity your music collection lacking dictator department , this album album get . " viva ! " great representation what this band all . after one listen you'll adding all studio releases your collection fairly quickly . i only few minor " issues " bring up . so , if you not fan band already , just skip my ranting below , buy cd come back read this later . ok ? below may considered blasphemy i may burn it . but i need get them off . only beef i sound imbalance guitar mix . ross guitar right channel set " 10 " while top ten guitar left channel set " 7 " ; this very picky , long time fans criticism . second , this not true live album per se rather than collection live songs . songs put together very little song chatter audience participation . some songs actually fade out silence . all this gives album more " live studio " than audience live recording feel . last song " cars girls " recorded audience free sound check sounds no different than rest album . i really hoping hear few song sermons manitoba it not . lastly , no music " manifest destiny " . this may contractual issue however not oversight band . but one thing overshadow all my nitpicking ross boss . if you all albums vinyl , then you know where i'm coming . ross playing here blends ferocity stooges james williamson melodic playing " buck dharma " little bit ace frehley thrown . he never , never , never , never , never sounded better . that it ....	1

first - " root down " hottest rawest down-to-earth funkadelic live album recorded jimmy smith his most unusual live group ' 70 . secondly - he never follow up album concept . too bad ! recorded live los angeles february 1972 , group young musicians rooted modern progressive rock/jazzrock funk seems no respect organ master pushes him beyond normal limits . wilton felder ( yes , man crusaders ) plays his funky elbass , some guitar distortion/wah-wah artur adams funky drumming paul humphrey , band sounds astonishing modern acid jazz vein , even today standards . smith kicks off laying down blues drenched organ grooves truly cook his originals like " sagg shootin ' his arrow " , " root down " slow down sagg " . too often played " after hours " sounds fresh new adding steve williams harmonica . reissue even greater than original album since verve restored original tracks their full unedited length ... great work verve	1
please stop letting yourself brainwashed this macho hypocricy . large part street punk oi ! just something racist , scared white people hide behind . singing wearing boots beating up people who you outnumber not make you special , it just makes you hateful narrow-minded authorities you oppose . if you really want tough , save whales . this band government music , big time labels prefer these hateful bands because they make punks look like bunch scary degenerates , because they convince some teenagers fight middle east . think what you're doing if you choose buy this cd ; you really think 30 years you say " i am happy i became such moron beat up all my neighbors . "	-1
when paul westerberg good , he unmatched any songwriter out there these days . he capable writing amazing pop songs , great rock roll wonderful ballads . he also become consistantly inconsistent his solo work this batch songs poor examples his potential . only " right arm bears " seems worthy release high profile soundtrack geared kids , while other tracks sound too familiar these ears , relying tired riffs borrowed melodies , sounding too mature kids audiance too uninspired adults who still care . apparently paul considered grammy song " i belong " which could blessing or curse our old boy . he deserves recongition his great songwriting career he certainly deserves get " real paid " after all this time , but he then joining company other grammy winners writing lukewarm drivel masses . i highly disappointed this collection songs it one very few pw releases i cannot recommend	-1
not sure how i moved give mutemath try , but they're my current favorite . i saw them open fray last night - i believe they stole show . awesome live band . most talented ( entertaining ) drummer i've seen years . great vocals , very original sound .	1
mastodon-blood mountain ***** metal back , real metal finally returned so vengeance . more then just metal this one album knows no bound , reaching into progressive rock , classic rock , thrash , just straight up rock roll . attitude when needed unparalleled any other band around right now , moments sensitivity fantastically balanced intensity . brann dailor plays some best drums you ever heard your entire life blood mountain , fervor mans kit insane . troy sanders lays down some fattest bass lines i've ever heard , also some intensest vocals metal history . guitars played brent hinds bill kelliher most creative guitar playing genre seen almost fifteen years it so refreshing hear . lyrical matter album very early slayer but much more sophisticated . story band parking bottom blood mountain attempting climb top reach crystal skull before they catch frostbite ate sleeping giant , cysquatch . if sounds insane you like one most off wall premises album then you wouldn't far off , either you never heard real metal album before . songs like incendiary `the wolf loose ' which opens album capillarian crest ' provide what metal missing last few years ( exception trivium , lamb god ) , balls . album opener easily best song mastodon ever written recorded . slower more melodic tracks like brilliant `bladecatcher ' beautiful(yes beautiful yet brutal ) album closer `pendulous skin ' so there more mastodon then your face-destructive metal , much more . complicated rhythms this album show musical prowess each players this none more present then `circle cysquatch .

my wife i heard cut radio immediately moved . stunningly beautiful . healing . hauntingly spiritual . lisbeth scott voice speaks my soul evoke its peace	1
i picked this up cd after i listened band earlier releases , quot ; raincoatsquot ; , quot ; odyshapequot ; , quot ; movingquot ; quot ; kitchen tapesquot ;; it didn't impress me . note absence vicky aspinell , who i feel essential part raincoats their early years . gal voices don't sound great they their previous albums . gina voice grated my nerves after first track . last two tracks back day . raincoats ' classics ! i would say , pick this one up after you listened their earlier releases . maybe then you'll share similar opinion	-1

this one michael kamen best . it adventurous , romantic , fun all rolled into one . main theme titled quot ; overturequot ; classic main theme actually music morgan creek pictures logo . it big colossal wonderous brass fanfares top notch string performances . score contains lots variations this theme throughout . quot ; sir guy gisbornequot ; contains light bouncy woodwinds , leading quot ; escape sherwoodquot ; quotes main theme some great percussion work . quot ; little johnquot ; slightly amusing cue , leading quot ; band forestquot ; , which militaristic like march . quot ; sheriff his witchquot ; dark ominous nature . quot ; marianquot ; , well quot ; marian waterfallquot ; contain beautiful romantic theme played mainly flutes gentle strings harp . it also melody outstanding bryan adams song heard toward end . quot ; abduction final battle gallowsquot ; starts out ominous sounding strings piccolo , few guitars , leading rumbling percussion solo , finally heading toward exciting action cue powerful horn sounds top notch brass fanfares . quot ;( everything i ) i it youquot ; one my favorite songs hit top charts years ago still top requested song because it good . quot ; wild timesquot ; decent song performed jeff lange , but not even close how good other song . this highly recommended soundtrack if you haven't guessed now	1
course no album perfect , but purity which mr. newman music comes through these interpretations riveting . " i think it going rain today " alone worth price album . william merrill wrote his spotlight review , songwriting takes center stage . if , like me , you've not randy newman solo concert , least we've got this album bring songwriting alive us	1
this particular version js bach " goldberg " variations really should require no review all ; anyone even remotely interested this kind music should already know it . it j.s. bach -- undisputed all time master contrapuntal fugue form -- peak his compositional skills , interpreted glenn gould - keyboard genius without parallel - perhaps greatest classical piano virtuoso history human race . track track what you here quite literally most thrilling intricate baroque era single clavinette music ever written . fact it generally understood only reason goldberg variations not heard often bach signature work , far more famous " well tempered clavinette " collection , simply because there so few people around level skill necessary perform them . give extremely high marks gould then , because this recording replete rivers sizzling notes moving flawlessly all directions blinding speeds ... speeds times too hard even process through human ear much less play ! one almost picture him keyboard , eyes closed , head cocked bowed way over , both hands " flying " up down keyboard performing their simultaneously complex scales counter-scales astonishing amount intensity almost un-human , precision-like perfection . there 30 goldberg variations ( not counting two arias open close which illustrative ) , each variant containing two four voices , each characterized canons other repeated sections , but really interesting twist this production you get 2 recordings same set variations ; one gould his brilliant 1955 recording debut- one created sensation which landed him cover time magazine time , second gould 1981 just days before he died , back studio performing same set same exact order . even fact much this paricular collection old analogue recording gear ( circa 1955 ) adds its pure delight , tape giving back true depth , clear spatial definition , good old stereo separation taken away this less personal " digital " era which we currently live record . so it all makes amazing experience , truly so . i say : buy it , buy it , buy it --- even if you're low money -- buy it ! even if you're " baroque " -- buy it	1
this very good cd some very strong tracks1 . three chords country- very good song cd version better then radio version steve tyler but very good song2 . podunk- good song guy lived small town valled podunk moved away there but end goes back his hometown3 . wrapped around- very good song probley one 4 prime cuts this album4 . xxl- just great song people big love this song prime cut number 25 . pickin wildflowers-very good upbeat song also prime cut6 . everytime i hear your name- great song guy can't get woman off his mind7 . stick it- love this song it very fun song listen too sing too 8 . plan b-good song guys who tries get girl but don't work so he needs plan b9 . lazy your love- this good song but i think weakest song album10 . clothes don't make man- great song guy jail but not bad guy because clothes don't make man11 . you'll know when i get there- i think best song album should single but my view best song albumso overall i give this album 4.75 stars but because i can't put i give it	1
this expanded edition what already classic blues album . all all expanded edition ok . it remastered george marino , who remastered lot catalogs , most importantly led zeppelin catalog . this edition sounds little better than old cd , but not much . two extra tracks really outstanding . one instrumental jam where buddy really lets loose other nice cover guitar slim . no horns or big production , just buddy band these two . big letdown : ' mustang sally ' jeff beck contribution edited out completely !!! all fills his solo . why , what happened ??	1
i agree this show fabulous . i am often london business never able get tix until this summer . what treat ! i am huge broadway fan this show right up there best . cd , it very good really takes me right back theatre . strongest numbers include : electricity , letter , expressing yourself merry xmas maggie thatcher ( i wonder what they'll w/that one when show comes new york ) . don't buy cd until you've seen show - you enjoy it much more way	1
phrase i've seen time or two reference james brown little richard suggests they forgiven their egotism because their music lives up boasts . thought came mind after ingesting this cd " teacher " krs-one boogie down productions . those who suggest this disc musical propaganda correct . kris parker general message here police not trusted , educational system failing pass achievements black americans past african culture , sometimes black man only friend his firearm . he uses intense vocal delivery while musically smooth rhythms take some edge off bitter pill . reggae flavors turn up often , most pronounced ( ironically enough ) " hip hop rules " . group also make time nod beat box sound " breath control " . highlights : scratched hook " jack spades " relentless . ever wonder where origins " throw your hands air " ? check rhyme ... parker sister pamela " harmony " scott turns nicely soulful vocal spiritual paean " jah rulez " . ( " what they ? /what they say ? /they can't live without your love/another day ... " ) " who protects us you ? " aims police brutality , questioning whether quality protection varies class . ( " it seems when you walk ghetto/you walk your own point view ... " ) " you must learn " indicts educational establishment failure teach achievements forebears like benjamin banneker ( creator almanac ) granville woods ( inventor walkie-talkie ) . it not just young blacks who miss out here . ( " when one doesn't know other one culture/ignorance swoops down like vulture .. " ) gangsta rap template " bo ! bo ! bo ! " catchy , if not more than little disingenuous disc also includes " world peace " logo " stop violence " movement . lows : " world peace " simultaneously musically catchy lyrically vapid . " if we really want world peace/and we want it right now/we must make up our mind take it .. " answer according parker but doesn't take into account fact many world conflicts based deep seated religious or ethnic divisions won't go away just because " positivity " . bottom line : you take some " education " here grain salt . but there no doubt all krs ' skill mic . he absolutely defines foundations old school hip-hop this album one rap cornerstones . recommended	1
you learn everything how make record this album . care precision put into this record present everywhere . handful songs simply amazing , but even less than stellar songs every note arrangements purpose . during time when most singer/songwriters just worrying " message " newman concerned music . it shows . then there songs , mordant ones any rate , which just plain brilliant . this intelligent pop music new orleans stylings thick thread reaches back piano based ballads people like fats waller . newman american original .	1
this album combines exceptional , interesting , stylistically disparate tunes , luscious electronic orchestration , unrelenting drive uncanny sense artistic unity . it " dance album " pretty much class itself . leftfield , before disbanding , also created formidable body ep releases remixes . their second album , rhythm stealth , also full shimmeringly beautiful cuts - though without unifying " comet ride " impulse this album easy acceptance often greets familiar - case leftism , it comfortable place dance bin . repeat : if you like hard-driving dance music glorious electronica , this truly distinguished disk	1
my husband i literally wearing out this terrific cd ! rich blend celtic english ... songs known unknown . this celtic enthusiasts everywhere	1
... i went school not far dayton when this came out . thankfully , it one those you play all track one end . it ended up helping me through many evening studying dorm room ... music , .. although cover didn't hurt none . i also remember those friday night student union parties where they played heck outta quot ; firequot ; quot ; smokequot ; slowgrind jams quot ; togetherquot ; quot;it all overquot ; . what i say , but quot ; throw some water mequot ; ... call firemen ! after i graduated school moved dayton , i lived apartment complex not too far both troutman labs one story storefront warehouse where they practiced when they town . anyway , i got meet billy beck , diamond sugarfoot ... they weren't all impressed me , but i thought they great their musicianlike moodiness ... they sure could play funky music . i miss kinda group around ..	1
it exactly what i looking . i love cd	1
i didn't buy this album . i downloaded several songs . it produced suge mostly new material . songs boring though . only classic " until end time " . don't buy this album . just download songs you like	-1
i don't know exactly how classify this band . nu-metal ? i don't think term really applies so much heavy music scene anymore . i would say they would alternative metal , not emo or nu . first off , vocals just amazing . not only leads , but backing vocs harmonies excellent . haven't heard better since maybe alice chains . every song here worthy single , i think if they got proper backing , they could huge . there hooks galore . i think i almost od'd catchy tunes . there few tender moments this disc , but it rocks pretty hard while keeping true melody it title . if you enjoy bands like taproot , 10 years , godhead , etc ., you'll love evans blue . no , they not hardcore or anything , but i'm not ashamed i like broad range rock metal . i listen lamb god flames , too . i appreciate great music when i hear it , these guys great .	1
i reviewed debut , i review all her cd chronogically . so this leads us 5 000 000 selling us , one #1 hit . following self-titled album , its success kind disappointing , although it still very succesful . it probably mariah album i listen least . emotions : only #1 hit , first single , instantly catchy early 90 dance track . who doesn't remember this ? but i like way i feel , insiiiiiide!' infamous high notes , belting , this one mariah best songs vocally . some say ' oversinging ' , but it ok my taste . 10/10and you don't remember : my favorite song record . many fans dislike it , but slow haunting verses mixed direct heartfelt chorus really it me . not mention endless high note . it very sad song , i relate . 10/10can't let go : probably my 2nd favorite . it stuck #2 billboard charts . it little faster than aydr but it still slow ballad . it catchy chorus beautiful vocals . once again , endless high note . goes 16 seconds if i remember correctly . even though i try , i can't let go ... 10/10make it happen : clearly one mariah favorite songs hers , she sings it every occasion . catchy uptempo beat , powerful vocals make it amazing song dance . plus , lyrics so uplifting , i can't think better song listen cheer you up . 3rd single album , it hit #5 billboard charts . 10/10if it over : one most powerful songs off record . when mariah sung this back day , you couldn't help but get chills all over ... it isn't fair , it isn't right , if it really gone , then tell me tonight ... if it over ... melody also haunting . 10/10you're so cold : amazing intro first thing i mention . vocals just astonishing . i left speachless after slow intro ... but then beat comes . it my favorite upbeat song record . it really catchy piano beat different . she asking why he so cold . 10/10so blessed : favorite amongst listeners , although it never really stood out me . it good , but i don't see huge appeal . it slow song very romantic lyrics . 7/10to around you : last upbeat song album . it not good 3 first ones , but it really good its own right . it picks up pace last song it keeps album interesting , short it . 9/10till end time : i never liked this song ... it slow boring me . i'll give it chance grow me but til end , it my least favorite song mariah carey . 5/10the wind : beautiful hauting somewhat jazz feel song . it very depressing , mourning loss . ends album beautifully 8/10this album released year i born . i love it nevertheless i'm happy i'm not missing out mariah older stuff . you've got me feeling emotions ... deeper than i've ever dreamed ofoh , oh , ohyou've got me feeling emotions ... higher than heavens aboveyou got me feeling higher ..	1
his long career hassell created very personal sound , not only his trumpet but all his ensembles he bring direction he likes . maybe this not one his best cd but few seconds you easily recognize his music different any other musician . while other similar artists like eno making musical flops ( listen day ... ) hassell continues his artistic journey no compromises we grateful him	1

i saw them live , i all original lp i watched 1968 concert bbc . this offering far removed way i remember them . all cream same age i am , it showed . poor jack recovering surgery lost voice stamina . ginger subdued but who would expected him still alive . eric , well he just going through motions . but biggest criticism , mentioned others , clapton using strat ' instead les paul gibson . they just didn't sound right . said this , it cream i bought cd anyway	-1
like companion set , hittin ' all six ( jazz guitar ) , this collection brings together wide range excellent records date earliest jazz recordings going up though early modern . some selections predictable , some obscure , but they all interesting . lots sid catlett , example , excellent choices big band side particular ( cozy cole , jimmy crawford jo jones , name three ) . no lionel hampton , but fabulous cymbal beat alvin burroughs hampton small group . course , chick webb liza , which features wonderful drumming but also really fine trumpet solo bobby stark ( 2nd solo )	1
i love neil diamond but this album left me very unhappy . i think i found one song i enjoyed . i don't recommend it all .	-1
i didn't time go watch film .... i bought cd , few weeks ago .... " blindfold " , because i'm conviced so far , asian composers doing terrific job , when they composing music films . what i'm trying say ... scores like ... 7 swords , fearless , crouching tiger-hidden dragon , hero house flying daggers , very high dose ofthat " magic exotic " , music scale far-eastern music ! ( music scale progression notes specific order ) . score becomes " sonic explosive " additional touch epic music-structure . this " mixture " also contains , great chorals great solo china-flute " passages " live flute master-player ...... or it japanese " shakuhachi " ??? great china-gongs , drums all over final result .... simply amazing ! we used western world , hear scores sound almost alike . it because western composers , no more " ideas " ? i don't know what wrong , but one thing sure ..... trust asian composers ! buy this cd!it excellent lot china " flavor " !!! big bravo composer ! ps : please read comments below ..... way .... many thanks eriko kawahara . i informed my eriko kawahara composer japanese !!	1

this definetly their best album so far ! epic orchestral usual but unusually voice singer fabio lione , triumph or agony powerful then ever this time they have'nt become much orchestral , so if you consider last album stop buy rhapsody`s albums - " triumph or agony " fresh must . listen first reviewer - " this album totally blows away all expectations "	1
if you like stuff like depeche mode , thompson twins , erasure , naked eyes , human league talk talk than you enjoy this great forgotten band too . they obviously weren't biggest hitmakers 80s , but their tunes pretty infectous aged pretty darn well . this complilations all singles more . admittingly , few tracks skippable , but considering how rare their studio albums find , i'm willing bump my review this album up five stars ! plus , re-mastering job knock your socks off . blancmange never sounded better	1

this six-man ensemble precursor hit-making group debarge . switch , who best remembered featuring late bobby debarge , overshadowed groups like commodores , but during their tenure motown ( they recorded gordy label ) , they made some enduring material . their debut single quot;they'll never bequot ; obviously their career milestone , but many other songs , including quot ; i wanna closer , quot ; quot ; i call your name , quot ; quot ; love over over againquot ; ( co-written bunny debarge ) held up well over years . though group become somewhat buried motown history books , they one label most talented acts . since none their original albums print , this best way go ( though it would not hurt beat down some used record bins quot ; switchquot ; quot ; switch ii , quot ; both which went platinum , representative their work )	1

no matter how many times i listen it jan hammer group ' melodies'other fact none musicians this album well known except jan hammer never ceases anything but purely impressive . musicianship first rate , jan hammer uses his ' guitar synthesizer ' great effect his own production this album emmaculate-from song song jan keyboards synthesizer steve kindler violin often merge into one single entity . these songs lyrics truely stylistically diverse they come . one thing every tune here , even instrumentals very melodic title suggests-the breezy romantic rb " too much loose " , " peaceful sundown " , fernando saunder warbling " i sing " lovely " don't you know " all evoke relaxed , romantic mood very pituresqe . saunder bass hip-shaking funk tines " honey 5379 " , deep " you they " " just fun " deep economical it gets-the latter wry commentary groups own music they talk " pleasing everyone " their music " fitting into mold " . like best stevie wonder ( later prince ) jan hammer group actually prove here they more then capable playing music any occasion . it not " black " or " white " sound or " rock " , " funk " , " rb " , " classical ' , " pop " or " jazz " -actually it unique distinctive combination all five styles music . centerpiece album me beautiful , transcendant " window love " -it kind ballad you'd usually hear stevie wonder or elton john but eerie chord progressions reverrbed drums sound all their own . lyrics , although i my personal impressions lyrics it definately sung it truely inspiration someone or any people who opressed-takes earth wind fire lyricism almost religious ferver . most classical element comes steve kindler manic " hyperspace " , perhaps inspired jerry goodman wailing violin theatrics jan old group mahavisnu orchestra . i cannot understand why so many people i read reviews this band think kindler bad musician-i never heard someone express tension egoless playing so much yet so theatrical same time . hammer himself his range keyboardist increbible . course his use synthesizer like spacy hard rock guitar his best known attribute but he play simpler , funkier style moog fender rhodes well . finale " your love " he displays his talents brilliant acoustic pianist-it simple , economical very beautiful ( people who don't like pop music ) say this best song album , even moog flourishes . only things i believe kept this album successful pop chart hit lack familiarity most musicians one other simple fact : if nemperor stopped marketing jan hammer group jazz act then this album would likely joined ranks ' dark side moon ' ' rumours ' one great pop releases 70 . but marketing marketing i thank wounded bird putting this out cd . but if you like 70 pop even if your knowledge classic albums doesn't extend beyong what rolling stone magazine critics or vh1 tells you classic albums this more then worth your time picking up	1

this one serious headtrip connoisseur . all sounds blend out each other . it feels almost darkly sensual how sounds wrap around each other it slightly evocative haunted house ghosts mirror ( admittedly my twisted imagination ) . it manages sound totally psychedelic ( me ) , haunted truly emotional occasions . some you may remember my review lifeforms less than impressed it . this , however , something impressed . this truly awe-inspiring . it truly my favourite fsol album them all ( bar isness/otherness because i haven't got it yet ) . this album works many different levels . if you feeling introspective , this album you . if you want take psychedelic drugs , it may not album you but then it again it could ( depends how it affects you ) . if you want lost sound album , this album you . fact , just buy bloody thing . it'll worth your while , trust me	1

after brit pop movement got exhausted , bands began break off move into very different directions . after great escape , blur treaded into really fuzzed-out tripped out territory . place where white sripes would eventually come . results mind-blowing . where weird sound effects gurgling prior albums subtle hinted , this album it they hit you like brick . those you who heard song 2 thought this album would non-stop indie rock force-to-be-reckoned-with , i don't know what tell you , if anything , song 2 just small part this mind-trip experience . so warned . cd starts out radio-friendly terms beatlesque beetlebum , it serves perfect intro where blur this cd . verses pure minimalist indie-rock style , they break into soothing radio-friendly chorus , outro builds up into torrent buzzing blurry sound-effects eventually eclipse song they're grounded . it encapsulates what come over next hour . song 2 indie-rock extreme album rocking like beast . then you head into country sad ballad man which polar opposite , psychedelic slow-burner uncountable layers acoustic , electric guitars , bass , drums , indefinable bubbling noises . like white blood cells white stripes , this cd no flow it all , listening this first time around , you no idea what hell going happen next . indie/psychedelic texture this disc , blur explore pop music , rock , ballads , pure psychedelia , unknown ( essex dogs ) . it one hell listen leave you mystified coming back more . if you're looking rock music it simultaneously most mystifying haunting , this must .	1

pat metheny john scofield both amazing talents . each one albums shine examples great instrumental guitar work . unfortunately , this album less than sum its parts . collaboration these giants yields two really interesting upbeat songs : " red one " " everybody party .

this probably not best most complete recording available fo show . however , it feature rosiland russel rest obc , which major plus . score many hightlights , strongest quot ; ohioquot ; ( which i think should ohio state song , but that whole different issue ) . bernstein music definatly not bland or forgettable , comden-green lyrics witty all all enjoyable , best demonstrated quot ; one-hundred easy waysquot ; which rosiland russell character describes how lose man . there some duds this show , biggest example quot ; swingquot ; which , aside cheezy lyrics overal bland melody , not make one want swing dance . if this number stronger -- it certainly potential -- if recording liner notes more complete , this would easi ly 5-star recording . unfortunatly , isn't going happen , so you'll setlle order enjoy this great score original cast	1

offspring so far yet put out album really disappoints me . i haven't heard ignition so i can't really say much but i heard everything they've released since smash most least good . this release however better than good , its very good . no it may not amazing smash but it lot great tracks . my favorites " staring sun " , " kids aren't alright " , " she got issues " , " pay man " . here ratings rest album ... 2 . you ever - 9/103 . staring sun - 10/10 4 . pretty fly ( white guy ) - 10/105 . kids aren't alright - 10/106 . feelings - 9.5 /107 . she got issues - 10/10 8 . walla walla - 8/109 . end line - 9/10 10 . no brakes - 7.5 /1011 . why don't you get job ? - 9.5 /10 12 . americana - 8.5 /1013 . pay man - 10/10 overall : 92% a-overall , it isn't best band but it still accomplished release . i'm big fan this band but what i've seen it may not please some fans who enjoy their earlier stuff like smash . i think smash their best but i enjoy their newer stuff well even though its just slightly different sound . i guess slight change enough tick people off . anyway , get this if your fan some tracks or just band itself .	1
phenomenon known ufo begins here . though ufo released albums before this , it wasnt until joining michael schenker , departure mick bolton release phenonmenon ufo found their legendary hard rock sound style . when michael schenker joined band he only guest few gigs , because he member scorpions time , well ended , he left scorpions joined ufo full time . large hole scorpions they called uli jon roth replace . when phenomenon released it bands strongest album so far . album opens up hard rocker ' oh , my ' killer vocals out this world guitar riff solo showed ufo finaly chosen right guitar player job . next rocker/balladier ' crystal light ' filled beautiful lyrics arpegiated guitar must heard hear how well it flows . truly one bands best slower songs . ufo biggest hit ' doctor , doctor ' next blisterng solo fiery leads schenker catchy chorus boot it no wonder this bands biggest hit single .

this most tremendous collection boby rydell music put out ! nothing ever ever perfect even though " fish " not included , so it . way , " butterfly bay " hit his i believe within summer 1963 . now , what sad it nothing this cd . i believe ' 61 into'63 his talents developing enormous clip . during summer ' 63 he starring role ann margaret , dick van dyke , paul lynde huge movie " bye bye birdie " within movie he sang very moving song , " one boy " ann margaret . this one most beautiful duets i've ever seen heard . movie huge success . he followed movie up touching very big hit record , " forget him " . , sadly , became his swan song . many americans truly , very ashamedly , " forget him " . i feel though movie " bye bye birdie " two touching songs , " one boy " ( ann margaret within movie ) big hit , " forget him " , which followed movie , he his way super stardom both recording fields motion pictures . until beatles squashed him their fluff . he ( ) more talent within his little finger than all four beatles ever . fact , his talents outweighed all fluff british artists suddenly began flood our american airwaves including not only beatles , but dave clark five , rolling stones , gerry pace makers , hermans hermets , even many american artists such beach boys , etc . i'm even including groups like " hollies " , etc . producers fluff crushed bobby rydell . it so very unfair when he totally cut out when his total talent becoming more more evident more than likely super stardom horizon . he crushed fluff . it tremendous cd available it sad what beatles other " artists " plus what american public him . shameless .	1

this cassette so popular when it came out- i remember little seven eight year old kids jamming it cabrini green projects chicago- they knew every word heart . they never heard " clean " version . way , isn't label " explicit lyrics " " clean version " contradiction terms ?? how album both same time ??? also , how come no one talks easy-e dying aids ? i guess still taboo subject . anyway , this album precious historical document- it trailblazing expression frustrations amerikkka black urban underclass time ( mid-1980 ) . unfortunately , it also very sexist album tends treat all women ho . i guess you can't everything . public enemy also came out same time they lot more sophisticated lyrically without sexist crap . -dj esperantochicago , il	1

this cd , tom proves once again he not just some las vegas has-been livin ' off oldies . maybe i bizarre tastes music , but i'm big fan both tom jones wyclef jean . combination two little freaky , but hell lot fun ! only reason i don't give it 5 stars there couple cuts i don't like ( like most cds i buy ) . most part , . . ' experimentation collaborations past few years great - ( check out quot ; lead how swing itquot ; quot ; reloadquot ;) . now i'm just waitin ' him hook up george clinton ( thoroughly hip old sob ) ..	1
i think title pretty much says it all . only problem don't they much concert footage . its just them goofing around . i wanted see action , but it pretty good nonetheless . you get see liarsenic , bayonetwork , absentimental videos which pretty good	1
heated cutting contest one trademarks jazz lore , where best friends get up stage together instantly become fiercest rivals . this particular album transplants dynamic into studio , but also adds unique dimension : eldridge father gillespie , musically speaking , time this album recorded dizzy already surpassed his mentor greatest trumpet player . if harold bloom quot ; anxiety influencequot ; literature could adapted music , i think quot ; roy dizquot ; would nice illustration it . one defining characteristics eldridge style taking great , big chances ... pushing himself instrument far they'll go then going even higher . he likened tightrope walker working without net who not afraid falling . dizzy took it next level simply walking faster , falling less often . two them together this record create pure sustained musical swashbuckling , each man pushing other his limits beyond . quot ; pretty-eyed babyquot ; them singing duet , then going into scat-singing cutting session . if these two aren't enough hold your interest , oscar peterson trio provides rhythm support . highly recommended	1
allison moorer third album , we find red-headed singer moving into new sound . lot people didn't like new sound , but i think it great . it still country , just leans more towards alt-country slightly contemporary , whereas her debut strictly traditional country . any allison moorer album you expect some meaningful lyrics , somewhat sad , miss fortune offers those more . album opens dark quot ; tumbling downquot ; , which great video . quot ; cold californiaquot ; interesting breakup song , it first single album . quot ; let goquot ; nice acoustic kind track , very reflective revealing . lyrics album very true blunt . there some good uptempos like quot ; ruby jewel herequot ; , quot ; hey jezebelquot ; , quot ; yessirreequot ; , more . i like midtempo numbers like quot;can't get there herequot ; , quot ; steal sunquot ; , quot ; up this highquot ; , closing quot ;d ying breedquot ; , highlight . overall , biggest misfortune would if you didn't give this album chance	1
i first heard angel 70 when local rock station played full albums their entirety they playing new releases , one them angel . this band just blew me away i went out bought album next day(sad say their later albums never sounded this good ) . i consider this first true progessive metal record ever made , probably one best since . i give every track 10 consider this must buy . \m	1
this music amazing . i first heard divine comedy performed summer music clinic i attended this past summer . i must admit music more powerful live than cd , however even without whole " atmosphere " goes live performance , it still amazing . it gives me chills every time i listen it , because it such powerful piece . other pieces this disc also very good . there couple beginning band , yet even those powerful , despite their simplicity . i strongly recommend this cd anyone who fan robert . smith , classical music general	1
this cd great listening , all way up down . super bon-bon radio hit , but every track bound stick your head after listen or two . lyrics nuts , i don't know what he getting exactly but music just outrageously good . i'm not usually huge fan this genre , whatever genre , but this top-ten disc me	1
curtis mayfield , edwin starr james brown among others , marvin gaye also produced compilated this release , which mostly jazz instrumental album it truly brilliant sense funky . marvin truly shines every album he since he found artistic control following his brilliant quot;what going onquot ; album . it just simply one brilliant collection ! props man even though grammys took more than 20 years until his quot ; comebackquot ; get him his rightful due props ! grade-a masterpiece	1
i traded this lp when it first came out i hungry new classy rock approaches/this filled ticket i listened it over over again/it contains variety great flow/i recommend these pieces anyone who enjoys solid psyc approach very accessable creative/i put this work up there first deep purple moby grape because it timeless , fresh exceptional listen even years later/i won't take this one out house ; too precious/you might give ' bangor flying circus ' listen , it also classic my humble opinion/with bonus getting second album one cd , this great deal	1
this wonderful album . so much melody , so many twists turns , so much fun . if you're not already love this album , then i recommend starters track 7 , hand heart , track 18 , warm regards . play these three times row ( high volume , it should obvious ) , then you'll dying hear rest album . there hardly anything detractive say fire garden . hm , let try hard : well , blowfish bit too distorted my taste . initially i found little alligator all eve too grungy , but now i'm also fond them . whookam weenie story funny ten runs ; now i skip them , but that ok . steve vai not natural born singer like robert plant bono , but he worked lot it ( like everything else he , let not forget ) , he become really good . ( i just don't understand his detractors this point . ) i couldn't imagine anybody else singing brother ( not all his spellbinding dying your love album real illusions : reflections ) . what he his guitar just beyond words . crying machine killer ( several other reviewers noted ) . he also other excellent musicians playing particularly drums ( i guess john kalodner his job well again , whatever it ) . listen while , then stand awe !	1
george lopez comedy never gets stale or outdated . long latino continues all wonders they , laughs continue roll . not only laughs appeal chicano , but it humor everyone relate , because life hilarious , thank you george helping us remember ..	1
sound , sound , sound . this band brings ear candy plenty . distorted singing them bones riffs rooster this album definitely treat ears	1
before " beneath remains " got sepultura attention they deserved , there " schizophrenia " . pure , straight ahead thrash album suggestions things come future , " schizophrenia " isn't essential metal masterpiece " beneath remains " , " arise " , or " chaos a.d. " would , but there plenty admire here . " wall " features one most excellent guitar solos ever heard andreas kisser , even though igor cavalera drumming isn't kind insane assault would his trademark later albums , it still unbelieveably heavy reminiscent dave lombardo slayer metal blade days . " escape void " " inquisition symphony " great well , only downside " schizophrenia " it wear bit thin towards end album , production ( even if this remastered ) still sounds shoddy . despite all , " schizophrenia " sepultura what " kill ' em all " " show no mercy " metallica slayer : not best come either band , but good sample what come .	1
i bought this album when it first came out enjoy every song album . my very favorite this album " broken engagement " . two variations this song sung suzanne ( her early years grown-up ) awesome . when i travel i always take this album me enjoy . i am also buying album this amazon so i always able enjoy songs . i wish alison krauss would produce album like this cox family . it would fantastic	1
this cd so good !! i really wish braid wouldn't broken up ! it would so cool see braid get up kids together ... trompe le monde great song . everyone go out buy all braid cds !	1

though i didn't become big fan george strait until i saw him movie pure country , i think george put out some excellent records . his ' 99 album always never same no exception . record initial hit single , " meanwhile " , classic george strait country song . waltzing tempo song reminiscent one george early hit songs , " you look so good love " , although " meanwhile " bit slower . what would album george if it didn't least one lost-love song it ? besides " meanwhile " , this record includes two other songs lost-love theme , " that truth " " 4 minus 3 equals zero " , latter song added dimension marital breakup . strait album not all cry-in-your-beer , though . this album , " write this down " , " one you " , title song " always never same " fun , up-tempo songs i think danced lot dance floors . furthermore , george three positive love songs this record : " i look you " , " that where i wanna take our love " , " what you say " . this listenable , well-pu t-t ogether album , like practically everything george . george still excellent record always never same	1
there three circle collections . general opinion first album best , third album close second this weakest three . i love all three but this one particularly appeals me . it many traditional musicians singers but also few less obvious singers like john denver , levon helm ( band ) , john prine , roger mcguinn ( byrds ) , paulette carlson ( highway 101 ) bruce hornsby . perhaps it presence such guests some dislike but you can't please everybody . whatever you may think normal music some guests recorded , they all justify their place this excellent album traditional music , sometimes singing songs they've previously recorded , but adapted traditional setting . some them , it may their chance record some traditional country without upsetting their fans or their record label . both would understand this ( them ) one-off . they certainly made most their opportunity . so we get bruce hornsby singing playing piano valley road , but traditional country/bluegrass style . roger mcguinn chris hillman , both ex-members byrds , sing play guitar you ain't going nowhere , bob dylan song recorded byrds sixties . michael martin murphey sings plays guitar lost river , one his own songs . john hiatt sings duet roseanne cash one step over line . john prine sings plays guitar his song grandpa carpenter . some songs oldies like life railway heaven ( featuring johnny cash ) , i'm sitting top world ( featuring jimmy martin ) , title track ( featuring everybody but particularly johnny cash , roy acuff ricky skaggs ) amazing grace , instrumental solo randy scruggs . other songs appear originals including so it goes ( featuring john denver ) , mary danced soldiers ( featuring emmylou ) lovin ' side ( featuring paulette carlson ) . if you haven't got any circle albums , this album great one start , especially if you're relatively new traditional country music	1
so , i just bought this version , after owning revival cast , it recently . there definitly good things this recording . music beautiful old joe beautiful voice . also , joe hardy better this recording than revival . unfortunately lola not greatest this cast , i much perfered revival lola . so which version should you get ? collectors , should get both , people who perfer more classical musical theater should get this version . other than , new version , better , better value . favorite song : " goodbye , old girl	1

rough tumble , powerhouse rock ' roll band , aerosmith america answer british rock . ' toys attic ' , released march 1975 , may not their greatest album ( would follow-up ' rocks ' ) , but it pretty darn close . building their success old fashioned way late john houseman would say ( they earned it ! ) , aerosmith ultimate road warriors , playing america high school gyms social halls while worrying if they get axe their own record company they came symbolize hard rock excellence 1970 . anthems well known probably overplayed some classic rock radio . " sweet emotion " always my top three ... into , outro , sleeze , sass ... man its all there , including voice box guitar ! " toys " , song , opens album primal urgency , kind like boston own " immigrant song " . " no more no more " good it gets ; lyrics ( road got bitch ! ) , arrangement , production - all flawless ! " round round " sabbathesque , heavy aerosmith would ever get ! " walk this way " bugs me now but it still one most inflential songs last 30 years ( rock rap anybody ) . " adam apple " more my style , back when cain abel ! ( check ou live version ' pandora box ' joe " f'n perry saying " this hard work " before he launches into riff ! ) . whatever drugs band doing , oh my they aplenty , they seemed help them create this timeless material . although mister tyler may not remember " you see me cryin " ( story hilarious book " walk this way " ) , aerosmith enthusiasts never forget merry-go round 1975 , year america threw her hat into ring hard rock greatness	1
even though brian wilson voice changed bit since heydey beach boys sixties , he still delivers some nice versions old songs , easy going manner audience . i love song " love mercy " , i'm glad he included it this concert	1
i love this show ! said , i not care this version it . inclusion word " concept " title means it just . this , thankfully , not final version show would later spawn hit song , " one night bangkok " . most broadway musicals , musical numbers tell basic story show . if you listen recordings phantom , mama mia , beauty beast , you discern basic storyline show . listening this particular recording chess , though , leave you wondering " what ? " broadway arrival chess saw much needed reworking storyline arrangement musical numbers . this recording seems too much like mish-mash songs don't really relate each other . musical fanatics ( like myself ) , i say " yes , you should this recording your collection " , if only understand how much work went into show before it opened broadway . if you only buying album because " one night bangkok " , purchase broadway recording instead ; you'll much happier performance phillip casnoff rather than murray head	-1
where i thought " side " showed angry poet , this record shows us same man , grown older full pain . some songs just want make you cry , they so good , so personal . it really hard praise " blood tracks " enough . it one best records ever made . imagery " tangled up blue , " stay you long after record ends . " if you see her , say hello " move you " you're big girl now . " " idiot winds " haunt you " lily , rosemary jack hearts , " excite you . i love this record	1
this band caught my attention little steven underground garage . although i usually shy away catchy pop songs , i say contrast writes them better than today emo bands or mainstream shoe-gazing brit pop bands ten years ago . i can't really compare them anyone current , but guitar work reminds me early dumptruck if they prozac ( ok ... i'm 35 years old out touch current music ) . high points album disconnected , something tells me , your starring role . i need check out some their early work	1
honestly , i'd never actually heard magic sam when i bought this album , but lot reading blues brought me purchase magic sam quot ; black magic . quot ; i now own everything sam-related i get my hands . this album my favorite , while others may recommend quot ; west side soulquot ; over this , quot ; black magicquot ; seems his most steady arranged material available . magic sam blends chicago blues sound soul inspired voice both riviting relaxing . everyone i listen this album ends up loving it . quot ; black magicquot ; constantly my listening rotation , i would recommend this album highly anyone who any taste soul , ramp ; , or blues	1

jelly jam features ty tabor guitar ( king ) , john myung bass ( dream theater ) , rod morgenstein drums ( dixie dregs ) . i would say jelly jam more ty tabor side project than others here , since he wrote all lyrics most music this album . you might very well imagine , there healthy dose king sounding material this disc . matter fact " st " could king album ( without pennick vocal ) , especially relative king " gretchen " era . jelly jam " st " just magnificent effort . it far best thing i've ever heard king side project , there many . this album filled killer hooky riffs , rumbling towering leads , killer right pocket rhythm section ! but most awe inspiring part " st " amazing song writing going here , especially musical end . monster riffs go hand hand beautiful intense melodies married ty , lennon like vocals , lush tapestry sonic delights fill ones ears . this album rivals " gretchen " me . there no mistake ty must central figure conceiving king material their early years . " st " just rocks no end , filled songs would fit perfectly " gretchen ! " matter fact , " st " whole rocks harder than " gretchen , " without losing it exotic flavor mixing hendrix , pink floyd , beatles , rush , pat travers into smoldering concoction epic proportion so evident " gretchen ! " jelly jam " st " far my favorite post 2000 album , essential anyone interested king or king influences . your ears addicted ! i know mine !	1
i borrowed title former dead kennedy vocalist , jello biafra , who many aspects long mirrored embodied same wry witted , conversationally suicidal social critiques late bill hicks - before hicks , actually . both completely unremitting their damning-yet-accurate views empire-thirsty , right wing dystopia wrought dissemblance , blind nationalism , headcase christian fundamentalism , mindless consumption xenophobia . bill often delivered his message zeal preacher . fact , he often compared thought one . yet he railed frantically against hypocrisy lunacy right wing , christian fundamentalist movement , case you're not awake , these very same corporate hitmen statist mass murderers who charge throughout 1980s , who now unconstitutionally charge again hoping bring their uniquely vile interpretation theocratic state . i'm talking " pro nuclear armament " christians , against-abortion-yet-all-in-favor-of-the-death-penalty-and-invading-foreign-countries-and-slaughtering-and-raping-scores-of-men-women-and-children " pro life " projective crowd . you know , wholesome , morally upright ' christians ' who blame poor people gulf not leaving . bill divergent attacks aren't against faith or christianity , but very narrow margin it far-right projective movement he wisely perceived ominous threat particular form fascism which politically amassed within corporate structures , , time shown , used subvert ongoing evolution our species attempting further cloud public perceptions . bill rants alive these observations , much like jello biafra , seem prophetic looking back , given what transpired , how many us weren't wide awake we should've all these years . it also noteworthy how hick undeniably influenced ever brazen syndicated talk radio crier new world order fascism , alex jones , who likewise , if not ironically , also texan . i immediately thought hicks when i saw jones crash press conference then governor george bush , lit into babbling thug series questions media suckers enablers wouldn't dare touch , only hauled off out handcuffs . it sort fearless evocation hicks , not caring what others thought him . their problem , not his . many find it odd bill believer , strong faith , spoke passionately god , potential world peace unity within our grasp should we ever decide collectively make it so . he so because he blessed what many right wingers apparently not : big heart , conscience , inquisitive , sharp intellect . other hand , bill often likened his work " chomsky dick jokes . " ' rant ' good place start although there more acutely felt view bill life found tracing his early work end his short lived life which became colored somewhat newfound ease , spiritual sobriety , his struggles media censorship , coming terms illness unfortunately took him life beyond before more people would hear his message . briefly address oft debated denis leary vs bill hicks issue , it rather simple actually : yes , leary stole bits hicks ' routines . however , leary put spin it ; instead coming liberal/progressive/chomskyan critique angle , appealing subversive sensibilities , he dumbed it down depoliticized , sports lovin ' , beer chuggin ' middle ground crowd , which assured more angry , white guys their female counterparts would respond favorably , much same republican talk radio fox " news " mentality enshrouds our societal din erodes public discourse . afterall , when dealing people whose every assumption regarding our current state affairs incorrect , it impossible even begin debate . it irrational . it mindset lures basis appealing mass ignorance free floating anxieties , both personal social , largely find no other * convenient * acknowledgement . other words , leary encouraged accepted mode his crowds existence , where hicks , much like lenny bruce , questioned confronted it ways really made some people think , therefore become uncomfortable surly . those didn't like hicks really didn't like him , ya know ? alone speaks volumes . it why leary more popular , so speak , than hicks ; he used more profanity than bill , but far less ideologically politically profane iconoclastic . if there message found rant minor , within bill voice , it we all passion energy what true just within our hearts ... soul , voice question express ourselves , we should express ... it immoral , perhaps sin , instead submit , not so while we live world where we still ability so	1
so sings elderane elf last track , tower , maybe he right , regard life general regard this opera . it would not possible understand story lyrics themselves , but insert contains 5 1/2 pages (!) fine print which explain plot . maybe helps appreciation little ( it certainly indicates effort expended tobias project ) but music fine its own . here real opera 10 parts sung 10 different performers , every one 13 tracks represents very listenable power metal . it cliff hanger though ; you not know what happens young maiden held prison witchcraft until you listen part 2 . i considered giving it five stars but decided it fits my listening often category more than listening over over . ( please see my profile brief discussion my rating philosophy . ) 1/8/07 revision . may last year i gave this four stars . i've listening it lot lately decided it fits my criteria five	1

milan records owns rights lot later piazzolla canon , since his death steadily mining its holdings number cd reissues compilations readily identified milan similarity cover art used . don't fooled four seasons buenos aires , however . while it fine recording , piazzolla not appear it anything but composer . i didn't read back cd cover before i bought it so when i opened it , i surprised find cover fooled me into thinking piazzolla featured . i played it anyway , prepared worst , many offerings piazzolla compositions turn out mediocre best . first , it seemed like my fears confirmed , but after several listens i warmed music . those familiar ap " four seasons " sequence know they among most classically oriented his works only slightest connection tango . but they also know when performed piazzolla one his musical formations , they among most powerful his longer works . anyone taking task interpretation better know well what heck they doing or risk making musical fools themselves . this interpretation " four seasons " brazilian orchestra my view started rather weakly . it isn't until " winter " ( invierno porteno ) reached power majesty music comes fruition . there out , rest cd quite good . my favorites remainder three parts " libertango " sequence they performed which features some excellent mandolin work deus xango , which closes recording jazzy rendering oddly reminiscent some old cti-era jazz recordings . weakness start drops star , but its rest recording which puts this recommended category anyone who loves music astor piazzolla	1

i've mentioned many my other reviews , hip-hop originates houston close spot my heart . dj screw style slowed-down , chopped up music hooked me upon my first listen it , even though he gone now , rest h-town continue carry his legacy slow-tempo , syrupy music , slurry accent . i've got lot favorites residing houston , ranging chamillionaire , big moe , paul wall , lil ' keke , lil ' pokey , among others . however , my favorite entire bunch , ironically , rapper least amount ties dj screw - devin dude . i turned onto devin through dr. dre 2001 record , like many others presumably . his chorus " **** you " so explicit , yet so hilarious , his verse so smooth , i check this kid out . finding out he comes h-town turned me onto cat even more , once i listened tryin ' ta live , i hooked . devin dude smoothest emcee this side .. heck , i really don't know who smoother than devin . some would argue too $hort , but even first pimp rap hard time matching charisma resonates devin body . not only this dude coolest thing this side smirnoff ice , he also lyrics back it up ; he may not mathematical emcee some backpackers fiend , but he tight rhymes , laced humor rarely found elsewhere . southern grooves found all over this album , hilarious tales retold player you never hate . this album tha x-treme both tight hell , but i think this one may rank little bit above it successor , due songs like " i-hi " " lacville ' 79 . " still , if you're one hip-hop heads who enjoys good music no matter where it comes , devin sophomore effort , tryin ' ta live , you	1

it took me few listens , but i grown quite fond this album cannot seem get it out my cd player . i never heard anything else psyche so i cannot compare this anything else they their long career . haunting melodies sorrowfull droning vocals . there alot passion mix here . you feel everything darren singing . musically i could compare this alot different synth bands , but sound pretty unique . echoing drums reminescent lycia , drawn out synth lines deep overtones sprinkling piano either synthesized or very amplified guitar . my only complaint few songs lack variation seem drone same direction without hooks or buildup any sort . some very excellent tracks here though , my favorites until , theme 7/assassin reprise .	1

oh boy ... it really pains me write this review say things i'm say , but ... i no choice ! this , far i'm concerned , without doubt weakest ac/dc record ever . i know lot diehards going want hang me such heretic , but ... i'm sorry , i grew up listening " back black " , " those rock " , " highway hell " " razor edge " , so you imagine how dissapointed i feel when i listen slow songs like " can't stop rn'r " , " come get it " " damned " ... darn record chock full songs like !!! god , mercy ... whenever i problems sleep , i put this pill ... i can't listen it , i'm not joking !!! there , course , some great songs : title track , " safe ny city " , " satellite blues " , " give it up " stellar , some best songs band ever written . sure , songwriting way more focused than say ... " fly wall " , but songs , most part , painfully slow long , they lack punch ( except those tracks i mentioned earlier ... ) what record gains songwriting focus it loses heavyness , i think it bad tradeoff . so , 4 great , fast , rocking songs out 12 ... how bad ? well , i'll let you decide , but i know , least me , this record truly stiff beyond recovery ...	-1

" strangers night " frank sinatra first big hit single since " witchcraft " , eight years earlier . some people apparently don't care song , but it win grammy record year ( what it worth ) . back 1960s , when someone smash hit single they would usually title subsequent album after it , which case here . album also includes follow up single , " summer wind " , which also hit , albeit not big one . rest album features seemingly random mix songs , some old some new . sinatra sings songs well , but some songs don't really suit him , like " downtown " " yes sir , that my baby " . overall , pretty good album , albeit short one ( 27 minutes long )	1
i remember cinderella 80s early 90s . i still remembered their songs like nobody fool don't know what you got . i am regular local bar they best cinderella their jukebox i played those songs . they still held up i take into account their solid musicianship . i got this cd i found it wal mart less than 10 bucks so i figured might well . i even remembered when they sold out shelter me . it took me back 80s i didn't feel so nutty any more some reason i regained lot my looks i had- least right now i don't physically look different . their sound shelter me it still sounds exactly same nobody fool , etc , it just it watered down not initimidating . get this if you miss 80s metal don't care newer mtv bands .	1
1990 , george michael released his second album entitled , listen without prejudice volume 1 . this album not what faith turned out , this album , still taking up george sound pop/rb , sheds george his faith skin . this great album cover concept what going world . praying time first single album . this song beyond amazing . it definitely one best songs this album . it seems focus way we all struggle survive world today . i think he trying point out making money these days not all hunky dory . if listen closely just music , it'll sound like something john lennon would compose . freedom 90 second single album . no , this not re-recorded rendition classic hit he wham ! hit he wham ! dance type love song , while this song just george throwing away his " faith " days shedding new skin . music video went this single definitely my favorite george michael music video . george not appear video , but five sexy supermodels appear . those five models : " linda evangelista " , beautiful , innocent-looking short-haired blonde , wearing only turtleneck sweater , " naomi campbell " , foxy african-american brit , who dances around , wearing bikini headphones , " christy turlington " , doe-eyed brunette who walks straight down living room hall , wrapped around bed sheet , " cindy crawford " , sexy brunette , who relaxes , while taking bath , " tatjana patitz " , seductive german blonde , who stands up against wall , smoking cigarette . they won't go when i go this song originally recorded back 1974 stevie wonder . i never heard stevie wonder version i not care hear it because i not like stevie wonder or his pathetic music . but when i heard george rendition , i immediately flipped over it . he sings it so smooth he sings it heart . something save acoustic guitar really brings out sound this song music . not bad song . cowboys angels fifth final single album . this amazing song seems focus two different people who seemed found each other seemed found love each other . definitely beautiful song . medley : waiting day/you can't always get what you want third single album . usually , medlies performed live concert live promotional performances , but george decided record studio medley . this song more impressive than i expected . " waiting day " also george shedding his skin his " faith " album coming into era . definitely great song(s ) . mothers pride not bad . heal pain fourth single album . i cannot go without listening this song . this one absolutely amazing . acoustic guitar incredible . harmonies amazing . george voice , usual , outstanding . definitely song not miss . soul free not bad . waiting ( reprise ) this song brings this album end reprise " waiting day/you can't always get what you want " medley . this version even better , especially sounding more mellow more subtle , george voice sound very smooth soothing . song no fan should skip . before i got this album , i expecting only two or three songs worth listening , since i considered faith george best album . but after listening entire album , i shocked hear how incredible this album . faith , me , still stands his best album , but listen without prejudice volume 1 one step behind faith . this album definitely worth time money	1

this two-disc deluxe edition famous influential " beano " album . disc one contains both mono original release ( 1966 ) stereo version ( 1969 ) john mayall bluesbreakers eric clapton album . review disc one , i would refer you many existing reviews original release this important album . i add little all that said before , other than say listen carefully you heard stepping out . ramblin ' my mind features young eric vocals style he came develop his solo career . disc two ( reason i bought deluxe edition ) contains 19 extra tracks , interesting part if , like me , you already own original version bluesbreakers album cd . extra tracks 1-13 both live studio . instance , there some bbc radio live studio broadcasts 1965 early 1966 some recording studio session tracks , which predated album . sound quality quite good tracks 1-13 couple those tracks highlight ( even early stage ) eric clapton playing style he known . but best all , extra tracks 14 19 recorded live flamingo club london march april 1966 . those recordings often primitive , raw , muddy distorted , but you'll hear some clapton most fiery fluid playing blues guitar standards 14 . they call it stormy monday , 17 . you ever loved woman 19 . hoochie coochie man . stormy monday same track that john mayall looking back , tracks 17 19 ( above ) , amongst others , same tracks released john mayall primal solos . there nevertheless 9 unreleased tracks disc 2 . this album era when eric clapton played gibson les paul developed his reputation " god " . it must-have album eric clapton fans , this deluxe edition , packaging original album , 19 extra tracks 20 page booklet , gives you best comprehension how it all happened . they say , rest history ...... whilst i praised clapton musical giant he become , credit should given john mayall astute influential band-leader , mentor young eric catalyst london blues scene .	1
so , i ended up buying this album not main piece , golijov ayre but upshaw version berio folksongs . fact , length time i've this disc , which couple months , least , i never even once attempted listening golijov piece . truth matter , i kept telling myself i didn't like goljov - which silly contradictory me since i've always enjoyed golijov dreams prayers isaac blind . fact , because i knew i enjoyed isaac blind , i investigated whether or not i'd enjoy golijov newly released opera , ainadamar . after listening some 30 second samples amazon.com, i must admit i wasn't impressed what i heard . i also investigated his la pasion segun san marcos only arrive opinion it , too , lacking very many ways . i immediately figured aside isaac blind , golijov other material seemed bland , unempathetic largely undeveloped - almost if he hurry prolific ! well , needless say , my opinion him immediately changed when i finally decided listen ayre . very first note , i realized it golijov my familiarity isaac blind i instantaneously drawn . rhythm exotic , casual , yet refined , harmony transported me away 21st century america into wholly other multi-cultural dimension . introduction holds you suspense , awaiting what next , then gradually shifts into mode encompassed jewish arabesque tones colors . upshaw singing so evocative pronounced , just like her performance gorecki " symphony no . 3 , " she doesn't spare any emotion her performance . her voice alone adds so much texture these songs ! song cycle ranges beautiful absurd , times , upshaw singing leading way . while music itself often appears move place place , never seeming touch same place twice , there actually so much cohsiveness each song it impossible not realize these songs rely upon each other their strength viability just like any other architectural composition . some people harangue golijov popular living composer , often berating him fallible characterizations . some even claim he isn't original only recycling what come before order put himself among ranks mozart , mahler , shostakovich . one reviewer belows states , golijov considered brittany spears classical . far it , i see it ! golijov music no less original than many other composers , including mozart himself . fact , it truly quite difficult find any composer , living or dead , who not inspired or not find their cue music preceded them . golijov may take certain themes borrowed previous composers ( such composing song cycle based berio folksongs ) incorporate those themes into larger scheme , but such inspiration no different than countless composed renditions " variations theme paganini . " don't let overly traditionalist music-lovers stray you away this release ! it truly what your heart , soul , ears searching	1
this recording makes wonderful background music , but it not background music . it very inventive musician exploring music great composer it deserves close listening . fred hersch impeccable pianist billy strayhorn often lush compositions perfect vehicles him . string orchestra under direction eric stern provides accent accompaniment without ever becoming instrusive or overwhelming . everything fits together nicely every cut worthwhile . if i choose favorite it would beautiful " lament orchid .	1

i admit when this album first came out , i so dissapointed . i only liked through rain bringin ' heartbreak time . i disliked album so much i gave it friend lol . but then i just recently started listening it again , i love nearly every song album . okay , her vocals aren't very best , but they way underrated . songs like " lullaby " " you your chance " , her falsetto makes songs sound kinda mysterious sexy . those who think her voice " gone " , listen through rain subtle invitation , espeically end both songs . incredible ! some mariah best vocals ever . her voice evolved soul-less empty during music box days . what you guys miss youthful sound she , but this album recorded 10 years after era . what i love mariah almost singing save herself now . so much conviction her voice . i really think if you dislike this album because vocals , listen it again like i , you'll probably like it lot more . only songs i dislike this record " boy " , " sunflowers " , " ttr remix " . i also like irresistable without rappers lot better . it some promo cd . but i really dont mind rappers much anymore	1
its shame todays world all producer needs copy someone elses work take credit it . sometimes results good though , sometimes bad . but tell you truth , this really isn't best albums using blue note samples . if you want hear real rawness flavour these tracks , i would advise you get originals . you would then not dissapointed . otherwise if you just looking mixed up compilation cuts have'nt really worked properly but still sound ok because original elements there , get this . i like lootpack , madlib other productions especially madlibs(quasi , ynq)own projects too , i love hip hop , mostly hip hop sampled jazz cuts which big part my life( i.e. tcq , black sheep , chi ali , kmd , lotns , main source , artifacts , premiers stuff , ditc , etc . 90 time , list goes forever !! ) added them little extra flavour . but reality , theres lot originals always better because they their own arrangements vocals sounding excellent already , then work newer versions just take good parts away , make it sound wack or change it horribly . original artists came up music , wrote it down , then played real instruments ! (thats talent ! ) , not digital workstations , samplers , turntables grooveboxes easy access stealing tracks getting credit it . so you beat make it worthwhile what you actually doing otherwise it waste time , whether ten steps ahead , or one step ahead , but never back any steps !!. don't get me wrong , i use all these types equipment studios too aswel instruments . sampling excellent if properly like madlib shown before . if you achieve nice sound original progress it or highlight sections make them stand out different sections compositions without ruining it , thats tight !. but here theres nothing makes it any way good originals , mostly not sound too good . mainly because production reasons , i not feel enough put into it or thought advance original blue note compositions . it change perceptions deeply . i mean , one example , bobbi humphreys sampled cut ' please set me ease'has processed sounds like it auto bpm mixed beat wav studio it makes it sound electronic(not intentionally ) off-key , it gets repetitive , i liked hearing 6-7 minutes original never got bored it because its variation bobbis singing , it also sounded how it should sound like(the quality ) . theres so much say this album , but not enough space or time , i just hope hope blue note would call me up next time , i really appreciate all their work my heart . but if you just looking little flavour you don't know too much blue note , i'd say get it . if you ear genuine love instrumental compositions blue note work , any other good jazz artists , or even if you produced while know using samples too you understand me . otherwise it must your level not mine so tick me ' unhelpful ' . i give this 2 stars , 1 fact it contains blue note classics 1 madlibs appreciation effort too . he tight producer , its just this don't show his real skills . but thats all !! hope i helped . choose wisely people ! peace	-1
i think it very difficult discover entire cd ( though i admit i prefer disc 1 ) reels through emotions piano evoke . don't worry , it not all solo piano ; there orchestral accompaniments throughout , but this one simplest , sweetest renditions clair de lune i heard . i no problem correct labeling songs when i downloaded it my computer , though . i think this great beginner classical cd -- , if you're not sure which composer you'd like try something else , you get good variety . ( no focusing just baroque , thank you very much . ) happy listening	1
year 1998 time changed lots music world ... least country . quite popular female country artist shania twain decided after making two albums make album would little bit ... or much commercial .

i never thought diana could top her lady sings blues soundtrack , but girlfriend blue . i really think this her best work ever . her renditions these standards more authentically jazzy than her lstb recordings . this true orchestration well . her version but beautiful pretty damn close billie . i think most people agree diana not billie holiday . however , sheer beauty diana voice more than compensates . she super cool easy living totally bewildered you've change . her rendition solitude melancholy hauntingly beautiful . she easy laid back what difference . she also sings behind beat which enhances her take this song . this project testament diana versatility , depth ability recording artist . i truly hope she ventures more into world jazz -- i think deep down she jazz singer . i recommend this cd anyone who enjoys good jazz .	1

friends distinction one best soul groups 60 early 70 . you actually cannot put them just one category , because they delved into pop music some more soulful rb ballads expertise unsurpassed era . " grazin grass " monster hit you could not help but sing every time you heard song( " bir-hir-hir-hirrrrrds dartin ' ... out trees !!! " ) ... period . it fun song listen sing . my favorite this group all time very blusey " i really hope you " " you got me going circles " which my estimation riveled some other soul groups like delfonics temptations it silky smooth delivery . mannnn !!! i could listen million times . i also liked " love or let me lonely " which great pop smash hit it own right(the horn string arrangements simply fabulous ) . they absolutely ... " bomb .	1

i adore this latest release vertical horizon . three cd i this group , this my favorite , which says lot because i played their last cd , everything you want , constantly . go more refined sound than everything you want while still keeping edgy , but not quite metal sound . group seems worked out their place music world going james taylor like sound running thin ice trying metal band sound everything you want . it perfect blend . after only listening it twice i couldn't get song i'm still here out my head . vocal blending members ' voices nicely collaborated just enough vocal originality lead singer not confused all those other bands . song styles fairly similar so cd blends well without monotomy every song sounding exactly same . whether you new this band or long time fan you hooked this cd	1
great music , vocals almost sound semi skater i prefer masculine vocals but they made cd good sound equalization . this title better than their " putp " but im glad i both	1
nearly four decades musical magic jimmy smith , kenny burrell grady tate kicked-off 1965 this master trio album . album name - organ grinder swing - became synonimous jimmy smiths concert highlight throughout his long career . " organ grinder swing " opens this album gets treat you expect this classic tune fast straight 4/4 fascinating interplay smith burrell(not too many organist recorded this tune , guess why ? ) . " oh , no , babe " drenched-down blues where both smith burrell gives power demonstration their deep musical roots . lovely ballad " i'll close my eyes " 3 minute pure mellowness demonstrates smiths passion ballads . later over-recorded " satin doll " , written duke ellington rounds up this great album nice organ registration changes became jimmy trademark ( smith always claimed he inspired erroll garner playing block chords adding fats waller sound ) . organ jazz produced many excellent drummers , but some stands out - grady tate one few . everything said kenny burrell his guitar wizardry . organ grinder swing must every serious jazz collection	1
i fan cold blood since their great debut lp 1969 . luckily i saw them once eastowne ballroom detroit 1971 . they opening act 3 band show . after bands intro instrumental " shop talk " , vocalist lydia pense became focus stage . she vocally loose , very stage active ! behind her rhythm section cooked . keyboardist raul matute purred his hammond , bass man rod ellicott oddly played funky hofner ( beatle ) bass . their horn section very tight , adding punch every song , very well arranged . i walked out night loving every minute their set , much bigger fan than before . i bought all their subsequent lp , hoped see them play again soon . this small label 1973 sound board recording dig music brings me back evening . although this cd offers only 5 songs ( 40+ minutes ) minimal audience ( no mention recording date or location ) , cold blood plays all songs pure funk fire ! songs added vitality " live " , vocals key , horns crisp , nothing sounds tired ! no , this not one those " we played these songs waaaay too many years , sorry , we only here money " sets . lydia voice sounds great , she loose , hits some astonishingly high notes . this " one kind " release , cold blood enjoying music truly their own . blend lydia soulful voice , pure stax arrangements . oddly nothing here sounds outdated almost 30 years later ! how they ever came out bay area i never completely understand ? only negatives this cd release short set , mono recording ( hopefully they expand length this cd release ) . it however truly document their early 70 " live " shows . so anyone who enjoyed cold blood , you love this dream cd ! unfortunately i never saw them again live , but this cd they confirm exactly what i heard night 3 decades ago . tightest 70 soul band west mississippi	1
this my 1st yanni cd . i loved it so much bought several others , but others pale comparison this one . this cd more neoclassical feel , instruments less " synthesized " than other cds . example , it sounds if he playing real piano rather than playing synthesizer computer generated sound . i wake up this every morning , i frequently play it softly work . but best thing walk ocean beach this playing your headphones ... what moving experience ! try it if you	1
most these tunes acquire nice , attention-getting emotional edge their acoustic settings . " she blinded me science " hilarious no matter what you it . enjoy	1
there something strange primative beats laid down kimbrough his band . view into what blues may sounded like 50 years ago , but amp'ed up . it tough pull yourself away this sound . liner notes robert palmer also great . if you looking soemthing different , but great , check out this album	1

joan osborne pretty little stranger gem . her voice style reminiscent very early linda ronstadt , when she country . those old enough remember ronstadt early years recognize compliment . better yet , songs lovely interesting , something one rarely finds , intelligent lyrics . you're not likely hear this music mainstream radio stations , but i liked it lot	1
these guys really good ! rodrigo pick gabriela fingers ( hands guitar percussion ; there such thing ? i guess yes ! ) . great stuff ! they rock	1
this album fantastic ! songs pop it finest - gentle , charming , catchy , fun sing . boy least likely plays simple music that easy ears . after hearing banjo " gentle me " stellar chorus " paper cuts " first time , i hooked . i hear subtle beach boys influences , although this isn't exactly groundbreaking record , it just so good you'll hardly notice . instrumentation simple yet flawless . xylophones , banjos , handclaps ... lo-fi sound really works this group , album enjoyable first song last . highlights really include every track . each one good its own , collection they form awesome album . child-like charm found " monsters , " " i'm glad i hitched my apple wagon your star , " " i see spiders when i close my eyes " irresistable . all indie pop i've heard , this ranks up there shins belle sebastian . i recommend this anyone who likes feel-good pop songs . it just might best record 2005 . note : i no clue why amazon charging $30.99 this , but don't get it here . either wait until it released u.s. or buy it www.insound.com , where it only $14.99	1
this hands down best slayer album next reign blood but thats just my opinion . if your fan extreme thrash metal then you should get this , songs range everything war , death , murder destruction horrors hell so lyrics allways deal dark subject matter but doesn't mean this album bad infact its high quality album its just not alot people gonna like this so its just matter taste . drummer dave lambardo pretty good job within fast aggressive music both guitarists kerry king jeff hanneman make some wild blistering solos especially songs like war ensemble skeletons society which best songs ever !. tom ayara good vocalist this sort thrash music very good bass player , all this makes whole uncomprimising album not mention fantastic underrated songs like dead skin mask which inspired notorious serial killer ed gein song hollowed point get this album now !.	1
i don't like compare arrangements songs era era . if song works certain arrangement , i consider itself great achievemen t.t hese songs all arranged singer each innovative , sensual , relaxing extraordinarily well performed . this isn't usual brand " jazz " singers recent years wonderful voices but tired arrangements gershwin other great songs . this cd brings new life these songs just when you thought last monheit , krall bentyne etc cd buried song generation . this cd one coolest its genre quite while . just wait til you hear fretless bass solo " help " . very cool indeed ..	1

johnny rotten must upset his record company when he recorded this effort . production sloppy there doesn't appear any attempts song construction . it simply jah wobble wobbling while rotten moans rants unintelligibly . it wouldn't surprise me if all tracks recorded one take one day . blah blah blah pil first album much better	-1
i started collecting this series ultra trance 4 , blown away , especially awesome second disc . but volume 5 , i found myself skipping some mediocre songs , there simply nothing i heard " wow factor " tracks like white room . 6 still not good 4 , but i honestly feel this solid release casual listeners ( like myself ) . unlike last time , i'm not skipping anything , there couple tracks i actually love . tracking treasure down , can't sleep find way made album worth purchase , my eyes . if you're like me you don't already import best trance around world , this probably worthy purchase . if you're more worldly up-to-date this stuff , you should probably pass ... you probably didn't need me tell you	1
ammonia avenue many parsons fans ' favorite album . it also many least favorite . it furthering his change towards pop music , prog rock he began . album opens prime time , one better tracks . it fame , star , much same limelight ( later album stereotomy ) , but not quite good . still , it quite enjoyable . let me go home reminds me i don't wanna go home turn friendly card . both aren't very good . lyrically , this song doesn't fit album , lyrics themselves don't seem go together . easily worst song album . one good reason step up . it bit repetitive , but it catchy , worth listening context album . while it not great out context , all parsons albums meant listened start finish . though this album theme not apparent , it still flows should treated concept album . since last goodbye ballad i personally enjoy . it not overdone , but not underdone either . it , goldilocks would say , just right . don't answer me lot like one good reason , it very catchy . song , it pretty good , but it could more refined , especially lyrically . dancing high wire one my favorites album . it could better , but colin blunstone ( i think they're his ) vocals shine this song . you don't believe catchy song , probably right middle , behind don't answer me ahead one good reason . pipeline only instrumental this disc , which disappointing , but it quite well . it not parsons ' best , but it well better than his wors t.t hen , last but not least , comes title track . this song gem album . it one my favorite parsons ' songs , probably makes any my top 50 song lists . only downside overdone instrumental interlude middle , but even sounds good ( opposed one silence i , eye sky ) . this album good starting place parsons if you're pop fan . if you like songs more vein pink floyd , start i , robot . then progress until you get this album . like any parsons album , it takes several listens , but fewer than most his albums	1
hey , this ain't beatles . fourmost established their reputation tight , exciting act liverpool alongside beatles , incorporating cabaret-styled humor their act before they forced go cabaret . they relied totally outside material , certainly didn't know how cope when merseybeat ended end ' 65 . what they good example prime merseybeat , even goofy tune like girls , girls , girls . beatles much same thing searchin ' early their career ( though , unlike fourmost , they didn't actually release it record , though they commit it tape their jan , ' 62 decca audition ) . if you buy prudently , this disc under $10.00 , including shipping . there enough good songs , imo , justify price , , 33 songs , you certainly can't say record company stingy . if you like merseybeat aren't expecting beatles , you'll pleased this disc	1
i'm music teacher i speak italian very well . i heard most this cd while cleaning up after tuscan-themed teacher appreciation lunch my own son school . i think this cd great find : contains whole bunch music i wasn't familiar ; witty lyrics , real authentic , not-overproduced feel . i really not heard indigenous italian jazz , now i find it great stuff . i'm pretty picky -- instance , love putamayo gypsy caravan arabic groove but detest jewish odyssey . so what it worth , that my opinion	1
i guess its just common trait supergroups characterize band such - its incidental part their status come up album filled splendid tracks but goes unnoticed masses , like queen hot space , yes ' tormato , led zep lp followed houses holy - thus case this here fourth album release one most remarkable bands this side progressive " art-rock " music genre ( one me all time favourites nonetheless ) - group , supertramp . other purist fans would claim point spite say their breakfast america album comes sell-out ( perhaps those who'd say so only hated idea album sold out so well selling millions copies ) band moved stripping down regular-lenght tracks against group usual stance coming up lenghty ones ' twas thing their day , contrary this album ( follow up breakthrough lp crime century ) laid out format comprising 10 tracks ( which would've eleven supposedly , but supertramp sax player john helliwell ( no relations those spice girls , me thinks ) ordains dis-inclusion track " you started laughing " due interest sound quality - given vinyl groove , reasons completely alien incomprehensible less enlightened post- seventies born generation ( that issued b-side " 45 single " lady " , track which succinctly embodied stuff which makes ' tramp great band , they don't give hoot if some would cite them uncool their carnival-like no holds bar type sound which definitely rocks its own way , pitting hodgson band distinctly nothing short themselves defining coolness its most undefiable degree rule within itself )) . prior time copy this lp group even quietest moments , album followed this one major fan ' tramp ( no i'm not speaking trammps who'd ditty called " burn baby burn " ) -- i've mistakenly attributed think some tracks carried this album rather appeared there , such " soapbox opera " , " man woman " . hodgson totally devoid any restriction his own way delivery he pours down " meaning " , which cumulates album poignant conclusion , closer track " two us " ( not beatle title ; however regard mentioned ever fantabulous beatles , this album like its predecessor also produced ken scott who've worked fab-four 1965 legendary lp rubber soul ) . album containing davies ' ( who sports wearing blue shirt his blue suit pictures this album cover inner sleeve following album ' ... quietest moments ... ' ) " ain't nobody but me " , track which displays his dry british wit , one featured singles album - opened similar birds chirping immaculate title track even quietest moments , intro its first track album " easy it " , which easily identifiable intro track open hodgson endearing song " sister moonshine " ( predecessor so akin sorts one their biggest hits " give little bit " , track opened following album ' ... quietest moments ... ' ) , crisis ? what crisis ? outstanding album high caliber kind . i love this album . shouldn't missed . hope they re-issue it out missing " you started laughing " track . significant great work supertramp .	1
this one most relaxing cds i ever heard . combination nature sounds beautiful melodies makes it really easy me relax . it helps me unwind after work sometimes i listen before bed . i quite few cds like this but this one my favorite . gordon brothers masters this kind music . i highly recommend it	1
i found cd source great memories . it took me back school all things girls get their guy or when they lost him . great fun good music ! cd quality also great . there some songs missing ? sure , but it only one cd	1
jesus , what glorious mess this disk . side side some most ridiculous crap i've ever heard my life some most interesting creative melodies i've heard some time . either these guys completely incapable editing themselves , or they simply don't care . " alien lanes " makes it very obvious members gbv , particularly head honcho robert pollard , not discriminate among his various creations . means discerning listeners must job themselves , but my opinion , it ultimately worth trouble . every ridiculous waste my time like " big chief chinese restaurant " or " ex- supermodel " , which features somebody making loud snoring noises throughout track , there many more snippets inspiring genius . " game pricks , " " my valuable hunting knife " " motor away " each deserve featured your local `hit ' radio station , or better yet , cleaned up covered famous band could only wish write something so clever catchy . since pink floyd incapable generating fresh new material , why not cover " always crush me " ? " alien lanes " actually shows band trying bit harder than usual retain some semblance sonic clarity , even stretching out sparingly include some slide guitar violin . look , cd twenty-eight tracks it . 28 !!! yes , good percentage them dismissed , but even if half them extraneous , still leaves fourteen thoroughly worthwhile . i wish they would spend bit more effort focusing what makes their best stuff so good eliminate chaff , but then again , maybe sorting through their output half fun . tom rya	1
" lust life , " which released same year " idiot " should even more successful than record , which iggy first taste commercial success . this album brings back hard-rocking , swaggering tendencies iggy parlayed stooges , although while music isn't quite chaotic , it still damned good record . jim morrison influence also seeps through lot " lust life . " tracks like " passenger , " which iggy wrote based jim morrison poem articulates vision searching many iggy best tunes built . rest tracks rock out make you think , well . " success " ad-libbed sounding iggy pop song could , but it still great piece work , title track , " sweet 16 " others . it good " lust life " finally getting audience it deserved so many years ago . check this record out , you won't disappointed	1

it pretty obvious what going here . one day 80s , record producer living plush apartment manhattan barked out orders one his underlings : " find me beautiful rock singer , blond guy , someone make girls go crazy . also get me out-of-this-world guitarist . i don't care what guy looks like or how ugly he . he look like vampire all i care . important thing he play guitar solos confound everyone -- even editors guitar world magazine . finally , get me drummer bassist big hair . i want them both mullets . otherwise , i don't care too much them so long they don't get way beautiful vocalist freak guitarist . " underling assiduously carried out his task found , respectively , mike tramp , vito bratta , greg d'angelo james lomenzo . tramp spotted walking down street one supermodel each arm . " you sing ? " underling asked . " sure , " tramp said . white lion its singer . underling discovered bratta guitar shop . bratta trying out guitar . 500 people watching awe . guy like yngwie malmsteen steroids . pinch harmonics , sweep arpeggios , 30-note melodic sequences half second , nothing too difficult this fretboard wizard . " you band ? " underling asked . " no , " bratta replied . white lion its guitarist . d'angelo lomenzo recruited movie theater . two sitting together . patrons seated behind them complaining : " we can't see screen because wall hair . " " perfect , " thought underling . once it developed two understood what drums bass , white lion its drummer bassist . now , you might expect group thrown together this fashion would no chemistry would not good . what i would expect . but this group rules ! somehow , against all odds , record producer project successful ! here you some finest rock songs come out mid/late 80s . you amazing sing-along choruses , blistering guitar solos make you shake your head amazement . surprisingly enough , this album also contains coherent songs actually stand their own songs . i probably don't need explain merits " wait " or " when children cry " you , but you also should know three other songs this album ( " lonely nights , " " sweet little loving " " tell me " ) also exceptional . buy this album relive 80s . see yourself it possible formulaic group become great group provided they right attitude talented enough pull it off .	1
i loved this album right start . i sorry see creed dissolve , but i love sound this band . myles kennedy , lead singer , such fantastic vocal range , mark tremonti , lead guitarist , really let it fly here . his playing very tight aggressive ; great stuff . my only complaint this band what hell taking so long get second album out ? come , guys . it three years ; let get move-on here .	1
i loved suede debut album , it true classic . i even bought their b-sides compilation " sci-fi lullabies " loved lot well ( " my insatiable one " might their best song ) . but let honest , this album pretty awful . there maybe 4 or 5 solid tracks here but even they don't touch weakest tracks debu t.t he theatricality amped up tenfold ( if that even possible ) but songwriting taken huge dip . if you want memorable hooks melodies , look elsewhere . if you want slow , pseudo-romantic dirges go absolutely nowhere , then this album you . sure , maybe i just don't " get it " but i don't see how anyone could say straight face this masterpiece , let alone suede best album . this album just boring . i wanted like it but end it just not worth your time . avoid unless you completist	-1

this one most wonderful collections music i've ever listened	1
i only add chorus praise this cd . charlie parker live recordings differ even his best studio work number ways : 1)obviously , solos longer , displaying his amazing fluency inventiveness ; 2)he tended take more risks than studio , which not hard understand ;3 )he gave free play his musical sense humor -- example , stringing together , lightning succession total musical plausibility , quotes " what this thing called love " , " you don't know what love " , " love sale " . also such delights parodies popular songs old new , military marches , " looney tunes " theme song , etc . etc . man apparently total recall every piece music he ever heard , able turn it his purposes . turning this recording particular , it true this stage his career cp often relied pretty heavily stringing together solos his huge store pet runs personal cliches . but what pet runs , what cliches , what stringing together ! i listened lot bird over years , but i found myself gasping speed , drive , diamond-perfect articulation his playing . just piece saxophone playing , it breathtaking . if one compare this recently discovered issued 1945 concert dizzy gillespie , kindest thing one could say there no comparison . 1945 concert he appears off night , while here he very rare form . only thing said favor older concert sound better , but he comes through pretty clearly this cd -- certainly clearly enough amaze delight anyone whose interest primarily astounding music . this recording permanent treasure american music	1
first thing this album careful choice songs . " django " one greatest jazz songs ever written . here , trio gives it great rendition ( one counterpoints version played modern jazz society - full orchestra ) . anyway , this 1956 recording , vince guaraldi piano , eddie duran guitar ( trully great musician !!! ) dean reilly bass . good thing this trio all songs they chose allow us listen geniouses players . there isn't really one solo protagonist . this one those trios who true musical dialogue . pay attention billy strayhorn " chelsea bridge " , gershwin " fascinatin ' rhythm " porter " it de-lovely " . when i first heard this album ... it instant love . very subtle ... it conquer any serious listener .	1
this sound brash young band born musical scene they very marginal tie . andy summers stewart copeland already time other groups ( copeland prog-rocker curved air ! ) sting came academic background . story goes they cut their hair spiky dyed themselves blond tape tv commercial gum ... all while working " roxanne . " so when punky slice pop began chart , image police punks almost accidental . never-the-less , " outlandos d'amour " aggressive way future police albums not . " next you , " " so lonely " " can't stand losing you " big attitude , which fans burgeoning punk scene fed right into . " truth hits everybody " " next you " kicking tempos made you just want jump . band three piece set-up minimum additives ( maybe keyboard " hole my life " some multi-tracked backing vocals ) kept things crisp clean . remastering brings into bright relief this re-issue , reminds us just how startlingly new this all sounded back 1978 . however , like most new bands , all kinks not worked through . silly " sally/be my girl " grew tired after few listens back then hasn't added any charm age . " masoko tango " just sounds like jam tacked record increase running time . but you hear elements eventually grew into brilliance ... reggae touches made " so lonely " " roxanne " so infectious , summers ' mad guitar " peanuts " sting ace songwriting skills . band still sense humor themsleves this moment - just listen flub remained beginning " roxanne . " fact , delete " sally " you could make strong case " outlandos d'amour " five star album ( much same way " mother " blight otherwise brilliant " synchronicity " ) . debut brimmed over excitement things come , police also never rocked this hard again .	1
you got kidding me jodeci . you all tried jodeci . they sound nothing like them . but real this cd striaght garbage . maybe i am much old head , because i grew up jodeci , boyz ii men , kelly , etc . i brought cd very very disappointed music . they need go back school get real job , because singing isn't getting it . you know what i am going try listen cd one more time before i give it away or throw it out window . it shame when you can't even give cd away which i tried several time	-1
creed much loved they maligned . one hand , you their fans , who see them extension alternative movement soaring melodies inspirational lyrics . other , you their critics , who call them " christian band " despise lead singer scott stapp his often unpredictable behavior . while i not condone stapp behavior any way , whole " christian rock " thing summed up two words : who cares ? it bad thing mention god or write inspirational lyrics ? long music this good , well , call me convert . well , first finest . definitely . their later material , human clay weathered , very good , but not match my own prison electicism . this attributed fact this album made before fame , which , unfortunately , went straight stapp head . album also record-setter : four singles , four number #1 hits . these four singles without doubt best songs album , because record-setter , creed should applauded their excellent single selections . these singles : " my own prison " , " torn " , " one " , " what this life " . creed similarities pearl jam striking : both stapp vocal delivery dark undertones surrounding music . i don't think creed trying copy vedder co . per se , but they probably influenced them . i stated before , four best tracks : " my own prison " - dark , moody guitar line stapp harrowing vocals create mezmorizing effect , but star here guitarist mark tremonti . not just his instrumental work , but his singing , he chorus himself . what chorus it , very chant-able ( word ? ) line . " torn " - opener , it influenced greatly alice chains possibly latter-day metallica . it heavy , but you really don't notice it , dark binaural-esque ( pearl jam album ) accompanying music . " one " - greatest track album , perhaps creed greatest song ever . leaded impressive ( hard play ) guitar line , it opens up into arena-ready chorus spiraling guitar solo finish it all off . " what this life " - i'm very sorry say it ; when i first heard it , i thought , " hey , this pearl jam song rocks ! " . it wasn't until chorus when i heard intracacies stapp voice i thought , " i mean ... this creed song rocks ! " . i actually meant compliment , because time , i against creed " copying " pearl jam style , but when i listened it first time without bias , i realized creed made great music . other songs just good ? no . other songs bad , then ? no , stop asking me questions , or i'll slap you upside head ! anyways ... other songs all good their own right , especially impressive " illusion " . i can't honestly say there bad song here ; some , however , feel like they could've more . but no matter , creed started off right foot , , really , only ten tracks , it hard go wrong !	1

you ever stuck computer glitch ? most likely not . but thats how this album make you feel . this most eccentric album i've ever experienced . but kick-you-in-your-teeth-and-solder-computer-chips-in-their-place sort way . first thing you notice ( apart non existent liner notes ) there aren't 9 tracks here . no way . not this baby . when i first put this itunes , it couldnt find track names . i've never happen . thats because there grand total 21 tracks . yes you heard right . but here tricky part , reason why this album not cddb because there string 5 second tracks ( couple minute halfers etc ) make up " song " 8 nobody knows what name them . nobody . but they part what packaging calls " retphase " but you name all them ? i don't even know . that what makes this album so cool . its untraditional so many ways . someone eventually know what name those strings tracks . they'll come up clever naming system or something . but until time , your going go without track names your ipod . but look beyond strange track system this disc you find some best tracks mouse mars recorded so far . it kind dark , sort autechre feel it . those you who know autechre know very good thing . but it still mom . its mom hardcore . there so much going each track you feel mechanized , but they never go too overboard . there still melody heard . you just find it . i'm giving this 5 stars , but rating system , my rating really meaningless . you give this listen your own truly appreciate how far mom really come .	1

although there few gems ( syd dale " penthouse suite " one them ) much music this disc pretty forgettable . it kind stuff cash-strapped tv producers 70s used when they needed soundtrack hip party scenes without paying huge copyright fees . if you like kitschy yet high-quality lounge/easy melodies then you'd much better served buying two-disc " this easy " compilation 2004 . set contains good stuff this album plus whole host memorable evocative instrumental vocal numbers set your toes tappin ' your heart soarin '	-1
i must admit i'm not very much experienced free jazz ; i listened some pharoah sanders some miled davis ' experiments this style ( " cookin ' plugged nickel " or something like ... ) i moderatly impressed moderately confused . i also listened some more recent jazz explorations charlie haden billy higgins , well some recordings art ensemble chicago wayne shorter latest explorations go beyond most traditional achievements ,,, it therefore seemed time i went source ... first all , i am impressed level expressiveness this music ; it no accident coleman liner notes mention new orleans jazz - some his ( but also cherry ) solos brought back some tonal features started disappear early swing era ... i'm not expert but i'm almost certain i heard ornette produce some blue notes his plastic instrument ! naturally , new orleans style one styles jazz which collective improvisation not so uncommon , so it no wonder , attempt free jazz charlie parker magnificent shadow , ornette times went sources jazz . addition , occasional " ethno " influences this album ( not only last song)are continuation usual manners which jazz musicians tried infuse new ideas into their music ; ellington , gillespie others particularly impressed latin america(s ) , there even some middle east experiments , but it time late 50 someone shows influences south asia other sources ... however , i must admit i still dig ornette explanations much more than i dig music ... this fine jazz , strong sense swing , least occasionally , fine drive , but all all , i'm not hypocritical enough hide my opinion band times rambles bit too much ... also , keeping format innitial concluding statement ... well ... anti-melody some songs also doesn't seem such good idea ( much better approach " change century " ... ) . perhaps if i devote more time this style i would get used it or discover more beauty , but now , 4 stars maximum i give ... even bit far fetched , rewarding courage determination follow original path ( regardless number followers ) ...	1

kid virgin megastore turned me this band last week , this first their albums i've chance listen ( their song selection their " late night " contribution convinced me they group some seriously good taste ) . suffice it say i haven't smiled so much long time when i listening this last night . how describe it , though ? maybe captain beefheart meets beatles jams dead then rush shows up ? i don't know , but this music absolute psychedelic blast . it its dark side , but prevailing atmosphere one completely off-kilter fun insanely brilliant instrumental virtuosity placed middle everything-bu t-t he-kitchen-sink mix bound thrill 40-something burnouts like me , nu-hippies , geeks , wads , urban hipsters alike . if such thing possible , i'd liken it tie-died wall sound tastes like one those jolly rancher watermelon hard candies you used eat when you kid . how wall taste like candy ? i didn't know it could until i listened this . jaded , cynical , angry time such ours , i can't imagine how piece music could more subversive ( yes , virginia , that very good thing ) . if you've forgotten why it so much fun your 20s during 70s , pick this up ; this cd made my year . whoo hoo ! now , " soft bulletin " " yoshimi .	1
recorded after ring wars before mare vitalis . this transitional record explains alot how they developed more raw melodic feel mare vitalis raw atmosphere ring wars . this short but sweet record , appleseed cast fans need only apply here . their some very interesting riffs only ac could come up , some realy great vocals chris . only thing their two tracks sound like alot statis some ( very little ) melody them , i don't know why you'd release record slow it down subtle instrumental tracks , but that sorta their thing ( especially llo ) . it still better than most records but no means it complete album . it great gift fans who crave more music this very talented band . look new release this year , if your new them check out ring wars , mare vitalis , their masterpiece low level owl i amp ; ii	1
it shame most people remember crystal two things : don't it make my brown eyes blue her hair . there much more this lady her career than just those two things . this collection brings together bulk her 80s hits warner brothers . few songs this cd yet appeared crystal hits package , so it nice them here . standouts include i don't wanna lose your love , our love fault line , me against night , making up lost time , sound goodbye , incredible cry . i wish all her albums would digitally remastered cd , but least we great sampling her great 80s hits . true love , cage songbird , straight heart three my favorite crystal albums well-represented here	1

folks rhino it again ! what great , well-produced engineered album ! when sax part started playing during " look love " , i could sworn player my living room ! there no doubt david-bacharach songwriting team ranks up there among best ever . " anyone who heart " , " look love " " walk " my favourites still give me great thrills whenever i listen them . so why you may ask only 4 stars ? well , i thought album trifle too short surely they could squeezed " close you " carpenters ! also , i didn't really enjoy first two last two tracks much although they great hits burt , i don't think they really represent his best work . i suppose this meant sampler get you wanna get other rhino releases like 3-disc version and/or " very best dionne warwick " or " dusty memphis " but point made . many , many artistes owe great deal bacharach great songs made them great this decent sampler anyone who wants get know timeless pop aka works art	1

i first heard natalie macmaster 1998 when i blown away track i heard ( catharsis ) local college radio folk music program . i called station ask who , what song , what album , counted myself among nm fans ever since . she amazing talent , who continues work her fiddle ( her voice , really ) like master sculptor sound . said , " yours truly " still took me surprise . this locomotive nm musical development really speeding up - music you practically chew , gravy potatoes side . tracks take you journeys glorious imagination via beautifully constructed arrangements , ranging gentle , soothing melodies those toe-tapping , frenzied , delicious rhythms we all come expect love - fact , one them downright headbanging ! excellent musicians featured this album reminder no matter how exceptional solo artist , she only good band beside her . you almost feel they all inspire each other play their best , their best what you get . this album gave me new appreciation cello hammond organ . some tracks contain so many different instrumental " voices " i almost expected some unpleasant collisions , but what results instead well choreographed acoustic ballet , all sounds skillfully dancing around each other . far michael macdonald rendition " danny boy " concerned - sure it better , but bit imagination , i found it quite warm stirring . ( all you mm anti-fans , don't let one little track stop you , rest cd worth it)the wonderful thing nm she all music , following her own , true instincts despite expectations traditionalists , mainstream listeners or bean-counting record execs . greatest musicians our time ones who courageous talented enough break " rules . " it shame more record companies don't realize . my recommendation : buy it , play it loud , enjoy it , dance it . word caution : put cruise control if you listen this cd your car or you might accidently get speeding ticket .	1
this brilliant live recording 1979 , one all-time great jazz combos , keith jarrett quot ; european quartetquot ; , hidden ecm vault ten years before released 1989 . this always remain huge mystery me , because my opinion this album perhaps jarrett best , certainly most underrated , album . everything this album superlative . compositions ( all jarrett originals ) , without exeption , marvellous , displaying range emotional expressions such beauty ( quot ; prismquot ; , quot ; innocencequot ;) , drama ( quot ; personal mountainsquot ;) , mystery ( quot ; oasisquot ;) playfulness ( quot ; late night williequot ;) . but this music , distinctly timeless nature , conveys so much more than what possible encapsulate few cliched characteristics . solos consistently highest level . jarrett perfectly structured piano solo quot ; prismquot ; quite simply one best solos history recorded jazz . stunning example free-flowing chromatic beauty . understanding inter-play musicians also breathtaking , especially considering this not regular working group . although highly accessible , there depth beauty this music demands endlessly repeated listening . two compositions album ( quot ; oasisquot ; quot ; innocencequot ;) previously released live double-album quot ; nude antsquot ; , recorded only few weeks later than material quot ; personal mountainsquot ; . although quot ; nude antsquot ; nice album , quot ; personal mountainsquot ; far superior almost every sense . sound quality far better , jan garbarek , who not heard top form quot ; nude antsquot ; , delivers one his best ever recorded performances . this makes it even more more puzzling material quot ; nude antsquot ; chosen release ahead quot ; personal mountainsquot ; material . 10-year delay release probably main reason why this album never achieved status it richly deserves , namely one very best small-group recordings jazz history . no less	1
this one started it all . some , it their best work . terms originality ideas , i think this true . terms delivering these new original ideas , they ways go . this body work reveals very young , slightly amatuerish band . album starts off two very good , if not clumsy songs , then really lights it up third song " stairway stars " . it if all pieces just fell together , band just learned how fly formation . my biggest gripe recording . it muddy guitars sound flat . there also too much reverb , drums sound like ringo starr ( al bouchard ) tapping piece cardboard , five miles away . but there much more enjoy this collection than gripe ; album whole very enjoyable , just don't expect sophisticated soundscapes . this low tech rock roll , touch blues , country psychedelia . highlights : " i'm lamb , " " stairway stars " , " last days may " " transmaniacon mc " " workshop telescopes " " redeemed " . great fun , indeed . recommended .	1
my opinion , this definitive dream theater album , encompassing all styles familiar band . it fast aggressive some moments , balanced melodic many more , slow sweet . yes , there soloing , but it fits music . solos journey beyound riffs songs they bring level depth complexity enhances music itself . speaking music , i hadn't heard anything this intelligent since beethoven ninth symphony , i mean all four movements . idea they introduce main themes overture track even reprise opening piece " spirit carries " genius , not mention all riffs themes reprised song " metropolis pt . 1 : miracle sleeper " . fact whole album centered around key -- not unlike , say , classical symphonic work or mozartean opera -- implies this album isn't heard one song time . hearing it beginning end least twice rewarding experience hard repeat ( except maybe hearing it third fourth time ) . finally , this album made many people fans band . people who , before hearing this , would cite depeche mode , simple minds , heaven 17 their favorite bands . i've also made believer my roommate who fan radiohead , red hot chili peppers , social distortion	1
i can't believe people comparing novembers doom opeth . put them both same sentence heresy its most profane , i feel bad even putting both their names this same sentence . first all , opeth far more talented craft epics shatter defy what we know modern music , not mention their contribution re-defining death metal/melodic/doom . novembers doom average best , there no stellar musicianship or amazing epic songs this album , or any other novembers doom albums i heard . pale haunt departure its moments , though far few . every song marred horrid singing cheesy doom talking singer . seriously , his singing sucks ! his screams decent though , you hear his lyrics(which suck repeat same concepts through whole album ie .. not good enough , there tomorrow , blah blah blah ) , but he sounds like cheap immitation amon amarth vocalist . i admit some their guitar riffs pretty good , but they repeat same parts over over , if they could not conjure up decent change ups variations , besides few gems mostly sounds boring . drummer sometimes sounds like he just started drumming , he uses his snare drum way too much doesn't seem know how use it . there few decent drum parts , but nothing spectacular . there virtually no bass all , heard once while , when you hear it , its average . but overall , song structure dynamics horrible poorly put together . i don't see why everyone praises these guys . maybe i just don't get whole doom metal genre its fans , but this album weak weak weak . i agree reviewer who stated intros best parts album , but after you get past 30 seconds each song , song turns into garbage . people so willing give out 5 stars every album . pale haunt departure not worth 5 stars all , more like 2 . pale haunt departure makes me realize anyone make album get signed label	-1
i speechless when i first listened this cd . it totally different anything i've ever heard slater before . he definitely evolved found sound seems suit him perfection . mostly funky electro , but you totally recognize slater techno influences throughout cd , which takes it level . every single track amazing beautifully constructed . this cd definitely worth checking out	1

man who never claimed jazz guitarist , he lays it down fine form this compilation . his unique chord-melody technique shines many numbers , his underrated single-note playing completely masterful . excellent backing piano , bass , drums ( different personnel two recording sessions , 1960 1961 ) . material ranges swing era ( gershwin , rodgers-hart , ellington ) showtunes even monk . my only beef this disc some minor intonation problems toward end one recording session -- i find myself saying quot ; come , johnny , tune pianoquot ; couple cuts . ok , so maybe this 4 1/2 stars , but this representation real johnny smith makes it more than worthwhile	1

now if you ask me , pleny auronautical fans now again rgular occurance , this here album title kind mystifying . wing designed withstand pressures going speed sound it pretty tough . we got some aeroplanes what it , but they got special wings made super-dooper materials . i reckon this here paul mccartney wings album much same way . see , he managed pull four singles off this album 1976 they included " let ' em " " silly love songs " which right up there top pile ( if you axe me ) . i enjoy listening this one when i'm out shed working something like rebuilding linkages brush hog , or tamping down flue port-a-smelter . this one puts me mood start workin ' just-a-keep-on workin ' - so i call this one my " workin ' album .

piano remains me greatest musical invention . one great musical challenges any musician tackle quot ; standardquot ; . mr pletnev it carnegie hall 1st november 2000 when he made magnificent again , beethoven piano sonata no 32 , op . 111(documented dg 471157-2 ) . mr mehldau it his series albums entitled art trio his latest ( double ) cd documents some music he made over three nights village vanguard during september 2000 . times i feel his incisive , searching , surprising ballad playing his great strength ( cf folks who live hill , disc 1 , track 3 ) but then he reworks alone together into uptempo piece preceded stunning piano solo introduction then staccato piano phrases punctuated drums bass delivering musical exploration very edge its form 15 minutes musical delight . then disc 2 track 2 absolutely exquisite , achingly beautiful reworking ( originally strikingly banal)secret love . my view mr mehldau no tricks , no theatre , no look-at-me-and-what-i-can-do bravura , no cliches , no licks , but all music . he one very few pianists i listen who gives impression music speaking through him , this how it . music doesn't get much better than made mr mehldau , mr genadier mr rossy	1

one reviewers below suggests , i'm starting think you really alive 60s , preferably highly sentient 1972 , realize what absolute masterpiece this , perhaps one qualification . major one me truly appreciate fsol one " conceptualize " each their releases terms initial album ( i.e dead cities ) subsequent " translations " followed ( i.e. my kingdom case dc ) view them inseparable " whole . " such , when i think fsol " isness , " i view it three disc set consisting original album , " mello hippo disco show " " otherness . " now , light kind music fsol making here , look both backwards ( into your record collection ) sideways ( what other artists doing presently ) . what compares this ? sgt . pepper ? meddle ? court crimson king ? larks tongues aspic ? red ? close edge ? go back give them listen , great they , prepared surprised . radiohead ? daft punk ? orb ? only if you're kind nut who thinks joe strummer " really " better guitarist than jeff beck still . fsol something here very much like what dj shadow entroducing , except they used their brains instead turntable . my ears , this most intelligent , coherent , " collageist " summing up everything wonderful progressive rock ( anybody who says " prog " showing their youth ) psychedelia one could wish . song song breakdown would tedious , i'm not any way slighting incredible stuff like " dead cities , " which i consider their masterpiece . one might add if this album missing anything , its some awesome rhythmic impact their best work . but this masterpiece well , completely unlike anything else out there present . if you ever wondered what your favorite progressive bands might they not burned out ( am i only one who thinks white album three sides too long or adrian belew should tried crimes against music ? ) pick up all three fsol most recent releases listen them if they part same album . this far music taken when moved direction suggested best late 60s 70s . i'm definitely not sensitive , 90s kind guy , but this album frequently brings tears my eyes , its so incredibly , unexpectedly perfect . nothing else outside " classical " music ultra-progressive jazz like coltrane " ascension " or " meditations " me anymore . this falls into line every other fsol release more absolutely beautiful ( not same thing " pretty " ) stuff it than just anything else released during last 40 years . comparing this band such forgettable acts supertramp elo , editorialist above , like blasting bach partita solo violin d-minor no good tunes : sheer idiocy . me , i'll still listening this loving it nursing home when young kids using radiohead cd drink coasters . if you still proper stereo , owning playing these three discs make you glad you don't most your music listening computer terminal ( that depressing think on-line gambling ) . beautiful , magnificent , yes , timeless stuff , not missed , especially if you're old enough remember when smoking allowed grocery stores	1
sounds created tld floods your ears keeps things interesting powerful beat . imagine rammstein english , more taste . it like soda bubbles bursting your tongue , irresistable voice commanding taunting your very existence . i'd never heard them before i saw them live knitting factory . they only opening act but far best band played night . stage he really taunts crowd holding out mic stand even going so far walk around pit roll duct tape . singer ridiculous charm . especially 30 some year old . important aspect this album it not like traditional " goth " music . don't let cover decieve you -- ask yourself our culture stress beauty , self-glorification , human ego . lyrics ring true our deepest human natures	1

if you grew up times old school hip hop onward , you recognize all tracks this album . best cut far slick rick " hey young world , " but every song good . i gave it four stars because while it very good , it not perfect . i say not perfect because all big jazz names album(roy hargrove , gerald albright , hubert laws rick braun name few ) , their appearances album alone sets expectation bar pretty high . although they all great job , it wasn't absolute best work they could put , therefore it perhaps two or three steps away perfect . horn arrangement jay-z " i get ... " struggled match energy original track known . method man " bring pain , " i looking forward hearing original beat , but they changed it up some point where i couldn't audibly recognize it until vocals came . also , since rick braun there it would good kirk whalum somewhere album too . but that really only major flaws i found album . " hey young world " perfectly , even go-go/reggae feel it . " all i need " excellent , they go waaaaaayyy back oran juice jones ' " rain . it really good album . not perfection , but definitely not waste money	1
i admit i am subdude newbie , but if this album any indication band prior work i lot look forward . this cd wearing out my cd player . i bought it when it first came out but i just started listening it during school finals i writing papers , i must say , it pulled me through some long nights . album highlighted last song quot ; bye-bye , quot ; it oh so sweet harmonies , bitter-sweet lyrics . my favorite subdudes songs , quot ; all time worldquot ; here , but unfortunately it doesn't hold up . slide guitar woefully out tune , but only low point otherwise phenominal album	1

i've owned this album ( originally its british lp release ) since early 1970 , it never lost its freshness worth . this one moment time , winwood mason really worked together , combination winwood/mason/wood/capaldi one most eclectic original popular music . mason consummate pop-song writer , roots folk english music-hall , " here little song " , " feelin ' allright " , " don't sad " " cryin ' heard " all quality songs beautifully executed . " feelin'allright " got covered many times , but me original version here best -- it rocks , it light airy , it sense humor . there several moments this record when mason winwood voices overlap , i'm reminded just how good they sounded together . listen codas " don't sad " " cryin'to heard " particular . but core this group winwood/wood/capaldi , it this unit puts together one most striking ( musically ) track all , " no time live . " it starts wood sax , sounding almost like animal-cry la paul winter ( many years earlier ! ) , capaldi comes playing tom-toms , winwood organ laces wispy lines his unique , soulful voice begins lyric . lyrics never winwood/capaldi long-suit ( capaldi wrote most them ) , self-consciously world-weary words this song hardly memorable , but song itself undeniable power . wood original , excellent reed-player , never better than this album or this song particular . capaldi shows again what sensitive percussionist he , his alternating textures beautiful stick-brushed-cymbal work this cut ( idea rock group would " sensitive percussionist " its drummer 1968 almost absurdity ) . reality , virtually every reviewer noted already , traffic never just rock band . its basic sound keyboard-based rather than guitar-based ( although both winwood mason shine guitar this album ) , winwood/wood/capaldi interests ran into far more diverse areas , all which come bear here this album . later traffic efforts might emphasize extended rock/fusion-jam aspect more , line-up would shrink expand , but traffic would never sound better than it studio 1968 when they recorded this album .	1
if you truly love oasis if you relate their music , then there no good or bad album , only slightly better ones . they haven't voted best brit pop group past decade no reason ! i am eagerly awaiting stop clocks	1
this best armstrong album ever ! one things sets it apart music . backbone this album made up traditional jazz numbers , not pop songs show up so many his albums . it shame armstrong much more known latter . furthermore , enthusiastic european crowds inspired band play it best . clearly everybody good time . i can't understand why it took so long this album reissued	1

this probably ricky martin best album right now . it least 4 us releases ( livin ' la vida loca , bella ( she all i ever ) , shake your bon-bon , cup life ) mainstream it , it deservedly receives lot interested fans . i think i even heard private emotion radio . blending lyrics music production releases not overly . if you're looking complex or extremely witty lyrics , this not album you then . lyrics music accentuate cd themes romantic love spirits accomplishment . shake your bon-bon way too corny , but besides track , other ones much more presentable natural ricky martin . some unreleased songs may too spanish sounding too similar sounding mainstream audience . they too similar sounding me too sometimes . she all i ever private emotion definitely capture contemporary pop well , private emotion sounds like big hit . probably hit big non-us countries . livin ' la vida loca cup life both cool flair that not just put together like some backstreet boys songs . suggested anyone who likes well music based entirely production vocals	1
basically took bunch great songs , dumbed them down , made them all sound same , made them very boring process . there nothing unique any songs , they really boring covers you might expect see some 18 year old freshman college who obsessed belle sebastian cover coffee shop . boring , trite , nice effort but try again please .. i think worst cover slaughter guns brixton . undertones cover here pretty bad , too ... i don't know , i didn't fancy this . if you like boring yet somehow hip music , this may your cup tea . you should probably get garden state soundtrack too , would great those boring days your dorm or coffee shop your soy vanilla latte ... bad shot irony	-1
sleepy , drifty quality synthesizer sounds employed this album , really mark it product 70 . younger or less experienced electronic music fans might not take this kind thing , seeing how it utterly lacks anything even remotely approaching break , cut , or drum machine . but electronic music classicists , it doesn't get much better . typical most vangelis , old or new , artist applies classical composer skills electronic medium , unique savory effect . track 7 especially beautiful , its extended length delicate harp . vangelis ( my opinion ) oft-overlooked musical genius late 20th century , rivaling more traditional composers like john williams terms ability style . get this album experience his gift , prior world spotlight shown down man quot ; chariots firequot ;	1
this one best albums i've purchased last couple years . i enjoy every single song . i not get tired listening this . i first discovered rocco deluca burden seeing them live opening act . i didn't know them but very impressed his skill dobro - which very difficult instrument master . i immediately bought album i love it . use dobro make it fresh . rocco voice phenomenal he strong songwriting skills . album successfully blends different genres makes it all " work . " there rock , blues , alternative , punk , americana other genres influencing sound . he grounded americana music knows history music which big influence his style . there good blend mellow up-tempo stuff . i saw them second time live even more blown away than first time . definitely see them live if you get chance ! i saw interview reason track " i trust you kill me " not album because it homage zeppelin other bands who titled their album song but then put actual song album . hint : you get track live ep itunes . thank you ironworks putting out band grounded rock blues	1
i really like comment reviewer below , mr. adams , who said project evans cannonball strove quot ; mellow , but swinging foundationquot ; . this precisely what achieved , this also why i like riverside recordings ( orrin keepnews producer ) so much . then relatively mid-sized label seemed not only make most right moves decisions , but also get exactly what needed personnel their roster - best . this one best concepts - record cannonball evans together ; team them perfect rhythm duo occasion percy heath connie kay , well feature compositions which fit groove decided upon . it true - long everything ran planned , session ' gimme ' . it turned out lot more than . it turned out classic . cannonball well-established reputation , keepnews notes , what allowed this happen first place ( he little humble , he his label saw possibilities ) , this classic , different it almost any cannonball before or after , good cannonball recording ever made . you could remaster this 20,000 bit ... it wouldn't matter . it would sound great mono	1
this music makes you want get up dance ! first few tracks best , but whole cd very good . i could not stop listening son fro africando many more . hide this cd because once you pop it , your friends never want give it back you . after owning gypsy caravan , afro-latino , afro latin party , salsa around world , cuba many more i come say this one best putumayo we seen up date . also check out putumayo colombia-it sure get you dancing like you never danced before !	1
well , powerslave certaintly contender title painkiller judas priest don't break oath mercyful fate . this album step up heaviness song writing piece mind number beast , which my opinion bit over-rated compared powerslave . there isn't moment through powerslave i get even relatively bored . not one . it just good . no metal collection complete without this . favorite tracks : aces high , losfer words ( big ' orra ) , rime ancient marine	1
movie good but music spectacular , fresh provocative . standouts wendy lisa , enya , grace jones ( gulp ! ) i cannot listed closing year enough , anyone know where i get cd single this gem ? i heard extended version it better	1
after mildly disappointed deadwing , i reservation porcupine tree latest album . however , after initial listen i am pleased report pt finally managed find perfect balance their older atmospheric prog their newer , heavier traits . steven wilson fine form this album , musically it astonishing . swirling vortex guitars , masterful drums courtesy mr. harrison , dreamy soundscapes lush synths combine create familiar pt sound , but this time around there absolutely no filler , entire album remains focused cohesive start finish . only room improvement lyrics , which aren't bad any means but some reason they don't grab me quite much past albums . concept original unique , little more easily understood than sometimes opaque themes previous records . if you're fan older porcupine tree you pleased know this album little less song-oriented little more atmospheric free-form than last two . if you're newer porcupine tree fan you'll please know this albums add more heaviness grind , but finds zen-like balance two . instead heavier sections tacked onto lighter songs , fear blank planet morphs raging beast soothing angel completely effortlessly seamlessly . i can't wait see where this band goes next .	1
i recently rented movie il postino fell love it ! music , poetry , story , all opened my eyes whole new interest italian culture . it wonderful because addition movie soundtrack , cd more than 12 poems recited actors music movie playing background	1
monk albums john coltrane great - no doubt - but when i heard this album first time recently i knocked out . it confirmed my belief johnny griffin not recognition he deserved . he isn't alone . i love benny golson he too overshadowed . problem not just trane ; it ornette colman certain extent eric dolphy . they ' weird ' compared straight-ahead bop-and-bluesmen ( like magnificent griffin ) took critical limelight . sure , ' weird ' fellows often made good music ( mr coltrane particular said his moments ! ) but now we know there other stuff going too . hearing monk grif now like hearing new jazz very highest order , passage time freed music confusing contemporary comparisons . it great - buy it ! apparently there same band same place i pleasure still come - thank you god	1
terms commercial success , bread still going strong into 1973 , but it easy see why david gates would wanted go solo . quite simply , it seems though he really wanted able devote entire album his own material not share space james griffin , which perfectly understandable , not only because gates ' enormous amount talent , but also due personal nature this album . griffin doesn't appear " first " , but david other bread bandmates larry knechtel mike botts here , which very telling indeed -- said , it seems utterly clear bread broke up mainly due tension griffin gates . addition knechtel botts , gates some big name west coast session musicians here including larry carlton , louie shelton , jim gordon , russ kunkel . it very fitting " first " solo album -- not only david write produce all tracks himself , but there very personal confessional nature many these songs that striking . instance , there wistful , gentle album-opener " sail around world " , really moving bittersweet song coming grips things you'd really like life , but probably won't ever chance . " i use soap " great tune curiously matches upbeat , country-flavored acoustic music reflective quite mournful lyrics , although he end song ray optimism future . " sunday rider " nice rocker escapist lyrics uncannily bring mind jackson browne , though browne yet reach his peak time this album . gates finally whole album himself , you clearly see him using opportunity branch out , it often great effect . he puts van morrison , not mention chicago , shame " help way " , rousing incredibly catchy jazz-rocker cautionary lyrics telling us not get too wrapped up race against time . he brings back jazzy sound album-closer , sumptuous blissful " lorilee " , presumably written one his children--it largely instrumental , great chord changes instrumental soloing , although it sound strikingly similar allman brothers band " memory elizabeth reed " . gates even steps into progressive rock territory extremely impressive " suite : clouds , rain " , almost undoubtedly his most imaginatively-arranged piece music ever -- it opens sound effects , then david comes playing lovely , melancholy piano theme before joined orchestral accompaniment . goosebump-inducing " clouds " released its own single--it dreamily transcendant song masterful use moog synthesizer . all said , it would certainly exaggeration say " first " marks clean break bread sound . instance , " ann " very much sounds like it could bread album ; it written one his daughters -- unfortunately , lyrics quite obvious sappy , although there no denying it very nicely melodic sincerely sung . easy-going , country-flavored " sight sound " pleasant song kind lines " sweet surrender " . unfortunately , gates falters " you believe he comin '" which annoying , self-righteously religious lyrics gospel-style background vocals . positive side , this tune wonderful coda reprises intro " suite : clouds , rain " . despite flaws , " first " still highly recommended album comes tantalizingly close masterpiece -- gates ' diversity ability follow through his ambitions truly impressive , much great music he would continue make after this , it still kind shame he never even tried make album combined adventurous departures his more trademarked style sprawling , unifying feel . it figures this album big commercial disappointment , not even reaching top 100 us album chart , because david gates makes it abundantly clear here he far more than mere commercial hack certain people like accuse him . ( p.s. this cd version " first " marred print back cover which damn near impossible read .	1
i very impressed first two volumes series but this volume , while it some great tracks , not match those two although i like this set better now than when i first bought it some years ago . highlights me i saw three ships ( sting ) , blue christmas ( sheryl crow ) , christmas ( blues traveller ) , gallic version silent night ( enya ) , santa claus back town ( jonny lang ) , christmas now drawing near hand ( steve winwood ) o holy night ( tracy chapman ) . most other tracks ok but version santa baby included here definitely not my kind music . i much prefer madonna version , found first volume series , or original eartha kitt version fifties . if you big fan nineties pop rock music , you may enjoy this more than i , my taste pop rock rooted earlier era . otherwise , you likely feel ( i ) this not essential purchase . you contribute special olympics purchasing first two volumes ( also filled mostly pop rock music ) or more recent very special acoustic christmas ( filled country bluegrass music ) , all which i reviewed long ago	1
i picked this novel up whim long ago during my trekkie phase , i pleasantly surprised it . not only it bring back memorable characters tos cast tng universe , it incorporates them their motivations way shows never really . story deals spock finally coming under romulan capture during his lengthy task reunification . held ambitious governor , he scheduled executed his followers , thus stage set political intrigue philosophical side novel . starfleet response swift sure . spock amazing memory , 150 years top-level federation secrets locked within his mind . security threat staggering . thus , one spock old friends -- certain doctor leonard mccoy -- brought aboard flagship enterprise help negotiate prisoner release before romulans discover spock among unificationists . same time , retired engineer genius montgomery scott intercepts message starfleet enterprise , decided go after spock himself . , he needs ship , so pure scotty fashion , steals ancient constitution class starship hopes getting spock out romulan territory himself . novel joy read , so i won't say much more . i say , though , this book really captures adventure feel original series amazing characters next generation . dealing these relics past , clash tactics comes fore , end it mesh those tactics philosophies finally needed -- but stubborn people both crews times able meet middle ground ? it interesting though , explored fairly well	1
perhaps consequence ambition savaged critics fans alike . quot ; consequencesquot ; torn shreds many critics its pretentions when it first released . narrative double disc album , it featured story nature rebelling against man songs instrumentals godley creme who recently left 10cc . while ambitious , yes , perhaps pretentious sprawling album offered something music hadn't seen awhile -- artist attempting something large scale wit intelligence . drawback quot ; consequencesquot ; its reliance , perhaps , too much narration talented peter cook when fans come expect something different godley creme . quot ; music consequencesquot ; came market salvage disasterous reception duo album double concept album . it focused primarily songs instrumentals bit narration cook hold it all together . whole , it works equally well original double album . best songs very much equal what duo accomplished within 10cc . quot ; 5 o'clock morningquot ; stands , perhaps , best track album its observations life working person . quot ; lquot ; other hand didn't ambition quot ; consequencesquot ; but it just much creativity going . quot ; englishman new yorkquot ; features godley creme sarcastic wit its best galloping melody vocal delivered kevin godley reminds me quot ; dean iquot ; terms its ambitious scope musical changes . it not perfect album but benefit better , more focused quot ; messagequot ; than quot ; consequencesquot ; . featuring gutarist phil manzanera ( roxy music , 801)on many tracks , album shows duo zappaesque word play musical invention frequently top form . while this edition lacks bonus tracks seen other reissues ( each others anywhere 4 8 tracks each cd ) , it great compilation two fine albums this often forgotten creative duo . godley creme wouldn't hit us until their next last album ( quot ; history mixquot ;) innovative quot ; cryquot ; ( which benefited original video directed duo themselves)and good song , these two albums their best even better . i'd give quot ; music consequencesquot ; 4 stars quot ; lquot ; 4 1/2 . remastering both albums comparable us releases ( where quot ; consequencesquot ; released its entirety two disc cd quot ; lquot ; combined witty quot ; freeze framequot ;) .	1
well i loved creed sad they split up so i gave alter bridge chance there great no doubt it they . so now scott stapp returned surprising good album me , before album came out i hear relearn love passion christ soundtrack scott i never liked track so i bit worried scott . but then i heard great divide single which i must say great song its got creed feel it lyrics great song . there tracks this album which you would think creed songs like fight song sounds like freedom fighter , but start finish this overall solid effort scott stapp its really good album it creed feel it but then again he lead singer one greatest bands ever my opinion . i'm sad creed no longer but long four them alive make great music weather its alter bridge or scott stapp solo stuff i always fan because they amazing musicians .	1

this album miracle . i could stop here you enough words understand level this album belongs . i'm bored when i read reviews where people point out music too technical or stuff like this . this music technical sure but it absolutly marvellous totally blazing emotional level . this album trip . when i listen this one sometimes i find myself unable listen nothing else while . technique not against emotions especially albums like this one ! if you not skilled enough appreciate beauty these players produced here , please , don't write reviews ! this album flamenco , jazz , classical , latin , it simply three mindblowing musicians united produce last word acoustic guitar music unbelievable chapter history music . but this album not only incredible guitarists , it fantastic everyone because songwriting amazing . credits go three them infact they choosed record tunes each one them ( two tunes each ) i can't say which best !! every tune perfect sequel one preceed it . it seems it written one single pen . this cd even fantastic audio experience if you good hi end system . even if tones could better , dynamic there you hear each player different channel , so you john centre , paco right channel al left channel . you recognize easily their different styles . you follow dialogs they improvising these marvellous tunes . i own this one since 1990 i guess . it still impress me technical abilities solos compings , it still amazes me songwriting skills these guys , delight me emotional level each time i decided take it out vaults . gem	1

most recordings i heard sonatas harpsicord violin use harpsicord not piano . one things happens harpsicord tends get " lost " violin such more powerfull instrument . here roles both equall pianist ( glen gould ) strong personality makes himself felt music . interaction gould laredo electric . both formidable artist together they create fireworks . 1014 allegro example which sounds quite layed back biondi disk here really rocks - you can't help humming it ( way i can't here gould humming anything ) . i prefer this version penguin rosetted grumiaux version ( harpsicord gets lost ) highly regarded biondii version ( boring ) . i guess it not authentic but gould brings out beauty , liveliness complexity bach better then any other pianist i know laredo exellent violinist . i havn't time listen concertos rose yet end offering . this may not " reference " but if you going buy one recording these works then buy this one	1

i can't believe " future without past " unknown underappreciated it . i count one hand number rap albums consistently funny entertaining this one . this album simply phenomenal throughout . three mcs here fantastic . busta rhymes would course go quick-lipped apocalyptic mainstream mc , but here he hilarious , immature teen . dinco dean carries weight one who gels busta equally zany funny charlie brown , whose yelling chanting make him one who really stands out . cut monitor milo makes beats , assorted group other producers , raps occasion . lons joy listen because they celebrate youth , quite capable tackling issues youth world amidst their crazy humor . production excellent , using samples creative instrumentals make unique yet simple sound doesn't sound slightly dated fifteen years later . i can't think group so much character charisma . " future without past " concept album follows busta , dinco , charlie through day school . these guys hysterical thoughts goings high school , i laugh frequently whenever i listen this . this album must-have any fans 90s classic hip hop . skits part what make concept work so well make album so much fun . beginning " homeroom , " which guys skirting into school amid some sort riot , classic song " case pta " plays school theme perfectly , poking fun school system over legendary production infectious chorus . " too much my mind " allows mcs voice problems their teenage lives , horn-laden hook . " what pinocchio theory ? " crazy hilarious , anchored charlie brown . despite its standard fun , " just when you thought it safe ... " displays social consciousness only best mcs 1991 . after visit " lunchroom " incredible " sound zeekers , " crazy song multiple guest rappers . " sobb story " great , " feminine fatt " funny song where busta speaks happily heavyset women . i love " transformers , " " afterschool " lons ask role models " show me hero . " " planes , trains , automobiles " infectious fast , well-produced executed " international zone coaster . " self explanatory " teachers , don't teach us nonsense " precedes busta hilarious " my dingaling . " album closes perfect " where we go here ? " much success busta rhymes would later find , my opinion this far his greatest accomplishment . " future without past " amazing . it unbelievably funny , musically catchy , simply entertaining best hip hop . fans tribe called quest , de la soul , even brand nubian or wu-tang should pick this up without thinking twice , they see lons group unique enjoyable any . this album never received its due respect but must-have any hip hop fan	1

" leg lamb " , " better living through chemistry " , " fade " , contrary name " lightning song " slightly slower tracks but all them full intensity , powerful licks lyrics . those who like heavier stuff check out " tension head " . all all this album full great songs variety . righteous cd must everyone	1
catch fire , bob marley wailers , first reggae album show genre serious form music outside jamaica , par american british rock roll rb . before this 1973 breakthrough , reggae seen something joke . even though jimmy cliff " harder they come " set stage , " catch fire " clinched it . album solid classic masterpiece lead vocals not just marley , but bandmate peter tosh well , tracks " 400 years " " stop train " . deluxe edition features both original " catch fire " album , released only jamaica december 1972 its two bonus tracks well original album released internationally public may 1973 , both songs like " stir it up , " " no more trouble , " well underrated classic " baby we've got date ( rock it baby ) " , my favorite song album . both also astonishing difference sound two subtle , yet extremely visible , adding album charm legendary status . " catch fire " leave you begging more .	1

i've listening alternative music since 1980s . suddenly late 1980s/early 1990s , record companies suddenly recognized " commercial value " alternative groups . result , creativity unusual nature performers marked alternative music homogonized into stale pablum same-soundingness . or , so i thought . montreal " satanic panic attic " one my favorite albums all time . i've rediscovering alternative groups sound/feel lot like old school alternative groups like " montreal " " blonde redhead " slipped my notice . thank god word mouth , or i would never heard them . first time i introduced this group through girl who i swapping music recommendations . she apologized lead singer voice some reason , but let me listen sample eros ' entropic tundra , it love first listen . not everyone like this , i'm sure . their sound retro low-fi . songs quirky , strange , giddy mix beach boys ' layered melodies/harmonies odd subjects epic openings/closings usually marked beatles ' music . i know i love album when i keep hitting repeat my stereo relisten song because i enjoy it so much . my favorites frequent repeat this album " disconnect dots , " " lysergic bliss , " ( adorable ! ) " rapture rapes muses , " " eros entropic tundra , " " erroneous escape into eric eckles , " " your magic working " " spike senses . "	1
this isn't my favorite album theirs , but overall it still very good . my ears , " into labyrinth " bit more earthy , tribal sound than some their other albums . not every track , but many . i would call " yulunga " best thing here , it beating drums ancient vibe , it single after all amazing video even . " umbiquitous mr. lovegrove " probably closest thing pop song , though not one , i really love track " spiders stratagem " , it reminds me old dcd . i'd call this disc must previous fans , newcomers might enjoy collection more	1
just like many other metal bands hair metal bands eighties worked very limited musical territory . still they created something fresh different made opportunity listener think something else than death , philosophy suicide get into territory where partying just fun great time headsubjct both within lyrics within music . i would never aloud myself class anything hair metal era world class musicianship , something more original deeper fulfilled . but doesn't say i don't like music , i actually really enjoy some it very much , heart young i consider one best albums within genre . its mix music created english rock group def leppard swedish rockers europe it fills all criterias what good hair metal album should include , making us remember sunny party days eighties ( re-do them ) , just great time .	1
one best cd i ever purchased . love it !! love it !! love it !	1
this album takes me right back 1982 . before madonna , michael all those wonderful ' 80 songs , there this gem . aside overplayed title track , every song this album strong my memory this day . give listen " ever since world began " try get it out your head . survivor " journey steroids " both powerful rock hooks ( hesitation dance)and melodic power ballads ( silver girl ) . 5 stars also lead vocals dave bickler . most important reasons buy this album right now ... well worth money you'll want play it over over again .	1
project 1950 awesome !!!! i really like great balls fire , monster mash , most all this magic moment . i would greatly recommend you buy this cd . buy it !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!	1
after getting their latest album ( ahundreddaysoff ) going back this cd refreshing . this truely their most amazing work yet . all sounds underworld mastered over their past few albums , beaucoup fish brings together perfect blend all them , but much more refined . no more raw drum beats carry song , but instead , they've got entire novel written each song . if there any cd my collection i would reccommend first anyone , it would this one	1
both these recordings beethoven fourth sixth made hollywood 1958 , same time walter turning rather slack unfocused readings other symphonies . here he recovers some dash intensity marked his 1930s pastorle vienna phil . columbia sym . plays energy inflection , even though walter tempos leisurely side . generally acknowledged , he found magic every movement pastorale , which surely stand best romantic versions this symphony ( far more charming than bohm often recommended but unsmiling recording dg ) . fourth same mode , more incisiveness than his eroica , fifth , or seventh . but walter somewhat less alert here ; result mellow performance good if not superb quality . newcomers might suppose , hearing these performances , rest walter beethoven must equal stature . it not , but we grateful this charmed moment his old age . look his bruckner , mozart , mahler similar inspiration	1
this one my all time favorite mariah carey albums . lyrics superb her singing mind-blowing . i whole heartedly recommend this any mariah fan	1
chess several incarnations -- chicago edition , original british version , this original broadway ( american ) cast . tim rice thought idea musical wrote lyrics during 1980s , it kind became his obsession ; i.e. chess tim rice e.t. steven spielberg star wars george lucas . rice corraborated project half abba ( benny anderson bjorn ulvaeus ): they wrote music what beautiful music it . show only broadway 3 months ( apr-june ) 1988 before cancelled . perhaps because cold war waning , but time there didn't seem much audience it . however , cold war ended 16 years ago show grown status over years . musical tells story american chess player ( loosely based upon bobby fischer ) his russian counterpart . american lover coach leaves him russian . russian professes his love , but he torn because he already wife children back homeland . play portrays russian victim , but if you really think it , he not . i find music show particularly moving many lyrics haunting . " where i want " , " nobody side " , " i know him so well " , " pity child " all wonderful songs , tainted melancholy . " one night bangkok " actually became international pop hit . however , main reason i like this album more than other versions show inclusion song " someone else story " . there just seems so much depth emotion song it stirs something my soul everytime i hear or sing it . most fans chess prefer more rock driven british version album . however , " heaven help my heart " call me red , white , blue yankee because " endgame " i like this album chess best	1

mariah second album " emotions " great follow up her eponymous debut 1990 . biggest diffrent ben margulies co-wrote most songs her debut changed walter afanasieff who going feature many upcoming mariah albums future , he also wrote her big hit " hero " 1993 . legendary carole king also co-wrote one song put some debth into it . musically " emotions " mix great ballads uptempo soul/gospel songs . all those liked early mariah albums " emotions " welcolmed your hearts too . album starts title track " emotions " soulish uptempo feautures backround choirs , it also best song album , it reached #1 charts . no wonder it catchy uptempo considering co-writers part euro-dance group cc music factory . " you don't remember " typical affanasieff ballad , same " can't let go " my second favorite , it top 5 hit . robert clivill�s/david cole cc music factory also co-wrote 4th song here " make it happen " also dance number also top 5 . " if it over " co-written carole king , it great gospel infleunted songs very beautiful . " you're so cold " dance number . " so blessed " wonderful shows what wonderful voice mariah got , unless you didn't already know . " around you " yet catchy uptempo , but somehow gospel infleunced . " til end time " slowest ballads all here , yes it co-written walt , who else ? " wind " also superslow feautures piano . these 2 songs aren't best though . overall , not many surprises . mariah just proved she could come up second album , almost good her debut . probably little more variation this far more uptempo then her debut more song writers but not just good her first , but very good album nonetheless . anyone who likes her , won't dissapointed if they pick up this one	1

after seeing film quot ; romy amp ; michele ... quot ; i buy soundtrack i quite pleased it . some songs cd better than lot songs come out today . quot ; gogo'squot; , quot ; tears fearsquot ; amp ; belinda carlisle my favourites listen cd , but cd not flaw free . some cheesy songs i never cared like quot ; i want candyquot ; or quot ; cruel summerquot ; included , but that matter personal opinion . some people may annoyed some more prominant songs featured movie not included like quot ; time after timequot ; amp ; quot ; footloose . quot ; however , what annoyed me most version belinda carlisle quot ; heaven place earthquot ; put cd . i never remembered song sounding way before , so next day i bought belinda carlisle album quot ; heaven earthquot ; indeed original album version there much better . i found out later version song this soundtrack actually remix called quot ; heavenly versionquot ; , how it got put here instead i'll never know(incidentally version film original album version ! ) . i no idea if any other songs here remixes , but if you planning buying cd belinda carlisle song , you'd better off buying her quot ; heaven earthquot ; album or greatest hits album . other than cd great nostalgic listen	1

once something canada doesn't suck . kittie debut album " spit " we get see other side gender coin watch 4 women show men what up . although kittie might not most original band universe , it nice get change usual stuff radio time . aside my hometown girl metal band ( babes toyland ) , i wasn't buying into women lead singers heavy metal bands . this cd quickly shut my mouth . since i first bought this cd , it remained one my favorites . " spit " whole emotionally disconnected kick crotch delivered sometimes sweet voiced sometimes growling morgan lander ( vocals/guitar ) , fallon bowman ( guitar ) , talena atfield ( bass ) mercedes lander ( drums ) . this cd 12 tracks heavy guitars , low almost death metal like bass double bass drum percussion occasional slipknot-esque sampling . songs like " spit " , " charlotte " " whore " give you their insight mature subjects like men , relationships rape . normally , i don't like favorite tracks album or rate each song because i think it takes away album whole but my 2 top songs this disc " brackish " " paper doll " . brackish one songs i referred very slipknot-esque . lot sampling production there it probably best track where fallon bowman back up vocals . " paper doll " just disturbing creepy . there remix version this song made it radio . sorry but only original version album . overall , this very good cd . very few cd ever leave my rotation this one never left . me personally , album hang me it gotta good or close slipknot , system down , tool , anything slayer old school anthrax pantera . yes i'm gambling high even suggest kittie could hang these great bands . i wouldn't necessarily say they best band or even best girl band but , " spit " just good album cd itself hangs some my other bands ( talk dancing around equality men women ) . anyway , i give this album 3.8 its enjoyable , listenable style metal . again , kittie not most original band ever but what it , this album pretty good .

dan fogelberg singer-songwriter who his creative feet several musical worlds , spanning rock , pop , country folk . he never flashy artist , coming across almost shy more focused his art than caught up media hype so seems snare so many musicians . fogelberg throw back days when music more honest familiar , modern minstrel singing please himself whatever audience listen . this album begins " part plan , " song early hit fogelberg . song quick-paced pop song supported well known players graham nash singing harmony , kenny passarelli bass , russ kunkel drums , joe walsh 12 string guitars . this song patience your life accepting what thrown you when it comes . way song karma , though i suspect fogelberg would say sometimes karma needs little help . second song , " illinois , " noticeable country flavor . al perkins makes guest appearance pedal steel guitar passarelli , kunkel walsh . this relatively simple well-executed song simple theme , longing state illinois , which also dan fogelberg home state . " changing horses " short little country-flavored ditty making changes your life before you give things chance . this euphemistic song could readily significant others , your career or any number relatively significant issues . don henley plays drums provides harmony this song . " better changes " continues country flavor warning someone their lifestyle they headed trouble if they keep going way they . title track thoughtfully deep melancholy song which dan fogelberg so well . though title " souvenirs , " there references physical souvenirs , song alludes souvenirs couple different ways . one approach souvenirs positive mental imagery remains you you get older . mental baggage you retain you go through life . this song includes string quartet , accordion arp bass , played joe walsh . " long way " reminds me lot justin hayward his melancholy best . this song theme similar " old lang syne , " which approaches this theme much more directly . this well-constructed pop song gives fogelberg opportunity show how well he hold note . next song clever song blinded love , this case it sounds though blinding intentional . " raven flies " pushing toward rock edge pop , pair lead guitars bass helping speed song . this song one better songs this cd . " song half mountain " one man effort , dan fogelberg playing all instruments singing all vocals . this heartfelt song observation nature , includes credit moog synthesizer , which used accent which i initially mistook organ . next song bluegrass . " morning sky " pending breakup couple , different approaches two dealing event . bluegrass flavor enhanced carl perkins excellent banjo pickin ' . this song relatively fast-paced contradicts somewhat relatively serious topic lyrics . next song flavored blues deals man caught up stories someone telling him liaison never happened . " ( someone ) telling you stories " pop elements touch country flavor , perhaps influenced don henley glenn frey backing vocals . last song this cd masterpiece . " there place world gambler " features outstanding harmonies zither , moog synthesizer , piano , saxophone , drums variety guitars deeply layered song . lyrics depths within us , allowing which within released . however , it multi-tracked orchestrated sound catchy pop hooks make this song one dan fogelberg best , best this cd . dan fogelberg incredible ability songwriter singer . this album he joined several members eagles veterans including graham nash , russ kunkel kenny passarelli . amazingly , horsepower provided numerous guest performers used appropriately sparingly , music remains effective powerful rather than bombastic over-produced . such simplicity makes great albums , but not necessarily great singles . it albums such these explains why i rarely listen top 40 radio . greatness not necessarily established popular vote .	1
okay , i admit it , we huge todd snider fans . he worldly insight , incredible talent , awesome , yes i said it , awesome stage presence , great love his fans/friends . what not like ? however , doesn't mean this record isn't up his usual appeal . we anxiously awaited this release delighted when it finally arrived	1
i bought this recording based upon amazon review very misleading . there none zimmer magic . i've since read almost all score actually penned gregson-williams . . . , i believe it	-1
i'm not sure i say more . it awesome . peace train superb , others .....	1
could little better - filler still rules here . but it " crash burn " , " all over town " , " future tense " , " sign gypsy queen " , " just you me " - all great songs . i would give it 5- if it not obvious reason this album too unimaginatively almost one same style not mention style point beaten death dozens other bands . still , great record one most undeservingly underrated unfortunately relatively unknown hard rock bands america . " just you me " played everywhere 1981 but band couldn't capitalize faded into status soon after when they released rather disappointing power play . too bad ..	1
few albums get it all right . this one them . i loved it first time i heard it . it simply brilliant work anyone would foolish ignore	1
tras la decepci�n que supuso el �ltimo disco de sylvian ( el mediocre " dead bees cake " ) su pen�ltimo trabajo " blemish " result� ser algo as� como la ant�tesis de aqu�l . mientras que el primero se gest� lo largo de muchos a�os , �ste se grab� en unas pocas semanas . si " dead bees cake " era el �ltimo trabajo que sylvian grababa en la multinacional virgin records , " blemish " represent� el debut de la nueva compa��a discogr�fica de david ( samadhi sound ) . si en el anterior disco la n�mina de artistas involucrados era enorme el nivel de producci�n notable , en " blemish " el n�mero de colaboradores se ha reducido la m�nima expresi�n ( apenas son derek bailey el propio david sylvian ) la producci�n es m�s modesta pero muy personal . esto viene demostrar por en�sima vez en la m�sica que la forma importa m�s bien poco si no se tienen buenas ideas que plasmar que la calidad supera la cantidad . tem�ticamente , ambos trabajos no pod�an ser tampoco m�s opuestos ; pues si uno describ�a un estado de �nimo feliz satisfecho , el otro ilustra ( al parecer ) una complicada etapa emocional en la trayectoria vital del artista : su ruptura con ingrid chavez , la mujer con la que tan encari�ado se mostraba en el libreto de " dead bees cake " ( iron�as de la vida ... ) . " blemish " es un �lbum minimalista austero , compuesto mediante una escas�sima instrumentaci�n sin innecesarios efectismos de por medio , sin duda alguna una bocanada de aire fresco en el desesperante panorama musical actual en la cada vez m�s exigua discograf�a de este artista . resulta curioso que un �lbum en apariencia tan sencillo como �ste sea tan dif�cil de describir , me resulta muy complicado hablar de �l comentarlo abiertamente . las canciones parecen ser algo as� como mon�logos interiores acerca de malogradas relaciones familiares , desencuentros , rupturas , etc , todo ello cuestiones los que este artista nos tiene acostumbrados . hay temas , como por ejemplo la inquietante " only daughter " , donde la voz de sylvian se corta abruptamente media frase o reverbera de manera extra�a , como si el protagonista de la canci�n no quisiera afrontar alg�n hecho en particular o deseara escabullirse de ese juez llamado conciencia pasando reflexionar sobre algo diferente , evadi�ndose . la m�sica tambi�n contribuye realzar esa atm�sfera cr�ptica en la que sylvian nos introduce de cabeza ; ayudado en parte por el guitarrista derek bailey ( compositor , junto sylvian , de tres de los temas del disco ) . no cabe duda de que �ste es un trabajo dif�cil de asimilar , no es el t�pico disco que puedas poner de ruido de fondo mientras haces otras cosas pues demanda toda tu atenci�n . seguramente provocar� ( de hecho , ya lo hace ) graves divisiones entre los propios seguidores del ingl�s . algunos considerar�n " blemish " como un �lbum audaz , sincero , honesto muy destacable mientras que otros renegar�n de �l diciendo que es un trabajo herm�tico poco inspirado que oculta sus carencias bajo un envoltorio vanguardista . lo que est� claro es que " blemish " no es para todo el mundo , es improbable que deje indiferente cualquiera que lo escuche . deleitar� unos pocos espantar� la mayor�a , disgustada por la franqueza del artefacto en cuesti�n . como sylvian dijo ya hace a�os : " mi m�sica es como estar solo en una habitaci�n contigo mismo . es introspectiva de una manera tal que hace sentirse algunas personas muy mal gusto . la clase de gente que inmediatamente enciende la televisi�n cuando se encuentra sola no disfruta con mi m�sica , les hace sentirse terriblemente inc�modos " . sin duda alguna estas declaraciones del a�o ' 87 le van como un anillo al dedo " blemish " ; un trabajo sombr�o , et�reo , inaprensible , que sin embargo va haciendo mella en cualquiera que lo escuche atentamente varias veces . atreverse con �l es una experiencia curiosa , es ciertamente como estar en un lugar solas con tus pensamientos . sin menospreciar ning�n momento , sobresale especialmente el tema " fire forest " , un bell�simo colof�n que , en un disco como �ste , se asemeja una especie de rayo redentor ante tanta amargura soledad como destilan los ocho cortes compuestos por sylvian ( todos ellos homog�neos perfectamente combinados ) . `blemish ' es un �lbum peculiar honesto que s�lo unos pocos ( los de t�mpanos m�s inquietos ) llegar�n apreciar en su justa medida . para m� es lo mejor de sylvian en muchos a�os . es mucho nada la vez , una abstracci�n sonora , un estado de �nimo , una sensaci�n , un pensamiento hecho m�sica pero ante todo un �lbum �nico irrepetible . gracias sylvian por variar de nuevo las coordenadas de manera tan acertada por volver lo que siempre se la ha dado mejor : la experimentaci�n al retrato del desenga�o , la inadaptaci�n la melancol�a . " blemish " es uno de esos discos indescriptibles que ya no se hacen . es por ello que resulta imprescindible escucharlo para saber de qu� demonios estoy hablando .	1

i've noticed one or two reviews people who see no humor laughing what they felt mental illness , which some us might termed " delusions talent . " fact , florence foster jenkins well-known figure american musical scene , despite her obvious lack ability performer , her inability recognize any her deficiencies , she deeply loved music , faced numerous challenges her parents her ex-husband her pursuit her dream singer . notes cd nice job providing some history behind ms. jenkins her " career . " her one carnegie hall performance sold out weeks before it happened , surely nobody except ms. jenkins believed it hear fine musical performance . everybody else surely laughing her , but she derived great delight such large audience . she happy , we this day hearty laugh her terrible singing . her accompanist , listed " cosme mcmoon , " fact edwin mcarthur , well-known accompanist many fine singers , including legendary kirsten flagstad . small wonder why he used pseudonym , humorous one , his appearances florence . he best he keeping sync her poor rhythm - often challenge . somehow , florence managed below pitch most time , then overshoot her high notes painful degree . it truly hilarious listen . rendition lyadov " musical snuffbox " - actually piano piece , which somebody apparently fitted some banal words some neutral syllables , particularly grating , but worst all , my taste , rendition " queen night " aria " magic flute . " once she far enough into it you recognize piece , it really hoot ! ms. jenkins recorded output not extensive enough fill cd , so various filler selections provided various cd re-releases this recording . this case , extras work couple obscure amateur singers who made recordings just their own use , rather than making public spectacles themselves . english translations operatic numbers dreadful , singing , but don't expect same kind musical disaster ms. jenkins provided . recording quality " historic " ( rather rough ) , but normal re-issue anything 1940s . it fun , so long you know what you're getting , packaging this release nice also backgrouond information .	1

after one play through it obvious why this her worst selling cd . i admit liking some spears earlier stuff but this cd she abandons her pop styling go more hip hop . sure may appeal new audience but honesty , if you liked other stuff , this ain't . if you not bothering her because you liked hip-hop couldn't bother her pop , there no reason why you would paid attnetion it	-1

when you actually sit listen 2 hours same artist , especially when those two hours include every piece crap artist ever pinched out ? middle ten 43 songs here excellent , edgy , not completely slaving any certain genre . but old stuff just proto-60s psychadelic rock ( if it could get more primitive ) . i congratulate him inventing it , but it just doesn't hold up . there also bunch knock-off dylan here . no good . if you want hear best stuff , i recommend " i think demons , " or if you dough , " evil one , " which good songs .	-1
here i rate each song out 10 . please enjoy . wannabe - 10/10their biggest hit ever ! it very popular ! me , it never gets old . it sassy , bubblegum pop sound irresistable ! say you'll there - 9/10can boring some parts , but it still good . it sounds sort oldies/country/pop ! 2 become 1 - 10/10a song sex , but not crude way all . very sweet , candy , teeneager sounding , but it slow , nice song . love thing - 8/10they should released this ! it really catchy sort techno ! some reason , i think it sounds like macy gray song . very good . last time lover - 10/10this song , perfect every way ! it sexy , catchy , great ! way , i'm glad they didn't release it because would weird . it one those songs makes you glad you bought album . mama - 9.5 /10very touching . very popular mother day song . it would great sing mother day your mom ! ( haha ! ) some might think it boring , so i forced take off half point ...! definitely worth listening , it very long song . who you think you - 7/10sort catchy , very loud sounding . song lots energy ! just not even close best song here . it didn't really deserve any higher than 7 . something kinda funny - 8/10great song . it sort boring , though . you'd listen it 15 times before it gets stuck your head ! naked - 99/10best song this album ! this my topped played song my ipod ! should released it !!!!!!!!!!!!! sexy song , very , very , very catchy . great long car rides ! it very serious sounding , full bass . slow song beginning , but then it speeds up . great . if u can't dance - 6/10every album it weak point , this album ... it this song . i still like this song , but it just song you try like so much , you end up not liking it even more end . they sound like tone-deaf robots beginning . you should listen it , maybe you'll think differently . it kind like dance song , but beat slightly slower than mos t.t hat my review spice girls ' debut album , ' spice'! hope it helped ! ^_	1

cheryl bentyne epitomizes good music her voice simply marvelous . she sings these time-tested standards so beautifully . loved music manhattan transfer eighties , i am not new fan ms. bentyne . she indeed awesome vocalist it solo performer or manhattan transfer , which very well-known their hits my favorites - grammy award winning song " birdland , " " boy new york city , " " shaker song " " embraceable you . " this unique ensemble collected least ten grammy awards add their credentials . this recording testament ms. bentyne one most exquisite vocals jazz scene her singing style simply amazing . she backed up talented jazz musicians namely : corey allen ( piano/organ ) he also album producer/arranger/director , kenny barron ( piano ) , john patitucci ( bass ) , lewis nash ( drums ) , don alas ( percussion ) , david newman ( tenor sax ) , chuck mangione ( flugelhorn-solo ) , mark kibble alvin chea ( background vocals ) . my personal favorites include one greatest songs ever written composed george ira gershwin - " they can't take away me " which features wonderful flugelhorn playing one my favorite jazz artists , chuck mangione , who famous his hit tune " feels so good . " you'll also enjoy listening ray noble beautiful song " very thought you , " which according ms. bentyne her very favorite song this collection . it so remarkable this best female vocal version i've heard so far . her charming interpretation " love me or leave me " gave this song whole new style elegance . " these foolish things " so delightfully sentimental i hit repeat button listen it again again again . ditto " it might well spring , " which latin flavor , kind mambo-ish rhythm it makes it real sheer beauty . i truly adore this version . intro arrangements somewhat similar " shaker song . " . . . my absolute number one choice this collection " girl talk , " song composed penned bobby troup neal hefti . her interpretation arrangement so sublime i just loved chorus . but let me tell you , i guess they love shopping clothes , purses shoes more than engaging " girl talk . " least speaking myself - i just " mind your own business ! " philosophy . " we like chat dresses we wear tonightwe chew fat our tresses neighbor fightinconsequential things men don't really care know become essential things women find so aproposit just dame , we're all sameit just game , we call it " girl talk "" girl talk " . . . we all ' meow ' ups downs all our friendsthe who , how , whywe dish dirt , it never endsthe goddess touch , they love so muchall mortal males beholdand though we joke , we wouldn't trade youfor ton goldso honey stay , don't walk awayjust hear me say after " girl talk , " talk me .

cheap trick second album very disappointing me afterthe good , but raw , " live studio " , 1977-76 recordedcheap trick . almost all material here so watered down it really comes off way better later many live disks they . after good start w/ " hello there " , concert favorite many years , only thing here write home when one considers how great all tunes this overproduced album sounded budokan other live recordings later . tom werman rick niesen show 1991 i hadrecorded tape once werman , noce friend tom petersson said , quote : " my three albums cheap trickgot better better ... " , which ever sarcastic ricknielsen said , " selling , maybe . " not realizing brotherrick slamming him , werman then continued , " exactly " ... oh boy . we now see why producing cheap trick albums throughthe years become like playing russian roulette . it nothard get better than this five months later solid , but somewhat oeverrated ' heaven tonight ' came out ... ( theguys even bought werman back dream police . things turned out better when pete comita , then later jon brant joined theband . yep - best yet come - ' 80 '	-1

well , i think there two roles history opera after interpretation maria callas it would not unwise claim they should not performed again : norma bellini ( all recordings she ever made ) la traviata verdi ( definition role lies london 1958 traviata- unfortunately , her 1953 studio recording cetra almost unacceptable considering how she developed role violetta after 1955 ) . although i very rarely sit down write review amazon , after read so much mme callas , i feel it my responsibility fan this great art named opera make following points : a)maria callas not interpreter . she creator herself placed same rank donizzeti , bellini verdi . it not her i doubt opera would exist today if it it would sad , boring musuem exhibit . she recreated whole italian opera -not just bel canto- modernised it way make it last 100 years aftet her death . i remind you opera 50 meant german opera . italian opera before mme callas something joke . terribly abused singers bad tradition horrendus vocalising , music italian composers lost its drama , its sense , its meaning . b)why people spend so much time judging voice this great artist ? why they not just relax enjoy this great artistry ? o-o ne says there no other great singers ! but no matter how great , they unfortunately just : " singers " . caballe , sutherland , sills , price , fleming , dessay all amazing voices great carreers . but , comparing them phenomenon opera what mozart classical music simply not them justice . c)whether we like it or not norma dramatic soprano role ! very difficult one well it should treated some respect . caballe sutherland , because they these amazing voices , manage sing it they sang it well . but , they not dramatic sopranos they conveyed lyricism their interpretation simply not suit role bellini intentions . other attempts however ( sills -alas- gruberova recently)should really remain textbook examples how inflated egos ridicule both theselves work art . i repeat norma dramatic soprano role . this sense only singers approached callas perfection elena suliotis ( decca reason expediency or stupidity not reissuing her marvellous 1968 recording del monaco ) jane eaglen sony muti recording . only singer seems taught callas legacy bel canto mme renata scotto but she well inadequate norma wasted much her talent singing ( commercial reasons , i suppose ) puccini . d)callas very unlucky far supporting cast concerned . 1960 norma recording only exception . it features amazing franco corelli . what voice this man ! pefect voice , perfect dramatic conviction , beautiful clear italian diction . we imagine callas -corelli partnership aida , pirata , manon lescaut ? e)callas not lose her voice even though she overworked it 50s . 1964 tosca recording best proof . but she lose her confidence emotional stability . this fact led her quit her carreer 1965 real tragedy opera . she managed work hard 60-68 period when all her worry ar . onassis we would left least 10 amazing stereo recordings . i say 68 because someone like callas simply would refuse play young soprano roles after age 45 . she believed opera singers like ballet dansers or athletes ( they ! ) , they should retire early . mme sutherland voice till age 60 . so ? it not ridiculous singing la sonnambula age 59 ? if callas she would not legend she ! this all i wanted note woman achieved fame world opera ( beyond !!! ) way noone else before i am afraid no one else so future . people sleep pavements three days three nights get ticket this lady !	1

i bought this cd little over year ago , already huge fan gang four entertainment ! album , i eager hear what other sounds this band store me . i drove out amoeba parking lot , i chose hard/solid gold out many purchases i made night listen first drive home ( place no small distinction ) . words can't describe my disappointment -- rather than hearing band even similar one i heard entertainment !, i instead got some cheesy post-disco 80 pop clearly same singers gang four i knew loved , maybe even some similar guitar work , but all all , left me feeling flat empty it faux motown backup singers drum machine beats . if i wanted good version this sound , i would purchased new order album . rather than attempting return this cd ( it used purchase ) let some other poor sap pick it up continue cycle disappointment , i threw it back my car , where it fell under seat remained over year , occasionally enjoying company gum wrapper or spare change . i knew quality band output some ebb flow , but i didn't want this sound taint my love entertainment ! album . although i realized time this cd two albums it , i naively figured whoever put package together would put better album first . thus , if hard placed beginning , then i didn't even want bear witness supposed horrors would lying wait me solid gold . . . what foolish mistake . last week , i found cd under seat my car decided give it try . sure enough , first few tracks hard sounded just miserable i remembered , but when i skipped ahead track 10 , " paralysed , " first track solid gold album , i found gang four i knew loved . here next logical progression after entertainment !, original lineup featuring andy gill guitar vocals , john king melodica , hugo burnham drums , dave allen bass . even artier weirder than its predecessor , solid gold everything i wanted this band , pushing formula newer greater places . taking cues more entertainment ! tracks like " anthrax " " not great men , " opposed more melodic numbers like " return gift " ( great song ) , " i found essence rare , " " glass , " solid gold what sophomore release band should . describing why i like solid gold bit challenge . . . it somewhat indescribable aesthetic , but if you listen way gill scrapes his guitar strings end " cheeseburger , " burnham stuttered beats songs like " what we all want , " unbridled energy " outside trains don't run time , " king direct , often staccato vocals liberal use melodica , interplay bass drums , or way each song picks you up , then you'll get it . if you liked aspects entertainment ! pushed envelope bit , you should get it too . also , lyrics still great , continuing touch themes like urban alienation , slavery work , social politics , gender issues , general confusion/obsession inner workings failings human social interaction . many others already astutely observed , countless bands owe debt gratitude maybe even few royalties sound gang four forged entertainment ! solid gold . there whole slew newer , soon forgotten bands carry gang four influence like badge ; earlier ( better ) rapture albums certainly borrow bit . o . 4 ., course we currently see many other anglo-beat bands ride trend well . best batch , longest potential , not u washington d.c. , developed sound bears many similarities well , especially when they use melodica . indeed , there plenty others , too many list , who don't necessarily fall into this niche , but borrow certain aspects . o . 4 sound approach-the minutemen , mission burma , fugazi , name few . anyways , what you still reading this ? get out there , pick up copy hard/solid gold , immediately skip track 10 , enjoy !	-1
this cd little more bluesy little bit soul than first one but john mayer music still best any new artist ever . you love it	1
i work my way through various grisman amp ; garcia collabarations i continue astounded amp ; elated . i am particularly taken w/this disc . it much celebration their musical powress their friendship . this disc first several volumes arranged grisman according genre . these traditional folk songs amp ; ballads . grisman releasing them showcase garcia musical depth amp ; breadth . same could said grisman artistry . many songs here i heard first time but definitely not last . accompaning booklet lovingly crafted . history each song presented lyrics . grisman amp ; garcia friendship allow us connect simpler amp ; purer time very much part our legacy . always acoustic disc quality heard fully appreciated	1
this recording less accessible than their later echo echo , but it rewards patient listener . carbon leaf gift ability create gorgeous soundscapes perfectly reflect lyrics each song . gift full flower here , result album coheres whole . expect need few listens before it worms its way into your head , but once it , you'll never forget it	-1
super score . two standards genre : hey there hernando hideaway , but also number outstanding production numbers duets : quot ; seven half centsquot ; , quot ; steam heatquot ; , quot;i'll never jealous againquot ; , quot ; there once manquot ; . most singing excellent but sometimes i admit janis paige isn't pitch i prefer ( dare i say it ) doris day movie . john raitt professional he always . this 50 musical through through , filled serious love songs , comedy satirical bite , endless energy . extra tracks this cd nothing too wonderful , excerpts pretty banal interview composer jerry ross , but they include song you won't hear ( good reason -- despite inteviewer mike wallace glowing support it pretty bad song ) show . want know why this show so good : george abbott , john raitt , bob fosse , harold prince , adler ross , eddie foy , jerome robbins , carol haney , peter gennaro . yes , there shows power-packed line-up like , bad , but not many . enjoy memories this bring back	-1
this release ambitious ( so much better than rap/hip mon ami bon ami release few years back ) - it scritti . there few moments get too precious , beatle-wise ; however total it one very few perfect listening experiences released this year . i just wish green still young blonde . what remarkable talent . makes you think wonder	1
you know how old nintendo games , your score would get so high hud no more space set your score back zero , so you so good you accidentally sucked ? that like opposite this album , which it fails so miserably ( except real american ) almost every area it reaches impossible level greatness . there just something really funny roddy piper screaming stage crew turn off their music because " it giving me damn headache !	1
i dunno why this album so cheap , but i figure they just wanted more people hear good music it . lots bang your buck , these some great songs if you like college rock kind stuff . i guess it kind reminds me strokes . doesn't really sound like though	-1
why earth , given hundreds songs rod could record this era .... he choose certain songs he cannot possibly enhance ? " love hurts ? " so my ears after hearing rod soil perfect nazareth song . " everything i own ? " bread ? rod , could you not gain access partridge family catalog ? " if not you ? " rod , olivia newton-john better interpretation dylan .... 35 years ago ! " still same ? " what sad , fitting title this collection . sad part , thousands sheeple buying this dreck , giving rod license steal yet again . i gave it 2 stars . there two songs aren't bad . first single , " you ever seen rain , " note-for-note remake ccr song can't topped , but rod version safe listenable ... perfect today ac radio . eagles ' " best my love , " which like most songs this collection , way overplayed already , good arrangement . rest either awful , or background noise . rod should embarassed . but course he isn't .	-1
how group fall far they ? " who you trust " " big calm " both classics ( dispite fact they sounded totally different one ) . now " fof " it just went down hill ... never came back	-1
no diss , just myself ... this only album i could not get , jigga let me listen his third it better than this album right here , but good if you got all common albums	-1
i originally discovered this album several years ago while working children radio program i used dj produce . i really enjoyed listening music , but leave cds behind when i left show after moving out city . now i currently am back air internet radio show , i've looking around some good quality halloween music play my new show . there really isn't much out there . lot halloween cds you buy compliations songs rearranged different artists or studio groups . that not case halloween hits . there only 10 songs album , but they all sung original artists . some them halloween favorites , such quot ; monster mashquot ; quot ; ghostbustersquot ; while others related frightening/scary/monster themes shows , such quot;addam family themequot ; quot ; twilight zone themequot ; . it would nice if this cd few more tunes it , but less than $10 , it basically bargain . good cd play halloween	1
problem making " best " album mr. hiatt would same making one john prine or tom waits . all written hits many artists but none one their own . devoted followers always bemoan their favorites left off . but cds like these aren't true fans . they uninitiated . this respect this fine album i enjoy immensely . i own few john albums am glad four my favorite songs them included but real treasure here finding gems i've never heard . this artist great songwriter enthusiastic performer . this cd showcases both aspects quite well	-1
this cd so boring . sarah mclachlan written / performed songs before set people alight her passion , her intensity , her hurt , etc ... these very tired renditions all-too-familiar christmas songs . sure , i stomach kenny rogers christmas , some reason it just seems make sense . but sarah mclachlan putting out christmas album seems nothing more than combination not new material her own needing some more bucks . excuse my frankness , but this album very disappointing	-1
if you're fan carlos santana , paco de lucia , al dimeola , tomatito or any other flamenco-inspired music this cd must . dvd ( 2.0 5.1 )included vida worth purchase price . unfortunately there no samples here amazon , but you go del castillo website listen .	1
you know you some blues when you see album titled " springtime kill you . " but what kind blues we getting ? not broken-hearted , misfortune blues , instead we get what i would call dysthymic blues . jolie sings , klonopin flavored slurring phrases , blues brooding , help-rejecting gloom . blues more than situational . rather sense cheerlessness wrapped up character , blues can't easily cured because her self-pity too important her , too protective . rather than replaced , her sadness , if taken away , would leave her gaping void could only filled uncontrolled anger anxiety . these songs give us sullen blues fueled anger world observant accurate , but no less self-defeating it . i'm not knocking her . i'm just expressing vibe i get listening this album . none this matters , she not my sister , not my friend , what matters if you like music . i . musically , i like her . she good musician , her songs creative . this isn't music i could listen all time , but it music i enjoy when i'm certain heavy-lidded , tranquilly-low frame mind resonate her attitude .	1
i only came across this cd because i remembered line " i'll " wanted find out what song it . when i came across edwin mccain , first thing popped into my mind , " who he ? " i never heard him before . however , after listening some samples listed amazon reading couple reviews , i went ahead bought " misguided roses . " let me tell you , it not something i've regretted . woodwind player flute , alto soprano saxophone recently clarinet , i am very interested instrumentation edwin mccain uses his songs . " i'll " interesting saxophone melody ( which you most likely would not noticed radio ) . addition , " darwin children " ( song you completely fall love if you fan " i'll " ) uses baritone saxophone main feature song . woodwind voice adds certain quality music you won't get other rock bands . " misguided roses " cd good long car drives , or anywhere , matter . when you're listening edwin mccain , there no need keep skipping tracks - this cd good whole way through . unlike some muisician[s ] ..., edwin mccain wrote all songs cd himself , adding certain respect his work . " misguided roses " cd everyone should ! i definitely reccomend it . like me , you wont regret buying it	1
this one my all-time favorite cds . i loved all songs this cd except one . my favorite " black girl pain " it should anthem inspriration black women all over globe . i pleasure seeing talib concert few months ago atlanta his live show even better than his cd . true hip-hop lives	1
wonderful cd but not perfect , few things . first all , let me state she not country or pop but defies definitons . some best performers can't classified she no exception . that one many things i like mindy smith . i love songs out lout , tennessee , i'm not only one asking long island shores . i'm not thrilled little devil i really don't like what if world stopped turning . aside those 2 songs this cd amazing , i would encourage anyone check it out . her music so much better than almost anything else around	-1
way , this cd good , way , it bad . " disneymania 4 " definately isn't best " disneymania " series , but isn't worst either . i think disney messed up songs like " supercalafragilisticexpealidocious " (turining it into rap ) , " bahama roller coaster ride " (which isn't even disney song , it supposed hawainn , not bahama ) , " monkey uncle " (which disney actually allowed pathetic youngster group like devo 2.0 sing ) . some better songs " dream wish your heart makes " , " zip dee doo dah " , " look through my eyes " , " you'll my heart " , " if i never knew you " . i wouldn't highly reccomend this cd , but absolutely huge fans disneymania series , they might want this .	-1
ned burst into " alternative rock " scene god fodder , brilliant debut effort , one best 1991 . " grey cell green " " happy " picked up local radio station , but entire cd spills over raw power . few songs cd ( ex . " kill your television " ) taken their earlier independent label issue , re-mixed here blended match theme cd . energy god fodder similar linkin park " hybrid theory " - fact , if you never listened ned , i would suggest this cd like mix nirvana linkin park . unfortunately , ned atomic dustbin later cds never reach level intensity this album , feeling overproduction , though they manage minor hit " sleeping around " .	1
when i bought this item , i not involve this disney euphoria , my 8 years old daughter ask me buy this cd , once cd home , i just looked her eyes , confirm me i just right thing . priceless	1
i won't say there aren't couple songs i don't fast-forward when i listen this cd .... but general , this one most extraordinary pop albums made so far this century . fact it made 5 years ago truly amazes me . i'm totally unaware cartoon-aspects band nor i any idea who legends behind this work . may or not interesting others but what truly impressive here boldness which this crew saunter through mish-mash styles attitudes almost always deftness purpose cunning .... yes .... some straight-up kicking joyous sounds . there no less than 5 classic hits here which deserve really tuning stereo up ... i mean way up . this rock pop hip-hop dub most extraordinary nature . mcc	1
first two bonus tracks undoubtedly kbfh broadcast gig capitol theater , passaic , new jersey august 30th 1980 . they sound same broadcast , clincher , billy name-checks venue , if you listen . ' la grange ' wasn't part broadcast , afaik , so that dropped elsewhere . ideally , i like know exactly where bonus tracks come , so i tempted dock them half star ! thanks these reviews below , i now know what i listening before cd wasn't mix originally released , which shabby way treat fans . i'm just retrospectively miffed : must so annoying those you who knew it wasn't real deal . ( kiss ' creatures night ' , only remasters sequence giving us mix running order i grown up . i couldn't play original cd pressing , which easy spot wrong era cover , so i empathise you long-time top fans . mind , i've now fan 22 years , come think it ...	1
me llen� de emoci�n cuando supe que habia aparecido esta grabaci�n , accidentalmente . 49 a�os han pasado , desde que se realizara en el carnegie hall , en new york este concierto ben�fico que pasar�a la historia del jazz como un evento hist�rico . escuchar dos m�sicos que son parte fundamental en la historia del jazz , es algo que nos emociona los amantes del jazz . recomiendo ampliamente esta grabaci�n la considero como el cd que no debe faltar en nuestra colecci�n .	1

recent covers albums go , this good one : it aces out cat power concept tori amos sheer consistency . concept this time out isn't sex but " real love , " kind soulful , abiding love not only goes into choosing our mates but also our favorite songs . greg dulli choices eclectic they come . but bless his heart , dulli rocker , one last authentic ones we've got . he digests tricky trip-hop , cabaret-electronica , smoove rb , even jazz , delivers pulsing heart all his song choices good old , electric-guitar-driven rock . but this ain't your daddy guitar rock . this sinuous , layered music , seen through dub-gauze , darkly . sometimes " she loves you " seems emanating directly someone dreamlife , sonic flashbacks chill-out room . mark lanegan , author last year excellent " bubblegum , " pitches back-up vocalist three tracks , but he really just here out comradeship ; this dulli show all way . daringly , dulli uncovers sadism always latent billie holiday masochism truly unsettling version " strange fruit , " he finds comfortable groove bjork fear-of-commitment " hyperballad . " but album two showstoppers tense , surreal " too tough die " ( not ramones song ) , very cool , slightly lounge-y arrangement " black color my true love hair " which just keeps revving up more , which almost great bowie similar heart-pounding treatment " wild wind " ( off " station station " ) . she loves you ? yeah , yeah , yeah .	-1
bee gees one greatest gifts music loving public . group took two paths during their career beginning early ' folk ' like sound through ' disco ' period 70 80 . my preference early stuff such " ny mining disaster " , " first may " " words " . this very fine 2-disc compilation very well put together but ignore some albums . example there no track 1981 " living eyes " . title track this one their finest ballads singles year , while second single " he liar " interesting , although minor hit . one my all-time favourite bee gee hits " spirits flown " . yet ommission , but let face it .... it impossible fit everything two cd . this still fine effort worth your collection .	-1
i am far tech-head , but i would like think i recognize good beats any genre . songs like " just " " traffic " trace-like but still very danceable . i think his blend etheral vocals good background beats really show good number these songs .	-1
this fine band chicago created fabulous album . it very rare indeed find band which fuse good tunes , excellent lyrics rich varied use musical instruments but i am happy report frisbie band . where other bands content repeat chorus ad infinitum , frisbie seem take song make it change pace direction several times . album starts upbeat note quot ; let gets startedquot ; . once you hear first few chords this number you realise you treat . quot ; pollyannaquot ; second effort very pleasant indeed . if you want good example song changing direction , listen quot ; shinequot ; which changes pace mood near end . quot ; paid kindquot ; very strange song indeed speeds up slows down several times . it this song you start hear use trumpet which makes appearance several songs very rewarding hear . quot ; marthaquot ; pleasing ballad which includes what i think bassoon ! quot ; see seenquot ; superlative number which my opinion one highpoints album obvious nod big star ( very similar quot ; back carquot ;) . quot ;d isasterquot ; fine song . then comes what i believe best song album quot ; momentitoquot ; . song everything - 12 string guitars , john fogerty-style vocal delivery trumpets . 30 years ago this song would recorded byrds ! next two songs quot ; hifalutinquot ; quot ; booksongquot ; both strange hard figure out but testament band originality . quot ; vertigogoquot ; classic three minutes pure pop some great harmonies . final song quot ; shufflequot ; banjo it great fun . all all , this album absolute gem should listened every opportunity . frisbie supported matthew sweet recent tours us i pray they come ireland future i think they magnificen	1

definitely their most commercial album sense most people probably their best . nothing ever touch master puppets my opinion , but beginnning end this top notch album without single weak track . if you're diehard metal fan never listen anything else , you might want avoid this one stick pre-black albums . however , if you love solid hard rock/metal album this one handful must own	1

this cd wonderful collection toby keith earlier songs . recorded when toby keith still fully country , before he became more cross country rock . this cd includes hits such " should've cowboy " , " little less talk lot more action , " " you ain't much fun " many more . my personal favorite " he ain't worth missing " . but every song good one i think this cd easily enjoyed any country fan	1

' best ' great update their earlier ' greatest hits ' album . this c.d. provides more highlights mixes songs better , overall . unbelievably , it adds two more classics ' bridge over troubled water , ' but still doesn't make purchase original classic redundant . " hazy shade winter , " " zoo , " " fakin ' it " welcome additions undoubtedly better appreciated than their original release . ( significantly , these songs played oldies stations more now than past . ) their vintage hits don't fool around , either . none them seem old , really . unlike dylan , they comfortable spare , folk music they ethereal , pop production . " sounds silence , " " feelin ' groovy , " " homeward bound " excellent folk . " dangling conversation , " " scarborough fair , " " boxer , " " bridge over troubled water " exquisitely crafted pop masterpieces , " i am rock " " mrs. robinson " folk-rock perfection . if you haven't given enough , then this c.d. rounded off their reunion finale " my little town , " which surprisingly only clocks three-and-a-half minutes . generosity selection make this c.d. must those who love timeless music sixties early seventies .	1
i say keane take coldplay sound but there several differences . if you like coldplay you , probably like keane . i not like coldplay , i find it sounds too mopey me . keane improved upon coldplay sound better vocals more upbeat sound very enjoyable ( if derivative ) sound . it interesting keane used keyboard/piano instead guitars create their emotional feeling . my favorite song ' your eyes open , ' it build up sound emotion , great song . overall great first album	-1

painful hear painful watch . yester-year pop singer who doesn't courage quit . there nothing left so she keeps throwing out pointless album after pointless album stay spotlight ; if isn't highest form egoism i don't know what . she got fame she got fortune she her hits why not just go now please ? what she use shock value early days now seems so trite pathetic . woman nothing more then spectacle very little substance . she uses anything sex religion self promote . yes i fan days like prayer vogue but i moved , why madonna doesn't come same conclusion i never understand . this cd good flavor month but its shelf life way past due . i challenge madonna put concert without all antics overt sexual malarkey dominates her shows ; she would booed right off stage if happen . please enough crucifixion stunts all ready .	-1

i really wanted like this cd . i tried , i really . but end , it never got above generic rock me . yes , it rock pretty hard times , but main thing i couldn't get past pretentiousness lyrics . enough heavy-handed biblical imagery already , barbara ! leave sort thing dylan ... he knows what it . ( fact , they end this cd cover bob " highway 61 revisited , " don't song any favors . ) while barbara keith power her voice , i don't hear much soul . take listen neko case hear difference belter singer who mix strong voice subtlety . musically , cd full pretty straightforward rock riffs , bit lines joan jett without growl later zz top . they're basically competent bar band needs lay off sophomoric " poetry , " honestly , i'm bit baffled overwhelming response this cd gotten here amazon reviews . i guess this might sound good compared lot what you hear mainstream radio mtv ( when they play videos ) these days -- , you'd not doing much exploring outside mainstream over past decade or so . each their own , any case , but lyrics these songs make me cringe . i need it played more freewheeling spirit , more heart , more soul , little more creativity . bit sense humor wouldn't kill them either , matter	-1
this album far one my favorites . some might dismiss it lyrically perhaps musically inferior garfunkel sound . this really quite tragic , i see songs album perfect reflection who what garfunkel stand . i am 24 years old not even alive when album released so i cannot compare it pop music time -- although i never really classified art garfunkel pop --- more art music . what i say his voice , way he chooses use it , songs he chooses utilize it , lyrics he expresses touched me . he artist this album sense he knows himself what he wants say listener . if you looking sensitive garfunkel displaying his usual sensitive tenor voice , then this album you . it might even classified concept album it takes you through journey love	1

1999 capitol released first stereo/mono single disc version this album . 2000 they re-released it , what i read time they goofed not used hdcd master 1999 release . i didn't bother buying it again because i don't player hdcd capability . last week i found out there reason they re-released it 2000 : when stereo version released , radio stations started playing stereo versions songs singles this album . stereo version " wouldn't it nice " carl wilson singing bridge ( ... maybe if we think wish hope pray it might come true ... ) , while it mike love voice mono version we've heard since 1966 . when he found out this , mike love capitol alter stereo version song insert bridge mono version him singing . when you listen stereo version song this cd , you hear how stereo folds down mono briefly during bridge . capitol good job splicing it together ; i hadn't noticed it until someone pointed it out me . altered version this song also appeared compilations released since 2000 . surround sound hi-resolution stereo versions album dvd-a dvd accompanies this release use unaltered track carl wilson singing bridge . i believe 2 lp vinyl set also uses unaltered stereo version	1
what america thinking , making albums nelly chart toppers ? remember time when actual artists made records could go #1 ? remember beatles ? you know , band wrote their own lyrics music ? actually , rap / hip-hop only beats background , which technically isn't music . rapping itself , well , it quite simple really ; if you can't sing , you rap . lyrics rapped so silly too . what moving song " flap ya wings " , notice amazingly clever witty way nelly abbreviates " your " " ya " title . don't give me any " rap way life , dawg " nonsense . it way or life or temporary fad , fact remains same : majority hip-hop bunch uneducated , noisy , loud , obnoxious , cocky , self-centered high school drop-outs who write rhymes piece paper call it art . rap never required any talent , , if things don't change drastically pathetic genre " music " , it never	-1
this cd hi-tech sharp jazzy . it reflects genre cowboy bebop anime series , all but one part first song ( where we hear opening theme song ) all original material . dj ( who speaks songs ) odd , but kind funny -- talking old bands 2040s cracks jabba hutt . if you enjoy smooth tasteful lounge , well some danceable trance/ambient tunes this probably excellent buy you . you might want check your anime shop , before plunking down 30 bucks it , but it still cash well spent	-1

her 2nd release , cash turns extremely solid effort . i really liked her debut ' right or wrong ' , but ' seven year ache ' gave good glance what really come . nothing against outside writers who contributed their songs -but her initial songwriting efforts , she pulls off two extremely strong tracks they carry album ( title track " blue moon w/heartache " ) . all tracks their high points - only i one i usually skip over ' hometown blues " . " seven year ache " great track holds up 2+ decades up there w/the perfect songs this genre .... pretty good overall most . cash vocals strong rodney crowell production clean - almost too clean . good use crowell band former hot band memebers . rosemary butler emmylou harris outstanding harmony vocal work throughout entire disk . extra track this disk ok , but nothing anyone ever missing . live version " seven year ache " muddy either poorly recorded or performed . only live cuts ' interiors ' seems really good quality . sound quality remaster good - it her other two reissues . really worth checking out . btw ... could not find any reissues stores . all ordered through amazon .	-1

i always liked his music , he one best market . lately he made some wrong choices , looking easier success ... anita baker story should teach him something .... i like this cd , but don't think it spectacular ... it very much ' babyface ' , which ok . he needs some pure inspiration , some new excellent musicians , try new , little more adventurous path sing song regina belle , most consistent brilliant vocalist available nowadays ... just check her terrific latest ' lazy afternoon ' out ... most all , he needs forget glitz glamour ... charts ... 48 , he can't make more mistakes . what we're expecting him next time some really fresh , different , quality contemporary music , which stand test time . if he truly inspired , success follow	-1

easily one my favorite dylan albums , if it not top five , it certainly top ten . lot people , who written off mr. d relevance , taken aback when this record came out . there lot , " dylan back . " or " i knew he it him . " kind comments going around after folks gave this record listen too . folks biz , those know , started calling " oh mercy " dylan comeback record . but then there those who faithful fans , listening appreciating his music all . them , dylan never really gone anywhere come back . said , this record harkens back those dylan albums yesteryear , those story songs so wonderful . this most certainly five star album one you absolutely must own . reviewed stephanie san	1
good talent evidence such no more tears tells you , zakk wylde wasted solo artist constantly ripping his own music , creating average album after average album without break ( one every year ) talking smack everyone but drozzy . his fake biker persona tough-guy exterior only veils his insecurities guitarist his creative bankruptcy . mafia , which i some hopes since 3-star blessed hell ride truly dissapoints . suicide messiah its catchy riffing chorus pulled me into getting this crap even zakk not listen years come . then you this river , so-called tribute mighty dimebag . zakk everyone noticed made great name during after dimebag sad untimely death repeatedly talking how close he great southern trendkiller . then you expect mandatory tribute song utterly cheesy , classless stupid this river . wish it dime who makes it other end river ! if zakk stops concentrating bitching other artists , throwing eggs legends singing like wannabe ozzy , perhaps he make some good music future .	-1
world where most artists assume they produce noisy , discordant , non-melodic fodder equally beguilled public these guys nice retreat . just plain good ole rock you play all way thru without torturing yourself trying listen it 10 times before " you get it " like some crud passed off art these days . ( yes , i hate emo death/thrash metal)this only album theirs i've listened looking forward grabbing rest their work	1
" louder than bombs " smiths compilation sorts , collection non-album singles , b-sides several tracks smiths ' first compilation " hatful hollow " . many these tracks you can't get anywhere else . well , you get them " world won't listen " , but that very similar compilation this one . it good value collection , fine introduction band , i think . there 24 tracks , recorded 1984-1987 , all different styles moods . all fantastic guitar playing johnny marr , while andy rourke bass mike joyce guitar keep things catchy too . morrissey lyrics though , what makes this record , smiths , really special , i think . he witty times , he warm , he sympathetic he despairing , often all same song . he comes up some great little phrases his songs . subject matters , he covers all sorts things , just johnny marr covers all sorts moods . " shoplifters world unite " lends ear commercially compulsive , " this night opened my eyes " sees mother abandon child , " girl afraid " touches pushy girl/passive guy relationship , " you just haven't earned it yet baby " ( which i reckon really should gone hit single ) sums up pain struggling striving , whether attempts find love or attempts famous . it one my favourites album band , " rubber ring " , where morrissey urges listener not " forget songs made you cry , ones saved your life " spare happy thought him after such songs helped you through tough times . if anyone else singing it , it might come across bit arrogant , but smiths wrote some powerful songs , morrissey knew it ! there also instrumental johnny marr ( " oscillate wildly " ) very strange , but typically morrissey , cover song ( twinkle " golden lights " ) . booklet fairly simple , but it comes lyrics all songs , which very nice band like smiths . overall , great introduction band , great addition smiths/morrissey collection , great bunch songs . recommended .	1
i loved this cd since i bought it day it came out . i love songs fact sting relaxed injects so much humor throughout album . japanese release contains " everybody laughed but you , " added song placed within songlist ( #8 ) not tacked afterthought . it b-side if i ever lose my faith you cd single great song well worth including	1
obie trice , member shady records , released his sophomore effort , called " second round me " . his first album , " cheers " , released back 2003 , very promising debut . i loved album , i'm starting like this one just much i like his first . obie definitely through lot this year . he almost killed when someone shot him driveby detroit , he also lost his cousin proof ( . i . . ) . so , i thought obie would definitely come it this album . i've waiting this long time , considering release date pushed back quite few times . well now it finally out it doesn't let me down all . after intro , which his mom yelling him because he selling drugs , very first song " wake up " . i love this cut . he rhymes how black people need wake up before society takes them down . good track start out . " violent " next . honestly , it nothing special , but i like obie chorus i like beat eminem . course , it how he violent . next track , " wanna know " , first track i heard this cd long time ago . this certain video game soundtrack but i can't remember which one . anyway , i love this cut . sample chorus great . obie rhymes point well . " snitch " akon track i mixed feelings . one thing , whole " don't snitch " thing wasn't good begin , now it played out . but , akon chorus very , very catchy . it hard deny song akon chorus ( atleast me it ) . song sounds pretty good , despite topic too cliche . so it actually okay track . " cry now " cut released single ( i think ) . i seen video it imf one day . song great . beat witt pep awesome , obie tells haters they cry now . " ballad obie trice " nice too . eminem made beat electronic voice saying " ob-ie trice " over over again chorus , which i think cool . " all my life " featuring nate dogg catchy song made ladies . it kind like laid-back party track . i like beat trell , nate dogg chorus catchy , always . " there they go " sort like detroit posse cut , eminem trick trick appearing . everyone drops good verses , especially eminem , production good . trey songz drops good chorus " mama " , 50 cent stops give decent chorus " everywhere i go " . " obie story " probably best song this album offer . it starts off obie telling how he little kid , then him slanging dope , then his daughter born how he changed his life around . production jonathon rotem excellent so obie lyrics . perfect way end album . album few duds well . " lay down " isn't necessarily bad cut , but obie flow doesn't match beat well . song sounds little off-kilter . " jamaican girl " falls flat , basically filler song . " kill me mutha " just song same boat " violent " " lay down " . " out state " , where obie raps how he going get his paper no matter what , just hustling track fails take off . " ghetto " nice chorus trey songz , but again , concept worn out . there way too many " this ghetto " type tracks they get old after awhile . " 24 " done-to-death song . who cares what his rims sitting ? i don't . despite these drawbacks , album solid one obie . i like he doesn't overload his album skits it doesn't play much over hour , i think it only clocks 62 minutes . there too many albums whole 79 minutes worth crappy music . i'm glad this doesn't . yes , album may really dark album , but if i through what he through this year , my album would dark well . i still wouldn't say this album beats cheers , i don't even think it good cheers , but it definitely good album . i think his next album , obie needs stay away worn-out subject matter topics his songs so there won't much filler his next album . tracks like " out state " , " kill me mutha " , especially " 24 " don't belong obie trice cd . but all good tracks this album offer override bad ones . so all all , obie made good record . nice lyrics decent production make great listen . if you're obie trice fan , you won't disappointed picking this up . i still recommend this any one who likes hip-hop well .	-1
name song quot ; sleepwalkquot ; santo amp ; johnny . i don't know if you'll remember you ever asked this question but there your answer	1
this solid rock album . but it not good their previous effort quot ; spiritual machinesquot ; . sound more bottom it ( thanks bob rock -- or no thanks ? ) but same time it isn't heavier , which strange . first i very disappointed album ( i all their previous recordings ) , but it eventually grew me . however , if this new direction band , i don't know if i like where it going	-1
bup , bu bu bup , bu bu bup , bu bup , bu bup bup - percussive use electric piano so mind-blowingly catchy this album , i listened kill moonlight obsessively two months . i disagree reviewer who said girls tell more immediate two albums . if nothing else , sheer a**-shaking nature most moonlight makes it so much fun new listeners take ( this my experience experiences those whom i introduced spoon ) . i also ( vehemently ) disagree other reviewers who stated kill moonlight empty , or somehow otherwise unfulfilling . degrade spoon fourth lp offering nothing more than experiments rock band into arena indie dance sounds ignore depth meticulousness which britt daniel company pen their songs . take , example , small stakes . first listening , i don't think anything stands out quite much overall pulsating feeling music . keyboard tambourine - this seemingly all needs exist lean world spoon creating . closer inspection reveals lyrics just gnawing incessant beat : " oh yeah , small stakes ensure you minimum blues/but you don't feel taken you don't feel abused/small stakes tell you there nothing do/can't think big , can't think past one or two alright ! /yeah , alright/me my friends sell ourselves/short but feel very well/we feel fine , aw we feel fine/ ... " . how could anyone call this album vapid ? juxtaposition uber-danceable music restless lyrics youth reveal such gutting , underlying dissatisfaction or meaninglessness . lot spoon music this album youthful revelry - escapism it all . take way we get : " we get high backseats cars/we break into mobile homes/we go sleep shake appeal/never wake up our own/and that way we get ! " or jonathon fisk , song bully daniel small-town past : " jonathon fisk speaks his fists/can't let me walk home my own/and just like knife down my life/so many ways set me right/ ... /jonathon then says it sin/but he don't think twice ' cause him/religion don't mean thing/it just way right wing/ ... " . lot spoon fans complain when spoon comes out new album because it always aesthetically different last release . i agree spoon each album doesn't ( shouldn't ) sound same . each time around they push themselves create well-crafted thoughtful albums without confining themselves one sound . ultimately , exactly why i am recommending this album - it sounds amazing it lot say	1
any mp3 you find can't this justice - you need original article . buy it glad you . this album chill f**k , but it won't put you sleep . same way reich or glass maintain static dynamic , this album always move if you look - otherwise , it content lounge background . i like it most because it what i think ' optional listening ' album : there great depth if you choose listen critically , yet album doesn't require thinking cap enjoy . ( yes , very intentional dig recent ' idm ' .	1
i bought this album because i am so into sigur ros moment it seems all reviews i read say " ... if you like sigur ros you like mbv .. " let me say this album no where near sigur ros experience . if i could compare them anyone it would very early cocteau twins , though i must clear i don't think singer anywhere close artistic sense vocal talent elizabeth fraser . it would more palatable if production value higher .... it sounds terrible . sound quality comparable some old vhs tapes i mid 80 i recorded off tv ( then soaked water few days ! ) .	-1

... when you're gearing up suicide . this whole album sounds like last thoughts comments person who going just end it all . i found myself suffering nightmares , fatigue , misery paranoia . my ears unclogged but i started getting headaches fuzzy feel my head . this not good album stressed , because it just make you feel worse . i find this album unlikable mostly unenjoyable . when i first listened it it sounded inaccessable , after listening it more more i started get more " into " it , but i can't say i found it good place . it somewhat interesting album , but it mostly just dragged me down , made me nervous , numb hurt my head . people say this great music . let them say what they want . give me some old fashioned enjoyable music doesn't make pest itself . kid just ok me , hasn't worth all effort " get into " . this almost seems like sadomasochistic album spank listeners . i don't know , maybe i'm missing something , but hear some " weird " music like this miles more heart alot kinder ears , try " passengers " u2 . thom york sings like muppet this album . way i've enjoyed radiohead first three albums quite bit ( including pablo honey -- why people always busting its chops ) .	-1

" le le low " greaaat song . i love guitar it , beat always makes me want dance .

" more show " great course amazing lyrics like " dollhouse drawn sand . random lack dirty hands " . it complete feel good song .	1

first things first : you not heard this album until you've blasted it full volume nyc traffic . hip-hop not get more new york than this album . i don't know what people saying production this album , but it really showcases aesop evolution composer . he should release instrumental album . he produces all but four songs this album , it really amazing . admitted , lyrics not good labor days , but production incredible . blockhead also holds his own , three incredible tracks including " greatest pac-man victory history , " which only uses sounds mixed classic pac-man video game ( besides drumline , course ) . only track isn't standout super fluke . so just buy album , cause it worth it , punk	1

i pre-ordered this set , knowing i going buy it regardless reviews not yet posted . i got it locked $23.99 , which subsequently changed $29.88 day this review . so there may lesson value pre-order , especially if you just know you indeed make purchase . big george harrison fan , now knowing all we look forward things already exist , i happy see expansion his catalog modern age sound engineering well visual arena this se t.t he dvd made me go this route rather than cd only , nine or ten dollars less than 15 minute disc , i am not sure monetary value . i guess years come , i happy i spent up expanded set . this dvd one thing my expectations future . both previously issued " dark horse " dvd this one nicely rendered 5.1 videos 1991 japan concerts , which must mean there videos all songs double cd . i hope we see those songs concert dvd future . dvd bit shock me , because years listening cds tour japan , i assumed terrific slide work " give me love " george himself . it surprising watch both harrison clapton strumming acoustics , while andy fairweather-low replicated slide sound harrison style . still , it nice see george playing front crowd . rest songs dvd basically audio soundtracks montage stills non-related video support songs . alternate take " sue me , sue you blues " really stripped down raw . it would nice cd too . actual album nicely rendered it ever . george voice strong clear , while band musical playing comes through exactly where it needs . elements sounds very nicely balanced . quality songs historical data point george post-beatles career . he really strong album measured against this sophomore studio recording . my opinion he such deep catalog waiting put " all things must pass " , he may set bar too high any future endeavors . this very good album , but me " all things must pass " better one , especially first listen . i played this new rendering " living material world " 5 times now , i am just beginning get point able " know " songs . still , this must anyone wishing fill out their harrison collection more modern media ( my first litmw 8 track ! ) . fwiw , my enjoyment this album indeed all my george harrison albums , including wilbury , greatly enhanced my purchase book , " while my guitar gently weeps , music george harrison " ( available amazon ) . it chronologically breaks down every era george music offers nice details recording sessions all his work . this album example , there 15 pages devoted band he used , who played which songs even review how record received fans critics . true fans george music , this book make all your albums more fun listen , open your eyes parts his thinking you may not known .	-1
[ ... ] means i don't know how much stro 89th key involved production . but song ( title cut ) he great , i bet he influenced lot other songs , if he didn't produce them entirely . beats tight , lyrics right target . there ain't much pimpin ' or bitch slappin ' , but that part beauty album . indeed , " mind power " points out hazards such activities . track reminds me us 3 " knowledge self . " i would say it not out-of-this-world experience i hoping it would , but it definitely solid album . i feel comfortable recommending it my hip-hop connoisseur friends , even though i'm not one myself . ohmega , oh make album	-1
i've always thought " get back " sessions one most fascinating periods beatles ' history . back-to-basics concept ; infighting ; iconic rooftop concert ; multiple attempts create finished album dozens songs hours aimless tapes ; treasure trove bootleg material surfaced years later . album finally emerge sessions , " let it , " intriguing document any other produced band . beatles such reputation perfectionism it refreshing hear them let loose bash out few jams . despite palpable strain sessions ( captured " let it " film ) , their musical partnership still strong capable producing amazing collaborative efforts . first two efforts constructing " get back " album ( which available bootlegs but should really released officially ) more faithful initial goal sessions : capture band live sound reduce their dependence overdubs retakes . phil spector finished product retains dialogue , jokes , technical blemishes . it also edits , lengthens , adds orchestral overdubs several songs ( but point , beatles largely abandoned back-to-basics idea anyway ) . result unique hybrid studio sheen rough edges , meticulous craft fluid spontaneity . it also contains some beatles ' very best songs . george dryly humorous " you blue " personal favorite . universally acknowledged classics like " two us , " " get back , " " let it , " " across universe " speak themselves -- how any album containing these songs could branded disappointment , i may never understand . when discussing " let it , " it common hear cliche bad beatles album still better than most bands ' best material . forget . " let it " great album its own right	1
i disagree last reviewer -- i this album it excellent -- it not reissue life . upon more than superficial examination album description , it reads , " reissue hit swedish pop quintet 1994 debut four tracks european edition their 1995 album ' life ' added bonus tracks , ' pikebubbles ' , ' travelling charley ' , ' sunday circus song ' ' closing time ' . " it their first album bonus tracks european version life . carnival isn't one them . it probably not good idea judge this album based facts aren't true . cardigans always release great , interesting intelligent records i would recommend emmerdale any other cardigans cd future listeners .	1
okay , this going short sweet . why should you buy this album ? you should this album because it combines humor , sarcasism , fantastic lyrics , some great riffs create fantastic stripped down no frills attached rock roll album . its great it not get lost it what it attempts achieve , which itself achievement these days world indie rock . just when you thought indie rock taking turn toward pretentiousness , essence replicating creating same sentiments over over this album comes blows such turn out water . truly great stuff . take listen	1
what whole world let alone cali doing 92/93 , not what they where doing 99 , just maybe 7 years apart but rap not heading into 2000 without bang , if it wasnt 4 dre-2001 . greatest album far , im speaking albums concept , beat production , this ahead its time . people may say there party songs what not , but since this album droped , it still hasnt got old , snoop came , heard beats , reestablished his dre career , eminem just stamped his trademark lyrics , 2 tha good(then died out)but not this album . all all if dre showed people how 2 it 1992 through 99 , he showed them how 2 keep it going . next episode , xplosive , every track it going , only problem some songs needed 2 little bit longer . so you could say lyrics where not better , not good , but it everybody pouring there heart out some creative rhymes , six 2 , snoop , kurupt , dre even brought back d.o.c. , devin dude , i mean come , this 4 ever greatest album , until maybe detox . please believe me	1

drive long praised one most innovative extraordinary groups music . however there time their career when they just finding their footing growing into monster they would become . trial stage " acrobatic tenement " , but this , their sophomore album " in/casino/out " , drive displayed what they known , years now : amazing song-writing . if you're not familiar early stages band went through get where they , then this utmost importance listen . not just , but it even more evidence why drive easily one best bands last 10 years , one most inspirational original groups emerge music . " alpha centauri " opens album dizzying fashion , giving way shattering guitar chords , frantic drumming , soulful performance front man cedric . jim omar play off one interesting ( most impressive ) guitar structures progressions , most times leave your jaw floor . however they only complimented paul rumbling bass lines tony outlandish drumming . this just first song . don't get comfortable , because quickly " alpha centauri " ends , jarring , schizophrenic " chanbara " kicks showcasing its wild yells , interesting drumming excellent lyrics . you hear bit mars-volta-ish style vocals during verse , which sign things would come future after drive in break-up . but just quickly band floor you powerful tracks , driving numbers like " napoleon solo " " hourglass " show how diverse they get drop hat . however i wouldn't say this difficult listen all . " hulahoop wounds " , " now .. we toast " " transatlantic foe " all upbeat accessible , but they easily balanced out more aggressive pieces like " shaking hand incision " " devil among tailors . " there such wide range dynamics writing here , it hard get bored anything band presents . all 11 tracks found album though , " lopsided " got absolute best . i go far say it best song band ever written . now course i hold certain bias since it both first song i ever heard band my personal favorite . like all songs found disc , lyrics absolutely stunning ( cedric really one greatest writers music ) musicianship unparalleled . furthermore it probably most strikingly different tune band ever recorded . while every song record instant classic itself , " lopsided " truly set standard what i held drive too . after all said , there not single moment this cd anything less than enjoyable . while this album not considered great their final album " relationship command " , ( i no idea why though ) " in/casino/out " really necessary purchase all fans band , indie-rock/post-hardcore general . it really biggest stepping stone band discography , if it lead great products like " vaya " " relationship command , " it would seem like there little complain . while " acrobatic tenement " bit pre-mature , " in/casino/out " truly when this band become one innovators modern music . easily deserves endless mass praise .	1
there legions one hit wonders who their one big hit disappeared music scene . when don mclean burst upon charts quot ; american piequot ; there good chance he might quickly disappear well since it fairly obvious odds against him ever bigger hit . but while mclean never hit popular he certainly proved he more than one great song him when he wrote quot ; vincentquot ; ( a.k.a. quot ; starry starry nightquot ;) couple very good songs quot ; i love you soquot ; quot ; castles air . quot ; i even like his quot ;d riedelquot ; song anybody who cover roy orbison quot ; cryingquot ; shows good taste well . yes , it clear there there songs this album not worth listening more than once , but ones good simply great . mclean clearly one those artists where you just need his quot ; best ofquot ; album . final note : i always thought name character vincent television quot ; beauty beastquot ; taken mclean song given line : quot ; but i could told you , vincent , this world never meant one beautiful you . quot	1

steve khan green field appropriately named : it fertile , sweeping plain musical feeling insight fills listener both peace awe . there something special trio khan , dejohnette pattitucci one finds almost nowhere else : ability each player make their own unique mark music while same time contributing cooperative sum greater than three put together . khan long favorite mine couple simple reasons : his melodies catchy , his solos articulate moving , his sense rhythm ( accompaniment ) provide bill evans-like brush strokes perfectly appropriate . dejohnette , most know , master musician whose drumming like fire ice -- controlled understated until you come understand power lurks just beneath graceful surface . patitucci blends marvelously -- he drives momentum provides melodic interest all same time . my view , steve khan one most underrated guitar players jazz today . he shouldn't . this disk show you , his smart melodies beautifully architectural improvisations rank very best . i highly recommend this disc . it make you fan	1
george strait " greatest hits " released 1985 contains his first 10 hits . it incredible collection shows why george so successful . very beginning , he worked some best songwriters producers business , which really shows this work . george ton hits now #5 country artists all-time . it all started these songs . 1 ) unwound - george first hit kick-started his enduring career peaking #6 1981 . terrific up-tempo song lots fiddles , it first many hits he recorded written or co-written dean dillon . this amusing song drinking away your problems contains this amusing lyric - cause woman i had/ wrapped around my finger just come unwound . terrific stuff . 2 ) down out - great swing song . this song only went #16 1981 , but it would more than decade before one his hits stopped short top 10.3 ) if you're thinking you want stranger ( there one coming home ) - george first top 3 hit ( #3 1982 ) one his best songs ever . story couple growing apart , song manages pack amazing variety under 3 minutes . 4 ) fool hearted memory - george first #1 hit ( #1 one week 1982 ) beautiful up-tempo ballad man remembering old love . 5 ) marina del rey - george first hit slow ballad ( #6 1983 ) . it some really lovely lyrics , such : we looked into each others eyes/ we found our bodies lost paradise/ like castaways/ marina del ray . 6 ) amarillo morning - simply my favorite song george ( #4 1983 ) . true classic bull rider , cmt deservedly named it one top 10 country songs all time . lyrics so evocative , starting incredible beginning ( amarillo morning/ up san antone ) best lyrics any strait song - well i'll looking eight/ when they pull gate/ i'm hoping that/ judge ain't blind . fade-out violins haunting apropos ending . 7 ) fire i can't put out - george second #1 hit ( #1 one week 1983 ) story past love . 8 ) you look so good love - includes somewhat sappy spoken-word interlude ( #1 one week 1984 ) . it not one my favorites cd but quite smooth . 9 ) right or wrong - george got back recording some hit swing this song ( #1 one week 1984 ) . it sounds contemporary but could recorded hank williams ; extraordinary song . 10 ) let fall pieces together - sweet ballad finding solace arms when you're pain ( #1 one week 1984 ) . this cd must-have fans george strait country music ; every song here quite good . although his later box set includes all these songs , i like this collection well , it absolutely no filler . most highly recommended .	1

when mccartney beatles , he more or less held check songwriter john lennon , who really guiding force behind beatles sound . without balance , mccartney went off his own basically , became less less discerning . or , maybe he just felt his fans weren't sophisticated . i suppose we'll never know . anyway , mccartney first solo albums beatle-type stuff , really , not bad . then came , " band run " which marked turning point , typifies rest mccartney work . i can't imagine how anyone listen this sort garbage without recalling great sound beatles songs like , " i call your name " , " you can't " , " drive my car " , or " i feel fine " . when artist musician robert crumb once asked why he killed off one his comic book characters , " fritz cat " , crumb replied character become " too cute " " needed killing . " after hearing " silly love songs " , " jet " , " band run " , " listen what man said " , " let ' em " piped through public address systems every grocery store retail chain i've last decade , i pretty much feel same way paul mccartney music : it too cute , it needs go away .	-1
released prior inchoate stage " grunge " movement , neil young crazy horse " ragged glory " stands alone work exemplary garage-rock . devout admirer young entire catalog , i must say " ragged glory " remains my unequivocal favorite . album represents epitome songcraft sheer power ; neil lyrics make seemingly mundane ( yet archetypal ) human experiences seem positively transcendent . absolutely epic soundscapes " country home " nearly utopian idealizations " love only love , " crazy horse created extraordinarily affective portrait life , love , loss , apprehension . " over over " contains one most memorable hooks i've ever heard my life .

radiohead started new millenium this , fractured twitchy record , frighteningly alien ( post apocalyptic chill ) but same time warm tender . album art says it all , showing bleached barren landscape overrun strange " evil teddy bears " . it radiohead definitive artistic statement , self consciously arty esoteric , but same time it where their sound headed all . opening pulsing keyboards " everything its right place " ending ( after several minutes silence ) soundscape bell like sounds , which builds what sounds like hundreds whispering voices ( then more silence ) . kid arresting listen , it demands you hear whole thing start finish . it very easy want so . some would find it too shocking , indeed , it described nightmarish . but underneath everything songs still pure their intent , if one concentrates them , they create their own story it . lyrics full confusion , loneliness , anger , defiance , something radiohead known . guitars may gone but radiohead still there . sonically , album relies largely repetition , particularly bassline terrific " national anthem " beats scattered throughout album something marvel , sparse metallic , but oh so listenable . album also takes styles not covered before radiohead such electronic music " ideoteque " , abstract very thin ( also most vocal centred song album ) ode what seems human sin ignorance . kid hard record love , but rewarding experience one find way . it transcendant piece music should not taken lightly .	-1

justly acclaimed set , now offered price cheaper than even naxos ever manages . incidentally each copy i've seen full booklet description tracks various cds [ .. ] this strauss integrale , aided recording quality never less than very acceptable usually excellent , ranks surely best thing even rudolf kempe ever . every piece works , but rather brusque metamorphosen , try i might , i can't admire - it lacks poetry christoph von dohnanyi wonderful version which i've praised elsewhere amazon - somewhat lumbering couperin dance suite devoid sparkle neatness characterizing erich leinsdorf asv rendition ( best luck trying track down ) . otherwise , though obviously it would shame miss out herbert von karajan , fritz reiner , sir georg solti , etc . ( or even underrated zdenek kosler aus italien ) , you could derive very good idea strauss orchestral accomplishments even if you never bought non-kempe recording again . two particular highlights : first , best ( because noblest ) don quixote ever committed disc ; second , milk-white tone manfred clement ever-fresh oboe concerto . where else you get even adequate - let alone impressive - performances such curiosities macbeth , violin concerto ( slightly marred soloist moments wayward intonation ) , or improbably-named parergon zur sinfonia domestica ? wonderful dresden band - associated strauss early 20th century onwards - such pieces , rather than usual provincial ensemble boxy-sounding broadcast dub some fugitive central european label , treat . this collection indicates gravity orchestral music loss when kempe died 1976 , all too early ( conductor ) age 65 .	1

record buyers certain age title this 1974 collection become default label any artist collection odds ends . small part , it catchy rhyme , but primarily it because this album defines essence non-album album release : alternative chronicle great band career point , overflowing non-lp , b-side previously unreleased tracks high artistic quality ( " little billy " " too much anything " " glow girl " " naked eye " " pure easy " ) , deep historical significance ( high numbers ' " i'm face , " unexplainably faded end this cd remaster ) , or concert favorites hadn't made it disc ( " long live rock " ) . original 1974 vinyl release would made five star straight-up reissue , but addition dozen more rarities , this album asserts its place longer-form cd world greatest rock ' ' roll odds-and-ends collection ever created . rare acetates " leaving home " " baby don't you it " document group early fascination motown , unreleased 1967 take eddie cochran " my way " shows off both muscle swagger . sympathy-for-the-stones cover " under my thumb " great historical artifact ( though it begs question why single flip , " last time , " isn't included ) , previously unreleased alternates " mary anne shaky hands " " love ain't keeping " show how band approach radically impact songs ' final groove . additional concert favorites include studio recording " young man blues " doesn't match grit previously released " live leeds " version ( nor , apparently , studio master take released 1969 label sampler " house track built , " inexplicably not included here ) , after-the-fact studio take " water .

echoes nature : ocean waves quickly became my favorite nature sound cd . it contains 4 tracks , each distinctly unique ocean sound . note : if you one those who not like animal sounds , couple tracks contain seagulls seals . i personally find them enjoyable , but then i am not using cd fall asleep . my personal favorite track big surf i love huge crashing waves . captivating relaxing . i later decided purchase other ocean recordings just more variety but not found any good . ( i've tried solitudes , sounds earth , but both dissapointing me comparison ) .	1

before getting steamed title my review , take time read my review objective sense . my critical anaylsis this album strictly objective possible . i took my time listening every single " song " this album , so this isn't uninformed review . now review . ------------------------------------------------------------ hell earth , mobb deeps third release , came out during era media-fabricated infamous east-coast-west-coast beef . throughout album , you get sense artist where suffucated negative climate time . songs lyrics this album , every way , reflect era . starting off album deep bass mixed dark-drum line instrumental . havoc prodigy lace beat self glorifying , tough guy lyrics accentuate grimy instrumental . though this album 14 tracks , you've hardpressed differentiate one other if it wasn't switch beat . level variation subject matter this album so limited review one tracks lyrics tell you all you need know album , lyric wise . there little no song concepts this album . nearly every single track hell earth polluted numerous references someone getting shot , how much better prodigy havoc than you , how they queensbridge , etc . through lyrical context this album , you almost get sense mobb deep too consumed negative climate rap time . you get sense they're lashing out anyone everyone may pose potential threat them . cuts like " drop gem them " " bloodsport " find them verbally attacking late tupac shakur . lyrics this album get so rediculous times you wonder what these guys thinking . you truely sit back question how these guys could put out track after track same tired material . only saving grace this album instrumentals . dark , grimey , horror movie like , they paint background horror terror . though good , instrumentals this album also start sound repetitive you get deeper into album . after while , they all start sound like cluster same stuff . i'm sorry , but no way shape or form this great album some stated . lack variation topics , ignorant , mindless gun thug brovado give this album no depth . if you're someone looking intelligent lyrics or creative concepts , yourself favor avoid hell earth all cost	-1
this album holds most weight my cd collection . specifically there four songs me never grow old or get boring they : - episodes which beautifal urban raw mystical feeling it stirs something inside no other hip hop song ever . universe war featuring common which amazingly powerful track . no great pretender - i would say most accomplished song episodes black thought finally chilled hypnotic , which just pure brilliance . it still some experimentalness it but nothing compared organix . its better produced than previous album " you want more " which classic also . cut long story short , this album powerful chilled jazzy hip hop its finest one smartest rap groups ever existed . it lead me admit roots my favourite hip hop group , you can't go wrong buying this album	1
best thing this album it one those undisputed classics you get just any place few bucks . jangle-pop doesn't get any better than this , neither indie rock , matter . tf great band , this their best album ... i am looking forward snagging their new best comp , _four thousand seven hundred sixty seconds_ . teenage fanclub band never graced goodlooking covers their albums . _bandwagonesque_ no different . just goes show : don't judge yadda yadda yadda ...	-1
i enjoyed listening this work quite often college still replay it my mind times . get lost your imagination add your own playing if your mind handle it	-1

go-go formed 1978 emerged their ska punk roots become goddesses pop punk when " we got beat " became underground hit 1980 . pop scene greeted go-go certain amount surprise , it seemed , because all-female band could play instruments wrote most their own songs . contrast their punk sensibility their perky , poppy demeanor made curious , memorable image suited glossy cynicism 1980s . " go-go's: greatest " best-of album covering band char t-t opping hey day 1980s . 14 tracks represent 3 albums go-go recorded before their breakup 1985 . ladies ' line-up " greatest " : charlotte caffey , lead guitar keyboards ; belinda carlisle , lead vocals ; gina schock , drums percussion ; kathy valentine , bass guitar , rhythm guitar , backup vocals ; jane wiedlin , rhythm guitar backup vocals . 1981 " beauty beat " , we #2 hit " we got beat " , #20 hit " our lips sealed " , " how much more " , " lust love " , " this town " . 1982 " vacation " , there #8 hit title track " vacation " , " get up go " , " cool jerk " , " beatnik beach " . 1984 " talk show " represented #11 hit " head over heels " , #32 hit " turn you " , " you thought " , " i'm only one " , " mercenary " . " head over heels " undeniably sophisticated pop punk , defiance those tempted write off go-go bubblegum band . " talk show " album generally lyrical musical sophistication beyond go-go 2 previous albums . it pretty darn good music . among non-hits this collection : " lust love " solid rockin ' love song manages create sense anticipation . " how much more " sounds like tribute 1950s sock hop pop " beatnik beach " 1960s surfing tunes . " you thought " expresses bitter end relationship more techno sound than other tracks . " greatest " isn't go-go whole story , band reunited record " return valley go-go " 1994 " god bless go-go " 2001 . but when it released 1990 , " greatest " pretty comprehensive hits package , it still nice summary band first wave , so speak . order songs cd flows all right , but it not chronological . unfortunately , no lyrics included .	1
" animal i become " playing over over local hard rock station . every time i heard it , i knew i it so i wrote down many lyrics i could looked them up internet found three days grace . i am glad i ! awesome album beginning end ! one best most solid cds i've gotten last ten years ! it living my cd player months now i still can't get enough . i definitely recommend it ! cd booklet opens up reveal dark artwork social angst , nice ( but small ) full color photo band , lyrics . here tracks : " it all over " : excellent , exploding opener beefy sound . apparently watching friend destroy him/herself ( " it gets under my skin see you giving " ) . it not best track here , but appropriate , energetic song open album . " pain " : slow verses explosive chorus . little repetitive somewhat contrived lyrics " pain ! i like it rough `cause i'd rather feel pain than nothing all " ) . i like verses bridge . " animal i become " : love it ! reason i bought this cd . clear deliberate vocals heavy guitar . flat out kicks ! still my favorite . " never too late " : beautiful acoustic guitar blending vocals . wonderful power ballad verses explodes chorus . inspirational lyrics serious but not sappy : " even if i say / it all right / still i hear you say / you want end your life / now again we try / just stay alive / maybe we'll turn it around / cause it not too late / it never too late . "" my own " : track starts slow then rocks ! part before chorus brings up intensity my favorite . great vocals there . chorus bit stilted . i also like bridge this track . " riot " : this style music may not best create effective riot song , but they try . it probably heaviest track album . still chorus " let start riot ! " doesn't sound too convincing , but we probably wouldn't want it . lyrics verses better : " if you feel so empty / so used up , so let down / if you feel so angry / so ripped off , so stepped / you're not only one / refusing back down / you're not only one / so get up " driving guitar riff brief solo almost sounds like old school metal . some almost ill nino-esque screaming incorporated this track , too . " get out alive " : dark opening . nice , slow track excellent bridge . lyrics chorus bug me little because it sounds like he singing " if you want get life , run your life , " ( uh , yeah ); but he actually singing " if you want get out alive , run your life " but it doesn't sound like it . " let it die " : very accessible , mainstream-sounding track . nice , laid-back sound verses . i like blunt lyrics fire extinguishing relationship : " i swear i never meant let it die / i just don't care you anymore . "" over over " : very memorable song . it slower accessible like " let it die . " it also some orchestration background . " time dying " : i like this track lot . it very catchy , sing-along chorus . " gone forever " : this song ok , it not one my favorites here . lyrics more memorable than music . chorus not good ones other tracks this album . " one " : this final track sums up underlying theme this cd : disappointment where life gotten one . but this song gives positive message things might get better : " we ones / we get knocked down / we get back up / stand above crowd / we one . " end it : " we stand above crowd " background , little sappy , though .	1
rem one greatest alternative rock bands around . get this album ! highlights-1)try not breathe-an amazing song , it despair . quite harrowing . 2)everybody hurts-one could see this counterpoint former . this song says you're not alone if you're suffering , because " everybody hurts . " 3)sweetness follows-a melancholy song lossrecovery it . 4)monty got raw deal-michael stipe ode montgomery clift . it amazing opening section , celtic flavor . you'd think it michael flatley , not michael stipe . 5)nightswimming-chris martin coldplay thinks this greatest rock song ever written . fact , he right this one . ( though his song " i fix you " just comes across --- wrong)this melancholy reflection past ; it could interpreted song forbidden love , furtive meetings , fearanticipation . pianostring quartet make this intimate , almost classical , piece . 6)find river-an astounding song life journey . it wraps up melancholy tone this album hopefulness future . yes , this isn't feel-good pop ; this isn't haylie duff or justin timberlake , but it true modern classic !	-1
this great collection ep tracks . i'm not sure why most reviewers found these songs hard find - only non us release " this just modern rock song " ep , which still easily available $10 time release . ( 3 ) ep , this marks 3rd time they released , but least silly 3 ep box set seems replaced . music ??? music great , classic tracks here , including one best songs they ever , " beautiful " . later ep build sound " fold your hands .. " which good thing ! there few skippable tracks here ( why any other male besides stuart murdoch sing this band - least female vocals great ) but they few far betwee	-1

i don't know what deal . most people seem disappointed mos not rap very much album . while mos def one best mcs game , definetly my favorite mc all time , i literally blown away his singing this album . songs like panties feature very little lyrically ( there 7 or 8 lines lyrics this song total ) , music extremely solid , it seems like mos giving you little room enjoy track . when he decide spit , they're most solid rhymes come out any album last year . i lot say this album but i don't want waste lot space . this album turned me mos fan into mos fanatic , i only hope it same you	1
before buying this album i heard only few songs vbs ' website . they all dirty echo i love so much , same one you hear white stripes , strokes , et cetera . i buy album make it through first seven or so songs ... then girls start singing . but they can't really sing too well . it , erm ... well , first part album good , so maybe this -- well , no , it not going away . fact , girls keep singing . oh no , my eye twitching i can't get it stop . i guess what i'm trying say here half album good other half crap . i cannot stand girls ' voices . they're painfully monotone leave this horrible dry pink taste your mouth . but jason voice so full passion some cases you hold your heart together . it get bit old though ... so if you buy this one , buy it used . pay only good half album	-1

hype surrounding this release so much when it came out i couldnt help but little skeptical , but hype totally justified . he labelled everything " hiphop saviour " " new rakim " . his rhyme-style unmatched time . intelligent , witty , sharp , intricate flows combined smooth yet captivating delivery . only thing kind takes anything away this masterpiece elevator music tracks " climb " " umi says " . remainder simply put , perfect hiphop . joints like " hiphop " , " know " , " it now " " mathematics " make your neck nod so much you damn near get whiplash . joints like " ms. fat booty " make you laugh+get down same time , while joints like " new world water " , " speed law " " got " display his wonderful wordplay . all others just tight great examples although good , solid hiphop rare commodity it still exist !! if you dont this get your ass gear+go cop it quick	-1

i want give it 4 1/2 stars . not most moving album ever made but it depends what you want accomplish your listening experience . this very solid album . there some weak songs but there more good than not so good . no bad songs here . i think girls tell much better which seem discouraging because it implies they lost something or regressing . i dont think thats case , i think they just grew direction i dont prefer their last album . maybe band doesnt like it much either , who knows . but this album worth owning so if you get free shipping buy it .	-1

i fan rent years . i've seen play live five times , sing all songs without cd repeat all dialogue verbatim . said , i highly disappointed movie interpretation this play incredible music . part rent beauty its musical simplicity . anyone who seen play , you know all music comes small four man band onstage . movie over-orchestrated heck out everything , making it lose clarity stage version holds . it made into studio prodect . voices overwhelmed orchestra , simply travesty . while tracie thoms rosario dawson both decent singers , their voices not power their roles require . " out tonight " , one my favorite numbers play , mangled dawson , whose vocal register simply cannot handle demands role mimi places upon it . thoms cannot carry joanne , some parts fredi walker rocked out obcr squeaked out thoms . ( particular , " tango maureen " : take me or leave me " . ) role joanne requires certain vocal presence richness voice , thoms cannot deliver . original cast members , adam pascal performance particular extremely disappointing . rock sensibility wowed me obcr gone , replaced whiny psuedo-emo rocker style movie . movie also left out much great music stage version , including various christmas bells , happy new year , contact , it considerably weaker it . if you're considering buying this soundtrack , yourself favor get original cast recording instead . it money much better spent	-1
judging what written this group you might expect something close rapture when you pop this cd . it good stuff , sure , some it great . but fans old sun records stuff won't find anything revelatory here . guitar work pretty cool distinctive , burnette scream best them . problem , scream almost seems set timer . it becomes formulaic after awhile just doesn't same spontaneity gene vincent or early elvis . nitpicking aside , fans early rock ' ' roll roots music shouldn't disappointed this album . it like slab prime rib : great stuff , but still bit letdown when you've ordered filet mignon	-1
back 1996 , i heavily into primarily dance music ( house amp ; trance ) smidgeon punk ( not good charlotte sort garbage ) alternative music . roommate mine time worked local radio station brought home free cds everyone . one free goodies i got single quot ; curlylocksquot ; baby fox . i loved what i heard . it nothing i ever heard time its slick icy melodies , slow electronic beats , sensual female vocals . time , i not know this trip hop music . i eventually got group full length cd ( quot ; normal familyquot ;) quot ; curlylocksquot ; it . i recently excavated quot ; normal familyquot ; one my many piles cds slipped cd into my stereo . baby fox reminds me portishead , motorcycle , hooverphonic , olive , telepopmusik their slick , laid back beats ethereal female vocals . i almost forgot why i loved this cd so much several years ago . it truly ahead its time before chill out music became rage electronica scene today . all songs quot ; normal familyquot ; top-notched . i could not find one song i didn't like . i especially love quot ; ladybirdquot ; , quot ; curlylocksquot ; , quot ; your dreamsquot ; , quot ; alienwayquot ; . it shame this band short-lived . considering just how big chill out music today , baby fox definitely could sustained career music today . quot ; normal familyquot ; one those forgotten gems got sidetracked current music scene time . i'm glad i re-discovered baby fox	1

while i'm not sure i would really want it , i asked continuum press write one their 33 1/3 mini books favorite album , i just might choose wire third album 154 . partially , this choice would something compromise i doubt book nurse wound homotopie marie would make saleable product . 154 stands my mind epitome what post-punk should : bold fusion post-situationist / punk antagonism legitimately experimental methodologies undercurrent smarty-pop keep kids bouncing up down . i actually came wire somewhat late my record nerd existance , i actually grew admire band through reverse history sorts , i didn't really start enjoying first three wire albums ( pink flag , chairs missing , 154 ) until other graham lewis bruce gilbert projects entranced me thier experiments proto-electronica . this especially true ghostly post-structuralism found their dome records . those lewis / gilbert projects took their genetic code shadow gloom elements 154 . album made under personal duress , 154 drips disintegration . fact band split apart almost 7 years after making 154 , pursuing variety projects -- traces which quite present this album colin newman pop sarcasm continued through his solo records vast array lewis / gilbert projects . recorded 1979 , 154 marks band third radical reinvention three years . wire pacing slowed lugubrious , factory-esque crawl but lost none their punk antagonism . slower pacing better suited baritone vocals graham lewis , who penned many lyrics colin newman sang . lesser hands , patchwork forboding atmospheric dirges punchy power pop numbers would appear disjointed ; but wire deft use synthetic coloring , exquisite timing , simply great songwriting smear whole album into wholly convincing masterpiece . " i should known better " " touching display " represent few graham lewis ' baritone marches through plodding drone heavy basslines , which more common late ' 80s , proto-doom swans than snarl buzzcocks . newman pop brilliance also shines 154 through " 15th , " which sadly more people recognize tepid fischerspooner cover than this punk-pop gem . first three wire albums , 154 proudly stands most challenging most rewarding	1

first , word all those morally opposed punk rock music : i feel your pain . i used one you . but then i bought call doctor ( whim ) . changed everything . i now understand why so many people-even those who don't enjoy most punk music-love sleater-kinney . reason ? there simple one-word answer : power . call doctor doesn't just exude power , it explodes it out your stereo speakers . it album pure , unfiltered emotion . s-k gets off rip-roaring start title track , feral creation spews lyrics like " i'm your monster / i'm just like you " over raging guitars . sparse " hubcap " reams someone ( lover ? friend ? ) who plays god . best all , though , " little mouth , " " i'm not waiting , " " i wanna your joey ramone . " corinne tucker pushes her wailing voice its limit " little mouth , " screaming " i'm your little mouth " repeatedly until it lodges your brain forever . " i'm not waiting " serious-minded anti-cinderella jaunt still feels fresh 11 years later . expected , " joey ramone " homage but also s-k declaration independence : " i'm queen rock ' ' roll . " trust this reformed punk music hater : call doctor worth every penny you'd spending therapy . buy it , love it , scream it , feel released	1
this ep people who like acoustic music or people who really like fall out boy . dvd comes it nice bonus fans . impressive songs include " my heart worst kind weapon " " love tear us apart " .

i fan u2 since they released their mega-hit record " joshua tree " ... since first time i heard it , i fan them ever since ... never , ever stopped fan !!!!! so many people critisized them because many paths they've taken , risks , changes , experiments , but each every single one those steps made them who they right now : most honest , bold , charismatic , energetic emotionally commited band modern rock scene . they not name , brand , empty shell : they soul !!! i think this record cleary serves example what they able communicate millions around world trascending barriers language , culture , religion or economic status ... htdaab album takes time ... it not easily absorbed just playing it once ... which perhaps what makes it so endering deep ... it album speaks flow lyrics , echoed rhythms unmistakable touch bono , edge , adam larry use sign every track ... they not lost boldness fierce lyrics war or unforgettable fire , but rather , they've chanelled them using different elements both their sound their lyrics ... i heard so many " so called " fans who rip their robes saying how much band " evolved " but ... that exactly what music .. if it produced right reasons ... music , true music , only created born part musician very core , thus growing changing him , not manifactured easily consumed product like so many bands or pseudo pop stars diluded themselves into thinking ... i'm happy , glad , thrilled u2 evolved guts not repeat themselves ... all these " fans " keep pressing band come up achtung baby part 2 or joshua tree volume 2 but what they don't realize such not possible because time passed , 4 people who created those records matured magnificent , confident , daring , still polically active band we enjoy today , without mere caricature what they back then ... so i ask all those who only critized them what they not , you actually taken time listen , really listen this record ????!!!!! i really still find it hard understand why it would considered lacking or weak after hearing tracks like " sometimes you can't make it your own " , " man woman " or " yahweh " ... not only they capture inner experiences their members , but also serve way communicate just what band gone through continues experience entity who lasted longer than many marriages nowadays ... 28 years exact since their first sessions inside larry kitchen back their home town dublin ... not affected this record either , my opinion , close-minded possibilites what true rock band should or more importantly , creativity these 4 individuals ... this record not what fans think band , but what band thinks themselves world they live ... not political enough ? how " love peace " or " miracle drug " ??? if someone not capable touched these two anthems calling attention state chaos indifference we live nowadays , i really don't think they should even try call themselves fan this band because then they don't really understand what u2 . it very well balanced album , tracks highlight magical guitar ability edge like " city blinding lights " or " crums your table " expose perfect harmony adam base larry powerful drums ... if it weren't fact bono , even edge , mastered lyric composition such rich point , sound band produces would almost danger overpowering words ... but such not case , contrary , lines come perfect time , each one entwined other , like it happens second verse " man woman " : ... but you can't numb love , only pain feel nothing all , how i hurt when i'm holding you " .... or end " original species " : ... " you'll never alone ... come now , show your soul , you've keeping your love under control " ... or " one step closer " : ... " i'm island busy intersection , i can't go forward , i can't turn back ...

it hard find more lush , more comparable voice than art garfunkel . all true garfunkel fans own this cd love giving it spin . but when we get his version tim moore second avenue , we all take deep sigh . we simply cannot understand why someone decided edit original single version this heart-wrenching , achingly beautiful ballad . we're pleading you cbs . find original full-length master this classic release it us . i know it just one song , but perhaps you could just repackage quot ; garfunkelquot ; or include it bonus cut one his solo albums . garfunkel synonomous lush sound our old vinyl 45 this no longer this incredibly hypnotic masterpiece justice . i'm sure i'm speaking many art fans . our hopes continue ... we hope someone listening	-1

austin puts it , this album ' groovy baby ' , so much so it makes you want step into time portal head back 60's! all songs album retro kitsch , which ultimately sits well movie themes .

real -- only rachmaninoff play rachmaninoff . until someone cleans up composers own recordings , we manage pretenders . course , some these pretenders given us interesting even good renditions . my opinion , phillipe entremont best , although sadly early days recordings , thus not digital . lang lang version not too bad -- yes , it overly interpretive overly expressive , but other hand , it very entertaining . recording excellent sound -- turn volume way up you'll see how well engineered it -- no fuzzes or snaps . balance orchestra soloist perfect . i bought this cd because conductor gergiev , who never disappoints . trust russian play russians ! there sections piano concerto kind weird -- due lang lang interpretations , which go off track into something new agey . it true there excess emotionalism possibly hides lack real talent pianist . this not scholarly version . other hand , it very entertaining . if you tired all " serious " versions just want enjoy this concerto , try this cd .	-1

it wouldn't long before super furry animals fills songbook vol . 2 everyone elses participation more than just playing instruments , hitting us experimental album year . this one , everyone super furry animals write sing their own songs . so it probably led you skeptical album since you thought gruff rhys absolute brains sfa , right ? lets find out , through this , i tell you who wrote this . " zoom !

" atomik lust " hits us asong just living without feel wanting , deciding right away , " lets get our *** together ; insane crackbrainz . " i know no reasoning line crackbrainz taking place but super furry mission making music not just make fun , quirky music but it bit passion , seriousness , way make you want listen this band . " horn " basically their song fun enjoying . though some may raise their eyebrows fact " lalala-lalala " there . ( even more you raising eyebrows because gruff isn't wheel anymore aren't you ? ) when i listen this , i start picturing wonderful enjoyment villages . " walk you home " , their method this go usual write song if it tries play lie real love song . more or less , song perspective shy , warmhearted man fire his heart . song kind like traditional motown back up singers playing friends saying , " you could drinking me/so why don't you go up ask ? " then , they break mood just introducing you signature super furry animals single . difference ? opening not same one video till say , 1:15 minutes ? since music thematic man who just perplexed life where everyone cares who celebrity marries . they even broke mood , clery , line : " no more romantic comedies/this fanfare introduction high-powered purposeful theme . " " frequency " song sfa kind wonders what it like their end their life or end world . fact album just guy walking around wasting precious time figuring out what heck there his life . this song also best use wordplay describe life : " you say history your judge , but jury whipped , gagged drugged . " not much pick up think but major detail so far . " oi frango " super furry animals love kraft taking off landing space funk amazement may scare you bit mind . " back roll " song best described song anyone their mind road singing , touring , living road . basically , this all written road promote their albums , but no one really heart soul sing it such manner they . i am wondering what say piece like " cloudberries " . song separated into named verses or suites all song under 8 minutes . nonetheless , you feel if you listening radio same time think they pulling off jay-z maneuver called " all around world/same song " . therefore , ending same song post-rock outlook . anyone who paying attention hos super furry ends their album , this one closes beautiful slow " cabin fever " . like end , you think you listening end , but it really closes piano line . session involving piano . if there few words i use describe this album succes this band , message best comes straight " psyclone ! " : " count your chickens , we're taking over . " ( playing : oi frango)rating : 8/10	-1
beginning one little riddle , cd just gets better better . it probably their best work . i wish it bigger hit them , because there so many outstanding tracks . i love latin soul . it so cool funky . their vocals just good ever their blend amazing . they need keep releasing new work because i end up listening their stuff so many times over over , i get too used it , need new material . i hope one day soon , they actually work like back early 90 so they'll more hits again . terri ellis best singer , but they all such excellent job	1
there people live music like this . word it unique . if you listening this stuff , you obviously know thing or two underground rap . underground hip-hop often times repetitive sloppy too . although lyrics always forefront rap music , there lot desired when it comes down production . obviously , there going lot people won't , or can't get into this record due it complexity . aesop lyrical delivery too much some people it own , let alone production . that why " labor days " " float " worked so well . blockhead genius production , although minimal , complimented aesop complicated flow brilliantly , making it much easier focus lyrical content . " bazooka tooth " other hand , bit different . production often referred futuristic , since there so many electronic sounds , bits , quirks it . now , music moves just fast aesop . his lyrics very difficult pick out unforeseen production , which obviously frustrates some listeners . i one , recommend listening this album headphones . more you listen , pick apart music like this , easier it experience their artistic vision . you fan progressive music all kinds appreciate this music . you'd probably enjoy this record more than most , if you appreciate trip-hop , house or techno music . i also like this music lot because my love progressive rock music , such yes , king crimson , emerson , lake palmer , pink floyd . if you always looking music progression , then you should appreciate unique approach aesop rock taken improve this commercially decaying genre . this album definitely heavy collaborative efforts . album recorded mixed nasa , el-p executive producer/performer ( " we're famous " ) . we also catch glimpses mr. lif ( " 11:35 " ) , camp lo ( " limelighters " ) , p.f.a.c. ( " cook it up " ) , blockhead ( producer " cook it up " , " babies guns " , " 11:35 " ) , scratching dj cip one , dj pawl , additional spots featuring cannibal ox , s.a. smash murs . standouts include " easy , " " no jumper cables , " " limelighters , " " we're famous , " " greatest pac-man victory history , " " babies guns , " " 11:35 " . keep open mind , find traits album you like expand them . keep listening , remember , good pair headphones your saving grace understanding this album little better . i absolutely love this album after 4 listens . album gets even better each listen , when given chance , it reward you beyond belief	-1
i own daydream nation , goo , rather ripped . three , i probably skip most tracks this one ( " sleepin ' around " " rats " usually , " what waste " " rapture " occasionally ) . there some really really good tracks classic sonic youth too though .

this album so good i finally decided write review . i add some thoughts especially since some other reviews aren't positive . return cookie mountain sounds fresher than anything i heard long time . " wolf like me " amazing what drew me them first place . but it other songs hold onto you much longer . " i lover " great intro sets tone perfectly . " method " which no one here really discussed much , beautiful song layers harmony lead into wonderfully sinister drums . it kind juxtapostioning keeps you your toes through out . last part album drags bit , but it only because first part so extraordinary . if you really like eclectic beautifully crafted music you go wrong this . gets better every listen	1

mxpx great punk rock band , there no denying . this cd nice it rock much it running time . there few weak songs , but good songs made up it . compared most punk rock bands you hear mtv [ simple plan , example ] , mxpx probably up there best today punk rock genre . 1 thing i not understand life me fact mxpx considered christian band . looking their lyrics , you don't see anything even remotely related god ! their lyrics don't reflect anything christianity or any kind spirituality . their lyrics ain't no different green day lyrics or dropkick murphys ' lyrics . but , least it nice clean rock music that very enjoyable . i don't know , maybe mxpx older stuff more christian . this only mxpx album i ever bought heard . but , i won't hesistate say i like mxpx music lot . best songs album '' waiting world end '' [ best song here far ] , '' darkest places '' , '' young depressed '' , '' wrecking hotel rooms '' , '' late again '' , '' story '' . if you're looking good new punk rock release check out , i'd reccomend buying this cd , christian or non-christian .	-1

you may introduced kt through movie queen damned , award winning deus ex invisible war game , or just wandered into this review , but rest assured your ears tapping your brain pan asking some more dreamy , industrial grit only kt give . starting off , it wouldn't fair so over-zealous say this cd ' totally cool awesome ' like so many other emotional non-technical reviews here . zerospace cd deserves 4 stars mainly because sound truly unique . it sort like industrial splash techno all wrapped post nuclear , dark metal sphere . there only 5 out 13 songs any good . they : black bullet , before i'm dead , dyskrasia , glitter girl zerospace . while these still good credits band , there few technical issues some songs . first , examining good songs , i would much better if lead vocal , dominguez , not interrupted pace tempo two songs : black bullet zerospace . what she , few times both songs , she slows song down almost stop , whole " whisper effect " sequence like so many try now . this add some shock-drama song , but dominguez doesn't it very well , tempo speed songs themselves don't need it . tempo pace glitter girl good model domiguez should pay attention future , tempo speed fit character song . songs : amnzero taking train barley songs all . they represent shots techno-dream abstraction really poor songs technically ; they should axed cd . example , taking train nothing but long silence same repeated whisper lyrics ... really boring irritating . rest songs cd just ok , seem different mindset 5 other good ones . overall , cd worth buy well-earned band support ; you get 5 great songs rather than only one decent song , like so many new cds today ( damn , greedy record companies sign anybody make buck ) . if you like dark , dreamy , distorted metal , you really enjoy kidney thieves . it surely give your soul something dark , metallic , gritty chew	-1

upon first forty seconds first song , you just might tapping your foot- beat song- because pinback carries beat- song . i think i said all correctly . what i mean all this pinback not just pile different sounds meshed together make noise you see your neighborhood punks blasting late night no logical reason- oh no , pinback features melody . " concrete seconds " officially declares so . just listen guitar each song followed drums or drum machine , you might just see what i mean . well , if you haven't heard it- take my word it . so we've established this cd melody . concurrent beautiful melody , if i may say so myself . i mean , when you listen , there no loud abrupt sound make you cringe , or any ridiculous solos middle songs seem completely pointless . when you listen this cd , it seem like ...... like everything it place- right where it belongs . it carries beat too , remember , so ... you pretty good music your hands . you some differentiation well . example , " boo " very laid back easy song just listen long hours night , incorperates somewhat " drowning " feeling well . then , music switches " bbtone " , where you more preppy ( but not dancy-preppy , more like bob-your-head-and-smile preppy ) beat , becomes catchy memorable soon verse kicks . i suppose i should mention this time there amazing harminization two singers any given time , when they sing their part well . rob crow zach smith vocals soothing fluent , which perhaps makes pinback so worthy grand title . take " penelope " example- you crow singing softly , or just going " oooooooooh , realease air " while smith sings almost delicately . again , preservation melody . i also wish state this- when you listen cd , you most likely find favorite song . many prefer aforementioned " penelope " , or uncanny but delectable " prog " , or even mysterious " seville " ( sheena bella , sheena bella , name get stuck your head [ only if you decrypt lyrics ]) . i personally prefer " bbtone " myself , very gentle song " tres " , which some may consider marvelous piece it own , where piano plays major role . either way , if you give each these songs time , you most likely enjoy them all . each song seems it own ... flavor , what makes it so amazing simply ... well , simply what it . this whole cd wonderous , inspiring , vibrant , you should not miss it . pinback unique melody harmonizing vocals purely grogeous , if you allow it , they find some place your memories . or they'll just give you tingly feeling when you listen it year later ... great cd essentially	1
if there any list best lyrics song " high hopes " would probably undisputed winner . more i listen this song more i get it . every line every word seem carefully chosen . sometimes i feel how one get so perfect . may they just happen put it coincedence im just really deriving those thoughts my own scrutiny . ah ! music its just breath-taking . it definetly not inclined towards old psychedelic content which i really like but itself whole new phenomena . there seems absolutely no flaw this album all . each track leads not only musically but also meaningfully . album art too , how they pull it off ? individual tracks this album " cluster one " , " poles apart " , " high hopes " really nice listened singles . but whole album sounds great best heard one streach . album everyone no matter who you ... how old you ... or what kind music you prefer	1

judas priest rocks , ok ? rob halford rock god , he one most powerful voices heavy metal . glenn tipton k.k. downing amazing guitar players who trade leads extremely fast extremely well . ian hill great bass player . les binks isn't their best drummer , but he good . this first priest " live " album it early one . so , therefore , most songs " hellbent leather " or " stained class " or anything before . but , despite it early stuff ; this one best live albums i've ever heard . yeah , it overdubbed overproduced , but it still technically live album they're killer ! only thing you wish better set-list , but here tracks : 1 . exciter2 . running wild3 . sinner4 . ripper5 . green manalishi ( two-pronged crown)6 . diamonds rust7 . victim changes8 . genocide9 . tyrantbonus tracks : 10 . rock forever11 . delivering goods12 . hell bent leather13 . starbreakerthe live version " exciter " ten times better than studio version . i've never heard studio version " running wild " but it great .

" hell bent leather " much better studio " starbreaker " awesome . this truly masterpiece far live albums go i'm sick reading reviews people who diss rob halford voice . halford so many things his voice such talented vocalist . they're people better than halford , but still ... give man some credit . grade : a+	1
super score . two standards genre : hey there hernando hideaway , but also number outstanding production numbers duets : quot ; seven half centsquot ; , quot ; steam heatquot ; , quot;i'll never jealous againquot ; , quot ; there once manquot ; . most singing excellent but sometimes i admit janis paige isn't pitch i prefer ( dare i say it ) doris day movie . john raitt professional he always . this 50 musical through through , filled serious love songs , comedy satirical bite , endless energy . extra tracks this cd nothing too wonderful , excerpts pretty banal interview composer jerry ross , but they include song you won't hear ( good reason -- despite inteviewer mike wallace glowing support it pretty bad song ) show . want know why this show so good : george abbott , john raitt , bob fosse , harold prince , adler ross , eddie foy , jerome robbins , carol haney , peter gennaro . yes , there shows power-packed line-up like , bad , but not many . enjoy memories this bring back	-1

notorious b.i.g. nor 2pac greatest all time ; not even close . who better than b.i.g. ' pac ? gza , nas , az , ghostface , big , big pun , immortal technique , redman , method man , keith murray , canibus - list goes . b.i.g. ' pac so overrated , it not even funny ; if they alive today , b.i.g. would just criticized jay-z , 2pac would just washed-up snoop dogg . yet you people can't see through this , choose worship them because they martyrs game . since stating , i feel need say doesn't mean i dislike either b.i.g. or ' pac , nor discredit them emcees . i just don't see them gods some people , who know very little hip-hop beyond 50 cents kanye wests world , proclaim they . overall emcee , b.i.g. also better two ; lyrically , 2pac simple rhyme-scheme fails miserabley comparison . i . . ' complexity , great word play . 2pac passionate delivery made up this , but b.i.g. even admittedly better , more traditional flow . b.i.g. also much more vivid imagination , intricate way stories . his production also much finer , balanced than 2pac almost strictly g-funk trunk rattlers . i know i'm going get numerous " not helpful " votes pronouncing neither b.i.g. or ' pac earned legacy they given their post-mortem life , but i'm giving you nothing more than truth this review , can't help but point out facts , especially all 2pac ****-riders inhabiting this product , carrying out beef they not around even experience , mostly due their 13-15 year old age range . said , this great release , one my favorite albums come out mafioso genre ; unfortunately , there far too much filler call this classic so many others make it out . it may not raw ready die , but works its favor more than it takes away it ; this much more mature , vibrant production musically lyrically than its predecessor . maybe rich cinematic scheme little too much people who think " ambitionz az ridah " greatest hip-hop track all-time , all albums should carry thug life tradition , but true hip-hop heads , theme carried out this album real treat . " kick door , " " hypnotize , " " last day , " " what beef , " " notorious thugs , " " going back cali , " " my downfall , " " long kiss goodnight , " " you're nobody(till somebody kills you ) " undoubtedly certified hip-hop classics . rest album , sadly , filled good tracks , filler , that why this album not five stars my opinion . if you cut off fat this prime piece sirloin , you undeniable classic ; if you leave it , you've got dozen classic tracks surrounded dozen ' meh ' tracks . end , this grand album , but double disc idea too ambitious b.i.g. this stage his career . it definitely much better product than his rival all eyez me(which fewer classic tracks , much more filler - well lacking any one theme throughout , simply thrown together ) , but it still isn't top ten , let alone top five album illustrious genre hip-hop . it recommended , just know what you're getting before hand	-1

" . i saw this guy concert 30 years ago i saw him again last year he still singing same tired old songs but he put some weight . i guess when you haven't got anything original new offer muisc buying public then you just keep churning out albums same songs it . i give this album 5 stars because thankfully mr. mclean now faded into music obscurity	1
this one most powerful amp ; albums i own ironic part i discovered it chance 1992 . i not know anything kw but i kept hearing his name radio so i decided seek out this debut album . this man it all ; tremendous voice complemented sensual lyrics . this album transcends time because it still strong after so many years . if you romantic soul or sentimental person this kind amp ; that must . they don't come like this anymore . this amp ; back day when it its peak popularity . this cd ultimate romantic music . song # 2 , #4 , #7 , #9 amp ; #10 really bring it home . strong recommendation given	1

i'd never heard anything adiemus all until few weeks ago . that weird because i only listen classic radio stations . first time i heard it plane way my first real holiday 11 years . what appropriate way start it opening my eyes something incredible this . adiemus songs sanctuary terrifically energtic uplifting . main instrument peculiar , stripped down orchestra human voice incredibly wide range emotion mere sound it provoke . lyrics songs sanctuary don't mean anything , they only phonemes , but not style scat-singing , more way delivering free-roaming range emotions rather than specific point . this helped abundant freedom movement sequences keys unusual time signatures . songs sanctuary come across liberated adventurous no doubt inspire you just go out keep going going until you far away where you started . if you even stop all . yes , songs exciting always keep your attention no matter how many times you listen them . composer karl jenkins calls songs sanctuary multi-ethnical he couldn't more right . they'll take you anywhere world you want . beyond . i urge you go out this cd	1

i album couple weeks tried listen it much i could but it wasn't until just this last complete run though i really saw this masterpiece , not just work art . it though , no questions . anyone reading this already knows this very highly acclaimed i am here tell you listen everyone . this record absolutely enthralling ( glow pt . 2 ) , absolutely fun ( i felt my size ) , absolutely adventurous ( moon ) , absolutely haunting ( headless horseman ) , absolutely captivately ( something #1 ) , absolutely psycho-pop ( i felt your shape ) , absolutely ... well ... what i think we all look music . lyrics great , music spectacular , production/mix amazing . this emotional but lighthearted rollercoaster ride works individual song level but even better whole ( 66 minutes ) . i am suprized say i even like it better when turned down low since headphones optimal it . obviously , this record multidimentional	1
janet jackson success continued grow tremendously each year followed her 1986 album " control " , but mid-1997 , many her fans started notice remarkable shift janet style , image , musical direction . first single 1997 " velvet rope " rather somber hip-hop ballad called " got `til it gone " which featured rapper q-tip sample joni mitchell " big yellow taxi " . song lyrics describe failed romance imbue deep sense regret despondence . song appeared much more lethargic than janet previous hits , album extended mood even further . this album often overlooked , unfortunately , many people misinterpret what it . " velvet rope " used metaphor describe person need feel unique , protected , accepted . theme intended difficult decipher , because life often harsh amidst it difficult someone identify what makes them feel special . " velvet rope " undoubtedly janet strongest album ; running wide gamut topics overcoming grief losing loved one ( " got `til it gone " , " together again " ) , isolation despair feeling unfulfilled ( " i get lonely " , " empty " ) , domestic abuse ( " what " ) , social prejudices ( " free xone " , title track ) , self-deprecation ( " you " ) . what most critics quick note explicitly sexual lyrics many songs ( " rope burn " , " my need " , " anything " , " tonight night " ) , however , most them fail recognize songs ' connotations . lyrics not intended arouse , they used means submission distraction . songs engaging sexual activity way both punishing oneself gratifying oneself spite their lack self-worth . they represent janet attempts explore facets her sexuality she always curious but denied herself . this album flawless , aside some embarrassing unnecessary interludes . it intense masterpiece , one requires great deal patience open mind listen , but it far janet most rewarding astounding album	1
first off , this fabric cd anyone educated knows fabric night club releases string mix cd well-known artists . if you don't already know these mixed compilation cd than that your problem . getting out way , this nice job showing global communication fans exactly what tom middleton mark pritchard up these days showcasing their ever eclectic tastes . mix cd split up into two parts , first half pritchard choices second middleton . pritchard , who also records harmonic 33 troubleman , starts it off hip-hop , latin rhythms downtempo grooves leads seamlessly into middleton groovy house meanderings . personally , i appreciate what pritchard doing late more than middleton cosmos project recent obsession cheese-house but one still appreciates impeccable pastings sound these two come up ; they both ability make you appreciate sounds you don't normally give time day . end it , you still come out deep respect global communication their influence electronic music whole . if you want classic original material these guys , start digging make sure you purchase " 76:14 " , " pentamorous metamorphosis " " new school science " , just starters . just keep mind this cd not original g.c. material . however , there one new track end amba , which middleton own project one he discussing five years now . apparently , there forthcoming album amba so keep your eyes peeled	-1
any gibber can't help but think boys ' concert antics this 1989 release . this album came interesting time . andy gibb died year before , hurricane andrew devastated florida , brothers gibb relegated doing concerts disney channel . music helped boys cope difficult circumstances , one modest critical success . usual , us slightly different perception anything gibb , but first single ordinary lives hit rest world . there very cool refrain here distinct beat . sometimes song listed title cruel world parenthesis , its neat hear barry utter words song . one monster hit all hooks one could ask . boys their little one ! salutes concert , my nieces just obsessed watching it over over . one so tropical catchy great lyrics cool rifts . onto what may one steamier gibb songs , bodyguard very naughty when it released soft core music video . robin delivery form , words ones every woman wants hear . growl ! you deserve more , let me take care protect you . hot damn . its my neighborhood first departure song one . it got eighties hard edge it doesn't always suit boys . i like chorus lyrics proper element bad boy anger . not same kind growl ! bodyguard , but growl ! nonetheless . tears so real . i am not major teary eyed type person , but tears just perfect song when you need good cry . three grown men admit fact `there tears tonight ' . it okay cry , who knew ? barry delivery lyrics not ashamed it just set this kleenex keeper off . it unusual eighties see bee gees song written only pair brothers , opposed solo material where any combination brothers their teams expected . tokyo nights , however , robin maurice make very catchy tongue cheek song . it bit tribute stalwart japanese gibb fans , yet i suspect something more sinister its ambiguous lyrics . guests my car just don't understand when i sing this one . flesh blood might better robin song this album . bodyguard partly shared barry , rest album baz dominated . flesh blood this hard style album seems going , this suits robin . it similar walls eyes , perhaps album would stylized blood it full blown gibb production . nuances here delivery top notch . i recently discovered cute little opening effect wish you here i hadn't noticed until my headphones-only listen . it like carousel turns into lofty echo . barry , robin , maurice wrote this song tribute andy , it tearjerker totally real lyrics . it bittersweet . there very happy , fond , `wish you well ' type sayings mixed `don't go we'll miss you ' somberness . perfect reflection loss song . yay we come maurice moment album ! house shame usual per maurice , slightly different style than anything else one . even edgy modern stuff isn't quite like mo hooky lines here . his delivery varies verses , then he drops killer chorus you i often find stuck my head even if i haven't heard shame ages . good stuff . sometimes this trying prince stuff just much , you ever let me almost bland imitation . it its moments , it me or all choruses strong here ? song i would probably write off if it anyone else , brothers delivery hooks still bring me back . wing prayer doesn't sound like anything old fashioned , yet it reminds me old time song `coming wing prayer . ' ( i am then also remind `don't sit under apple tree anyone else but me!' but that story . ) gibb tune here bit uneven . i really like slower parts barry breathy speaking lines , but then song turn rough stuff it doesn't all seem fit . still one starts ends upbeat note , any new fans surprised find depth seriousness . special note #4356 . shape things come one these gibb oddities fans forced hunt . released arista their olympic album , song received little notice . no gibb collection , however , complete without it , or one matter . album unique look three successful men brothers , coping , crying , moving making music boot .	-1

i like some songs this album . i've fallen love ' here i dreamt i architect ' . i really admire colin meloy voice , it might just my favorite--it unusual whiny , he slurs dips vocals quite well . i'll tell you , though , one thing i don't like this album lyrics . some lines expressive wonderful , others just sappy fluffy naive . i really hate how ' leslie anne levine ' starts out , something like " hi my name leslie anne levine " . songs tell stories , actual stories , other people . i prefer words describe subject , opposed " once upon time " thing . i suggest if you pick choose songs this album ( ipod or whatever ) , instead buying whole cd . half cd beautiful , other half so-so .	-1
wow , people cite passages soundtrack heard before films 20 years ago , evidence horner ' recycling ' . i cant . i just know he handful others write most hackneyed scores around , making all films converge towards mean , become homogenized . how something original here , like music adding film providing counterpoint , displaying complexity emotion ? there many examples this , but usually not composition but incorporating world music or songs known already pop music . fact , hollywood composers cabal , ingenuity not valued . movie so so , i given this soundtrack radio station promo .... culprit danny elfman , uniformly quirky , but thats story ..	-1

how very sad joey scarbury , date , never followed up this hidden early 1980 gem album us enjoy . this my first album kid - like other reviewers , i begged my parent it out love songs i heard each week greatest american hero tv series . though only two songs album actually used show ( " some my old friends " course " believe it or not " ) it great collection tunes ... i waited actual soundtrack series come out , or very least follow up album ... waited ... waited ... but alas ... it though my . scarbury dropped into mystery . sacrbury voice " real " " natural " " distinct " ... songwriting album also top notch ...

there no justice this world when songs good these lie buried beneath mountain mediocre music we listen over over over again same 300 tunes " oldies " radio ! i recently took chance this cd only introductory knowledge poppy family ( one megahit three tiny followup hits ) . boy , i hit jackpot ! there two great things poppy family : first , voice ! susan jacks , i apologize behalf all music lovers we not speak your name same sentence linda ronstadt , carole king , carly simon , karen carpenter , etc . when discussing talented women song . second , those arrangements ! almost all nuggets clocking under three minutes , terry jacks brilliantly succeeds crafting some most unusual , haunting , beautiful melodies i heard years . yes , you think insightful lyrics but you also contemplate music itself rare thing popland ( left banke comes mind ) . i love all tracks this collection . if i going stranded sea could only bring three tracks me , they would : " you took my moonlight away " , " i wondering " , " i'll see you there " ( apparently terry favorite song according liner notes ) . those savory pop nuggets just click away	1
dvd off hook , lot music videos you real hip-hop or eazy heads . you not dissappointed dvd . interview tight , behind scenes ruthless records tight . honest , i only got this dvd hoping bone it , they . they one my favorite rap groups but without man eazy-e , there would not any bone thugs-n-harmony . cd maad right , although i question their originality . sometimes they sound real tight , really nice . other times i'm wondering if they just chopped songs up feature other artists thereby expanding more unused eazy material capatalize . but w/e , cd hot , very nice . it nice cross quot ; new old skool . quot ; tracks no doubt ol skool gangsta rap , but bit modern flava . if still around , this exactly what rap hip hop would sound like . eric wright r.i.p. 1142	1

i heard good things pulp so i downloaded this album . maybe i should downloaded this hardcore , which i haven't listened , since this didn't impress me . fact it bored me . its not i don't like dreary music , i like cure joy division . noting almost all , beside babies , worth buying . babies really great track i stick it mixes i make relatively often . but i found nothing else this cd made me want listen it . but i listen it , two more times fact . i still couldn't find even one more positive thing it next two times through . jarvis cocker cool singer lifts album lackluster songs half notch . but singing not real big deal me when i listen music , hardcore . good singer doesn't make band good , although it doesn't hurt any . songs try sound epic but they just come off sounding dull . like i said if you want ' good ' idea what pulp sound like this album just download babies scrap rest material because it would just waste good fifteen bucks	-1
steven martin great comedian just anyone . i am 14 years old enjoy his comedy very much . many comedians today throw too much profanity into their acts . while this funny , after while it gets old . steve martin may throw some profanity but he doesn't get old . steve martin very original man . only weak point this cd songs , martin would better doing two more comedy skits than doing songs . all all its 4 star performance	-1

two years separated " spirit " " this way " projects . time jewel took personal time reflect her fast rise one biggest singer songwriter her generation , fell love , grew person . even more importantly , jewel began writing new material . all these events this would take shape into what became " this way " . released latter half 2001 , " this way " showed slight commercial decline her two previous lp , but received rather well most critics fans . there those raised their eyebrows more " mature " jewel . one who wasn't afraid flirt different musical styles her own sensuality . " this way " finds much more wiser , yet still innocent jewel looking world more intense fashion . this intensity matched musical electicism found this lp . folk element which jewel so known still present . but , there country , rock , pop , occasional surprise elements abounding here . though i won't give it all away those who haven't heard this record . lead single " standing still " , inspired jewel relationship ty ( his last name still escapes me ) gem . jewel sings verses quiet , yet building passion . this passion erupts chorus , showcases jewel voice . " break me " , which far superior it orchestrated version here than more whitewashed single version , subtle lilting . specific enuciation words gives jewel voice charismatic purr even gritty context . this best showcased cuts such " love me ( leave me alone ) " " jesus loves you " . lyrically , jewel showed progress , but still keeps it mostly simple . though i shine spotlight " serve ego " which lyrically sparse , almost erotic reading social culture . this also her first dance hit . musically , stated , diversity handled subtle fashion . many textures very well mixed , some may not notice ( right away ) jewel hinting more adventerous musical territory . course , " 0304 " would born this flirty musical behavior . some may shun jewel use more " studio " technique . ironically , i think jewel manages meld " live energy " her first lp " studio experimentalism " her second lp quite well . two live cuts tacked onto end record , blending quite well pre-recorded studio tracks well . each track worth second spin , each one gets better spin . jewel selected strongest songs " this way " sessions , making record stands jewel catalogue her most cohesive strong . it also my personal favorite jewel whole catalogue . highly recommend anyone who loves music , everyone should hear this least once	1

jeff lynne got one most underrated pop geniuses seventies eighties . while world prog-rockers bombasting themselves side-long double album extravaganzas ( yes , i am talking yes ... ) , jeff lynne his mates electric light orchestra decided " i am walrus " " good vibrations " all inspiration they needed . end result body work sounds even better these aging ears than they 1975 . their orchestral rave-up chuck berry " roll over beethoven " " bama-lama-lama " chorus rockabilly " rock roll king , " lynne mastered styles effortlessly three decades . ( even if " zoom " not represented here . ) despite fact elo pretty much abandoned " orchestra " part their name " time , " ' pocket-symphony ' concept stayed them till last hit this cd , " calling america . " songs like " rock roll king " hint production chops lynne would eventually bring likes tom petty , travelling wilburys , george harrison dave edmunds . i chose this " essential elo " cd my collection over " all over world " primarily because this set includes " ya . " " all over world " few choice classic-rock cuts ( " ma ma belle " " diary horace wimp " name two ) , but if you're looking get sugar coated buzz 70 singles , this collection own . my rating held four stars because ommissions like " four little diamonds , " " 10538 overture " or " showdown . " ( this should double set , ala " strange magic . " ) now all albums back out pristine remasters , you pick choose classic elo fit your whims	-1

fred neil king east village coffee shop , pass-the-hat folksingers very early sixties this cd shows why . much his origins late life shrouded rumour mystery . sinatra , johnny cash , even jim morrison great baritone voices , but fred neil sound really something else . neil most spectacularly deep resonant baritone voice , voice would sound wonderful reading phone book ! everyone idolized him , everyone imitated him , everyone covered his songs : roy orbison , jefferson airplane , youngbloods , harry nilsson , tim buckley , tim hardin , judy henske , john sebastian , gram parsons , linda ronstadt , tom rush , roger mcguinn . unknown , awestruck , social climbing bob dylan used play backup harmonica fred neil his ringing 12 string village years before these albums . ( dylan mentions this bio pic " no direction home " ) fred one main influences david crosby , steven stills ( crosby , stills nash going call themselves " sons neil " before neil talked them out it ! ) . neil brill building song writer , like carol king , years before venturing out his own . album bursts early sixtes ( there two sixties ! ) folkie optimism energy . there much more energy precision here than " many side fred neil " which also worth . line neil song " toy balloon " ( not this cd)so impressed jefferson airplane paul kantner grace slick it found it way into " ballad you me pooneil " , fact " poohneil " combination winnie pooh gentle fred neil . see also " house pooneil corner " . bleeker macdougal neil solo includes his second most famous song " other side this life " which covered jefferson airplane nearly everyone else . ( his most famous " everybody takin me " , hit harry nilsson , story neil life . not included here ) . " blues ceiling " deep world weary quality it . " little bit rain " deeply melancholy . " sweet mama " upbeat ringing 12 string overtones . when he sings word " home " " bleeker macdougal " his voice sets up bass standing waves all over room ! famous line dating golddigging women " handful gimmie ( mouthful much obliged ) " found it way into tom rush " drop-down mama " same era . ( i don't know if it fred neil first or not ) . " yonder come blues " ( dressed high-heeled shoes) ! not bad cut this bluesy second album . fred hated music industry its commercialism . he dropped out didn't record last 30 years his life or so , living frugally proceeds " everybody talking me " , despite offers rock giants record duets again . now his incredible talent forgotten nearly all but " small band admirers ( many them stars their own right ) " . shy reclusive fred neil singer singer . just listen let voice wash over you . like deep rich chocolate . he represents skill purity folk , occational bluesy jazzy tone . this album ( or combo import " tear down walls " which includes this ) best example extant his talent . ( lost somewhere rumoured tape young bob dylan fred neil jamming ) . excellent sound this album .	1
this only album my collection i listen regular basis without ever getting bored . i ff one or two tracks generally , but this one heck album goes down great cocktail party . fact , i've never , until now , bothered write anything album . highly recommended	1
don killuminati : 7 day theory probably 2pac most intense cd . it begins " bomb first " which adrenaline packed gansta rap song actually made my hair stand end first few times i listened it . but , my hair stayed up listening " hail mary , " which eerie both beat pac lyrics . then comes " toss it up , " which disappointment probably only downside this entire album , only song i ever skip when i listen this cd ( life outlaw , because outlaws , they really way ruining perfectly good pac songs ) . rest album , however , maintains intensity raw energy 2pac , intelligent lyrics possibly best beats any 2pac album . tupac raw , energetic , powerful genius lyrically this album . if this where 2pac , or ' makaveli , ' headed , it really shame he taken away so soon .	1
key factor choosing this cd over other goodman collections emphasis jazz . goodman recorded lot if not bland , then certainly restrained commercial material his quest broad appeal . this lead false belief some he lacked ability play loose emotionalism characterize best jazz playing . this collection should help dispel idea , covering everything his early , more fervent clarinet playing his brilliance leader complex , modern arrangements . chronologically programmed , set still carefully varied sequenced play well when listening straight through . not dull cut bunch . remastering sound quality very good , although i've heard little better some columbia reissues .	1
... other album , course , " american beauty " . this album works so well because once these loveable long-haired , dope-smoking , acid-dropping , heroin-injecting , coke-snorting , whiskey-swilling , barbituate-injesting hippies decided forsake their nauseatingly self-indulgent free-form jam tendencies ( see " live dead " ) craft straightforward , unpretentious , no-nonsense album mellow acoustic rock . if you wanting introduce friend grateful dead first time , this record you throw turntable . " casey jones " " uncle john band " most popular cuts , but there not single bad track here	1
i took chance this cd ... it ok first time , better second magnetic after third . simply best artist talent no one knows . someday i like see him live , but i cannot take any my friends , because they never heard him . thats ok ... i like keep some things myself , i attend solo	1
alright , reading some these whiny one star reviews makes me want take hammer my skull while watching old " wings " re-runs . once again i read paragraph after paragraph sayng how korn changed why dont they go back their roots blah blah blah , yet these same people hated take look mirror which closest their self titled debut , or their roots even still these same people , there seem many them , say korn not anything good since follow leader . truth told follow leader korns worst effort date . yet sadly its all many " fans " hold nowadays . every korn album ingenious creative its own way exception i stated , follow leader , which more like rap album god awful fred douche , err i mean durst . now far this new effort , coming undone bonus track eaten up inside , which belonged main album , 2 standouts syotos . liar cool track . only songs i truly could not stomach listen more than once or twice politics tearjerker . this album must if your really into korn raw emotion thought they put into their trend setting music . there noticeable absence " head " which , while unfortunate he gone , doesnt detract syotos any way hopefully korn keeps pumping out album after album . god bless kor	1

although there mixed views this album , i am one those who like it very much . fact i would put it my top 5 albums 2006 ( either number 4 or 5 ) . yes , there some moments where slightly weird , wacky , german edguy humor just bit too much , but there some outstanding tracks this album well which make it worthy purchase edguy fans or fans melodic hard rock/metal . me edguy always sounded like cross iron maiden/bruce dickinson def leppard , their previous albums leaning more towards iron maiden/dickinson type metal sound def lappard type hooks melodies . " rocket ride " though , they moved away sound bit , this time leaning more towards def leppard type commercial sound . that not say though edguy " wimped out " , some tracks " rocket ride " really powerful sound . album kicks off bang " sacrifice " , 8 minute mix light shade , piano , power riffs , pumping beat , hooks melodies all edguy fans love . this one stand out track . title track also one albums best , fast paced rocker mellow moment reflection middle which builds up before guitar solo , then track bursts pace again . " wasted time " classic . intro high atmosphere , it builds up anticipation before big riffs come . then we get acoustic guitars soft vocal before track again rocks great chorus sing . again , killer guitar solo mellow moment middle before it kicks off again chorus . wow , this track good ! " matrix " good track , but not good first three . this one more commercial its sound , but it good chorus . " return tribe " song isn't too bad , but it isn't stand out . it typical fast paced edguy rocker . " asylum " clocks over 7 half minutes , my favorite track album . like some other tracks album , this one which builds up mix light shade . starting acoustic guitar vocals only , it sounds quite mellow if it going ballad . but then you tell way sammet builds up vocals something big coming , man ... it sure . high pitched wail , power riffs drums kick , followed more mellow , melodic verse . then power builds up again chorus . this track high intensity power . break/guitar solo starts off mellow builds up per formula song , finish powerfully . i think this one edguys best songs ever , i love it . " save me " ballad , very good one , perhaps edguys best ballad so far . " catch century " pretty good track , more hard rock type song than metal . it finishes bit wacky edguy humor but this doesn't detract what good song . " out vogue " nothing fantastic , but it not too bad . just average edguy rocker . " superheroes " track picked single , so you would expect it very commercial its sound . it guitar part which sounds like theme music comic book hero tv show or something , but it fits well song . there chorus which you just can't help singing , one better tracks album but not meant taken too seriously . " trinidad " cr #p . this prime example edguy humor too much . it obviously intended joke song , but it just over . little bit humor okay , but this isn't funny even if lyrics serious style song doesn't appeal me caribbean type sound it . this sort song should relegated bonus track end album , or bonus track single if they feel need it all . " #cking fire ( hair force one ) " . title like it obvious this example edguy humor . however this one better than previous because least this one some power song you find yourself singing chorus ! i got digi-pack version this album which also bonus live track " land miracle " . nothing special this track , it ok , but live ballad ? not good choice bonus track . conclusion , this album some excellent tracks which really stand outs , some others which pretty good too . however what lets it down finish . finish off these joke songs just silly idea itself , it this prevents me giving album 5 star rating . this shame because album deserve better finish after so good up until then . i also recommend getting " superheroes " ep if you like this album . it four non-album tracks plus piano only version " superheroes " which sounds really good . non-album tracks quite good , especially " judas opera " which michael kiske sharing vocals song many changes it . fact , i like these songs better than those end album itself !	-1
after watching ken burns jazz series last month , i went back period came up short programming - 70 - 80 . series ran theme jazz died 70 . teenager who discovered quot ; conference birdsquot ; during this time , i disagree critics . jazz not die , it evolved . this recording beautiful classic example evolution . evolution still going today , 2001 . listen this cd then follow it playing holland latest recording quot ; prime directive . quot ; dave still evolving spinning out classics . no other bassist/composer i heard last 25 years spins out more intriguing music than holland . his bass playing crystal clear very strong , while his compositions structually complete . he always works first-rate artists who continuously challenged , they respond kind taking compositions their highest level . quot ; conference birdsquot ; one most beautiful compositions i ever heard . 70 2001 - holland still evolving artist . keep up excellent work dave . long cats like you around , jazz good hands	1

it surprises many people learn there no definitive version handel " messiah " . everyone knows version they heard growing up , or version they sang when they younger . however , scholar trying put together historically informed performance this most important work faced many choices even more questions . you use score he wrote 1741 but never performed , or adaptations he made dublin premier . or maybe you want version used london premier 1743 . if you , you also reconcile reality handel later abandoned these additions changes . while work settled into more less standard form 1750s , handel still made changes based upon singers players available . these just beginnings alternatives scholar consider . this performance attempts recreate specific performance work handel 5 april repeated 15 may 1754 . wonderful notes included this recording fully explain what this choice means provides insight into each pieces well text german french well english . this recording 1980 notes say it first complete historically informed recording . this time great experimentation thought early music , especially baroque . we performance complete messiah here ann arbor december 1980 too great number these same issues . we also fortunate emma kirkby sing here ( she absolutely wonderful ) well other fine soloists . we recording part work well regarded its time . this recording also makes interesting choices composition chorus vocal style soloists . chorus choir christ church oxford uses mostly boy trebles altos young men tenors basses . they sing great clarity while they may not provide massive sound some might wish , i found straight voices quite wonderful very high registers where voices vibrato might smear or timbre might become bit shriek . this composition choir handel used this performance , so it authentic . however , it also not only kind choir he used performances this work . i enjoyed this sound very much . they also pull off quite powerful effects " hallelujah chorus " " worthy lamb " . soloists also use much different vocal production style than you might expect . remember , verdi still more than century future . big brilliant voices we expect today not rule may not invented yet . this smaller voice most pronounced tenor voice paul elliott . he certainly gets all notes very expressive , but his not brilliant voice we usually associate " ev'ry valley " . judith nelson emma kirkby share duties expanded soprano role this piece both very fine . i admit my personal bias towards kirkby . carolyn watkinson superb alto , david thomas just terrific bass " trumpet shall sound " turn . orchestra brilliant , tight , constant delight this piece . just hear them all their varied approaches texts these pieces worth hearing this disk . now , this likely not " messiah " you grew up nor what you expect when you hear this work . i urge you expand your palette . there no " right " way play work . yes , there lots wrong ways , but this not one those . one problems listeners getting too settled recording work they happen . this always mistake . no single approach enough any fine work let alone one cultural artistic magnitude " messiah " . other source mistaken fixation version you grew up or heard impressionable youth . again , i urge you re-open your approach musical taste sample this work see if you appreciate all fineness this recording offer . if you , you not only better off because your ability appreciate music expanded , but you take fresh ears back your favorite version hear it new delights doubly rewarded	1

i came this album very early my jazz listening career ( taking baby steps out ken burns cradle ) . i bought it right after " moanin '" because seemed like logical thing . let me tell you , this album huge shock after " moanin '" if you're not prepared it . while " moanin '" excursion groove , swing , in-the-pocket hard bop , " night tunisia " forward-looking powerhouse isn't accessible but just amazing . reason this change traced primarily passage two years presence wayne shorter who , , always ahead his time . though he contributed only one tune this session , " sincerely diana , " tune his others like it moved jazz messengers much closer cutting edge new harmonic language would become post-bop . his szxophone playing also much drier more angular than his predecessor , benny golson . initially , this turn-off me , it casual jazz listener . wayne shorter takes time appreciate but he truly one greatest geniuses jazz ever known . other reviewers said , title track long , intense affair highlights art blakey drive power drums . but it features great playing all group , lee morgan cadenza near end art cheering him one great moments jazz messengers history . other tunes , " so tired , " " yama , " " kozo waltz , " definitely hard-bop vein but they predict innovations come following years . since this album not immediately accessible " moanin '" some others , get " moanin '" first , then get " big beat , " also shorter present . then check out " like someone love , " same session this one . if you like all those albums , then get this one . level musicianship superb art blakey drumming superhuman its drive	1

i admit i not really listened mika before i saw him concert stockholm . he what he reasonably well this genre . good falsetto voice although it gets bit loud annoying during show . here what made me lose all respect this artist . during his show stockholm he only played 60 minutes , including encore . i am sorry , but no artist worth anything would walk away only playing 60 minutes . overall i would say ok voice , pretty weak songwriting , pathetic live show . i lost what little respect i gained mika during first few songs . weak , weak , weak .	-1

recent batch blue note rvg releases make many jazz fan salivate several extremely hard find , previously out-of-print cds made readily available once more . this particular title not one rarest , its first cd incarnation connoisseur series issued late 90s , but it delightful back nonetheless . ike quebec " heavy soul " lives up its title . but this album not heavy up-tempo soul jazz , instead it heavy soulful ballads . there some faster numbers , quebec penned " acquited " " que dilemma , " but it slower , sultry standards set this disc romantic tone . while i'm generally not jazz organ fan ( unless it larry young or jimmy smith ) , freddie roach playing refreshingly light , spacious enough allow bassist milt hinton room make his own contributions .

if there band defined what 70 rock all , it taste . they've often called ireland answer britain superstar band cream . i think they better than cream every way . rory gallagher guitar , john wilson , formerly them drums , ex spencer davis bassist charlie mccracken , they considered hottest live act europe time . big reason this gallagher improvisational abilities six string . there nothing fancy this band . they didn't wear matching suits or psychedelic clothes popular attire day . they just hard workin ' blue collar band gallagher wearing his trademark red flannel shirt stage his lunch pail called ' 61 fender stratocaster . gallagher different than superstar guitar players time like clapton , page , peter green , who got lot their influences muddy waters , howlin ' wolf school chicago blues . gallagher loved southern rural/ country blues son house big joe williams . it shows here feelgood acoustic song quot;i'm movin ' onquot ; equally wonderful quot ; hailquot ; where he sings note note his guitar . trademark sound taste though blues rock . gallagher most aggressive guitar player i've ever heard blues rock genre . good examples this opener quot ; blister moonquot ; quot ; born wrong side townquot ; . but he also get very creative , catchy quot ; railway gunquot ; . killer tune it numerous rhythm changes . he also shows his creative side jazzy quot ; it happened before , it'll happen againquot ; , which taste most experimental song . it really swings , it probably gallagher finest moment six string . only knock i here same one other reviewers pointed out . he shouldn't picked up alto sax he just learning play attempted solo . but hey , it 70 . they those things . sometimes they worked , sometimes not . but that only knock i this excellent best collection . if you want hear why rory gallagher considered many one alltime best guitar players , just check this album out . it should all lovers classic rock wish lists	1
i never heard gabriel dresden before ; my music tastes more mainstream pop/ electronica oriented - pet shop boys , depeche mode , new order . one club fm , best internet radio , recently started play dangerous power featuring jan burton . i immediately fell love . song itself wunderland ; it enigmatic piece dreamland journey both powerful feeling voice great burton but it mix cicada- song album version really sucks when compared mix- then why bother release album , or , more precisely , why we bother buy them ? i came here buy album , excited song , thinking i would hear more precious sounds . then i listened trial album version i hear jan burton sure it same song . album version simplydull , dull , dull !!!. i heard other tracks , too they also simplistic ; like rice not cooked enough ... unfinished symphony . they need good mixes some them certainly receive . so i gave up . wait remixes . ilo ( or their label ) same thing poetica- all those good singles their simplistic form . course i not even bother buy it though rapture one my favourite songs 200 0s.i generally tend support my favourite groups or ones i like : return joyous times i heartily agree pay few dollars more but this case i not . music industry getting more voracious ? i don't wanna pay fifteen bucks album full demo-like pieces then pay again remixes . that why i downloaded only cicada mix dangerous power- however , it both band music lover loss : band loses money , music lover misses all those songs could really great . my advice : download great remix version wait other remixes skip album	-1
i know many who only know metheny work within context pat metheney group would not understand what truly great musician pat metheny . but pat metheny authentic jazz setting , his trio work , or true jazz cohorts ( herbie hancock , chick corea , dave holland , jack dejohnette , etc . ) , my opinion , one most , if not most harmonically complex , dexterous , fluid jazz guitarist world . any his trio albums demonstrate this , all nothing short inspirational amazing if you love jazz guitar	1
following breakup eagles , don henley would embark what would slowly become very successful solo career . 1980s , henley would release three albums . his first effort 1982 " i can't stand still " . this effort would produce classic tune called " dirty laundry " which henley poked fun " pretty faces " doing tv news . two+ years later - 1984 , more successful follow-up " building perfect beast " would produce three more singles " all she wants dance " , " sunset grill " , " boys summer " . " boys summer " mega-hit henley boosted award winning music video . following " building perfect beast " , henley would take nearly 5 years make his next effort . 5 year effort made henley would not disappoint - his 1989 effort entitled " end innocence " would become his most successful solo effort date . each don henley solo albums would more successful both commercial sales criticial acclaim standpoint . " end innocence " marked peak don henley solo career broke him out mold eagles put him his own two fee t.t here three factors make " end innocence " great album . first , songwriting standpoint - henley company some his best work . second , production standpoint . danny kortchmar brought co-producer henley 7 10 songs . kortchmar collaborated henley his two previous albums songwriter . kortchmar continues collaborate henley several tunes , but now moves into role main co-producer . kortchmar previous work henley makes him natural fit he able get most out don henley talents . finally , his previous studio albums - henley brings all-star lineup musicians - past , present , future . this lineup musicians help augment henley talents even more make this such great release . lineup musicians includes : bruce hornsby , mike campbell ( tom petty heartbreakers ) , patty smyth ( scandal ) , axl rose ( guns roses ) , jeff porcaro david paich ( toto ) . lineup includes three woman who would become big stars 90s : melissa etheridge , edie brickell , sheryl crow . bruce hornsby co-writer , producer ( this one non-kortchmar produced song ) , pianist " end innocence " . hornsby trademark piano playing combined henley vocals make this classic . lyrics make lot use metaphors . although much different sound than 1984 " boys summer " , song still much retro-qualities " boys summer " . " how bad you want it " very underrated tune . it probably one best songs album co-written henley , kortchmar , stan lynch . there some great horn work terrific drum work . patty smyth plays key role background vocals fold perfectly when needed . although not strong song " how bad you want it " , third track " i not go quietly " makes good use background vocals well . henley kortchmar collaboration , this strong uses axl rose background vocals he goes perfectly hard rock edge this song . despite kortchmar solid influence , collection best track " last worthless evening " wasn't kortchmar collaboration songwriting or production standpoint . mike campbell john corey ( corey stan lynch wrote produced this henley ) provide some terrific guitar work . acoustic sound makes this song special . this song , don sings this song himself woman who broken up someone don feels he fill void woman life . best part song bridge middle song goes " time time ticking ... " . this song classic . " new york minute " written 1989 henley , kortchmar , jai winding . it truly great song features toto jeff porcaro drums toto david paich piano . this song terrific haunting quality . what nobody would realize how this song would almost become soundtrack state new york city following world trade center attack . lyrics such " harry got up .... went down station ; he never came back " " lying here darkness ; i hear sirens wail " examples this . paich also contributes piano " little tin god " .

if , like me you consider tempest-soft machine-tony williams-uk period " golden years " allan holdsworth , then there no earthly reason you not buy this cd . it logical progression material first heard " bundles " brilliant live showcase his then blossoming guitar technique . i'm not your typical " prog/fusion " fanatic feels any rock presented jazz/classical bent it stretched 10-20 minutes ( flower kings - boring ) nectar gods . i'm 56 this type music since beginning quite frankly , style structure don't hold much water me unless there abundance substance soul well ( dream theater or anekdoten ) . that what left me so cold when it comes most holdsworths post uk work - lots technique presented group highly talented sidemen devoid any soul or sense collaborative effort or destination . sure , he play fast more notes than any other living guitarist , but where passion soul ? this cd different story . soft machine firing all five cylinders here aside slightly muddled recording/mix i am loss find anything negative say it . even john marshall drum solo holds up pretty well . there few weak moments but those more than offset brilliance collective talents band this live setting . speaking john marshall , why , much like jon hiseman , he unknown except select few outside confines europe ? his playing never ceases amaze me . no individual track dissertations here ... anyone reading this probably already knows material players . if you're looking prime holdsworth grab this wonderful cd while it still available .	1

this cd stunning debut recording one most gifted young guitarists appear some time . her technical abilities highest level . anyone play prelude 4th lute suite this briskly musically above most criticism . i playing 4th lute suite thirty years myself . now , course ana vidovic lots room grow aesthetically -- how could it not so , she made this recording before she twenty years old ? example , sonata romantica suffers bit excess impetus . she almost never lets music breath this music , hommage schubert it , expansiveness inherent style . but let us also praise her choice repertoire . she unerringly chosen very fine pieces repertoire , which not always case . her walton bagatelles remarkable , showing panache we used hearing only julian bream , whom they written . one thing ana vidovic spades real ear harmonic progression -- this one many things sets this recording apart many others those velocity fingers little else . so , my advice purchase this recording . i doubt very much you regret it you hearing lot more this artist over years	1

i've always enjoyed admired jewel singer/songwriter contemporary folk artist , but this impressive album , which i still haven't tired , given me new found respect her talents ability continually evolve challenge herself artist . those who wrote her off just pretty blond singer some thoughtful folksy tunes , this cd make you sit up take notice . it definately shows ' jewel ' slightly harder , sharper edge , much more upbeat , urban sound both musically vocally . though she undeniably , always intelligent songwriter knack observing human social foibles , these songs less naive , far more mature ' rock chick ' feel sound than previous tracks , whilst still maintaining country girl freshness natural sex appeal underneath . its very all american ' road trip ' kind feel ( i love playing it car ) , travels white middle class america , ' trailer trash ' southern bible belt , it could almost written film soundtrack , or accompanied documentary tour . exploring such topics , religious hypocracy ( jesus loves you ) , well social poverty human deprivation , ( wild west ) , not forgeting usual pitfalls love relationships ( break me ) , detached but insightful observation gives album its edge originality . then there more bittingly sarcastic sendups human ego nature ( everybody needs someone sometime , love me , just leave me alone ) . fact there barely weak track this album . ' standing still ' , more ' pop ' genre its catchy bridge uplifting chorus , great opener first single ; ' you want play ' great energy catchy hook , while ' i won't walk away ' movingly tender love song very suited jewel beautiful voice . ' serve ego'(a song which appears kind ritualistic hedonism youth culture : " .. underneath disco light everybody feeling alright . get your hands knees praise new deity .. " she sings ) standout track , very sensual moody , relying exotic rhythms more than lyrics . ' this way ' definately terrific assortment tracks , borrowing variety influences inspirations swing country rock pop folk . not just devoted fans , it continues show jewel quality singer/songwriter developing music artist , many strings her bow .	1

without question , elvis most anthologized artist nearly thirty years since his death . so how this collection different others ? short answer -- nothing . if you're die-hard fan , there no reason buy this . but that not true casual fan who looking comprehensive overview perhaps most influential performer 20th century . this mid-priced two-disc collection covers every aspects elvis career , beginning his first sun single " that all right " through 1977 single " moody blue , " which topped country chart just months before his death . hits every stage his career--50 rock ' ' roll classics like " hound dog , " movie hits like million-seller " viva las vegas " comeback hits like " suspicious minds " ( his first no . 1 more than seven years ! ) . sure , there missing tracks ( including nine no . 1 , like " ( let me your)teddy bear , " " stuck you " " good luck charm " ) , but casual fan who only wants one anthology their collection this works nicely . however , total playing time less than two hours , it could more inclusive . highly recommende	-1

any pop album new millenium ached more beautifully than this one ? if you've ever liked annie lennox work , either eurythmics or solo artist , you're probably gonna like this one . if you've ever your heart broken , you're gonna feel it too . if you're currently throes heartbreak , well baby , you're gonna feel it your bones . whole disc painful dissolution love . tempos here generally slow , befitting subject matter , but melodies arrangements beautiful . lyrics intricate confessional , rarely resorting tried-and-true sentiments lesser pop . musically lyrically , " bare " mature work , chronicling aftermath lost love . there passion pain aplenty . regret , bitterness , despair , hope -- it all here . adding impact these spell-binding songs voice . ( i've never understood why lennox often mischaracterized ice-queen . too cerebral ? too british ? too androgynous ? ) perhaps her singular alto just leaves some people cold , but lennox gotta most soulful white girl since dusty springfield . if she lacks raw power some bigger-voiced i.e. " blacker " singers , she more than makes up difference her phrasing inflection . oh annie belt it out good , but she also knows power whisper . not only lennox singing here possibly most emotive she ever recorded , but her voice sounds like it stellar shape . suppleness control her singing throughout disc revelation , especially considering she sounded like she'd lost some flexibility range eurythmics ' fine 1999 reunion disc " peace . " no such signs vocal fatigue here . she superb voice . only disc sparse closing track she sacrifice her vocal fine-tuning , chilling dramatic effect . times complex intricate , " bare " hypnotizing pop . tuneful , addictive deeply affecting . solo masterpiece lennox . oh such gorgeous heartbreak .	1
upon listening first proper record tears fears nearly 14 years i not sure what expect . after curt smith roland orzabal went their seperate ways i remained die hard orzabal fan he continued tears fears . i still bought everthing smith released but not impressed . orzabal ( brains behind duo ) released some outstanding music but there element pop missing his work . when he smith reunited it promised more familiar album tears fears . my first listen i thought i listening beatles record convinced exception orzabals trademark powerful vocals proving i not . my first thought ... damn it they it again ! these guys write bad music ? well , then i remembered track " way you " thought , yep they ;) album opens title track it eerie how much this track sounds like graduate ( orzabal smith previous band before they became tears fears ) yet still sounds so damn paul mccartneyish same time . i astounded second track single " closest thing heaven " , some most powerful piano work i ever heard orzabal powerful singing smith joining chorus i said my self ... welcome back tears fears - you missed ! " call me mellow " lead single album world fun middle aged man grappling feelings attracted much younger woman . it amazes me this song not number one this catchiest song i heard years very well . " size sorrow " comes number 3 album my least favorite track album . orzabal penned this tune years , ago but smith took role singer this one . haunting " who killed tangerine ? " next this one standout tracks album . this song just terrific no better way say it . this song found mild success drew barrymore jimmy fallon flick " fever pitch " used promo ad espn . " killing kindness " standout track album feels like orzabal solo tff sound ( bit harder aggresive ) wasted not single . " quiet ones " contender single one my favorites album . this tune ( also very catchy ) takes life it own showcases talents orzabal smith . " who you " came next this only other song smith took lead singer job fantastic song written smith years earlier orzabal twist . " devil " brilliant play words ways reminds me tears earlier track " prisoner " hurting . bit different everything album but yet manages fit nicely other songs just same . " secret world " best track off album uses full orchestra you really feel collabaration orzabal smith this masterpiece . " ladybird " interesting song , smith who wrote chorus unable come up rest song orzabal brilliant songwriter he wrote seemingly different song go smith chorus it worked ! this great track truly co-written two talented musicians . album closes " last days earth " woderful finish masterpeice . all all tears fears back better than ever . reunion this two childhood friends reason celebrate among us tears fears fanatics . one only hopes this talented duo not make this happy ending contiues write perform . duo toured succesfully around world second leg america 2004/2005 news they performing night poms through october november 2006 we only hope more music tears fears . yes this album absolutley recommended !	1
good example one those bands defy easy categorization . if you like celtic bluegrass , maybe little bit gospel , blues , country , folk , pop , this band worth listen .	1

i offspring fan many years . i listened every one their albums serveral times over this one came out top all rest . my opinion , albums greatest least ( not counting their greatest hits album ): 1 . ignition2 . self titled3 . smash4 . ixnay hombre5 . americana6 . splinter7 . conspiracy onenote i am judging album whole , not just best songs . ignition not single " space filler " song . it raw , 90 punk rock , consistant album . some disagree this best bunch argue smash . i agree smash amazing songs like " self-esteem " , " come out play " , " gone away " , many others helped boost offspring mainstream . but not every song smash absolutely good . " dirty magic " best song cd , if not best offspring song all time . i think it overlooked underrated . ignition starts off dexter yelling " f**k " shows you album goes then . " session " first song cd one top songs cd . there many great catchy songs then . then hits more emotional , dark , mysterious song " dirty magic " . then it moves into drug song album which " hypodermic " . after comes pyromaniac loving song , " burn it up " . " no hero " also great example how offsping turn simple chug riff into something amazing . " l.a.p.d. " offsping like " f**k police " n.w.a. catchy song comes after called " nothing something " . what better way end cd great song like " forever day " . sure this album no sgt . pepper , but no one touched beatles . so i highly reccomend this album people who heard offspring before . but if you just starting enter offspring world , i would suggest smash better feel . after you get ignition if you really like it , their self titled right up there it	1
ms. proctor lovely voice wonderful ear candy even if her songs didn't depth , which they . it unfortunate her best singles , especially " me emily " probably won't get airtime they deserve they good old boy network country western music . this song could easily cross charts hopefully . highly recommend !	1
i love this disc . cannot play it enough i think sister hazel just taking off . stay tuned	1
this got offspring best album ever ! classics " come out play " , " self esteem " this classic ! " gotta get away " , " bad habit " , " nitro ( youth energy ) " couple more great songs this cd . so if you're thinking listening any offspring albums - this should definetly your first choice ! songs beginning better than ways later album . time relax : 10/10 just good intro , because you no clue what expect next ! nitro ( youth energy ): 10/10 awesome drum roll beginning ! it great sound - tone ! bad habit : 10/10 some dexter clever lyrics how lame * ss drivers tick him off ! gotta get away : 10/10 awesome song ! great vocals , guitars - etc .! genocide : 8/10 yeah good song , i guess it grow yousomething beleive : 7/10 not best song . it just wierd sound . come out play ( keep ' em seperated ): 10/10 holy [ ... ] - best offspring song ever ! lyrics so true . beat rythmn make you like song - guitar riffs make song fun . self esteem : 10/10 one their greats ! bassline makes song 20 times better - it hard just not like song!it'll long time : 7/10 not best . killboy powerhead : 9/10 i just like song overall . what happened you ? : 6/10 me this one those songs i'll probably only listen once or twice my whole life ... i don't think ska thing working great them ... so alone : 7/10 nothing really hits me this song . not one : 7/10 same . smash : 10/10 one my personal favorites , because ... whatever reason - i honestly not know ..	1
steel pulse " ultimate collection " very nice collection group best work island their early years . this reggae classic late 70 period . lot music timeframe pretty good stuff across board . steel pulse no exception . it very relaxing , even when it sometimes politcal its message . cd missing few good songs when they switched labels early 80 though . i would recommend this fans bob marley peter tosh . it similar style reggae . good music calming down .	-1
he once beatles ' lead guitarist -- brilliant songwriter his own right -- but mid-1980s , george harrison once lively successful solo career free-fall . after series lackluster albums plummeting sales , " quiet one " seemed retreat further into gardening formula one racing , until he hooked up electric light orchestra maestro jeff lynne embarked recording process produced perhaps his best solo work , 1987 cloud nine . harrison songwriting playing completely invigorated producer lynne " gee-whiz " can-do attitude studio -- he mile-high afro aviator shades challenged harrison aim ever higher , while same time setting him ease reminding him he , after all , deservedly one rock major icons . lynne strategy worked , harrison never sounded more self-assured or downright joyous than he here cloud nine . this case , you judge contents this album its cover -- blinded harrison mighty grin get swept up joy within . perhaps most telling , delightful , track over-the-top beatles homage , " when we fab , " where george humorously , wistfully , wisely comes terms his larger-than-life legacy ... where fab fan #1 lynne finally gets get his total beatlesque freak . every bell whistle thrown into production this number , kitchen sink , tangerine trees , more than few cellophane flowers . it far best beatles song beatles never recorded , better than most ones they . gear , baby ! course , even bigger smash hit here #1 " got my mind set you , " no matter how often i hear it , i can't help but get happy . mentioned other reviews , video complete delight -- hilarious , self-mocking , surreal , magical . lynne kicky arrangement harrison spirited singing re-awaken this old rock chestnut make it tune ages . it swings swoops makes you want backflips out your wingback chair . title track edgy blues number works its way under your skin winning way , while " if that what it takes , " " this love , " " fish sand " luscious mult-layered pop highest order , could ( should ) massive hits , each one . harrison delivers gorgeous melody sensitive vocal " just today , " then spirited rocker " devil radio " ( more shoulda-been hits ) , moody " someplace else . " i love fiesty " wreck hesperus , " which prototypical harrison cranky humor defiant rocking , which " breath away heaven " beautifully delicate love song sonically rooted heart asia . bonus tracks , they interesting curios --" shanghai surprise " not really overly engaging ( much like bomb film which it taken ) , but " zig zag " ( also said bomb ) actually fun little jazzy number . addition harrison lynne , other stars featured this cd include eric clapton , gary wright , elton john . but none them try hog spotlight ... all them graciously support their pal harrison he soars climbs cumulonimbus rare air pop perfection .	1
oklahoma must if you like good old broadway sound . i think it one rodgers hammerstein best works . this recording also held up classic broadway voice afred drake . songs all classics but they move slow after little while they all just start sounding same . main drawback this recording recording its self . since it made 1943 techonology lacking so it sounds like you listening old record . still it must all broadway fans	-1
i liked amelie soundtrack , but after i saw tremendous life performance yann thiersen amsterdam , i ran recordstore buy this record . yann thiersen without doubt musical genius , he played piano , alt-violin accordeon if these instruments part his body . one part , he even played piano one hand accordeon other . besides , he played some gitar prooved good singer well . other words , i've never seen so many talents united one person . track l'absente really stand out rest qu'en reste-t-il , solo performance alt-violin litterally blow you away . cd only two english spoken songs it , which not bad , but compared rest this cd bit awkward . if you like amelie , you'll like this album . if you happen able see life performance this man , go see it . my case , this concert one best i've seen many years ..	1
this band stunning ! they produced one those rare albums where everything its perfect place , everything relative , it need nothing extra nothing unneeded album . songs brilliant themselves but 100 times stronger when they together create brilliant whole , mantle . where you start agalloch ? first foremost atmosphere album . it most atmospheric album i ever heard . each track workd one create one huge progression throught this masterpeice . album cold , white desolate , solatary , isolated , beautiful atmosphere . it sounds like soundtrack walking through snow covered pine forests arctic or something like . there even samples wind bots trudging through snow . it one those records which throughout its duration paints crystal clear mental image ones head . this band gets compared opeth . not acurate all . its true they both lonely , epic atmospheres them , but where opeth warm claustrophobic , agalloch white , open , expansive , cold . there black metal vocals , there beautifully haunting clean vocals . there acoustic guitars , distorted guitars , all manner instruments which add effect , like traditional horns such . opeth never get particularily heavy . although they use some screaming , double pedals etc ... it always comes across perfectly ... expressive , opposed slamming heavy . there 4 instrumentals this album 5 " real " songs . they rerealy fall much short 10 minute mark . there variation dynamics this album use unuasual instruments make it even more varied . song structures brilliant , they not verse-chorus simple structure , they progressive evolve , like opeth . there howeve couple shorter , verse-chorus songs end te album , giving beautiul sense ending closure . this what i mean .. everything this album perfect ! lyrics brilliant too ... telling stories times . they black metal style lyrics .. worshipping nature , allbeit very intelligently subtly . there referances " oak " " pantheons " all adding natural imagery . i not narrow my recomendation anyone ! anybody who appreciate atmospheric , intelligent music should buy this listen it ove over again . it should listened whole , notas individual songs , given genuine time thought .... this not background music ! but whatever you put into listening this album you get out tenfold .	1

aussie twanger kasey chambers put out fine debut captain . this one , she occasionally allows more breathing room guitars dances closer rock end country-rock equation . her voice still same marvelous childlike instrument ( think julie miller ) but she ups songwriting tad this time out . there more tunes lodge themselves insistently than first effort . highlights : disc kicks off brassy title tune , declaration intent kasey snarls " iron bars big ole cars/won't run me out town/i'll d**ned if you're not my man/before sun goes down . " she follows up meek " not pretty enough " leaving you wonder which one " real " kasey . perhaps it both .. you get dose melancholy " bad day " ( chambers ' pal backer lucinda williams guests harmony ) but weeper " little bit lonesome " ( chambers channeling hank sr. ? ) " if i you " chambers again insists if her lovers don't " get " her , it their problem . ( " i'm only half what you see ... " ) " crossfire " edgy rocker kasey this time playing runaround romeo ( " if you don't hate me , you'll learn to/i thought i it clear start/i don't heart ... " ) perhaps strongest track visceral " ignorance " ( hidden after track 13 ) , chambers recoils world evils . ( " if you're not pissed off world/then you're just not paying attention " )lows : no real clunkers this time out , though " runaway train " sounds like knockoff title track . she didn't really bring anything new gram parsons cover either . ( " still feeling blue " )bottom line : if you like alt country or julie miller , this highly recommended . if you love traditional country ( loretta lynn , george jones , johnny cash ) you're looking something new " sounds old " , you'd well advised give this one listen	-1

when i first got this , i didn't like it near good happy trails , so i didn't play it much . once i really started paying attention , i couldn't quit listening . this brilliant debut now one my very favorites out large collection . there depth maturity this album alot better known 60 acts lacked . this album truley gets better each listen . sure , sound quality could stand remastering , but don't let get way . there so much atmosphere this music . it transports you like great music should . yea , there better lead vocalists out there , but there nothing bad this record . song quality top notch . pride man more relevant today than when it recorded . i've heard several versions this song , but quicksilver always my favorite . dino song puts smile my face everytime i hear it . gold silver awesome ! real gem . light your windows might just pass ballad someone else , but there depth atmosphere here only repeated listenings bring surface . it too long sort 50 feel , without sounding like nostaliga . fool : this masterpiece ! i still get shivers up my spine every listen . i just wish it longer . this song influential alot other groups , more so europe than here . i wish i could put into words just how much better this album gets every play ! i alot 60 albums , but there something subtle here many quicksilver contemporaries lack . it steal low price it sells . i think i'll listen it again right now . get it ! it one best	1

this album came out around my freshmen year college so i exposed it before she don't use jelly song took off . it took me while get into it , but once i gave album chance it struck me how different album how talented musicians . this came out grunge 90 i can't really think anyone doing anything this psychedelic or weird time . i mean no one writes songs moths incubators , or zebras running into space ships . it complete weirdness over catchiest melodies music . also , layers upon layers guitar sound towards end moth incubator just blows me away every time . over ten years later it doesn't surprise me one bit lips come out brilliant studio albums , incredible zaireeka experiment . few posess their level imagination or talent . i would also say this album isn't everyone , but then again most ground breaking albums aren't	1
finally , after four years ( since his 1998 work " cosas del amor " ) , enrique iglesias back " quiz�s " , all-spanish album , it worth wait . " quiz�s " great album variety songs them ; ballads he known ( tres palabras , para qu� la vida , mentiroso , etc . ) more latin pop based ( la chica de ayer , mamacita ) , " quiz�s " variety good songs . also included cd song seems blend smoothly ballad latin pop back ballad , " pienso en t� " , which great song . first single , " mentiroso " also offered marachi version , " no apagues la luz " , which his 2001 english album , " escape " . also included this bonus edition dvd which gives us good , but bit too quick , biography enrique , four music videos ( one each his first three spanish albums , his hit bailamos ) . not bad , considering most places , two discs sold less than " $ " together . even if enrique can't keep his english career going , his spanish one looks bright ever	1

during extended avalanche grunge rap 90 , this cd offered refuge those who craved great pop music melody , harmony , lyrics substance . aimee mann " whatever " truly remarkable cd featuring 13 tracks sonic gold ! my opinion , amiee mann spent 80 climbing this very high point . her work "' til tuesday " managed improve each release . 80 outstanding decade pop rock , but " new wave " formula often used ( exploited early ' til tuesday ) tossed aside aimee truly shine . 90 may huge train wreck music industry , but aimee mann shining brighter than ever ! one cannot review this cd without mentioning production jon brion ( aimee ' til tuesday band mate ) . nothing short amazing ! i purchased this cd very day it released back early 90 . it since become timeless work " audio art " , one few truly great albums era . -j	1
i'm stunned after years listening fred neil contemporaries ( bob dylan , tim buckley , hoyt axton , etc . ) i never once heard his name or music mentioned other players folk era mid sixties greenwich village . i guess stands testament just how obscure fred neil ; term " fringe artist " really doesn't apply . liner notes this remastered edition his third album confirm neil made music himself didn't care business side music . like many others , i introduced music fred neil through sopranos show which used " dolphins " great effect during scene where christopher relapsed used heroin . my ears perked up i said out loud " who ? " i ran straight my hoyt axton discs started fumbling around thinking it him , but not finding song question . ( i later read axton largely influenced neil ; two certainly similar vocal styles . ) i tracked this disc down purchased it primarily " dolphins " , which incredible song . lyrics music combine capture such wistful sentiment , it become one my favorite songs . tim buckley covered this song also , although i haven't yet heard his version . i surprised quality rest music this cd . fred neil such great voice , obvious appreciation blues . i hadn't realized he songwriter who wrote " everybody talkin '" , later huge hit harry nilsson " midnight cowboy " soundtrack . liner notes explain neil refused cut song movie soundtrack , nilsson instead , further proof neil disregard fame or exposure . neil version plaintive direct i think i prefer it nilsson version i've hearing all these years . i interested read liner notes neil experience working doors ' producer paul rothchild what turned out complete clash personalities . producer this album took opposite approach rothchild , who tried handle neil ( which backfired ) , decided let him some friends greenwich village sit circle play their guitars until songs included album took shape into finished takes . whole disc informal feel , but mood captured hits spot every time i listen this . i would recommend this disc any fan singer/songwriters early seventies . this album confessional personal style similar artists follow neil . i would say fred neil probably one most overlooked sngwriters his generation , although i think he intended things way . however , this album needs heard , it really good	1

this perhaps most satisfying cd purchase i've made , bar none . if seems excessive , well , o.k. , it . but , this disc phenomenal , lover latin-american classical music , its must . ballet uirapuru cemented my view villa-lobos one most phenomenal orchestrators . uirapuru dark , mystical score tells story enchanted rainforest bird who turns into man , who falls love madien , but then gets shot angry old flute-playing man bow who upset because some hunters beat him up because he wierded them out . well , story may somewhat silly , but music unsettlingly powerful , glittering orchestration masterfully highlighted mata superb venezuelan players . chavez horse-power suite fascinating much more visceral way , mix neo-classical wit chugging latin rhythms . closing movement , ' el tropico ' , far surpasses pat benatar album same name , weaves intricate bach-ian counterpoint into darkly sentimental yet energizing tango . final selection , far most well known , ginastera popular estancia ballet suite . those who don't know piece , prepared blistering 6/8 rhythms exhilirating syncopations ( mainstay ginastera works ) . performances phenomenal , totally committed . dorian ( who put out number excellent cd surveying important latin-american repertoire ) provides top-shelf sound , usual . o.k. , so maybe it not best cd ever , but it close	1

great thing miles davis his trumpet playing so transcendent . he probably only jazz player whose albums frequently appear top 100 rock lists . i fail see how anyone could not take lilting sentiments ' porgy bess ' heart no matter what your musical tastes . ' buzzard song ' opens album grooving bass line paul chambers , cleverly imitated tuba follows suit ( how many albums you heard grooving tuba ? ) . then lyrical note changes ' bess , you my woman ' , before one highlights album , ' gone ' . this something departure gershwin opera itself , but backing players relish opportunity some pure jazz playing , topped off jones ramshakle drum playing . power ' summertime ' much its basic composition , which once both strong tender lends itself so many interpretations . this version musical backing acts counter davis elegant soloing . ' oh bess , where my bess ' proves most uplifting these tracks while ' prayer ( oh doctor jesus )' contains character-filled contributions all players building monumental crescendo . ' fisherman .... ' begins evocative alto flute danny banks , floating above slight air menance backing arrangement . straining lament ' my man gone now ' followed great toe-tapping swing arrangement ' it ain't necessarily so ' . gil evans arrangements much colour davis trumpet playing ' here comes de honey man ' . final highlight ' there boat leaving soon new york ' sounds unstoppable effusive , clear joy all involved . each individual player becomes miles davis equal this explosive finale . again i mention universal appeal miles davis work , whether indulging simple , lazy melody or bringing subtle nuances fore , his playing wonderfully haunting	1

i've mostly into ultra . trance series , but eventually moved away it when i started hearing songs so ' ghetto ' they couldn't possibly categorized trance first place , let alone wind up album who main sales pitch trance music . same thing happened ultra . dance series .... some strange reason more trance tracks appeared this album , which probably means dj compile these selections don't really know what they're doing . typically ultra series collections , you don't see really good dj compiling stuff ( like oakenfold/van buuren/tiesto ) . instead we get wannabe disc jockeys like riddler , vic latino , johnny vicious , etc ... seem all want get mad props/recognition , process striving fame , they lose thier credibility intermixing generes/going off tangent music album that supposed feature only one genere music . ultra . dance 06 i cite 3 or 4 different generes music this album touches . those like dance but not hip-hop/rb , they put up it , because these " amazing " dj felt those songs playlist . but when looking new compilations come these ' big time ' dj , including louie devito ( who compilations i gave up least 2 years ago ) , trend i've noticed how they this magic ability select songs just sound real bad . example , ' out touch ' ( disc 1 ) sounds like it compiled garage using 386 compiled twice over using mp3 encoding . seriously , some these songs cannot played loud high end system because they sound like trash . but if you people keep buying into it , then you support garbage . despite all this bashing , there few good songs this album . but i've basically enough ultra series . i would say if you like this album , you would like ' trip house ' series albums better	-1

someone said fantasia cd cover " hot mess . " actually , there nothing wrong cd cover ; it music itself that really hot mess . i so excited fantasia 2nd album now i'm just exteremly disappointed . fantasia supposed step up her game , not step down . you amy winehouse joss stone using leftover music previous decades , hailed great soul singers . yet if amy joss told make contemporary rb album , first thing they would get neptunes , timbaland , swizz beats . fantasia , who could blow amy/joss rest their ilk out water , comes out this tired album . i nothing against missy elliot , but she swizz beats very bad job producing fantasia album . how you going voice like fantasia come out this souless , immature , flavorless bubblegum noise ? it obvious fantasia wants pop mainstream , but it working against her . rb sound she " free yourself " can't find this new cd all . what you get some watered down rb music polluted loud repetitive club beats pop overtones . everything sounds like what already radio , there no potential classics , nothing would played quiet storm . it sounds " modern " it heavy style , but that it . other words , it forgetable . best song this cd " 2 weeks notice . " i actually don't like song , but it sounds better than other ones . i'm not feeling this all i'm upset . fantasia needs go back studio right away some different producers songwriters come up smooth rb sound . she needs remember where real fanbase . if mainstream doesn't like it , that too bad . sorry , but i'm skipping this	-1

i'll start saying i love jim steinman songwriter , almost everything he touches becomes gold . his previous work this one , ' bat out hell ' meat loaf recording vocals , masterpiece . said , let go jim steinman singer . i believe he great , but that my personal opinion . he may not able hit some notes meat loaf could , but his voice not much different range , it may lean more towards bruce springsteen sound , but it still grand none less . most songs here covered later meat loaf albums , some may sound better meat , but jim give each song his own particular style , which times beats even what meat loaf could manage . song ' rock roll dreams come through ' which hit meat loaf ' 93 , i feel steinman better job . i prefered his arrangement one ' bat ii ' , but again , just me . anyway it goes , i feel this crucial part rock history , if you're collector meat loaf albums , this must .	1
i came richard hawley his lowedges album , which i thought terrific . so while i am not able remark arc his solo career his first record , i think this record step down lowedges . don't get me wrong -- this record good -- very distinctive filled seductive murmurings ( both vocal guitar ) which hawley known . i can't help feeling , however , there somewhat disconnect music words . melodies still beautiful but lyrics more opaque than those lowedges , therefore i find songs less compelling . here , more than his earlier record , hawley repeats various lyric phrases ( " oh tonight , " " here my arms " ) , effect becomes hypnotic but not especially transporting or meaningful . two standouts me " darling wait me , " where lyrics come into focus music perfectly conveys wistfulness longing , " born under bad sign , " wonderfully relaxed tune , despite contradictorily themed , ominous lyrics . i've only it couple weeks , but i don't think this going get played much lowedges .	-1
500 years now , historians look back tumultuous 20th century ask , " yeah , but they accomplish anything ?

" grand funk remasters " series : first all , what took so freakin ' long release these records this format ? why we listen crappy sounding cds this day age ? nathan ( william snape ) says " full monty " during one his dad ( robert carlyle ) clumsy dance rehearsals --" crap ! " even beatles taking their own sweet time producing quality cds their catalog ! ( " capital albums vol . 1 " ) oh well , better late than never , i guess ! i just one last thing say record companies , et al involved concerning this faux pas ; guess which finger i'm holding up!there world difference sound these cds sterile sounding earlier digital releases same material ; fact alone justifies buying remasters . however , bonus music these cds makes them must-buy anyone who likes grand funk . " pluribus funk " : vintage grand funk railroad sound ! this last gfr record produced terry knight engineered ken hamann . i like gfr music released after this period , but plain fact matter this true sound group . it sound made them more than footnote rock history . again , i love grand funk sound after this phase , but they would never again able equal intensity band original mega-noise-nova-heaviness ! i hear heavy metal . i hear punk rock . i hear influence . think i'm exaggerating ? don't forget frank zappa liked them ! liner notes jazz trumpet player tim hagans ' cd , " animation-imagination , " he states he " dug " grand funk . addition , his written thank you section cd specifically calls out names , mark farner , mel schacher , don brewer ! ( note : craig frost not mentioned . ) don brewer says liner notes knight wasn't " great " producer " antiquated " " simple " approach recording gfr . say what ? greatness grand funk didn't anything " sophistication !

please note this re-issue earlier double cd similar title but different packaging . rocking berries , when they chose , brilliant pop group . they could also sing great comic songs . their problem their fans not appreciate this mix . so maybe group would more success if they left comedy barron knights , specialists kind music . they one other problem - they didn't write their own material so all their hits ( misses ) covers . group built up huge reputation live act secured contract decca . they recorded two singles decca , neither which charted britain although one ( wah wah wah woo ) well germany , where they also known great live performers . decca dropped them but they soon got contract piccadilly it their piccadilly recordings make up this compilation . they began minor hit - cover i didn't mean hurt you ( shirelles ) spent just one week uk charts , 43 . it might much bigger hit but extraordinary thing happened - their second single rush-released almost immediately . tokens , successfully american group , made little impact britain ( one minor hit - lion sleeps tonight - which lost out cover karl denver ) but release he town , which would surely big uk hit them , but rocking berries heard their demo recorded their own cover , which made top three . tokens , they never british hit , all their best songs hits via british cover versions . group seemed set up when they initially given funny how love , song written two members british group , ivy league . rocking berries recorded brilliant version would huge hit . unfortunately them , ivy league decided release their own version single so , piccadilly , subsidiary pye ( ivy league label ) , rocking berries not allowed release their version single but it included here . they minor hit what world come over you ( cover dovells song ) , then scored their second last big uk hit poor man son ( cover reflections song ) made top five . this followed tokens cover ( you're my girl ) but it only minor hit , sales hampered simultaneous release four-track ep . it this point their comedy material started alienate their younger fans only one more minor hit followed - water over my head ( cover eddie hodges song ) . several other singles all missed charts but it didn't seem bother group while - they very busy variety act didn't need hits . this comprehensive collection contains all their hits failed singles , b-sides , ep lp tracks . most music serious , their comedy mostly limited live shows , but examples their lighter side evident tracks such harvest love ( song you would expect hear wurzels or barron knights ) , when i'm cleaning windows ( cover george formby classic ) two children songs ( laughing policeman , i know old lady )	1

released 1970 , this debut album british band egg extremely complex progressive rock dominated some incredible hammond organ work . i guess it worth noting although this keyboard-led trio considered part " canterbury ' scene , music sounds nothing like caravan or hatfield north ( although canterbury sense humor present ) . rather , music egg combines significant proportion avant-garde tendencies classical some dissonant passages . general though , over-the-top technical excess order day i absolutely love i t.t he musicians this album include keyboardist extraordinaire dave stewart ( hammond organ , acoustic piano , mellotron , tone generator - it crude synthesizer ); mont campbell ( vocals , bass guitar ); clive brooks ( drums ) . all these guys simply phenomenal musicians individual ensemble playing simply out this world . respect bass player , mont campbell not simply follow left hand piano part but thoroughly contrapuntal , which makes egg composition very interesting . although mont vocal abilities not great sound tiny bit dated times , vocals not big part egg sound not detract anything all . tracks album range length 0'09 " experimental track bulb excellent 25+ minute multi-movement symphony no . 2 . general , music album mixes experimental passages some very nice adaptations classical pieces ( j.s. bach toccata fugue d-minor grieg hall mountain king ) , incredible jamming , quirky proggy tracks vocals ( while growing my hair , i absorbed , song mcgillicudie pusillanimous ) . large part though , tracks mostly instrumental dominated dave incredible hammond organ playing . although this album simply amazing very enjoyable , there moments when avant-garde tendencies get mildly irritating , but little affect overall listening experience . this becomes apparent " they laughed when i sat down piano " , which features very nice classical piano piece countered some abrasive noises tone generator - it actually kind funny really . there also tone generator " freak-out " symphony no . 2 during blane movement gets little nerve-wracking . odd time signatures abound meters such 5/8 , 7/4 , 9/4 , 9/8 , 13/8 used frequent meter shifts . chord structures also pretty exotic there some very unusual root movements . this remastered version eclectic discs very good features ton liner notes restored cover art pictures band . sound quality also excellent . one features this version album pretty cool addition previously unreleased fourth movement symphony no . 2 . additional tracks include seven jolly good time , which celebrates jolly delights ( or horrors , depending your perspective ) playing 7/4 , " you all princes " ( which ends abruptly ) . both tracks released singles 1969 pretty good . there tiny bits psychedelic influences two tracks . all all , this excellent stuff highly recommended superb follow up album polite force ( 1971 )	1
during time period this album ( 1970 - 1972 ) leon russell top rock concert act world . back day when most rock groups four or five members , leon russell hit road no less than ten top line performers , including derek dominos bassist carl radle , rev . patrick henderson black grass . leon russell shelter , you get studio recording captures much leon concert feel - but where you understand words , instruments balanced well . i don't remember if personnel same , but feel right there ! starting " thee i sing , " through end album you'll looking flat peice ground so you dance . piano work awesome , combining leon black gospel style ( he also played some andrae crouch albums ) bit blues , honky country . if you're musician , you'll want this album " utility licks " turn arounds gold nuggets playing leon throws out there . this album one i learned play pianq , listening it over over picking it out bit bit . all all , it great selection genre music timeless make you feel good - you definitely won't get inferiority complex you sing leon ! it feeling rather than velvety smooth david gates ( leon also played him , sixties , prior bread ) voice . get it	1

most reviews i read this disc seem pretty pleased both performance recording . other hand i am just slightly influenced some thoughtful comment i seen expresses few reservations regarding balance -- me reviews ' useful ' if they show independent judgment , not if they support my preconceptions which quite strong enough not need reinforcing . what this account definitely vivid . orchestral detail very clear , but if i ask myself whether this quite how planets sounds concert hall , then i'm not so sure . i like it this way , but this not piece where i am hard please way i am performances viennese classics or ravel or sibelius or elgar or walton . general this very effective reading planets . tempi sound right me , no doubt because they much what i am used , playing orchestral discipline superb . this only disc planets i own or plan own because it not work i'm fussy , but connoisseurs may want consider whether effectiveness slightly overmanipulated recording technicians	1
rob swift something elder statesmen , regards art turntablisim , one original founders " x-ecutioners " turntable collective , ( which he since parted ways ) . but seeing rob generally one always sporadically releasing solo albums , always looked push boundaries turntable dynamics , reluctant solely rely hip-hop his expression music , instead regularly incorporated complex arrangements : soul , funk , illbient , electronica , seamlessly woven into his mixes , this hasn't too much problem . here , he looks stretch things even further , building album reflection not only devastation 9/11 attacks , but subsequent decision go war iraq , bring into some context mood assess current climate america . but obviously this isn't singer/songwriter protest album , , there already many rap albums since , touched upon these issues . so you'd impressed hear this turntable album , brings these views situations some context . you'd ( quite rightly ) figure , you'd pretty mad want try build album collates such important topical subject matter into dj turntable album , but then this ' rob swift ' we're referring what he devise multimedia album sorts visual side handled accompanying dvd , regular cd , providing music/commentary side things . it album clearly anti-bush , both president his party , coming under intense scrutiny throughout album . but instead traditional ' finger-pointing ' exercise ( although there moments ) , it more album takes fragments all over place uses them , carefully build up picture , documenting elements 9/11 attacks , retaliation military attacks iraq , what repercussions this means . this primarily album ' war ' . so rob pieced together this album , using media footage , dialogue , press statements , presidential addresses , political commentary , sampling , tracks lyrics under rob editing , express terrorist climate , gun-ho posturing , anti-war sentiments . so you rob cleverly taking george bush addressing american , his announcement american taking military action , cleverly manipulated via rob swifts deft cutting scratching , focusing his reasons retaliation , declaration war against iraq . classic rap tracks , taken completely rebuilt reinterpreted work statements intent war ( ' eric rakim ' , just one example ) . instrumental pieces rob reigning back over top turntable dynamics working more like stream-of-consciousness tracks kinetic looping conjuring up imagery post 9/11 nation , still coming terms attacks , change peoples perceptions . even going so far imply america become more fearful nation because attacks . political commentary dropped throughout album , impressive thing i've always found rob swift , his doesn't always feel need display his technical ability , but seems far more keen create moods , artful juxtapositions virtuosic cutting which bounce ideas around . hip-hop tracks obviously present , but various rappers/vocalists brought feature multitude tracks . again , themes here : retalition/media coverage/inaccuracies war/spin pr/hostile reactions/distrust/confusion remains progressive thoroughly engaging ( even if you don't necessarily agree , statements ) . but what surprise not all these tracks purely backed hip-hop production/arrangements , instead , it just likely feature elements rob own musical influences so there moments when funk soul recordings even piano , provide softer edge vocal dynamics , subtle cutting scratching mixing things up wonderfully . variety music really works this records favour , because it tends make record more cerebral tone , take higher ground than , mere aggressive sloganerring ( think more " dj spooky " than " x-ecutioners " ) . amongst there more agitated social political theories , all delivered provocative confident directness . interspersed amongst musical tracks snippets ' reportage ' .... features , news events , social commentaries highlight growing disparity social classes , passages sampled news dialogue that'll make you think , or very least pay attention whats highlighted . it never presented patronising manner , but actually more like showing much we'd all like believe one day , people become empowered , class divide go smaller . america still great many issues work through , before any sort universal consciousness or collective understanding possibly attained . if your expecting mix album , go alongside rob swifts previous work , i'm afraid say you won't find it here . it surprising rob taken so long make his own statements or stances evident record , especially it so long after much what happen very well documented . but then i feel this more observation , rather than providing any clear insight into world post-9/11 . sometimes it more preferable information presented you , way individual make up their own minds or conclusions , i think that whats happened here . because it doesn't truly clarify anything other than when regards politics , media , government repressive bureaucracies , we shouldn't so willing accept what his presented us . it clear rob stance one obviously ' anti-war ' , but he declines impress upon listener see ( hear ?? ) his way thinking , instead he more like exercising his right ' freedom speech/expression ' , this isn't really album become engrossed it technical trickery , but arguably work artist , feels his unparallelled technical ability turntables , needed confined just knocking out stunning mix album . this more certainly rob swifts most mature focused work , even though it not something bump club , scope it knocked me back little , most certainly left impression . not only innovative ( reasonably informative ) , but daring take art turntablism , push it into completely new direction , confrontational daring question america governments reasons military action , just might peoples asking questions or looking more closely governments actions . although you might not necessarily agree album , but it doesn't mean this shouldn't heard , even hear just how far turntablism come since it early days	1

we bought three copies this cd . combination familiar hymns , beautiful arrangements , excellent voices fine symphony musicians keeps us playing it often . music calms my husband " road rage , " he says , i like hum . we hope same groups christmas music recording	1

sure , jello voice takes some getting used , but honestly ; what punk fan isn't sick same ol ' raspy voice mumbling unintelligibly ? jello insight well his voice provide interest genre where message often lost translation . insight one best songs dead kennedys recorded . hell , i popped one his spoken-word cds last week it eerie how appropriate jello words , even though he speaking corrupt president over decade half past . give this album listen well checking out some his spoken word albums .	-1
i heard steve tyrell radio several times . he entertained king center here melbourne , fl few weeks ago opening linda ronstadt . i understand he great . he produced one ( or more ) rod stewart great american songbooks . i guess he decided go off his own go sinatra songs so many singers doing . his voice different but i really like it .	1
after fully listening this cd well over year i decided finally put my thoughts into writing . this mix turning into one most inventive cd releases since digweed sydney global underground release disc 1 . over five years ago digweed dropping tribal percussion beats like hong kong trash , elements , shape shifter ... molding tunes together where you would literally think yourself " what hell going here ! this superb .. " lisle taken things same level this mix . this mix meant truly " listened " not just put generic thumping prog . he drops breaky techy sounding overlays all while keeping your head adrift excellent track selections . certain cd never get old , others you stop listening after multiple rotations . dance music changes so often disc created 3 years ago often considered dinosaur . after careful attention this cd , i think 5 years now , this cd still library . listen carefully you find small details mix smile . nice work jonathan .. nice work	1
1999 nominations quot ; grammyquot ; awards compacy disc extremely dissapointing . varaity different types music made me dislike it . there version backstreet boys quot;backstreet backquot ; i've never heard before . also they opera (?) music andrea bocelli . i think it great he nomination , same dixie chicks . but country opera aren't kind music deserve place compact disc ages 10-15 majority people buy it . i'd say pop , rock , alternative , rap main choices music pre-teens choose . if you like opera , country , pop , soft rock , this album you . but if your around 12 13 i would not recommend this , so save your money go buy something else	-1
when you think how little people know movie , imagine how many never heard soundtrack . it great background music anything . i tend not " rock out " office , so this music just right . it doesn't put me sleep , but it doesn't disturb my neighbors , either . track #9 , my noble knight , bit tear jerker ... absolutely beautiful	1

these recordings long some most difficult find mississippi john hurt catalogue . this ironic they among finest recordings hurt ever made . recorded during two marathon recording sessions summer 1963 , this second batch material hurt recorded after his rediscovery . first batch recorded april same year . i can't say enough these library congress recordings or mississippi john hurt , general . these sessions , particular , warmth intimacy them i really enjoy . hurt plays many these cuts positioning his guitar strings tuned down one or two steps . this really brings out warmth his voice . consider , example , his rendition " corrina corrina " . this may lowest i've ever heard him sing . his voice guitar so up close they positively tickle your ear . there would such void recorded blues music , without lovely contributions mississippi john hurt . my money , no other blues singer sings plays such gentleness , grace , beauty . he truly category all his own , which why many people past argued hurt not blues singer all , but songster . we so lucky hurt discovered recorded , first ' 28 then later during blues revival 60s . it really makes you wonder all those blues singers never recorded died unnoticed . time i born , mississippi john hurt already passed . i'm really glad his music lives	1

nearly 25 years chanticleer performed large wide variety music , gregorian chant most modern fare . its seamless blend 12 male voices , ranging counter-tenor bass , ensemble earned international renown " orchestra voices " . chanticleer founded 1978 tenor louis botto , named after ' clear-singing ' rooster chaucer ' canterbury tales ' . this cd offers wide variety choral gems , some well-known ; some traditional ; some french , german ; most english . but all them performed great skill well exquisite tone quality . dawn upshaw added plus this disc . just commenting few them captured my interest : " christmas round " / " today virgin " . sir john tavener joined russian orthodox church 1977 which tremendous impact his compositions . brief text ' christmas round ' orthodox liturgy christmas day . ' today virgin ' strophic setting text mother thekla , orthodox nun , who provided him libretti several his major works . typical russian orthodox style , drone employed bass , upper voices move parallel fifths octaves .

marley may hold crown , but peter tosh king his own right . many argued tosh represented grittier , rougher side music , contrast marley more accessible sound , this not far he truth . but tosh plenty catchy melodies offer well . live documents go , you don't get any better than this : sound makes you feel like you really there club ... you almost smell ganja smoke coming out your speakers ! songs , little slowed down studio versions , lose none their vibrancy . fact , some them benefit slower , longer delivery . overall aural picture reggae sound , this fantastic example neophytes devotees alike . it also phenomenal live recording rebel his prime	1

funky , ethereal , free , melodic , romantic , edgy ... classic . jarrett , sharing spotlight garbarek , offers program such variety sheer finger-snapping lyricism any jazz lover would silly not give it listen . recording clarity richness one ecm finest - head ears above most what come out last 35 years . garbarek , those you who know his more ethereal folky work , his coleman/coltrane/rahsaan peak here - sailing , moaning , tossing tart , lopsided twisty rhythmic nuggets into mix one moment , going deeply gospel or romantic next . tone like deep-fried ice cream . christenson , too - groove , experiment , agility , shading tone , poly-rhythms - appeal fans touches dejohnette , erskine , motian , haynes even murray cyrille , but really singular drummer . george russell , who featured jan jon late sixties , commented some reason , norwegians seemed swing like they came 125th street , but their own kind blues . danielsson lyrical , fa t-t oned bassist who digs deep , anchoring driving inspiring soloists . under-appreciated bassist who real showcase here . jarrett contained , best sense - sensitive ever songs , grooving deeply flying - especially windup , real showcase piece alternating funky labyrinth head free-blow solos . there no reason not this album . it jazz watershed	1

mm food , what i say this album which not said already , well not much but what i say this one my favourate albums , first time i heard it i thought it just good but after repeated listens i began hear intricisies dooms rhymes , understanding slang ( please note coming england some american slang lost us)and metaphors . doom such accomplished emcee , first time i heard him venomous villain , not great album but his skill left me awe i just seek out rest his material , currently i own most his albums including operation doomsday which dare i say my opinion not good this album . majority album produced doom himself , one track produced count base , pns madlib also track each , every song my opinion great beef rapp kookies . production varied yet i think most people need time get used it i don't know sure but people i've played it told me they needed time let it grow them , but opinions positive . overall this outstanding album varied production doom never sounded better , only thing i not like tracks 6-9 which all skits which annoying since it all lumped together it breaks up flow album but this far one dooms more consistent efforts worthy successor operation doomsday	1
there two essential live blue oyster cult albums 1970 , it telling " your feet or your knees " didn't get remastering treatment " some enchanted evening " . soe contains " hits " ( reaper godzilla ) isn't raw " your feet ...

good 20 years through many eras music continuing his tenth release " slow time " , patrick o'hearn retains amazing quality defined way i view new age music ever since hearing ancient dreams when i just toddler . newest release appropriately entitled " slow time " just title suggests , very slow but gorgeous album home run arguably my favorite new age maestro last decade half . album without doubt major departure even his more medieval sounding works followed " indigo " many years ago . it perhaps greatest departure his trademark sound since changes took place el dorado indigo . here o'hearn rhythms absent six eight tracks here . album places reminds me almost steve roach " magnificent void " nearly decade ago it eerie sounds space atmospheres . those who've embraced " ancient dreams " " beautiful world " " so flows current " not immediately thrilled this newest outing but me , it new chapter arc music pat released last 20 years . " music three vibraphones " eight-minute experimental track nothing but vibraphone/marimba instrument delivering beautiful if somewhat repetitive melody metallic tones vibraphone . i've played something similar oddly enough when playing vibraphone . track my opinion greatest departure any his songs past . it followed up title track which more akin what i'd hear jonn serrie or steve roach . " slow time " haunting melody what me sound lot like dripping water cricket sound effects create really dark but beautiful somber melody . this track oddly enough reminds me images swimming deep ocean light provided deep sea fish using their own lights illuminate scene . " let move " experimental track uses mostly electronic effects create dark psychedelic but peaceful atmosphere track reminds me electronic experimental tracks early 1970s like " cosmic kitchen " roger powell . " i could live here " goes into more familiar o'hearn territory strange water like ambient background effects tribal sound dominates track . effects beautiful merge into fifth track entitled " where we once stood " which moody melancholy track reminds me somewhat " lone man " decade earlier . " welcome sight " closest one gets familiar o'hearn territory maracas-like instrument providing percussion bits pieces medieval sounds previous releases well beautiful echoing pianos . " slow time " yet again wonderful outing one greatest new age maestros new age field . it may not kind album changed world way " indigo " or " so flows current " me but it still must-have . who knows what o'hearn cook up next . highly recommended .	1
i must admit i never boyzone fan quite fankly i found ronan solo efforts rather dull , so when friend lent me copy boyzone member stephen gately debut solo cd i rather skeptical . i pleasantly surprised . this cd filled wonderful pop sounds stephen sweet singing voice used full effect here . several tracks cowritten stephen himself , lyrics basically dealing his coming-out . wonderful cd - i throughly recommend it	-1
sepultura second full length release similar their breakthrough album , " beneath remains , " lot ways , so i'm surprised this c.d. ( " schizophrenia " ) didn't get more attention . like " beneath remains , " " schizophrenia " death/thrash metal album full brim blindingly fast , pile driving riffs , scorching solos , pounding drums , max violent , death metal barks . plus , even though it sounds rather rough , it not quite great or groundbreaking sepultura third or fourth albums , this album actually quite great . tracks three four , " wall " " escape void , " good examples this album insane guitar drum work . next , " inquisition symphony " good centerpiece album , because it instrumental . it also tour-de-force guitarist andreaas kisser , flattening riffs , searing solos , even acoustic guitars . other highlights include " past comes storms " ( which catchy , chugging , pounding riffs ) , " septic schizo , " " abyss " ( which acoustic guitar interlude ) , " r.i.p. ( rest pain ) . " finally , like remastered version " beneath remains , " if you buy reissue " schizophrenia " ( which i strongly recommend you improved sound quality ) , you get two bonus tracks : " rough mixes " " septic schizo " " wall . " these remixes actually not remixes all , they're instrumentals . they're exact same original song , only without vocals . bottom line , this should sepultura breakout album , but since it not ( it not considered one best thrash albums all time ) , " schizophrenia " isn't absolute must every metal collection . but , because it foreshadowed greatness come sepultura later works , " schizophrenia " essential every sepultura/max cavalera collection	1

i just browsing saw only 5 people rated this album , which really not band or this album justice . album allot older than ' 97 cd release , late 80s i guess , vinyl era . this album success europe , " where i go wrong " perhaps their second most commercially successful song , " red red whine " ( not this one ) number one . non reggae listener this great entry album . it basically takes reggae goes pop it , spinning some sweet melodies process . however , what makes ub40 so unique they made some more accessable mainstreamed reggae without it sounding fabricated . they also made serious " true " reggae , their labor love series , i feel this comes through their pop oriented work . part thanks nuanced melancholy voice one their lead vocals , ub40 made many lasting song their long career , this album probably best place get started them	1

straight story film i really like major reason this music . i can't think movie i've seen which musical score this gripping , especially song 3 , which i think called laurens walking . after hearing what angelo badalamenti twin peaks , well , makes me aware i'm hands genius . though david lynch his editors ( mary sweeney , i think , key one ) didn't create any this music angelo ( least , i don't think ) , they accentuate it so immensely using it such beautiful ways images film it seems they should almost get small songwriting credit well . i didn't think watching 79-year old man riding tractor iowa wisconsin could feel so haunting , endearing sometimes spooky .	-1

yeah , we know miles went through many phases stages , but this where i started miles after i initially heard " sketches spain " , then i went " round midnight " coltrane , then backwards mile charlie parker days , then i went forward " live blackhawk " , then " kind blue " . whew . that alot ground , but miles mercurial great everything he , never stopping very long smell particular group roses before moving next challenge . ' piece d'resistance ' here extended performance " i'll remember april " . huge , mind-opening performance !! arrangement-wise ( very uptempo native-american oriented ) , performance-wise , it just wonderful , i've listened it decades same wonder enjoyment . kenny clarke brushwork too much , davey schildkraut ( alto ) miles ( muted trumpet ) blow wonderful , inspired solos still fresh today ; but horace silver two piano solos steal show even his piano fills during magnificent percy heath ' walking bass ' section exceptional . worth entire cd !! don't miss this ! " tune up " " smooch " ( mingus ' amazing pianism double stops ) also great , but gem " four " . few times history jazz music so much wonderful stuff so little time than " four " . totally mesmerizing . i absolutely love miles ' solo , ultra hip clever horace silver piano solo , blakey wonderful rimshot groupings . wow ! afterthought : song " tune up " later received legendary extended wonderful performance sonny rollins one his own cds . mingus also displays more his piano work his solo piano cd " mingus plays piano " . buy all three enjoy overlap	1

this 2nd album punk legends not universally acclaimed when it appeared 1979 . short intro poppy day ( lyrics poem john mccrae ) sets gothic tone join hands , extending boundaries banshees ' unique punk strain . here they prove slow , melodic songs equally effective evoking sense menace . playground twist classic early siouxsie , but it gets even better mother/oh mein papa , successful experiment where juxtaposed words lullaby medley create sinister feel eerie buildup music . other songs like regal zone placebo effect more reminiscent debut album , powerful guitar siouxsie piercing vocals . icon premature burial quite dark gothic probably served inspiration later goth bans like bauhaus . original album ended cacophonic bang lord prayer medley which includes phrases o claire de la lune/mon ami pierrot , chilling tomorrow belongs me ( movie cabaret ) sundry other sources . this re-release includes two new tracks , which classic love void far best . join hands more varied than their debut album scream , therefore worthy follow-up , perhaps one their more underrated works .	1

this cd 1985 most powerful new band i heard mid-80 . period i consider very dry real melody , voice twang without synths . even my favorites , dylan , petty , springsteen name few . place over production . this only really great lone justice release . short lived their originality , lone justice band disc one best soon titled , alt-country items around . los lobos'quot;by light moonquot ; runs close second but fact maria mckee so young ( 19 ) this band so raw real , just good concert . made them hopeful antithesis digital soundscape saturating radio time . i think this timeless	1
bowie loved this band . when their lack success almost broke them up , he came produced this album them . this 1972 masterpiece put them up there likes . rex ziggy stardust bearers musical movement loosely called glam rock . imagine glamed out rolling stones . they not goofy like slade or artsy like roxy music or bowie . they just right . like new york dolls , they trashy attitude . unlike dolls , they knew how play their instruments . bonus material great . demo version " one boys " out sight	1
career full vastly dissimilar masterpieces , small change one those handful waits albums markedly stands out rest . this only waits ' fourth album , continuing his evolution into ravaged-voiced , drunken nighhawk beat poet came into fruition his previous record , nighthawks diner . but this time around , waits merges this persona set truly moving , melodically rich diverse tunes . albums immediately following this one ( foreign affairs particular ) , waits ' character beginning show signs stagnation , empty role playing . but 1975 , this record , none these signs wear come through . what left completely unique compelling atmosphere , excellent songs compliment . ' tom traubert blues ' arguably greatest thing here , one waits ' most recognizable songs one his most moving lyrics , not mention phenomenal melody . elsewhere , all sides early waits spot , hilarious beat-rap poet , desolate drunken piano balladeer , sinister storyteller ; all them place here , arguably their pinnacle . if you interest early waits , small change or more accessible , gorgeous ' closing time ' places start . 1970 , waits also major innovator within rock roll genre ( he more famously 1980 ) , but efforts such this go slightly un-noticed due more familiar efforts such ' rain dogs ' . small change deserves listen anyone who digs tom waits .	1
reading lazy reviews always gets my blood pumping enough sit down what bill hicks night night out ; tell truth . rant minor not only funniest comedy album ever but it also most cathartic experience available purchase . bill continues represent , even 12 years after his death , something sadly lacking comedy these days brute honesty . bill hicks like soccer : most countries seem appreciate material except amercians . could because most americans don't like hear truth ? i always read reviews people complain bill " just ranting , it not funny " , etc . what makes bill material so absolutely hilarious he audacity himself . he true original who saw world through sunglasses no other human ever worn . why can't we laugh how f*cked up world through comedic medium ? why must we inundated soul-sucking , lifeless , company men like jeff foxworthy who continue dumb down homoginize comedy ? bill hicks always find new audience through generations , like lenny bruce before him , simply brave enough telling it like it ( ) . main difference hicks bruce , though , hicks funny beyond belief ! hicks wasn't afraid pour his heart out audience , showing us his sensitive side , his profound side any other side he . because this honesty , his true self shone through god it gloriously funny ! " rant " particular , he allows us laugh until we cry such when he goes off jay leno his doritos shilling ways . how could anyone not find rush limbaugh bit funny ?? good god , people , lighten up , open up your third eye ( bill recommended ) listen this album again . again . again . i fortunate enough see bill perform this very material before he died 1993 . my memories night always me i experienced one true visionaries original talents this world ever seen .	1

virgin black darkest band i've found whose music lyrics address spiritual crisis without mocking it . while lot metal sounds like heat killing , this band sounds like hour later , when we stop look dead all around us . if you've heard saviour machine , virgin black moves slower heavier direction . " opera de romanci " opens cello gregorian chant promising darkness come . " embrace " makes good it dose slow metal orchestration worthy film score . virgin black strikes great balance , alternating " funeral metal " orchestration . " walk without limbs " starts cool beat , like bachman turner overdrive " takin ' care business " . then it changes gears into industrial-rock sound unusual this band . " your beauty " finally puts rowan london operatic voice front . his voice exceptional lyrics pull listener into place where it always 4 a.m. , winter never quite yields spring . " drink midnight hymn " jumps out speakers dose speed metal shrieking akin mayhem . this cd following " elegant ... dying " , songs change speeds modes often . samantha escarbe plays guitar restraint , valuing songs over solos . " museum iscariot " three-part suite lot variety , less intensity than some tracks before after . " lamenting kiss " semi-industrial beat opening chant sounds like train siren losing strength distance . then london voice takes lead again . " poet tears porcelain " powerful finale - escarbe finally busts out some fierce guitar melodies . metal cuts off abruptly , leaving brief chanted melody end whole thing . image i get this album someone lying down stone altar dark , eyes open , waiting	1
star sailor satisfied my need some new tunes new releases coldplay radiohead it so well i nearly like them better . this album complaints sounding same throughout , but it strength . i loved every song . this album didn't leave my cd player few weeks end i singing out loud each every song . my favorites " silence easy , " " born again , "" some us , " " fidelity , " but heck they all so good i could include every one them . great album , polished crystal clear . if you like coldplay or radiohead you'll like these guys . however , band comparisons don't them justice . one my top 5 albums year	1
fan this band i already knew some stuff i heard this first time . 1996 i bought this cd , first it bit different i left cd quiet , but there day which i picked up cd heard it really understood how great it . you listen five parts row so you able build mental picture create environment short version stop you . it great	-1

sonic youth one more influential revered bands last 20 years . they rightfully known godfathers indie rock . i think no other band consistently putting out quality music long sonic youth . some bands manage string together 2 or 3 good albums , but then tend fade into obscurity , break-up , or start suck . amazingly , sonic youth yet succumb any those fates . they occasional slump ( mid-to-late 90 ) , yet they still here- producing worthwhile , quality albums . my mind , their creative peak late 80's; when they put out amazing trilogy `evol ' , `sister ' , `daydream nation ' . i love this band own every single one their albums . said , `sister ' my favorite . `sister ' initially released sst records 1987 , my mind stands quintessential sonic youth release . there mythic , mystical undercurrent pulling listener thru this delicious album . it hard quantify explain . guitar interplay thurston lee something special- times beautifully melodic , dissonant , violent , loving , ethereal . these songs really speak me . this awesome work open `schizophrenia ' ( you really need hear this song live sometime ) . i like how both kim thurston share vocals this track- something they should more often , which they fact numerous times `sister ' . lyrically this one sonic youth finest efforts , which should no surprise anyone when they realize youth heavily into philip . dick time this album written . feelings insanity , isolation , loneliness , chaos , love pervade `sister'- these all themes which dick intimately familiar . number sonic youth best tracks appear this album . `stereo sanctity ' dissonant , delirious , wonderful . this followed reflective mysterious `pipeline/ kill time ' , which makes use lee poetic lyrics , rolling drums , incredible feedback control . after this amazing track comes `tuff gnarl ' , which ends devastating divinely dissonant guitar frenzy . maintaining momentum , next up `pacific coast highway ' , one kim gordon best tracks- she sounds genuinely scary outset , which serves perfect lead-in more guitar beauty . this stretch here- tracks 4 through 7 , marks one best i heard any album . `cotton crown ' follows `hot wire my heart ' ( which i could've without ) . `cotton crown ' closest thing sonic youth love song , but don't let deter you- i hate love songs . instrumental section middle this song thing beauty power . dissonant guitars never sounded so soothing ( exception my bloody valentine loveless ) . `white cross ' follows this gem , ending album rocking note . `master-dik ' actually ends this version `sister ' ( i don't think it original sst version ) . `master-dik ' very tongue-in-cheek sonic youth take hip hop , complete lots distorted guitars even kiss sample . if you only familiar recent sonic youth , you find yourself wishing they would rock out more , than you need this album . this probably youth most rocking album . guitar blistering throughout . all though it blistering , distorted , dissonant ; it highly soothing quite trance inducing times . guitar interplay here paved way amazing sonics exhibited their next album , undisputed masterpiece- `daydream nation ' . song writing `sister ' some their best- cosmically poetic mystically enchanting . this , conjunction otherworldly music make fascinating listen . if you like sonic youth , but yet get this album , you must so immediately . if you only familiar major label youth ( post-goo ) , then you must immediately get this incredible album . finally , if you curious sonic youth , but yet delve into their daunting catalogue , this might not best place start . `goo ' `daydream nation ' might better jumping off points . however , if you musically adventurous , guitarist , or fan interesting rock , you most likely love this wonderfully dissonant work . after many years , hundreds upon hundreds cd vinyl albums , `sister ' remains one my favorites .	1
it hard review music . it very personal thing . all i say i like this cd lot . only issue it only 5 songs . i wish i would searched itunes first . it there only $4.95 . so if your into itunes you save $7.00 ( if you include price shipping cd	1
i bought this few months ago listened it many times since then , so i think my opinion pretty " cooled off " or objective . but i guess doesn't matter anyways , because i still think just highly it when i first popped it . basically , if you tortoise fan , this no-brainer ( 3 cds ! dvd ! startlingly good price ! ) . it gives you really broad look their " earlier " sound , which put me off when i first listened some their older stuff 16 , but my taste developed , my appreciation grew point where i actually like this style more than their newest stuff(like standards , it all around you ) . some tracks definately more experimental , but you just appreciate them what they . tracks variety , i especially like " whitewater " " cobwebbed . " they kind melodic ambient ... you could compare them some aphex twin .... but they their own " cool " it . remixes also great . nobukazu takemura remix tnt really sweet ... way he manipulates droning windchimes end it give sound such depth space evokes epic withdrawn mood , where you just kind melt away . i think some ancient japanese ritual when i hear it , but that just me . i won't even begin describe unreal energy opener , " gamera . " then there dvd . some music videos kind weak my opinion , but others fantastic , kind funny bizarre . it rad see them play gamera live , when it new song mid-90s . all all , this great collection . i recently chance see them troubador la , which further solidified them my mind remarkable band . i wouldn't miss out this one	1

all three anthology albums outstanding . this second three . these songs middle their career . like anthology 1 , there many outtakes unfinished songs well . personally this my favorite era beatles music , so this my personal favorite three . real love opens cd finally finished after several years vault . its good hear beatles 2 songs after 26 years apart . there many songs note , i am simply going hit highlights . you've got hide your love away minor changes sounds very much like original , only difference again it unfinished not ending way we hear it cd . you also hear paul walking band through very early version yesterday . it so new before song he instructing john george what chord progression . lyrics finished . only difference we dont hear cellos violins they later used . there also very good version norweign wood catch your attention . it much more sitar than recording we know . taxman also note , again very much like original , third verse added harmony note . got get you into my life early stages not horns added later . i'm only sleeping played acoustic guitar its early stages well . strawberry fields shows progression song acoustic guitar finished project . evolution this song very interesting . day life its very early stages also it shows you how george martin able put song together stages . there also songs show beatles laughing during recording such your bird sing . i only hit highlights . any beatles collector needs buy this well other two anthology album	-1
i don't generally listen what described progressive/art rock , but i may change . dredg catch without arms one most enjoyable albums i own listen . every single song good . some better than others , but this one few records i know i really like every single song . they're all good different reasons . dredg combines strong music , beautiful singing , hard riffs all into formula that hard me resist . " ode sun " starts album well , high rising vocals cool instrumentation . it followed single " bug eyes " , which strong alternative rock song . " not simple " probably my favorite song catch without arms . it great chorus tune after second third refrains sucks me . it ends strangely , child singing chorus later song album what sounds like recording telephone conversation . next song , " zebraskin " , most unique . it not kind song i usually like but some reason it works . rest album folds out similar fashion . it all fairly different sounding , well sung , well performed , quality rock music . it not kind stuff that everyone , but i can't really ask more enjoyable album . i still yet find perfect artist , but if every record like this i'd extremely happy	1

next " indigo girls , " this remains my favorite cd amy emily . " three hits " elegiac " cedar tree , " emotional weight " rites passage " seemed greater than any their other records . much i liked dire straits ' original version " romeo juliet , " amy raw exuberance won me over their cover keeps . they also kept up their social barometer . pro-peace " galileo " ( harmonies jackson browne david crosby ) called nuclear disarmament during time when protest songs weren't particular norm . " jonas ezekiel " prays peace middle east ( funny how problem remains timely now it 1992 ) . there also line " let it me " rings out pure folk : " president no good idea who masses . well i'm one them among my friendstrying see beyond fences our own backyards . " political personal mesh throughout " rites passage . " " ghosts " beautiful love song cries tolerance . it probably ranks among my favorite ig songs . " chickenman " " airplane " also explore their southern roots ( i could sworn " chickenman " rem song first time i heard it ) . re-master " rites " first rate well . it brings out definition acoustic instruments . " romeo juliet " now explodes stereo . while i also admit , i really don't think live cuts add anything cd whole . i continue recommend " rites passage " pinnacle indigo girls ' career	-1
my admiration this lady grows album album ( or disc disc if you ) . she states notes , it not simply singler plus band but integration musicians , each excelling what he or she best . fact , playing individuals lends better , deeper , more satisfying sound . sound pure professionalism - no slurred words , chaotic drums , random bass chords or meandering searching over keys . arrangements themselves matched only voice which only described magnificent . i really liked choice songs . ms. sutton artistic niche reinterpreting works others - whether it once wordless melodies ( quot ; unsung heroesquot ;) , frank sinatra ( quot ;d ancing darkquot ;) or bill evans ( this work ) . each every venture work genius i mean true genius . ok , what stands out this one ? quot ; turn out lightsquot ; pure emotion , dripping sensuality . version quot ; autumn leavesquot ; its sonata-like movements just sensational . quot ; just you just mequot ; duet drummer ray brinker - tour de force . he major player quot ; old devil moon . quot ; quot ; you night musicquot ; mysterious , captivating work totally succeeds . i could go each every selection but suffice it say this one recording i almost order you purchase ... now ... soon possible .	1

purchasing this limited edition import cd comes my personal guarantee you transported back days when things so much easier because lines drawn more clearly those who enlightened those who not . it pity it took 35 years me discover this band ... * every * song transports you " era " when where we thought we going change world combining drugs music . few efforts late-1960s hold up close scrutiny because studio excesses molded music into rigid format . i promise ( excuse me : guarantee ) golden dawn fresh today it 1968 . dare i say their work seminal ? probably not because i am authority 1960s ; but , there something here transcends decades fills heart joy brain marvelous visions	1
tony desare not frank sinatra knock off like some current crop 20 30 something male crooners . he original , he talented , marvelous crystal clear voice . not only he sing he also plays cool jazz piano . this album not depend standards sell it singer , there only two standards cd he sings , " just time " " this could start something big " , which like title last song , it . mr desare talent besides singing playing , he wrote most songs this cd . " chance my heart " new standard he performs it magic . there third standard cd he plays piano roaring twenties , but not sing " five foot two " his playing out this world it other songs make up this cd . while michael buble recycles same old trite songs his cd ad nauseam , mr. desare swings his own rhythm , ryhme , playing . truly wonderful singer his own style young male crooners imitating years come	1
i bought " where sun never go down " found it " nice " . fine singing , nice arrangements , but very concert-like , very correct , uninspired , except " twelve gates city " . possibilities cut made me buy this cd , there no doubt guys got it right this time . this fine gospel singing you hear . if you think dixie hummingbirds or golden gate quartet or abyssinian church choir or aretha franklin james cleveland " precious memories " , this cd place right up there recordings those luminaries	1

this just great cd ! not too hard not too soft	1
all records post-punk , grunge or whatever era , this one blends so many things together it one most unique hard-hitters era . lyrics border bizarre observations some darker realities our world , but enough humour you really can't take anything too seriously . music so hard-hitting ways few other people ever , yes , like so many other reviews , it aged nicely . few bands touch this , period . patton soaring vocals range inspiration empowerment like few others . all sounds crashing together so well make me wish i'd caught these guys live during tour this masterpiece . also , like many other reviewers , this among my all-time favorites	1
really good record .. definitely one those needs your collection	-1
ok ok ok , raymond douglas davies fellow below , obviously state sex bad obscene . but this music , shouldnt taken literally ! how else this world evolved reproduce itself past how-ever-many-thousands years ! james had/has audience please he didnt just reach goal , he shattered it this offering . i stated before , its james brown ! godfather soul . enjoy .	1

2nd yes album , 1970 " time word , " saw band add some orchestral arrangements some their songs . some fans turned off it , even yes themselves now say they don't think orchestral touches album worked completely ( band would not take orchestral accompanyment again until 2001 " magnification " ) . personally , i'm not bothered one bit orchestral flourishes . they don't * bury * band , heaven sake , i think they enhance songs they're used very well . yes themselves still main attraction throughout " time word , " album excellent . it features several my personal favorite yes songs , such amazing cover richie havens ' " no opportunity necessary , no experience needed , " captivating sounds " then , " perfect pop-rock " sweet dreams , " supremely powerful rock " astral traveller " ( killer guitar riff peter banks ) , great beauty closing title track . band top form " time word , " they also say goodbye guitarist banks , who would replaced longtime guitarist steve howe shortly after album release ( so shortly , fact , original us album cover features group photo howe , even though banks guitarist album ! ) . i've always loved " time word . " it very strong yes album , i highly recommend it .	1

first it kind sounds good , but then track 2 starts it same piano riff same thing all tracks . after while it hard tell whether you listening different song , or if track 3 reprise tracks 1 2 . i guess if you like it then you like whole thing , because whole album sounds like comp same jam .	-1
i listened this set songs sung boxwell sisters i love there music . my favorite happens shuffle off buffalo . this song resonates me very much . if you wanted listen one talented , exemplary female singing group besides this one then i would highly recommend andrew sisters . these lady singers harmonized very well each other . i loved there songs like rum coca cola ; i remember mama too fat polka	1

" lifesong " casting crowns second studio effort . title track starts things off powerful light rock message . there , " praise you storm " slower , powerful song accepting all trials tribulations thrown your way still managing thank god them ( think job ) . it my favorite song album it timely song well considering recent onslaught hurricanse last year . " anybody hear her " strong song this album . my second favorite song , " stained glass masquerade , " speaks volumes . hypocrites run rampant throughout every church , this song addresses them . rest album just strong these first few , especially " while you sleeping . " if you've never heard casting crowns before , they lot like mercy me even matt redman . also , lead vocalist , mark hall , very steven curtis chapman-like sound his voice . lot music here reminds me chapman during mid 90 . overall , wonderful album any fan light rock bands such mercy me . highly recommended	-1
history music there few people i consider geniouses . pete ham one them . while quality this disc not perfect final badfinger cut , it still good , all things considered . my personal favorite quot ; ringsidequot ; , which beautiful melody , combined chilling parallel pete life . this disc would worth it song only	-1
joe bonamassa sophmore effort holds few surprises . first slight shift musical direction . much like jeff healey , joe opted less overt blues approach his second album . result 62 minutes powerful rock focus original songwriting , strong hooks , broader musical landscape . both bonamassa guitar playing vocals undeniably sensational , his band tight unrelenting ever . their spectacular performances run gamot hard edged grooves ( " lie #1 " , " no slack " ) , lighter acoustic shades ( " waiting me " , " never say goodbye " , " mountain time " ) , searing guitar ( " pain sorrow " ) , hard rock ( " takin ' hit " , " hard way " ) , few points . those fans looking more straight forward blues tunes , i'm afraid only title track offers this form mid-tempo shuffle . but aside , this fantastic album , its own would worthy four stars . but that where second surprise comes . originally , when i bought this year ago , amazon listed second disk dvd " new day yesterday - live " . since all information offered i assumed it promo clip showing joe band performing title track his debut album . what this actually phenominal full length live performance taped back december 21 , 2001 while touring behind " new day yesterday " . this blinding show displays bonamassa blazing chops mind-numbing tone tee . i've played this thing more times than i count , it good . fact , i so impressed i actually bought same wine red les paul classic joe starts show ( yes i know ... insane . but you guitar players out there know exactly what i'm talking ) . here're details : cradle rock - steppin ' out/rice pudding - new day yesterday - miss you hate you - walk my shadows - i know where i belong - color shape - trouble waiting - if heartaches nickels - don't burn down bridge - guitar solo - you experienced ? - cry today . total performance runs around 1 hour 52 minutes . extras include music video miss you , hate you 5-6 minute vh1-style bio . there also photo gallery . dvd itself easily worth five stars . i know there lot fans out there who very strict views blues/rock guitarists what they should shouldn't . if you feel you fit into this category you might not like cd so much but i think you'll love dvd . it certainly delivers everything you're looking ( assuming you enjoy live concert dvd course ! ) . if your tastes bit broader , i think this 2 disk set grand slam twice price . absolutely .	1

i purchased this album upon its release years ago , it still one my favorites . music simply not date ... partially because maire brennan crafted such beautiful album otherworldly timeless partially because instrumentation traditional , primitive , but exciting . i still believe this her best solo effort ( even though i love all her albums ) . brennan clan ( including enya bridin ) all amazing vocalists songwriters . grateful their talents	1
bridge , album plays absolutely no testament band whose ability far superceedes this pile [ garbage ] . i listening bt 15 years now , seeing them doing live shows jersey area late 80 . if you want great album , buy " save his soul , " dont waste your time this garbage . im sorry bobby . dead , he truly backbone this band , listen any early stuff his bass clearly prominent . its shame	-1
there not enough " good songs " this cd warrant purchase . besides , 80s not really time " hard rock classics " ... oh , sure , there few , but 80s dominated androgynous " synth " players ... it really crappy time music . course , there police , pretenders , blue oyster cult , ozzy , but i'm sorry , those " hair bands " ... gross ... even van halen fizzled . you could say , " but john , whadda ' 1984' ? " what it ? it wasn't " diver down " or " women children first " or even " van halen " ( incredible 1978 debut album ) ... no , 80s music stunk most part . i think saddest song this whole album " lick it up " ... you lick it up , you it ... i used kiss posters my walls , man ... i used dress up like gene simmons halloween . song just made me ill . just thinking ... ewww ... i just don't want go there . so , please ... save your money . all you kiddies who going " retro " thinking 80s put out some good stuff , save your money or if you spend some money , buy anything led zeppelin , doors , or alman brothers you'll spending wisely music outlast whatever phase you currently into . peace blessings , children ..	-1

you won't find africa or rosanna this album . there no sappy love jingles included this release . trademark 80 pop sound make many dismiss toto expendable fad 1982 nowhere found . credit , if you want , new bass player mike porcaro , who replaced david hungate shortly after release toto iv . or you give it new lead singer fergie fredricksen , who seemed take full control band when he replaced bobby kimball ' 83 . whatever case , you give band credit not getting caught up success iv ; deciding still experiment new sounds . result 80 rock it finest . david paich steve porcaro great together keyboards . steve lukather great always guitar . jeff porcaro talents finally utilized their full potential . , course , fergie voice well-suited . while their follow-ups : ' fahrenheit ' ' seventh one ' both good , they don't quite match up . notoriety , however , come short this album , seeing it only spawned one top 30 ' stranger town ' , which also critically acclaimed music video . but , don't let this one slip !	1

my opinion , slayer first five albums all easily 5 star thrash metal classics should without doubt every metalheads catalog . there somthing this album just really drew me . one thing definitely darker , haunting tones they went album . it definitely slower than slayer previous albums , but it darker , more unique style it . guitars really seem heavier than ever this album , almost like sludge/doom metal still all thrash elements , including insane double bass drumming always mr. lombardo . tom araya voice much clearer " south " he doesn't sing nearly fast like previous efforts when it sometimes incredibly hard make out what he saying . he definitely adds more melody structure his voice . also , there not quite much talk demons , satan , violence . course , there still quite bit it . come , this slayer we're talkin ' here . you expect some . slayer songs still pretty short . title track longest clocking just under 5 minutes . my personal favorites here course classics- south heaven , mandatory suicide , also spill blood behind crooked cross . spill blood really something new slayer . it haunting/dark acoustic intro . which i absolutely love . it extremely unique , especially slayer . araya started writing majority lyrics also this album , always axe slingers , kerry king jeff hanneman wrote musical parts . no mediocre tracks appear here , but if i choose i would say judas priest cover song , dissident aggressor cleanse soul would my least favorites . whole album flows very smoothly together . every song it place no songs out place here . everthing goes together just right . so if you'd like hear slayer bit darker , sludgier tone it , pick up south heaven . this would 2nd last album their incredible/classic lineup until dave lombardo would leave replaced exceptional paul bostaph . if you don't slayer album or haven't heard much them , i reccomend this , reign blood , or seasons abyss	1
this album bangin just like all d.j. quik albums my favorite song quot ; jus lyke bomptonquot ; if you nice system your car it your favorite too . i don't know why fool tim dogg tried diss homie quik but who cares because more people know quik then some clown named tim dogg	1
run pack ( 1976 . ) bad company third album . 1976 , bad company really beginning make name themselves . group , which combined free paul rodgers simom kirke , king crimson boz burell , mott hoople mick ralphs , showing excellent classic rock alliance showed no signs letting down anytime soon . band first two albums nothing short excellent , no classic rock fan deny it . what would come next band ? 1976 , group released its third album , run pack . how would it measure up comparison its predecessors - better or worse ? read my review . i personally thought straight shooter bit step down bad company debut ( though still good album ) , but any feelings i may band quality diminishing shattered run pack . this , my opinion , classic bad company formation ultimate album . although it didn't many hits , say , band 1974 debut , quality music nothing less . this album captures band prime no other . starting things off classic rock anthem live music , which unquestionably one finest tunes group ever recorded . simple man honey child lighter numbers no less excellent , show off those amazing vocals only paul rodgers . then we get title track , which minor hit . this song classic rock masterpiece , combining elements harder classic rock more melodic ones - even employing some orchestral arrangements . after we go right into album big hit , silver blue gold . bad company actually recorded quite few ballads , but this one just might best bunch . combining melodic song structure elements classic pop-rock , band succeeded creating masterpiece . strangest album track comes next - it cover old coasters song young blood . i serious doubts band covering coasters , but my doubts shattered when i heard song . though not best work here , it still solid - it kills coasters versions dead . closing out album several underrated bad company tunes you're not likely hear radio any time soon , including masterful fade away . bad company created six awesome albums paul rodgers frontman , this one remains best bunch my book . i don't see how anyone call this " decline " band ! bad company albums got remastered reissued , but sadly remastered versions nothing special . you get remastered sound but nothing else . no expanded liner notes , no bonus tracks , no twofers ... which blows . there many rare non-lp bad company tracks would made great bonuses ( many which bonus cuts anthology . ) this doesn't change my feelings album all , but bad company albums deserve better treatment ! run pack flat out rules . bad company never sounded this good before never would again . however , starting this album , band would begin downward slide off pop charts - though their music would remain good , they would forgotten due changing musical trends world . run pack ultimate bad company album . admittingly , this bit more aquired taste than band self-titled debut ( which where new fans should start ) , but if you're tried true bad company fan , buy this one . you not regret it . just give it some time grow you before you judge it	1
there three people who responsible " resurrection " goldberg variations , least far general publicis concerned : wanda landoska , rosalyn tureck , glenn gould . without them , goldberg variations certainly would not get attention they , may ended up curiosity music students discover budget labels performers seeking overblown romantic interpetations or sterile " period correct " ( other words , uninformed ) performances leave listeners yawning . instead , thanks those three , goldberg well know even casual music listener beethoven pathetique or mozart rondo la turka . now , i certainly believe landowska rendition most well informed , even most revolutionary terms true period correctness ( she first record it harpsichord correct baroque ornamentation ) , she musicality made listener believe they listening orchestra instead just single keyboardist . tureck interpretation so dancelike pleasant . it sounds so free happy , i get image there dancers keys her piano . she really one showed goldberg variations could performed piano without reverting overly romanticized versions dominated up time . it landowska tureck two allowed what arguably most famous interpretation goldbergs : glenn gould 1955 recording . inspired landowska passion early music right , tureck justified piano performance stood out head shoulders above others , gould combined best elements two added his own rhythmic dynamic perfection create masterpiece recording . his tempi ( general ) nearly twice fast most performers ' , indeed his own 1981 recording , which , places , i prefer ( refer variations 1 , 5 , 10 , 14 , 16 , 29 ) , yet he always control never sounds like he straining get next note . his staccato light touch give it wonderful bell-like clarity , it closest you'll get harpsichord recording piano . yes , his 1981 recording more mature , but it difference interpretation than technical prowess , i think choice two comes down mood , even , mentioned above , individual variations . this recording his first studio recording , presenting all fire passion twenty three year old showing world he got something prove . odd choice first recording , most pianists would probably forced into some half-hearted renditions chopin or mozart , but gould knew what he doing . he must known time right bach interpretation paid homage greatness achieved past well one strode confidently into future , future where ( philosophy like landowska ) old music no longer quaint but revered modern music didn't seek " revolutionize " but instead sought build upon . this increasingly prevalent attitude 1950 1960 thanks people like landowska , harnoncourt , , course , gould . we see this philosophy durufle , de falla ( one first twentieth century composers write harpsichord ) , later stravinsky . gould goldbergs played no small part baroque new birth . yourself favor get both gould goldbergs , wanda landowska goldbergs , perhaps koroliov goldbergs or tatiana nikolayeva goldbergs . you'll quite glad you	1
if you really like gospel music don't waste your money this cd . these beautiful hymns deserve better treatment . flat uninspired generous description this cd	-1
okay , previous ( negative ) reviewers all pointed out how this album not technical or original their earlier work . recently acquired progressive fear i kiss burning darkness , i'll agree slaughter soul monolithic tempo , repeated riffs conventional rock song structure don't match up weird , almost hiccupy changes tempo , odd song structures , constantly changing guitar riffs moments shear silence previous album . there nothing blazingly original here " raped light christ " or " non divine . " indeed these guys just don't -do- much three minutes they before . but what this album lacks technicality progressiveness ( proginess ? ) i'd argue it makes up its sheer melodic/harmonic catchiness , catchiness leaves gates ' brutality untouched . it achievement i think only one other band achieving metal history , one , like gates , flirted mainstream success but never quite made it : testament , their first album , legacy . no , gates don't sound like testament , but combination catchy melodic/harmonic hooks aggression what made legacy so great ( alex skolnic guitar solos , course ) . legacy , fairly monolithic pace slaughter soul makes it unrelenting its assault . far making it less brutal , catchiness this album even enhances brutality boring dark riffs relentless rhythm into your subconscious . this , wonderfully agonized vocals just-fuzzy-enough production make album quite atmospheric , evoking inklings some combination despair homicidal frenzy . it not nearly claustrophobic , frenzied or despairing greats black or doom metal like esoteric weakling , but songs catchier more accessible thus atmosphere rubs off you more easily . but then you'd hope it'd brutal much looking track list . speaking which , if you don't want read album detail , skip end this review . when i say something `great ' or awesome , i mean it simply sounds good . i admitted before , this not very technical album . standout tracks " blinded fear " wonderful opening track you ask this album . after suitably ominous electronic fuzz spoken-word clip it establishes driving rhythm album its dark atmosphere great guitar riffing . there very brief bridge/solo last minutes , but it extremely brief doesn't make this song any ' slower ' or more subtle while giving it melodic edge such blunt instrument would normally lack . 5 stars " slaughter soul " starts off very short , heavy intro section before going into song proper . this every other song album nutshell . things always changing enough you don't get bored , but not so much you can't follow them . there really great interplay two guitars so they compliment each other rather than dueling total over-the-top metal fashion . 4 stars " cold " features great solo more fabulous guitar work , point it stands above other excellent material album . 5 stars " into dead sky " nice quiet instrumental interlude musical blows face . it not great itself but it fits perfectly . 4 stars " need " my opinion best song album . nice varied , going melody melody brutal guitar riffs until it fades out , almost serenely , into single glockenspiel over silence . so yeah . 11 catchy , brutal tracks together make one most accessible most influential albums 90 . addition their gothenburg contemporaries successors it massive impact metalcore-listen darkest hour mark judas you can't hope but hear shadow this album . terms making serious metal accessible , this album knows few peers save legacy testament sham mirrors arcturus . indeed , i'd say this album gates invented pop death metal , which no mean feat . i don't recommend this if you require your metal extremely technical ( opeth ) or experimental ( ephel duath ) nor if you prefer it so raw it sounds like it recorded bear cave some scandinavian forest ( burzum , leviathan ) or so brutal it makes you're eardrums bleed ( pig destroyer ) . but if you like metal you like good conventional rock songwriting , this treat	1

simply astounding album . elvis costello his height popularity courage eplore his personal favorites bring them his " new wave " audience . unfortunately his audience so influenced stalinistic " year zero " /scorched earth attitudes class ' 77 punk they pretty much rejected this amazing sampler heartfelt country soul .

whether you're fan new doctor who tv series or not , if you enjoy soundtracks this album excellent buy . murray gold cinematic-style orchestral arrangments range dramatic eerie wistful . i like this album playing while i type , read , or work other creative projects since it inspirational without distractions lyrics . also included two " apocryphal " radio pop songs , " love don't roam " " song ten , " written specifically program . both stand their own merits quite well , provide fans in-jokes series itself -- only downside " song ten " re-recorded version , rather than one originally played tv series ( which i rather prefer ) . personal faves : haunting " doctor theme , " meditative " impossible planet , " dramatic " dalek " theme , complete alien-language chorus .	1

2002 one interesting year music , " now 11 " very good job conveying . twenty tracks all work together create diverse memorable snap shot summer early fall 2002 . variety series even grows this addition addition country ( dixie chicks ) techno ( dirty vegas ) . you know drill now :( 1 ) nelly " hot herre " . level this song works exceptional , considering its simplistic content . but nelly trademarked " southern flavor " turns it into must hear summer dance/rap song . completely enjoyable every way . ( 2 ) n.o.r.e " nothin '" a- . so simple , yet so enjoyable same time . n.o.r.e. terrific voice " arabian style " background provides very catchy tune . it just may run little long , but still keeps listener interest . ( 3 ) eve feat . alicia keys " gangsta lovin '" . this song lives up everything we expect eve alicia . just like " let me blow ya mind " it loaded style very sexy well . it takes very talented artists pull off song this well . ( 4 ) beenie man feat . janet " feel it boy " b+ . no means classic , this atleast good romantic rap . beenie man relaxed style combined janet smooth voice make this sweet romantic duet . nice look positive side rap . ( 5 ) dirty vegas " days go " . i don't really get techno , yet this song such haunting effect . words beat carry certain dimension stikes within soul . this song doesn't need over top strike our minds . ( 6 ) kylie minogue " love first sight " a- . kylie could sing phone book make it sound great . her voice takes standard song such this rises it nerw levels . this what good dance song should : meaningful infectious same time . ( 7 ) shakira " objection ( tango ) " . latin beat makes this song sucessfull it chosen level , but it could more . shakira makes catchy latin tune alot energy , even if it lacks impact " whenever , wherever " . ( 8 ) no doubt feat . lady saw " underneath it all " . gwen stefani just lays back lets words take over make extremly touching pop song . lyrics so much depth power even when lady saw comes , we don't mind her . one ' 02 best songs career best no doubt . ( 9 ) jennifer love hewitt " barenaked " b- . she terrible actress , but half decent singer . this debut contains some terrific ideas images , yet cops out become standard pop . makes you wish they stayed right track . ( 10 ) vanessa carlton " ordinary day " . this solid ballad just lacks resonance " thousand miles " " pretty baby " . still her voice piano talents make it worth while listen some more strong images . ( 11 ) dixie chicks " landslide " . again , country isn't my cup tea , but this song works me . girls ' make this fleetwood mac song their own add some bluegrass flavor unique acoustic arrangements . ( 12 ) aaliyah " i care 4 u " b+ . relaxing rb track late singer just runs bit too long . her voice just flows so smoothly beat so relaxing song keeps us interested until very end , despite length . ( 13 ) ginuwine " stingy " . yet artist who just lets music flow create wonderful work . this good old fashioned rb tune just makes you feel better its posiitive " story " . ginuwine finds perfect words just combines then beat create masterpiece . ( 14 ) norah jones " don't know why " c+ . what this song doing 2002 ? everything it seems outdated unfinished , like producers just stopped trying . what little substance here lost because listeners put sleep . ( 15 ) chad kroger feat . josey scott " hero " . this song not only perfect fit " spider-man " , but one all heros well . it terific rock track great message finds perfect vehicle message . best rock song best song film 2002 . ( 16 ) hoobastank " running away " b+ . first right step : song appropriate length considering material . second : voices good flow true conviction . third : catchy guitar chords . result : surprisingly effective rock song . ( 17 ) coldplay " my place " b- . nowhere near boring " clocks " , yet same flaws because group love their insturments . certain stretches middle contain enough style keep some interest through this stumbling rock song . ( 18 ) creed " one last breath " a- . usual , creed finds perfect words convey their message utilize some good guitar beats add some depth . it may sound like some their other work , but still gets job very nicely . ( 19 ) our lady peace " somewhere out there " . good rock song just doesn't break out ordinary . track some good material , but falls back standard stuff when it should tightening it all up . if only they some more confidence their work . ( 20 ) bon jovi " everyday " . jon bon jovi proves he still hip ever , while he cranks up energy this pop/rock track . it simple side , yet filled some meaning alot sound fury we get caught up music . bottom line : *** 1/2 . nice sample music 2002 , includes number year best singles . " now " series shows no hints slowing down , demonstates this edition there no limits either .	1

billy joel tenth studio album , " bridge " featured no very big hits highlighted more mellow style songwriting than his normal , catchy , rock-beat songs previous albums . people debated whether he growing old , whether he still what it takes make successful rock song . some even accepted , sure , little bit his flair missing his music more " adult contemporary " , but they'll take it . then came " storm front " . within first fifteen or so seconds first song album , " that not her style " , world knew joel back his old great form . every song showed flavors classic joel : " that not her style " contained infectious , catchy refrain dastardly beat reminiscent " half mile away " " 52nd street " . " we didn't start fire " , though not popular among critics even fans , showed joel still knew exactly what pop industry needed , song bolted #1 billboard charts . " downeaster alexa " displayed joel love storytelling through song , previously seen " scenes italian restaurant " " zanzibar " . " i go extremes " reminded us joel hendrix piano . " shameless " reassured us , even after all those years , billy could still make meaningful , catchy , excellent love song . list goes . every song reminds us , somehow , billy roots pop industry . there no filler this album . everybody likes some songs , dislikes others . but nothing low quality or uninteresting . so whether you buy this album " we didn't start fire " or just because you're interested kind music billy make , just sure buy it . bottom line : " i go extremes " ? " shameless " ? " so it goes " ? monumental pop hit " we didn't start fire " ? how could this not essential ? prepare yourself some best pop-rock all time	1

suzy never achieved level commercial success her talent deserved but she nevertheless built significant fan base america , britain elsewhere . suzy voice echoes emmylou harris ( no bad thing , ) certainly one best country singers her generation - or any generation . drawing suzy nineties recordings capitol , this contains most songs you would expect find . it pity they didn't license her country hit duet lee greenwood ( hopelessly yours ) but if you want it , you find it lee greenwood compilation . this compilation shows suzy could record oldies contemporary material equal brilliance . oldies represented someday soon ( first popularised judy collins but also recorded crystal gayle among others ) , jailhouse now ( old jimmie rodgers classic ) i want cowboy sweetheart ( million-seller patsy montana thirties ) . my favorite oldie recorded suzy ( take it limit ) isn't here but found common thread , eagles tribute album . joy lynn white ( brilliant but obscure country singer ) first record cold day july . suzy covered it few years later but it became better known when covered dixie chicks . elsewhere , there many outstanding songs including just like weather , diamonds tears , give me some wheels , hey cinderella letting go , just name few . if you only ever buy one collection suzy country music , you may well choose this one	1

after triumph ' ziggy stardust ' , david bowie wrote number songs while tour would end up becoming " aladdin sane " album . featuring " spiders mars " band ( guitarist mick ronson , bassist trevor bolder drummer mick woodmansey ) pianist mike garson added mix , bowie compositions found him exploring not only glam sounds he made his own , but also taking older pop forms bringing them into his idiom . nowhere latter illustrated his head first cover " let spend night together " . song taken fiercely uptempo , bowie voice ranting above frantic piano ronson churning rhythm guitar . but embracing doo-wop phil spector style pop clearly illustrated cuts like superb " drive-in saturday " ( one bowie most powerful vocal deliveries record ) " prettiest star " . bowie also tackles blues rock , churning " jean genie " , its snarling lead vocal chugging guitar line . also mix decent take ' 60s rock ( " watch man " ) , something totally bizarre ( indescribable title track , which after decade since i first discovered this album college i still can't make my mind up ) , jagged , frantic fierce moody glam workout ( " panic detroit " ) probably proves real highlight album . bonus disc this set proves nice compliment handful live tracks , rare " sax version " " john , i'm only dancing " ( original version ' ziggy stardust ' limited release ) until recently unheard studio take " all young dudes " bowie . " aladdin sane " end up bit rushed feel -- songs sound like they written tour -- but this lends nice , nervous energy it sort hard describe . bowie cooling off bit this one -- it not quite essential his previous couple albums , but it still fantastic record . recommended	-1

this got best thrash album all time prove it here it well first lyrics just insane unpredictable un-comparable brutality any other album ever realesed period true . second consistency entire album even extra tracks new release never let up i listened alot thrash albums this one never let up somebody say master puppets bla lets up like little **** all over place peace sells same same same same all other albums none consistent . third vocals precision guitar attacks like no other maybe some other bands one or two song hypes but never whole album never never never never like this . finally artwork which just icing cake but very well depict exactly what you going get so there it i proved my point . anyone who disrespects this #1 thrash album all time not thrash fan or just can't swallow somthing so insainly perfect or just jealous moron . until you seen them perform this thing it entirety right front you , you no right criticizing this masterpiece cd great but when it actually played right front you you never expereince precision involved so all underage or jealous fags shut *** up .	1

grateful dead warm-up band janis joplin fillmore east . they two seperate 1 hour shows mostly different audiences . ( bill graham used schedule two complete shows night maximize profits ) . grateful dead , they not any repeats one show next . constrained one hour show , dead played little bit differently than they would normal concert . some songs little truncated . but , some cases , it turns out good interesting thing . i love long , rambling jams , but it good sometimes hear band play tighter , more concise mode . one song really benefits shorter time turn your lovelight . it very energetic there searing guitar highlighted . many other songs also very good . sound quality fair good ( professional standards ) . sound little rough spots . audience noise little high times ( other grateful dead live albums great , because you almost never audience noise interferring music ) . there other grateful dead live cd this time period much better sound . thing i really don't like they included complete concerts . each concert couple minute introduction . included all chatter songs . they even included whole time band down while guitar string changed , so there long period middle cd just silence.at end second show , after we bid you goodnight , there several minute pause , then band breaks into cosmic charlie . 2 minutes into cosmic charlie it sounds like tape went bad , song cut off cd ends . some people love thses complete concerts , everything kept " give you feel concert " . me , i just want enjoy music	-1

some reason , most 1970-1990 mccartney/wings catalogue now available two versions : capitol cds british remastered " mccartney collection " . british cd offer , many cases , more bonus tracks than capitol cd , this release they same though . why not include junior farm ??? remastering british series , my ears , not bonus . signal compressed such way , average level louder than capitol cd , although peaks not . balance changed : low frequencies boosted , resulting somewhat muddy sound less focused midrange . this also affected stereo image . me , capitol cds sonically superior closer original lps . i found remastered sound disappointment , not doing justice obvious care went into original production !	-1
this great cd/dvd package illustrates yet again jh most talented tasteful rocker out there .

my mind this amercian culture masterpiece so don't hesitate buy this album appeals heart , mind ear . if you're misfortune fall into catagory those think journey some phony arena rock/pop music band 80 then you'll also even more misfortune miss out one best live albums all time which showcases band thats roots founded deep within era mid 70 . i just don't think any one band ever mixed blues/jazz music into pop style quite like journey . journey exemplifies beauty american pop music true unique art form its own right . they give us reason proud utter words american pop music . hell even down ancient egyptian scarib they chose their symbol shows how deep there roots go into america which i'm sure most you out there unaware our founding fathers obsession ancient egypt ( read " explodong myths " vol . 1 ) . kudos out sound engineers live recordings found here highest quality .	1
chevelle first album might come shock those initiated more recent albums ( " wonder what next " " this type thinking ( could us " )) , mainly because it sounds like totally different band ! not their new style bad thing , i love chevelle , new sound working them just well , but " point #1 , " their debut , just phenomenal . undiscovered gem . i've this cd since it release 1999 , so listening it provides lot nostalgia me , it holds special place my heart . this album full passion , intensity pure emotion . pete loeffler , guitarist vocalist , shines through thoughtful , often cryptic poetic lyrics , while his voice often echoes maynard james keenan , but it own distinct sound . his brothers , joe sam , back him up bass drums ( respectively ) dynamic three unbelieveable . despite fact they reportedly fight lot , whenever they get together , combination explosive shows music . album begins appropriately titled " open , " two minute instrumental primes you up album , showcases some solid musicianship . song bleeds into next , now classic " point #1 , " which my personal favorite chevelle song all time ( anyone remember creepy video they it ? ) , shows off what chevelle all . album continues fast pace , slowing down briefly emotionally draining beautiful " dos , " but pace picked up more uptempo tracks like " sma " " mia . " lot people tote chevelle tool sound-alikes , but i only hear it pete voice . musically , i always though them more common helmet , displayed songs like " skeptic " " long . " " prove you " one defining moments album , pretty much only song sounds all like what they today . album whole just beautiful . i'm sure many new people discovering this album , due their success , realizing what chevelle all . it may take few listens adjust , especially if you already own newer material , but it album sure very long shelf-life . not many albums made like this anymore , just plain raw , stripped down , pure . that what " point #1 " all , if you love music , this album you	1

i really like this cd , because you hear weariness , wariness , waylon , kris , willie , johnny voices , aging like fine wine or whiskey . song selection especially strong -- " last cowboy song , " their harmonies melding perfectly , captures mythic tone they set out accomplish , . " desperados waiting train " continues theme , " jim i wore tie today " propels message further , love , loss , death constant theme throughout . given whipped-up furor over immigrants news today , standout track me beautiful touching version woody guthrie " deportee ( plane wreck los gatos ) " willie voice chorus , backed johnny rodriguez singing spanish , this easily one best versions this song i've heard . sure , production mid-80s , some synthetic drums keyboard washes i could without , but all this very strong entry these heroes . pick this up road goes forever , " you bookended their legendary career together	-1
though principly known songwriter country artists , jim lauderdale always genre buster , fusing elements country , rock , bluegrass , rhythm blues , folk , 70's-style pop into solid catalog songs . after several promising but inconsistant ( now out print ) solo albums , lauderdale finally hit his stride performer quot ; whisper . quot ; quot ; onward through it allquot ; continues blaze same trail . opener quot ; you just knowquot ; would home dwight yoakam record . title cut definitive jim lauderdale song . quot ; trust ( guiding star)quot ; make you lonely your grateful dead records . quot ; we really shouldn't doing thisquot ; hit george strait . quot ; please san antone , quot ; quot ; almost next nothing , quot ; quot ; still not out woodsquot ; also highlights	1
aside cover ( minor detail but hard ignore compared previous covers ' glory ) this me best record their career . it got all classic elements their sound but takes into account what happened sonically rest music world since key lime pie acts accordingly . fact they push envelope further than most set standard higher than it ever rock music . so it musically serious , even little serious lyrically , but overall it funny enjoyable , even if it little dark times . after hearing these songs live i better understanding where they coming politically . it more subtle than lyrics let , not serious one may think reading review . i mean , it obvious cvb ( whole lot other folks ) against current right-wing atmosphere today , it comes through music , but don't mistake this cd political statement cause it not . it rock roll record dives into fantasy whim such both silly beautiful . even little pissed off . engineering production top notch , record big , full presence pretty close glory their live sound , they put lot effort into making every little corner mix interesting . overall this fantastic record triumphant return , almost like they'd rehearsing secret whole time not split up all these years .	-1

i heard " la negra tomasa " parties whatnot even knew words song . few years later i introduced caifanes , more specifically this album . i loved all tracks , every single one them when i heard " la negra tomasa " i couldn't believe this their song . every single song great meaning poetic way i hadn't heard great while . i immediately fell love caifanes . there out i heard all their songs , bought all their albums then got into jaguares . i'm one their biggest fans now i'm even going go see them concert hollywood september . i know seeing them live absolutely spectacular i'll morph into even bigger fan . i love caifanes/jaguares i love saul angelic voice . i'm not huge rock fan ( though i love mana ) , i'm more into hip hop rb so you know if i like it everyone like it . i haven't heard words so deep endearing long time . i'm so grateful this band came into my life .	1
while one can't argue price this 2-cd set , one wonders why all these redundant compilations dusty music necessary ? , since most them released after her untimely death 1999 , there certain aroma crass cashing serving what this writer calls necrophiliac music market . it seems every time musician dies , their record sales skyrocket . it happened elvis , janis joplin , jimi hendrix , jim morrison , et al . other words , who raking this dough ? certainly not late great artist . , therein lies tragic irony dusty springfield . it would appear dusty more albums released after her way too early demise than she ever life . this but one many postmortem compilations floating around . while song choices cover just every phase dusty 40-year career , including her early days springfields , their chronology totally ignored . why this album doesn't begin springfields ' tracks followed dusty first solo hit " i only want you " defies logic . why first disc ends kurt weill-esque " soft core " second disc begins insipid , non-dusty hit " close you " but one example disjointed , herky-jerky musical progression this album . no prevailing theme no natural segues , this album leaves listener confused unsatisfied . this writer gave it 4 stars only because it dusty . however , if you're truly springfield aficionado , might i suggest you pay extra money purchase brilliant 4-disc compilation , " simply dusty " - nearly 100 track , well-thought-out , chronological remastered compilation dusty finest work . dust one 20th century most gifted vocalists/musicians . while this album give listener more than glimpse her incredible talent , way this set organized not accord new dusty springfield fan opportunity hear how dusty grew changed artist . " simply dusty " tells whole story - this set merely disjointed fragments fantastic talent life work .	-1

there many brilliant moments within this recording including some solos , but use too much brass organ give it too much ' production number ' feel . { my experience messiah includes singing it stage carnegie hall avery fisher hall ~ 30 times total among other venues - bass section member . } while not true purist all choral members male [ ala boy sopranos altos ... ] harpsichord , limited brass fairly small orchestra better suited baroque music renditions which supposed emotive , evocative spiritual . this rendition just too far into big , brassy bassy better zone !	-1

neville marriner first recording messiah , recorded 1976 , without doubt his best recording work . marriner recorded handel most famous oratorio his academy st. martin fields decca , it not confused later german language version munich emi , or 1992 live concert ( philips ) soloists who not level 1976 decca recording . marriner takes generally fast , refreshing tempos choruses keeps light texture , but he knows where slow down , academy players so good : sync marriner every nuance tempo fluctuation ( these few , but sometimes music calls slight changes tempo or expression . ) " unto us child born " most satisfying i've heard , it really moves , yet never seems rushed . all soloists excellent , really understanding handel style writing voice , meaning text , drawn old new testaments bible . they not operatic voices , but more attuned intimate side late baroque oratorio . keep mind , though , intimate not mean " namby pamby " or " wimpy . " choruses very hearty indeed , heft orchestra always appropriate big moments , yet never sacrificing grace big sound . this also complete messiah , bargain 2 discs . ormandy bernstein ( both sony ) not complete , but really extended excerpts . if you must period instruments , try hogwood/academy ancient music ( l'oiseau lyre , 1980 , boys/men choir ) or gardiner/english baroque soloists ( philips , 1982 ) . but marriner my mind best , he blends both worlds : chamber choir orchestra , but modern instruments . recorded sound terrific : highest recommendation	1

" i don't hurt anymore " also favorite other recording artists . it testament appeal hank snow his songs . 1962 " i've everywhere " crossover hit . hank snow also made soulful rendition floyd tillman " i almost lost my mind " . there very little filler here nothing not like . i recommend it	-1
this very nice cd collection i enjoy very much . they original recordings so you aware couple older songs sound scratchy just like they when you put record record player . it shame they couldn't get crisper sound all new technology but it make you aware how sound quality improved over years . this would make great gift anyone over 50 . i put mine car just sing away before i know it i am my destination . this would great collection take trip .	-1
this cd great its powerful rock sound . lyrics sound great music awesome ! i love " cornerstone " , " fade away " , " rain song " , " jacob dream " . only thing could made this cd little better add couple more songs , total length cd only 35:51 , but i guess we'll just wait their next cd hear more . this cd real strong sound , though , just shouldn't missed	1

definitely , they better stuff . 10,000 hz legend much better whole , but this album some my favorite songs . " venus " great opening track . very subtle , perhaps little monotonous , but i like piano chord progression . " cherry blossom girl " acoustic guitar electric drums , mixed heliumized vocals . " run " my favorite track . toy piano sounds beginning ; rather dark track . songs kind level off there . like i said , they've better , but this listenable	-1
good quality sound music . excellent vocals instramentation . this cd probably good christmas time if you want something you can't dance , skip , or whistle . included time honored church christmas songs very well . very well composed produced music . unfortunately , winter knight definately not dark sound it . it not scary . it not raise hair back your neck . ' theme ' begining end sounds constant similar . this make good quality when you want consistancy mood , tone timber , but second listening , i bored . winters knight not what i expecting or hoping when i previewed other nox arcana music amazon ... sadly , winter knight not any music previews any its songs . if there listening previews winters knight , i probably would purchased different nox arcana cd . this cd just doesn't darkness or spooky / scary factor midnight syndicate ... i haven't purchased other nox arcana cd yet , but maybe after previewing those again , i might find sound i hoping nox arcana winters knight	-1
arrangements complex style production very unique may take getting used , but songs truly fantastic	1

i heard radio dj-not too long ago- say air whenever he played keith whitley song several listeners would call ask who artist . today country radio stations doing disservice their listeners not putting all keith whitleys top 10 #1 hits ( he 5 #1 ) semi-constant rotation their play list . classics like quot;i'm over youquot ; , quot ; it ain't nothinquot ; , quot;i'm no stranger rainquot ; , quot ; i wonder you think mequot ; , quot;don't close your eyesquot ; , quot ; when you say nothing allquot ; all hit top 10 should not strangers today country radio that regardless what some consultant says or what testing research reflects . i implore today country stations play these songs air today watch your arb increase watch your phones light up . keith truly magnificent singer these songs very well crafted fit very well today country music	1

paul simon promoting there goes rhymin ' simon while recording this album . originally released columbia records 1974 , it re-released simon current label , warner bros . 1987 . i like sequels , concert central park , art garfunkel paul simon concert park(by himself ) better than this one . best version boxer , originally 1969 bridge over troubled water , i heard tcicp , recorded 1981 . because there previously unsung verse song . other tracks good	1
cinematic world would far more enjoyable place venture into if we more composers who could write film music like prokofiev could . his foray into movie world ( eisenstein films ivan terrible alexander nevsky ) must considered one pinnacles film music . cantata alexander nevsky built material film same name . unlike most film music it more than aptly suited survive its own , away screen . other two works this disc less than masterworks , but still very entertaining . scythian suite hardly prokofiev genius work . it written originally ballet ( direct competition stravinsky rite spring ) diaghilev , but rejected . he salvaged music made scythian suite , which very violent , primitive , brutal quite entertaining . lt . kije fun little piece , it romance particularily delightful . i think you would lot trouble finding better performance nevsky than this one , abbado talent it peak here , lso really belt out loud moments this music ( they very loud ) , without losing their clarity . short , nevsky kind music makes prokofiev one my all-time favorite composers	1
i bought this album whim , very pleasantly surprised . it starts off pretty chill , great melodies , sultry vocals , good deal diversity widening electronica genre . i've listened album my car way work , just hanging out friends over couple drinks home . it good mix , makes great addition my music collection	1

great compilation . i love it they all full length studio versions . also it great them chronological order great liner notes info each song . i wish they would left off 17 minute long " celebration lizard " -- this real dog . they could replaced this nearly 9 minute title song " soft parade " which incredible funky middle section . also could included " take it it comes " their first album - very overlooked song . this band 90-100 minutes classic stuff - best rock , really - but rest their material pretty marginal if not downright bad . so , all their best can't fit one cd , yet 2 cd can't help but contain little filler . i'd rather than just 1 cd . but it would nice remastered version " soft parade "	-1

maynard ferguson late 60 70 lps re-released cd rather haphazard way but least his most important lp period finally making it cd . if you maynard collector , you need this cd because it contains some key tracks helped revive maynard career early 70 . this cd consists music two different lp out four lp maynard recorded british columbia , largely british band , during 1968-72 , when he living uk . one lp included here first lp maynard recorded during his 4-year stint britain , called " ballad style maynard ferguson . " it recorded 1969 included this cd tracks 9 through 19 . second lp included this cd real gem here -- lp called " mf horn 2 , " it 4th lp maynard recorded british band ( recorded 1972 ) . " mf horn 2 " represented here tracks 1 through 8 . difference two pretty striking ( see comments below ) , you really mark resurgence maynard career noting difference two . now , schedule maynard lp re-releases gotten totally confusing . clear up early 70 chronology ( near i tell ) , order his lp their cd re-release status like this : - ballad style maynard ferguson ( included here)- mf horn ( now out cd - get it)- maynard ferguson ( now out cd - get it)- mf horn 2 ( included here)- mf horn 3 ( which released same british label this)- live jimmy , aka mf horn 4 5 ( which packaged mf horn 3 cd re-release . ) . - then finally " chameleon , " which out awhile cd ( get it ) . takes maynard up mid-70 , generally most his work after available some time . so , key tracks this cd -- " mf horn 2 " tracks 1 through 8 -- fall right middle maynard mid-career revival , indeed , required listening maynard devotees . they're representative his early 70 style -- mostly pop/rock standards day jazz/rock/pop hybrid style lot horns , lot bass , lots screamin ' soloing maynard . " give it one , " opener this cd , maynard classic , staple his live concerts 70 , " hey jude , " final cut mf horn 2 album . " spinning wheel " interesting arrangement pop classic ; " shaft " . so , any guesses why these two albums laid down this cd reverse chronological order ? i think it because 1969 ballad tracks such snoozers it would too jarring put them first cd . result , way this cd arranged , you 8 pretty lively tracks first then suddenly track 9 this cd falls into deep sleep that bit jarring . true , it great hear maynard cut loose some pop ballads ( esp . maria somewhere ) , his high-register playing , usual , completely amazing . but arrangements so sickly-sweet , song choice so dated , it really hard listen most ballad tracks more than once . it trumpet geeks only , i'm afraid , even them it hard slog sit through . net : - this not best place start early 70 maynard collection ( i would start w/ " maynard ferguson , " " chameleon , " or new " mf horn 3 " " live jimmy " two-cd set promised soon ) . - if you out get complete set maynard , course , you own mf horn 2 tracks , they worth price admission here . think this required purchase mf horn 2 other tracks thrown free . my final rating mix : kudos record company prying away rights columbia get this re-issued ; 10 stars some god-like trumpet playing ; 5 stars " give it one " alone ; some heavy penalty points some ballad tracks . finally : r.i.p. maynard -- great musician , great educator , great entertainer	-1

if you seen keller williams live , you probably loved him or hated him right away . i fell into prior group following him steady two years now . this new double live cd , stage , best representation date his live shows . loop , live cd released 2001 , also very good disc which i highly recommend anyone , stage carries torch this album reflecting his more recent escapades stage . there more instruments used this album ( read my loop review more info his one man band angle ) create much more complete sound . some cover songs stage make you laugh out loud or very least guffaw slightly . i especially enjoyed his version rapper delight , which i saw him perform live barely recognizable original . all all , this great cd if you into improvisational live music , i've said before , if you can't see him live , this next best thing ( but not nearly good person , check him live !	-1
i bought this album because five years ago i spent four months cairo , egypt , every time i got into taxi , there 50/50 chance i would hear " amarain . " it catchy song , got stuck my head , despite fact i only understood one word out every five . i decided buy album titled " amarain " check out rest amr diab music . i fell love " ana , " which also single off album . " ana " combines egyptian pop sound latino rhythms vaguely techno riff . it also call-and-response driving beat . all all , great song . rest album very listenable too . so , i came back us , lost tape , much my chagrin . this year , i wandering around amazon.com, found greatest hits . it " amarain " " ana " it , so i decided get it . nearly every song very good , all good . few pre-packaged " listen this unspecific world music while selling cars or ' ethnic ' food " feel , but they're still catchy . my husband , who only understands five ( or so ) words arabic , enjoys insistent beat amr diab . you chill it , you dance it , you attempt read rather badly translated english lyrics , or you just put it car drive it	-1
i'll start off thing get me unhelpful votes , but it needs said . i've heard very few songs kmfdm so my introduction lucia came form revolver magazine . without ever truly hearing her voice i decided get land volcanos . nearly month ago this cd still heavy rotation . this one those cds escape . 54 some odd second running time , you're completely different place . lucia voice lush melodies sweep over you you lose all sense time . few cds so find one it , so successfully , quite relief . whether song harder variety or just relaxing , no point this record stall , it moves swiftly , which , ironically , my only gripe it well . very beginning so clever i figured i quite ride . so clever just solid song , nothing more . breathy vocals through verses turn into ear catching chorus . i don't care some best lyrics disc , plus chorus pretty much soars . fear lyrically driven song . it serves true highlight well . feels like summer probably my second favorite featured . ' instant classic ' comes mind whenever i hear it . pulsating beat some pretty intense moments only serve song more justice . what you become nin feel it repetative chorus , not my favorite but good few listens . who asked you creeps certain sensuality it . i goes down my favorite song featured . chorus irresistable , that basically what it boils down . monkey puzzle tree kind grated my nerves first but now i really like it . nice lyrics excellent chorus . ordinary girl rounds out true cd nicely . chorus kind eery due completely lucia vocals . i love pace this song . kmfdm verson monkey puzzle tree strikes me more reprise than remix . either way , it still great song . my favorite songs so clever , fear , feels like summer , i , ordinary girl . if you're like me haven't properly introduced lucia , well this perfect way . this cd truly amazing i only hope when i venture into kmfdm catalog they'll impress me much lucia land volcanos	1

after 14 years apart eagles got back together 1994 record 4 new tracks perform concert tv special . " hell freezes over " result this project my opinion this must own any fan eagles . 3 4 new songs great ones . don henley " get over it " great rocker pretty much sums up my philosophy life . tim schmit " love keep us alive " rather average song , but it brought higher level schmit unique vocal style . no one cans sing songs like this quite like him . glenn frey " girl yesterday " harkens back bands early country rock roots , good tune great lyrics . other new track " learn still " henley not lot me . live section album solid start finish . fact i would say this material blows " eagles live " album 1980 out water . recording pristine performances just perfect . band all acoustic version hotel california incorporates nice twist original song . my all time favorite eagles song " last resort " majestic even better than studio version , serves crowning moment album . " tequila sunrise " , " wasted time " , " pretty maids all row " , " i can't tell you why " , " take it easy " , " city " , " life fast lane " , " desperado " all appear here all sound great . don henley solo hit " new york minute " also included . this album would serve fine introduction anyone looking explore eagles . it also proved band back big way . they continued tour fairly regular basis ever since	1

itunes great tool , isn't it ? now , even tho i'm hella asian , i don't know anything computers technology all jazz . i know i like certain songs artists what not . so , i pretty much no life , although when i spell it out it doesn't seem all unusual . i'm 25 year old bartender who sits computer plays online poker his spare time . could easily describe 2 million people . but when i'm pokered out ( or when i'm flat broke pokering around ) i go amazon read people reviews , then go limewire get songs based reviews . i must this 20 hours week . i work 40 , play poker 40 , sleep 60 , this 20 . i told you i no life . when i made my profile 5 or 6 years ago , i prompted put down profession like teacher , or student , or whatever , i said " music my life , default " , statement still holds true today . why am i going this long winded narrative my life , or lack thereof ? i'm not sure , i just want stress i'm music lover , i love caia . so itunes , it keeps track what songs i play . weekend players number one , aquanote not far behind . but i've those guys lot longer than caia , caia proudly number 3 right now . reason i'm writing this review because i've " remembrance " repeat 50 minutes now . i just share how good this song album people who might care . there no other song my vast itunes library i would put repeat , let alone 8 times . if you're like me , who likes browse download based reviews , get caia " remembrance " . it not everyone , but you'll glad you're not one them . there other delicious songs here well , i'm sure like everyone else , i went through phase where i liked " rose room " best , or subway song , or " summer lightning " . it really doesn't matter anyways , everyone their own tastes . i'm just saying , right now , music junkie no other life , i love this album best . maybe i'm not willing yet put it ahead ok computer radiohead yet , but it same discussion . i never thought i would say this because ok computer well , ok computer . just check it out , ok	1

ventures greatest rock instrumental band ever . i would even go length say they best rock group , period , but that little too extreme many people . ventures formed late 1959 . future guitarists band , don wilson , bob bogle , new each other through their jobs , used car lot . after they got together , walk dont run came . after couple singles , album , walk dont run shot up charts , ventures surf rock legends ! few albums later , few changes lineup , 1963 , ventures consisted don wilson , nokie edwards , bob bogle , guitars , mel taylor drums . what group extraudinary musicians ! group could tackle so many musical styles . what ease feel they it . during 1960 , ventures put out great albums , some great hit singles . they would record their most famous song ever , " hawaii five-0 . " though it would their most famous song , most not know same group who put out walk don run 10 years earlier , put out this gem . this cd collection , captures ventures their prime . it also some rarities like radio show commercials breif interview " rocketing rhythms , " don wilson bob bogle . this nice place start , ventures . i two years ago , now , i'm hooked . i also learned little guitar them . this nice collection . if you're avad guitar fan , instrumental rock fan , surf rock fan , oldies fan , or just fan great music , this cd . you won't dissapointed	1
this true defining moment 80s apropos summary decade . this album came out 1989 , after motley crue , ratt , white lion , journey , all others made their mark . truth this album tried save genre album oriented rock ( find bad song it you'll thousand people telling you you're crazy ) , tried save glam metal ( although they weren't exactly trying get cover rock magazine every other week like motley crue ) look matched sound . this good rock . you would hard pressed find album 1989 influenced many , sold many , or played much ( radio , home stereos , car stereos , etc ) than this	1

movie itself trash , i would never call it horror ... if i ann rice i would never agree use my books plot such poor production ... but music ... music only worthy thing this movie ... its dark , deep wonderful .. giving more atmosphire story than movie ever could ... all tracks incredible shows truth sad , wasteful , lonley existence empty world darkness ... music much more darker , serious miserable then movie itself .. i love listening it ... its music full anxiety , pain sorrow .... showing perfectly atmosphire book .... who read it knows what i mean ... jonathan davis richard gibbs really great job ... so different accorading what he usualy korn , i hope we here more such great music him	1

this remixed stereo version who debut album simply vast improvement ; especially soundwise , compared my old mgm version , which i always found annoyingly dull . here you'll hear sounds parts you never even knew there . crunchier guitar-sounds clearer vocals . few tracks misses some parts recorded directly into original mono-tapes - that why some original mono-versions inluded disc two . " my generation " without lead-guitar feels little fla t.t hough pete townshend obviously hasn't reached his heights songwriter this point , his original songs outshine cover-versions miles . pop-rock anthems like " kids alright " " my generation " course classics , " i can't explain " , their first hit , benefitted enormously remastering - great track . album tracks like " good gone " , " la la la lies " , " it not true " , " legal matter " " circles " document great versatility townshend songwriting . it no surprise who great musicians too - listen enthwistle " ox " - like many other tracks featuring legendary piano-player nicky hopkins . among bonus-tracks you'll find all early b-sides alternate versions various songs . i especially thrilled " instant party mixture " , which way also predicts " sell out " theme . when i sometimes forget how good they really - this album remind me . fine booklet lots information written mike shaw , shel talmy andy neill	1

back 1987 , while just every new band all fit into one category , lacked originality all sounded similar . comes faster pussycat proud doing their own thing , playing wide variety styles didn't care what anybody thought . meaning they mixed sleaze , glam , rock , blues together , avoided pop-metal added humor their songwriting . they closer aerosmith/rolling stones sound than they given credit . also give me break they just ripped off guns roses , poison , etc . both these bands stole so much other bands without putting their own stamp their music . axl stole so much steve tyler it not even funny brett not same league taime . least faster pussycat they put their own sound their influences made music fun their humor filled songs . also they something neither guns posers or pop poison could . that release album 10 great songs it no fillers . each track this debut release really awesome . only pussycat could pull it off such songs , " bathroom wall " , " no room emotion " , " cathouse " , " bottle front me " . just too name few . must release you love pussycat . it bummer they where underrated never got credit they deserve . lastly , based music scene today . pussycat would fit right would huge	1
cameroonian musician richard bona made quite winning disc multi-cultural music tied together his ebullient singing , creatively layered arrangements jazz-infused rhythmic chops . he composed all songs except one , varied lot , performs his native tongue , douala , which one two hundred cameroonian dialects . he makes music truly world view , but never he sound contrived due consistency his sound his production craftsmanship . instance , there elements strong brazilian influence , particular , high-energy samba , " manyaka o brazil " , which manages make marc berthoumieux accordion sound seductive , ipanema-like " cal�ad�o de copacabana " . john legend joins bona opening track , loping " please don't stop " , which sounds like throwback 1970's-style rb shuffle especially atn stadwijk supple horn arrangement . dream-like " o beta o siba " jazz-lounge , vince guaraldi-like sound " esoku bulu " ( " night whisper " ) make nice contrasts predominantly rhythmic orientation disc . distinctive african beats pervasive throughout title track , which effectively sauntering vocal turn susheela raman , drum-heavy " akwa samba yaya " . " ba senge " catchy , keyboard-based beat reminiscent doobie brothers circa 1979 , while buena vista social club appears inspiration percolating " o sen sen sen " , which driven osmany paredes ' havana-style piano playing . there couple brief lovely acoustic ballads , pian o-o riented " kivu " ending " nu sango " . surprisingly moving track bona almost classical-sounding cover jaco pastorius ' " three women " moving string arrangement . strings play predominant part my favorite track , " samaouma " its rich multi-cultural sound brought life bona hypnotic vocals , pat metheny-like fret work lush strings courtesy flux quartet . variety sounds this recording quite impressive considering bona plays multitude instruments all songs . his dexterous fluent ability open himself up global scene hopefully bring him stateside success	-1
velvet underground , me , rock - or specifically indie/alternative rock - all time greatest band because it its most influential . list bands musicians influenced inspired vu enormous includes u2 , cure , strokes , rem , luna , jesus mary chain , patti smith , name just few . i am proud owner their boxed set , peel slowly see which one few boxed sets i own . i also own some solo records various velvets , including lou reed , nico , john cale . i brought my friends see film " i shot andy warhol , " which reconstructed era warhol factory , when velvets ( well played film yo la tengo ) house band . i now own copy fine film , well . even though i born 1961 , thus bit too young known understood warhol factory era , i remember tail end 60s . i remember greenwich village lower manhattan back then . i aunt who loved city who used take me over there , our nj home , regular basis i specific memories witnessing 60s freaks washington square park . i must six years old time . i got older , i came realization significance 60s , warhol , greenwich village , seminal band connected all three : lou reed , john cale , mo tucker , sterling morrison - velvet underground . i bought rather old , scratchy copy this record , which i found used record bin , while high school mid/late 1970s , which also period time when i , influenced 70s rock mags like creem circus , began discover music lou reed ( e.g. , coney island baby , transformer , street hassle , etc ) . however , i didn't truly get deeply into lou velvets until bit later , when i bought velvet compilation , began listening them , well various velvets solo stuff more frequently carefully . nevertheless , first listened this record its classic proto noise/no wave track sister ray , when i , planted seed . i recall liking few songs here - title track , sister ray , here she comes now , not quite knowing what make rest , particularly john cale nihilistic little story song gift or lou freakout guitar solo i heard her call my name . i also less than impressed cruddy production values recording , made worse my scratchy used copy . listening now , thinking it further , i now realize what gem even scratchy used copy this . this , indeed , great album , truly classic . this mainly lou album , it , you hear him asserting himself band leader . you also hear band pushing him back . listening whole band thrash away sister ray - its deviantly awkward , erotically charged lyrics -one hears what rock drone meant . short , lo-fi production inherent tensions within band made proto-punk , proto-indie rock classic recording , one which truly captures anomic polarized mood late 60s , time drugs , violence , political confrontation , social artistic change . whole world turned upside down , velvet underground managed capture small piece tenor times . this recording belongs music collection everyone interested history rock , punk , indie rock or warholiana .	1
although seduction always my all-time favorite boney , sweet thing/it all good great work . east bay wonderful groove sets tone rest tracks . but sweet thing my cut this cd . i got opportunity hear him play song live oh , my word !! buy it yourself . listen it . you'll find yourself coming back it .	-1
i waited almost 30 years buy this album . i knew " give me love " course . but when i bought listened it first time , i struck how familiar entire album sounded . i'll bet pre-vanilla world fm radio 1973 , i may heard all tracks , somewhere my memory these songs got locked away . but - good music always strange quality familiarity . you feel you heard it before . george harrison write great hook , material world he mines his imagination sounds we may recall beatles days - rhythm guitar riff " lord loves one " , instance , which harks back intro " old brown shoe " . george tips his hat beatles throughout this album . you get sense huge impact he their sound . but he also steps out here entire album his own way . he still presenting catalogue songs conceived while fabs still together . it like " all things must pass " , part ii , not disappoint . quiet beatle , indeed , lot say . we hear lot george vanishing creativity 70s waned . i would counter , say george harrison may acquired taste some . repeated listens , his vision message begin materialize over time . his profound sense unusual chord progressions yields beautiful sound uniquely his . george harrison impart positive message using darkest sounds , which almost exact opposite what paul mccartney his music . it may sad lennon mccartney split up - but harrison brought lot table . lennon his anger irony ; mccartney his soaring musical vision joy ; but harrison his optimism mixed sadness . " all " rivals " something " , but some reason not released single below radar screen decades . this one my favorite harrison cds . it true solo album , which he not run away his status ex-beatle . olivia dhani harrison given us concert george , set remasterings . it time them get into early capitol albums , starting this one - make even better , this excellent music . i wonder what bonus tracks floating around	1

music this recording represents perfect coming together musicianship . opening notes final sounds , listener taken into new world . varese bird one . i would reccomend this one anybody who cares jazz development jazz . i wouldn't reccomend this one fan any jazz pop . listen braxton world quot ; mostly blue but isolated touches red brownquot ; . emphasis quot ; texturequot ; rather than usual expectations we theme variation , harmonic structure , tempo . it music not follow our typical standards beauty rather ' it sets up it own standards beauty . many moments dense , colorful beauty . buy it	1
some grading this collection down because it contains relatively few tracks comparison other quot ; hitsquot ; compilations . frankly , kitchen sink approach chronicling band progression overkill . unless one absolutely smitten particular artist , eleven tracks probably plenty . selections here appropriate , some pre-lionel-as-sensitive-frontman gems like quot ; brick housequot ; , well accomplished balladry followed . whomever arranged sequencing this cd bit jokester : quot ; three times ladyquot ; , baroque beautiful wedding-reception standard , followed quot ; sail onquot ; , overt kiss-off . regardless , remastering top-notch ; listen this headphones you sometimes hear band members breathing . casual commodores fans probably find eleven solid songs quite enough , although they might choose skip back quot ; brick housequot ; few times ; it may tightest 70s anthem booty ever recorded	-1
those who purchased this cd some questions it , i would like fill details you . back summer 2005 i contacted cherry red , asking if they any plans release artery material they held rights . this included few singles , part ' oceans ' mini lp , ' one afternoon hot air balloon ' lp . they said they no current plans , but asked if i would like assist putting together compilation ? i gladly agreed . i doing sound restoration many years , i wanted directly involved aspect cd . they informed me what songs they could use without incurring additional licensing fees , so material i could work . cherry red pulled out tapes they storage , flat transfer them cd sent them me . i allowed select songs put them order my choice . i spent good bit time remastering material . i evened balances , adjusted volumes , removed some static pops within songs some careful hiss reduction . addition , tape one song could not found , three others poorly deteriorated over time . i managed save one those songs re-equalizing damaged channel others i remastered , skill , vinyl . you tell which ones they ? 19 songs i choose , only one i chose leave off 12 " version " alabama song " . 7 " far superior , though it still not one their best releases . cd also included couple unreleased songs found one master tapes . those songs , " africa " fully produced song i found quite interesting . jungle drumming shouting gave it sort adam ants feel . unreleased version " slide " later revealed me one band members joke track never meant released . not known advance , i included it because other versions " slide " could not included due licensing . like many compilation albums , material vary group explores different musical territory . this no exception . early songs like classic " into garden " " clown " quite different what appeared ' one afternoon hot air baloon ' lp but that what compilations all - diversity . i suppose i could ' balloon ' released its standard running order additional songs included bonuses , though i opted scattered compilation approach . i put my opinion stronger songs towards beginning , ending weaker remixes/alternate versions . i also provided front cover art all scans booklet . cherry red none single/album sleeves handy so i gladly scanned emailed them . i based design front cover ' oceans ' mini lp , quite pleased results . cover showing up many these online websites original , untouched rough draft i provided , which before last minute name change some correction curtains . i also proofed liner notes provided major overhaul discography . finally , i provided song detail paragraph page one . i spent many months working couple other great people get this cd become reality . i'm very proud results hope others enjoy it well - it long overdue . said , i also enjoy new artery compilation simon hinkler worked spinney label , which actually titled ' afterwards ' . it focuses earlier artery material , including much stuff i unable use . there only one song/version cd overlaps this one , making it essential buy artery fans . though final artery recordings not good earlier material , it would nice eventually see compilation focusing 84-85 material well	1

dervish caught my attention day one ! september this year they came all way ireland my college my friends i thought we take look see what this band all . i floored !! cathy jordan amazing vocals , group obvious talent any intrument under rainbow , their gorgeous melodies , jigs , reels me hooked . although cd isn't nearly exciting their live concert ( which they recieved standing ovation , course ) , it must any person who enjoys celtic traditional style , well style new fresh kick it . i know i'm hooked , why don't you give it try !	1
my vinyl copy live/evil arrived soon after its original release , my 15th birthday . i just begun listening seriously music , live/evil branded itself deep my brain . " soundtrack my inner life " sounds corny , but just what this music my last 35 years . i no hesitation calling this rock ' roll because its high volume , distortion , relentless beat . yet simple , even crude melodic structures allow players room weave writhe amazing directions . band improbable collection eccentrics , yet miles fused them . only he could lead furious interplay one hears keith jarrett john mclaughlin , or mike henderson , jack dejohnette airto moriera . there no missing angry , aggressive mood much work , yet there deep optimism beneath it . i always felt miles wanted not just lead us new kind music but new way living -- way involves asking new questions passing up old answers . like so many other early ' 70s musicians , miles trying shock us inspiration create better world . i think live/evil still 2006	1

if you liked riverdance , you'll love this . after listening free samples this site , i badgered my mum into buying cd . minute i put it my walkman , i loved it . way composer mixes traditional instruments like fiddles modern instruments like saxophones keyboards amazing . this gives music thicker feel , pushing it way above riverdance . whether you celtic blood or not you love it ! tracks 16 17 especially brilliant fast tapping michael flately feet rest troop . i really want see show now ! buy it or miss out some best music around	1
i never able see what big deal this band . all their records , general , sound exactly same , this one no exception . post-velvets guitar/organ drones , lackadaisical vocals , blankly uninteresting non-lyrics ( they could recited their grocery lists it would more interesting ) , dramatic lack energy ; all yo la tengo trademarks fully represented here , if you stay awake through it , you're better man/woman than i . surpassingly boring record , even this usually very boring band . if you've heard velvet underground , neu !, stereolab early records , sonic youth , you've heard yo la tengo total . if you're big enough fan those named bands , you could probably write songs sound like quot ; painful . quot ; but you would probably write better ones . avoid this like plague unless you suffer insomnia	1
even joke , this would horrible ; however , i think this band take it seriously - it blows ! i picked up this cd because i heard a.r.e. like combination suicide , front 242 , iron maiden : interesting . no !! a.r.e. bad imitation front 242 watered-down liars best . guitar riffs awful lyrics even worse . example : " hey world " begins how much it sucks 13 . when i saw pelican concert , they opening (?!?!?) a.r.e. , so i decided give them second chance . sound guy must not liked what he heard , because bar chatter louder . " louder " i yelled , so i might find something redeeming their music . " yeah , suck louder ! " someone else yelled - i agree give him high-five . maybe i would liked this when i 12 didn't know any better . zero stars	-1

this third time i tried post review this unacceptably bad album , i suppose i too harsh , because neither my previous efforts posted . lets keep this one simple . this not music , plain simple . i purchased this due glowing recommendations other reviewers this site , terribly disappointed . it basically consists massively distorted ( detuned ) guitar bass monotonously droning nearly hour no coherence , structure , or anything approximating actual ability play instrument . call it performance art , experimental noise , whatever . it simply not music .	-1

maria callas known one greatest artist century because she responsible revival neglected bell canto operas . april 14 , 1957 one those memorable days . it opening night new production great neglected opera anna bolena . this staged la scala . i am very happy this particular event documented this recording . least able listen this spectacular memorable night . characterization la divina one most exciting she . this probably because anna tragedy comes fusion all wounded characters she played previously . this seems catalyst she needed pour deep emotions role . final scene this recording make everybody understand why la divina considered greatest singing actress 20th century . it shows her height her talent both tragic actress course singer . despite poor recording untolerable hisses some parts . this recording should not missed any reason this best anna bolena disc .	1

este album llego mi por simple curiosidad en el 2000 . nunca imagine que alguien pudiese juntar tal talento en sus manos voz como lo hizo muddy para este album . la seccion de musicos que le sirven de soporte son nada mas nada menos que . buddy guy willie dixon . no hay palabras que puedan describir la magia que emanan de estas grabaciones , tan solo blues en su mas puro estado ... es como trasladarse al delta de los 1930 . sonido puro llanamente acustico con un entramado de guitarras magistral entre muddy buddy guy que sirven de fondo la ya famosa interpretacion vocal de muddy eso sin contar con el solido sonido de willie dixon al bajo . recuerdo que en una vieja revista de blues apuntaba sobre la existencia de este disco como una muestra de musica folk interpretada por quien se supone fue , es sera la mejor voz guitarra del blues americano ... pero aqui no hay nada de folk , es blues delta en su estado mas primitivo . maravilloso dotado de una sencillez total que asombran por el resultado ; pura magia . se agregan una serie de bonus tracks que no deslucen del contenido inicial de la edicion original ... pero los temas grabados en acustico son seran la parte central de esta obra unica en su genero . las fotografias que se incluyen en el inserto en la propia caja del cd demuestran por su elegancia el disfrute de tres maestros del blues que nunca imaginaron que al juntarse para esta sencilla grabacion , crearian una de las mejores muestras del espiritu del blues delta . el album recoje algunos de los temas mas interesantes de la discografia del mudddy ; captain captain , good morning little school girl , long distance callin ' ... ademas de otras gemas cargadas de sentimiento la belleza del blues en un estilo unico donde predomina la improvisacion la tecnica espontanea de dos de los grandes guitarristas bluseros de todos los tiempos . puede debe catalogarse de grabacion escencial para todo amante de la musica el blues ... no dudes en obtenerla ... nunca dejaras de escucharlo , de lo contrario no sabes de lo que te pierdes . saludos	1

this record opens haunting version " girl north country , " which dylan sings johnny cash . haunting sure , because any song sung mr. cash haunting , but this one , dylan using his new countrified voice even more so , spooky . this song alone worth buying album . " girl " followed instrumental " nashville skyline rag , " which i've heard said reworking instrumental " cough song , " which first appeared " stealin '" bootleg . i don't know if that true , but it doggone good guitar piece . , course , everybody knows " lay lady lay " which kind top forty hit still played classic rock stations all over world . it good song , but i like " i threw it all away " " tonight i'll staying here you , " better . this country album . " john wesley harding " its country musicians leaned way , but " nashville skyline " got all way there dylan would stay country two more records ( some would say three ) , then he'd burst back rock scene vengeance . still , country or not , this five star piece work . yes , dylan country , but he it very , very well . jack priest , writer darksid	1
its funny : i'm same age sophia coppola i seemed missed out some great 80s music . i never listened siouxsie banshees bow wow wow . strange how music this so hypnotic --- it choice music itself ? or it visceral association film ? girl who wrote here it sounds like its coming down hall spot . combining lavish past film contrasting it contemporary pop music master stroke ( reminds me bit how sally potter seamlessly combined past present movie , orlando ) . second disc such wonderful addition --- again , seemingly incongorous match first second disc comes off brilliant . i found myself imagining movie so vividly when listening these tracks .	1
ignorance count excuse such drivel ? i wonder times ... refute " criticism : de sabata no need " rush opera " because 1953 they no more " time-problems " . his tempi legendary , if you want dragged tosca , go karajan-recording ricciarelli . (!) callas doesn't " scream all times " ( grammar ? ) but sings soaring pianissimi , . . phrase " ah come la sai bene l'arte di farti amare " or " fa le occhi neri ... " . she sounds velvety cantilenae " pianissimis " : learn italian first before you abuse this term ! super-high-charged ? gobbi sing " te deum " over 30 times until legge de sabata satisfied , callas positioned different places " mario ! " calls , they worked over half hour one phrase alone : " et avanti lui tremava tutta roma ! " this so thought through recording it absolutely mesmerizing . get your grammar work before you write any reviews all before you bash legend : your homework ! this tosca nothing less but brilliant . sadly reviewers such these only bring sown amazon.com	1
this cd combines professional singing children participating , which fascinates my toddler . it very useful hear youngsters ' voices alongside adults ' . also , good mix music - traditional nursery rhymes ; country western ; folk , etc . overall , 4 cds entertainment that kept my child very happy indeed !!	1
it hard not speak hyperbolically this record , because it simply stunning beautiful . it subtle , natural grace found few other places , especially within hardcore/emo genres . restraint , fury , beauty , vvvrrrroooommmm gazing into stars . i know it sounds lame like typical fan reviewers ' over-the-top , gushing cliche , but this record one very rare few deserves it . hopesfall very , very much very little . true instance minimalism = expansion/layered texture . just buy it . every single song overgrow you like intoxicating kudzu ( if you any taste )	1
i disappointed some songs this cd , particularly one willie nelson . ray willie rendition " seven spanish angels " would much better selection this cd than what they . i skip song when listening cd . he nora jones fabulous job well he gladys knight , he bb king . cd worth those three songs .	-1
there some classic songs this album sure . 6 them exact . all bee gees songs . sure " disco inferno " pretty good . so " if i can't you " . but everything else joke . if you ask me , they should've given whole record bee gees them like 10-12 songs . if they could come up 4 songs like ones they've got here , this would easily one greatest albums ever	1
joan jett not released official world wide release album 12 years . there couple unofficial releases over years but they only came out japan ( naked fetish which actually more collection her more sexualized songs ) . her new album sinner sees her re-releasing/re-recording some tracks off naked well some new cuts off fetish addition some new material . how it stack up ? pretty good actually . while album doesn't quite hold up quite well lot her classic 80 material , most part , this release sees joan venturing forth her trademark sound , tough ( sexy ) vocals , sexually ambiguous lyrics kicking guitar work . considering she not 48 years old , it literally sounds like she hasn't aged all . her backing band sounds great well . production crystal clear everything really nice rocking bite it . while some hardcore fans might upset they already some these songs already naked fetish , more casual fan like myself , this album really enjoyable listen . there only 2 or 3 cuts bit fillerish , but overall , this just great no-nonsense rock album like lot people don't make anymore . while this album doesn't really advance her sound any , it still shows her doing what she best when she really puts her mind/heart it . i recommend getting this her greatest hits cd fit tied that'll pretty much all joan jett you'll need . hopefully she won't take 12 years come out release . sinner shows this sexy woman still quite lot say .	1
superb performance superb sonics . close live performance high-end system one could ever expect	1
if you're looking original versions black classics like " smokie " or white silver sands , " stay away this cd ! all so-called hits presented this cd stereo re-recordings original mono hits ; i suspect most them recorded long after bill black death 1965 . new recordings same arrangements old ones , great sound , but feeling originals totally gone . stay away this cd	-1
i came across ani difranco music through covers guitar slinging folk girls , woman who quite good what they honored their influences . then i listened knuckle down , just last year . i like , oh , so this ani difranco . all-powerful amazon warrior , not just some sniveling girl ( quote girl herself , all irony intended ) . needs . , i think , what educated guess : needs , needs not met , needs expose us , , finally , make or break us . if you're fan difranco , you should appreciate this disc . it plays like workshop , working through themes ideas her ani accents , language , music , etc . educated guess shows artist work some heavy emotional stuff , personal themes still open-ended enough let listener . i think disc knuckle down sides whole emotional/creative gestalt . what she voices educated guess presented much more stylistcally knuckle down , more accomplished release only because she band jams polished material bit emotional distance . educated guess working through , feeling your way artist . origami articulates succinctly what went down this girl heart . powerful , accomplished woman surely find it difficult someone . other person complete you some way , , well , we know story . animal sweet swipe our fatted-calf way life . really , you hear difranco politics stated clearly , quietly , beautifully . you each time ends ani voice looping back through like delicate heartbeat goes after music all else dies . if there one thing you take this release it ani voice , looping out all variety echos choruses . she sings herself questions herself answers herself . her voice worked through effects whacked way she uses perfectly knuckle down . it all here , creative tools stuff she uses knuckle down , her mature masterpiece . she certainly working , experimenting here , pushing herself artist not avert her glance . she hard other her lyrics , yeah , but hard herself because , you know , when it just doesn't work out , what you then . very internal , this stuff , dark times smothering . discovering you , actually , happy either way , after it all goes down , love love thing , problematic most anyone . effects love loss life . taken together educated guess knuckle down show artist spiritual emotional crisis share sort creative catharsis . this definitely mature work . educated guess workshop , knuckle down showpiece . but any ani difranco fan should appreciate educated guess . i guess it might depend why you listen her . she smart lyricist sly guitarist , doing very cool , jazzy runs picks . don't expect world conqueror here . this human ani defeat , emotional wounds exposed , keeping company herself , working through groovy way . accompanied her guitar ever looping voice chorus , high low scatting squeaking , singing , telling stories , calling herself out she shape shifts into something new	1

i'm not big fan christmas records general but i quickly become addicted aimee mann " one more drifter snow " . album title taken lyrics " calling mary " , new song written aimee her musical chief staff , paul bryan . hold there , buddy . aimee mann writing singing virgin mary , mother jesus christ ? yes , she . " calling mary " terrific song too , dark but not somber , optimistic but not sappy . it rocks , shuffling kind way . it doesn't force its point either . " calling mary voluntary , " according loping chorus . " whatever happened christmas " new aimee mann original it taps deep french roast vein melancholy . this one you'll listen christmas eve while you microwave turkey tv dinner one . ( hey , invite somebody over . yourself favor ! ) . " christmastime " brand new arrangement song written several years ago michael penn ( sean brother , aimee husband ) movie " hard eight " . if you've spent any time malls or elevators during holidays , you've probably heard " christmastime " heavy rotation radio hohoho . reading here " one more drifter snow " bit more organic , little less beatles , little more dylan . aimee also released previous versions two other songs appear this collection . original mann arrangement " christmas song " ( " chestnuts roasting open fire ... " ) circulated radio stations fans several years . aimee sounded like one kids waiting up santa . this new recording , aimee sounds wiser maybe bit sadder . first recording " yourself merry little christmas " originally fan club-only release couple years back . it fine but it lacked power focus version that included " one more drifter snow " . when bells ring aimee sings " we all together , if fates allow , " you'll cry those who gone those who still us . rather than address other highlights set , let me instead close note band , sound aimee . band just terrific " one more drifter snow " . producer paul bryan combines subtle distinctive sound master picker duke levine rich varied textures keyboard ace patrick warren glistening sonic landscape . aimee never sounded better . like many my favorite aimee recordings , " one more drifer snow " took couple listens move me . i noted many negative reviews this record , people commented aimee sounded " bored " or " boring " . i guess i'm not really surprised . i've aimee mann fan many years i've noticed while some people " get it " , many more don't . if you liked any other recordings aimee mann , especially classic " forgotten arm " , you probably love this album . if you low threshold naked emotion , maybe you should start something more cheerful , like patti smith christmas record . merry christmas all !	1
my favorite cat release - like most , i got into cat because film harold amp ; maude - several tunes here , including haunting ' trouble ' rest album also wonderful - only filler would ' rock star ' , but even it grows you . sad this album not better represented his popular ' best ' release . this best cat ' tillerman ' album	1
this cd easily among my all time favorite cds . great rock start finish well worth cash . i hear seether new studio album out 2007 , it hard them top this great cd unless shaun puts his amy lee problems into his writing like she lol	1
imagine approaching dylan directly after this album release saying him , `amazing album , bob . perhaps greatest album i've ever heard , but this year end , it won't album year . ' fortunately dylan , it would his own album [ highway 61 revisited ] would top it , it would album would stand greatest album ever released . what makes highway 61 even more impressive fact `positively 4th street ' [ one greatest songs ever recorded ] omitted - most likely because they found it too similar `like rolling stone . ' 1965 , bob dylan greatest year any musician ever . second place isn't even visible . discussing bringing it all back home , it said this dylan first go rock , its importance cannot overstated , all things those lines . album title itself hilarious . also , take good look cover [ notice copy side bob dylan ] . dylan giving big middle finger every person who turned him . so how actual music ? well , let see : `subterranean homesick blues ' said first song its kind . this isn't exactly true . chuck berry `too much monkey business ' semi-rapping thing going , it predates this . said , this song much more aggressive , writing stellar . if i'm not mistaken , `she belongs me ' john cale favorite song . . . period . writing formatted blues , but music , well , isn't . one dylan more subtly-odd songs . every person who i've ever introduced dylan hated `maggie farm ' - while anyway , i know why ; song wonderfully abrasive . it grows you . writing brilliant : funny observant . `love minus zero/no limit ' one finest pieces writing all music . it abounds film literary references , but , like eliot writing , one doesn't pick up every reference appreciate greatness writing . it writing layers . `outlaw blues ' straight blues rock . leave it dylan make social statement seemingly straightforward lyrics comprise last verse : i got woman jackson , i ain't gonna say her name . i got woman jackson , i ain't gonna say her name . she brown-skin woman , but i love her just same . it not uncommon people new dylan think him self-important guy who probably doesn't sense humor . my immediate reaction would point out there great deal humor songs like `like rolling stone , ' `desolation row , ' `tangled up blue ' [ some dylan most respected songs ]; my next response would point them songs like `on road again ' `bob dylan 115th dream . ' they pure hilarity . said writing , especially `bob dylan 115th dream ' executed very high level . this verse displays it well : i repeated my friendswere all jail , sighhe gave me his cardhe said , " call me if they die " i shook his hand said goodbyeran out streetwhen bowling ball came down roadand knocked me off my feeta pay phone ringingit just blew my mindwhen i picked it up said hellothis foot came through line there time when closing verse ` mr. tambourine man ' my favorite moment music - closing line particular . there too many spectacular moments music me favorite , but it still one them . it said , ` mr. tambourine man ' first four acoustic songs finish album . `gates eden ' easily weakest four acoustic songs . this , however , due greatness other three songs . last verse something special : dawn my lover comes meand tells me her dreamswith no attempts shovel glimpseinto ditch what each one meansat times i think there no wordsbut these tell what trueand there no truths outside gates eden during his 60 minute interview , dylan discussing how some his earlier songs seemed come him magic . `it alright , ma ( i'm only bleeding )' example he . it easy see why potent lyrics like : while some principles baptizedto strict party platform tiessocial clubs drag disguiseoutsiders they freely criticizetell nothing except who idolizeand then say god bless him . `it all over now , baby blue ' , many ways , precursor `like rolling stone . ' song more sorrowful less involved , but what songs involved `like rolling stone' ? album filled highlights potential closers , this perfect ending . second verse one music best : highway gamblers , better use your sense . take what you gathered coincidence . empty-handed painter your streetsis drawing crazy patterns your sheets . this sky , too , folding under youand it all over now , baby blue . this album near perfect . how dylan topped it . . . i'll never know . needless say , this essential .	1
yes , album title quite appropriate because everything made this band amazing previous releases ( shining example determination ) far beyond gone . god forbid traded all their originality popularity new streamlined sound . gone amazing catchy two-part guitar harmonies incredible breakdowns . gone amazing lyrics used accompany thier music . gone god forbid far i'm concerned . i gave this album two stars effort . band still incredibly talented band , i respect risks involved introducing clean vocals into music used almost none . vocals quite impressive , instrumentalists still rather talented . this album far too streamlined hackneyed this fan . if you want hear really stellar album , check out determination	1

this my first exploration into music joseph arthur . i actually heard " all our hands " npr then later his website , www.josepharthur.com . because i so taken song ( which doesn't make appearance album , it bonus ) i decided go out buy album . while " all our hands " probably most amazing modern politically charged song i've heard , rest album doesn't quite live up its standard . said , i am thoroughly enjoying blending electronic beats more " traditional " instruments . arthur vocals interesting , different than most pop-rock artists . i tend ear which likes unique , more gritty vocalists ( rem , velvet underground , etc ) . songs all well written intriguing , my favorites ohio , can't exist , echo park ( course all our hands his site ) . if you haven't heard arthur yet , go his site , listen songs there , then buy album . i definitely plan checking out some his earlier works	1

few bands able overcome seemingly inevitable " sophomore slump " , music critics call it . , their second album doesn't measure up first whatsoever . this unfortunately case many great bands , partly due fans ' critics ' continual comparison debut album . " room fire " could've very well considered brilliant stand-alone album , if it wasn't their stunning first album , " this it " . " room fire " somewhat failed meet general expectations , it evident band really capable more . strokes chosen very wisely their release memorable radio songs ; ' last nite ' " this it " , ' reptilia ' " room fire " , then ' juicebox ' " first impressions earth " . these songs recall sort complexity style music past generations . they still thoroughly modern sound , julian casablancas ' clever , articulate vocals , backed guitar rhythms , melodious bass , continuous drumming . each their albums almost seem if they're each one whole song broken up into different phases . it good album , would even better itself if there wasn't shadow " this it " looming over it . still , " room fire " appears lost some freshness pep present their first album . songs released radio singles , ' reptilia ' , ' 12:51 ' , ' end no end ' , all catchy enough lure album sales . rest " room fire " , however , contains many songs rather similar one . strokes figured out pretty good formula coming up plausible melody , but how many times formula repeated before fans get bored ? when you hear one their songs , it unmistakably strokes , it good thing they come up their own style . however , this album well their 3rd album " first impressions earth " , suffers too much same . they still one better bands around 00s , though they yet show their full potential	1
don't get me wrong , i am massive white stripes fan . this album , however , not band justice . it lacks absolute passion i come see jack white playing . i saw them coney island this fall i almost passed out . show much better than even show blackpool dvd , which excellent . there numerous songs very good this album , but they dwarfed but all other albums . although , songs this album amazing when performed live . check out live versions death letter truth doesn't make noise dvd	1
this album really so overated i really can't see reason why . probably because it released year after london calling ( 1979 ) which one greatest albums all time . so presumably critics expecting something would match london calling . true this mess throughout , but " beautiful mess " . one best albums 80 definitely . invest	1
while i love this album , i must agree quot ; music fanquot ; regarding mix . first i assured myself albums back 1968 sound thin sometimes , but then i read quot ; music fan reviewquot ; realized my first impression correct . it too bad this mix what it , especially regarding bass drums . still , i urge everyone who likes quot ; americanquot ; music purchase it	1

first things first ; midnight marauders impeccable masterpiece contributed growing brilliance one best years hiphop ( 1993 ) . now , over years it become evident me tribe called quest work constantly compared ! why ?. it always debated whether " low end theory " better than " people instinctive travels paths rhythm " or indeed " midnight marauders " , but this ignorant question not possible answer since each tribe album offers something different each time , ensuring each fan their personal favourite . so get off ish !. now personally , midnight marauders i believe atcq most diverse satisfying album they ever put out , purely down fact each track offers its own unique sound ensures any hiphop fan find their " favourite track " constantly changing . incase you not familiar atcq music , it mainly made up east coast , jazzy/conscious , laid back vibe not really ideal fans gangsta rap hard-hitting drum patterns occupied majority 1993-1994 . q-tip posesses one most laid back voices hiphop , so if you're looking rugged/dark album , sorry you not find it here . similarly , you not find one weak track this album , every track listened somewhere , sometime resulting amazingly consistent album played track 1-15 leaving you wanting hit rewind button . " electric relaxation " considered one best hiphop songs all time , let alone tribe best worth price album alone . " steve biko " sets album off nicely , addictive horns accompanied tip phife catchy flows its sure thing . then , leading replayable classics like " award tour " , " 8 million stories " " oh my god " you find yourself constantly suprised greatness . " keep it rollin '" produced featuing large professor nothing short amazing , would expectable line up so mind-blowing . all all , midnight marauders not just hiphop fans , fans any genre ( especially jazz/funk/soul ) find this album amongst their favourites tribe called quest incorporate variety different sounds/instruments into their music . give this listen , come journey into one best hiphop albums history . you find you may stumbled across personal favourite . peacelyrics - 10/10beats - 10/10replay value - 10/10style - 10/10x factor - 10/10 nothing less than amazingif you found this helpful , check out my other review	1
i bought this when it originally came out back mid 80s ... it cassette ... i wore it out , since it costed so much , i college student .. i didn't rebuy it ... i just recently purchased it ... this cd still all its magic . omar hakim drums branford marsalis horns ... it totally jazz rock fusion gem . there some jazz folks out there totally thumb their nose sting , but they snobs , they should ignored ... i love all songs but my favorite one world/love second wave combo beginning side two . this really treat , it could went 10 minutes far i am concerned . songs tight , band great music swings . there nothing dislike this cd there no weak songs . all two cd set . if you like dream blue turtles would like know what would sounded like live , then get this cd . it very impressive . fun	1
without doubt , gentlemen masterpiece raw emotional outpouring ... feelings confusion , indifference , infidelity , heartbreak , ... oh yes , love all staged against ragged musical backdrop both gripping fiercely compelling . album works so many levels but i feel gentlemen works best when listened one sitting . preferably bottle whiskey nearby . this not kind emotional record you cry ... but one you may feel anger , disgust , guilt .	1
this most listenable cd i heard all year . chris ziter sasha bell trade off vocals excellent effect even guita maestra jeff baron gets into act " rabbit . " this quintessential road trip album travel leave-taking major theme . i driving around top down listening " don't know why " all summer .	1
mind bending super album their career . soundgarden amazing talent come together perfectly this album . heavy , majestic , rolling , pounding rhythms melodies throughout . incredible vocals -- searing guitar -- drums edge . - bass pounding my soul - tempo time changes everywhere . wow this album completely destroys competition their midst . i must listened this album 100 times when it released this day it takes me somewhere else . this album perfect . i saw them tour superunknown disappointed they didn't play any songs badmotorfinger . what ?? how happen ? maybe my memory hazy they might played outshined - but seriously what f** !?	1
fan both david lynch trent reznor , this meeting two worlds no-brainer me . imagine if you putting three soundtracks " cool world " , " twin peaks " " crow " shuffle . that roughly what this sounds like , kind . or maybe it easier just imagine quality songs nin , bowie , smashing pumpkins , lou reed , marilyn manson , rammstein , some spooky/smokey instrumentals . while this might not great what trent " natural born killers " soundtrack , or smooth what badalamenti past , it still something get " lost " .	1

everybody knows heard " times they a-changin , " one bob dylan biggest hits . everybody knows he protest period this record came out smack middle it . but what they may not know there songs love loss this album tear your heart out . bob dylan then now master words . probably greatest wordsmith his generation , mine too . then there song impossible define " hour ship comes .

pink floyd now mythical band , released " dark side moon " early 70 today considered land mark one teh greeatest records all time . " wish you here " album came afterwards 1979 also magnificiant double album " wall " . although it hard compare them , i think these 3 albums all 5 stars masterpieces their own without making further analyzations . " wish you here " concept album dedicated pink floyd fouding member syd barrett left band cause mental ilness just after album " saucerful secrets " releasd ( although he appeared sessions ) sadly left us good june 2006 . it jazzy prog/rock influenced album great melodies 5 songs where 2 last over 10 minutes . david gilmour guitar play fantastic all through album when he get chance jam long periods roger water craftmanship compositions always fundamental great floyd album , even richard wright co-wrote some songs , it would take 20 years until he would again . it starts " shine you crazy diamond part 1 " which so long it cut 2 parts , originally it 9 parts but not newer records . first opener second closer , originally there song called " shine " used concerts , but it changed current title made much longer aswell . actually part starts long jazzy gilmour solo which one his best , only end waters joins sings some lyrics ( related syd ) there great saxophone solo dick perry . song title also echoes syd barrett name shine , you diamond . you say there several parts 2 " shine " songs ( 9 correct ) which all diffrent each other . song number two called " welcome machine " classic pink floyd song wonderful special effects , synthesizers guitars . song talks their bad experiences music industry , hence they even changed label " wish you here " . third song " cigar " more straight rock then other songs it " just " 5 minutes long , it feautures piano , synthesizers this time very funky blistering guitar solo david gilmour . it also suppost deal their experiences music industry . " wish you here " also got little less special effects magical sounds , basically it song where lyrics focus , gilmour plays accoutic guitar waters sings always , " wish you here " got one their best hooks great riffs aswell . it deals loss syd barrett waters inner feelings alienation depression stardome . perhaps this band most deepest song them all , says alot . second part " shine " closes album , it uses far more special effects synthesizers , but once again fantastic solo gilmour . perfect closer one most magical albums all time . overall , one greatest pink floyd albums . only 5 songs appear it , but they all excellent their own cause they all significant meaning they express so many diffrent kinds feelings , musically this takes you world it long , often somber recordings influents jazz prog . rock . concept album dedicated syd barrett 1946-2006 . rest peace	1
rhonda spectacular cd . new traditional bluegrass some mighty fine balads golspel . duets her brother , dolly parton bobby osborne spotlight some great harmonies . sound clean crisp . 60 years since mr. monroe invented bluegrass , it always tied gospel music . if you don't want hear little gospel , why world would you buy bluegrass cd .	1

i really enjoy listening music all orleans cd . especially ones 70 early 80 when wells kelly drummer . it music very easy listening fun . anyone who thinks otherwise doesn't know their music	1
... i still go back it , other coldplay cds , which i've bought , i think , all now . i tend fall love specific songs more than specific bands , but not this case . i find more i listen ( this cd particular ) , then go back other cds , then return , more impressed i am their child-prodigy-like brilliance . coldplay music sweet yet profound ... out its time way . inspire just too tame word what it .	1
combination these two great artists continually results some finest music making ever . two seem almost share mind while performing so perfectly tune each other they come across . i don't think brahms ever sounded so beautiful alive this recording manages sound	1

first time this year i managed get tickets see satriani perform hammersmith apollo london , majority material he played new album . i safely say i believe it his strongest outing since crystal planet . after some very mediocre albums , satriani once more struck back superb balance speed passion ; some lovely melodic hooks ' ten words ' ' love eternal ' , not mention some excellent rocky songs such superbly executed ' bedshift racers ' indeed title track . perhaps only thing stops me giving this album full five stars way which songs don't progress until almost quarter or halfway through song ; beginnings often slightly mediocre , which satriani slightly unusual . however , it must said this step right direction one technically greatest guitar players world . superb alloy melody speed ; step away ' engines creation ' step towards ' crystal planet	1

let get one thing straight : today 09/15/03 , there no quot ; ultimatequot ; john lee hooker collection . but 31 his best tracks , this rhino mini-box comes closest hooker nirvana . ( there 10-cd set , epitath , but since it would take week listen it once , i'll pass . ) problem compiling such collection implied boogie man , charles shaar murray fine biography . hooker recorded number different labels , especially his early days , also under variety different names ( john lee booker , john lee cooker , little pork chop , etc . ) , so it takes lot legwork figure out just which recordings made hooker all , much less obtain rights rerelease them . ( murray spends almost half book such detective work . ) therefore , such classic gems quot ; floodquot ; quot ; whiskey wimmenquot ; not included this set . still , it very good attempt . rhino chosen start collection track quot ; teachin ' blues , quot ; which aural primer how he created his unique sound . thus educated , listener then move such primal tunes quot ; boogie chillunquot ; ( live staple virtually every major blues band canned heat savoy brown , this number hooker chose perform guest spot rolling stones steel wheels tour eighties . ) , quot ; crawling king snakequot ; ( covered wonderfully doors ) , quot ; boom , boomquot ; ( animals ) , his reinterpretation amos milburn song , here entitled quot ; one bourbon , one scotch , one beer ( which , when combined john l house rent boogie , very well covered george thorogood ) . he recorded several such reinterpretations , most notably quot ; frisco bluesquot ; ( this case , he reportedly didn't try get correct lyrics tony bennett famed quot ; i left my heart san francisco ; quot ; he just sat down recorded his own off-the-cuff rendition . ) . conclusion , there plenty john lee hooker best stuff here warrant recommendation ; it just not quot ; ultimatequot ; his most devoted fans would want it	1

i love mike bloomfield , thrilled hear this recording immediately ordered it . what great dissappointment ! drummer so incredibly bad it hard believe he not dragged off stage mid song . fabulous numbers like " don't throw your love me so strong " completely ruined . he no clue slow blues groove , seems completely lost actually goes into waltz cut time !! i am not exaggerating . worst recorded case incompetence i ever heard . bass player gives up after while just follows . it amazing bloomfield even capable playing such sabotage , testament his great musicianship . very unfortunate what would great addition bloomfield recorded work . hard listen . i recommend you check out fabulous " my labors more " nick gravenites some best recorded examples bloomfield live still available	1

it this album mckennitt awesome talent composer/arranger truly finds distinctive voice -- somewhere celtic , jazz , folk world music -- so prominent beloved her later work . most music some lyrics well " parallel dreams " written mckennitt their entirety rather than arrangements traditional tunes or poems . there still sense quiet restraint many songs this album , but this time it underlain pregnant intensity synth chords percussion , released into music just enough give it air mysterious purpose without overwhelming mckennitt ethereal vocals nuanced harpistry . guest musicians include rick lazar udu drum congas , ratesh dasj tablas , guitarist brian hughes , violinist oliver schroer , cellist , bass tamboura player george koller , mandolin-player david woodhead , piper patrick hutchinson , percussionist al cross , shelly berger pzud . loreena mckennitt previous album " drive cold winter away , " next one sequence , continuing her intriguing development composer , " visit .

first all , i'd liked start off saying this cd review should more than 3 1/2 stars . what hell wrong you people , people bugging if you think " survivor " better than this . album bunch fillers just plain " pointless " . these tracks more mature , better when performed live . i saw them when they new york last august touring , i especially inpressed michelle . she killed " through love " , well her solo single " you know " . honest i wish they never broke up , because there lack true rb groups out there . they need get reunion together give these other groups run their money .	1
what incredible career . chris whitley very special man musical icon went largely unnoticed his lifetime -which all too short . i've listening chris ' music since 1991 seen his intense live performances everytime he came los angeles area . without getting overly sappy this , ' reiter ' one cw greatest records . if only flaming lips cover , " mountain side " . it one my favorite cw songs ( more chris ' song now , than flaming lips , which he huge fan ) . it real treat what ended up his last album , he came full-circle way , back electric sounds 1995 ' din ecstacy ' , while still adding contemporary touch his unique ever-evolving style music . it getting harder me write this review , album currently playing background i want commence grooving ! it too bad amazon doesn't make song samples available , because visceral quality music immediate . highlights : " mountain side " , " reiter " , " i go evil " , " inn " , " all beauty taken you this life remains forever " . if you love chris , go buy two copies this album asap . even if you've never heard note his music , go buy two copies anyway . your life changed forever	1
this one my favorite soundtracks ! first half cd much better than second half , but that because first several songs all actually sung movie . i love " please , mr. jailer " ... it really sexy song , fun listen . this soundtrack filled great 50s songs . it tons fun . only thing i'm little disappointed two songs soundtrack differ movie versions . " doin time bein young " completely different version ... they took out background singers ( other jailbirds accompanied cry baby movie ... you know-they're ones who shout , " stinkin tank ! stinkin tank ! " ) , james intveld ( singing voice cry baby ) singing also different this song . movie , voice yelling more than singing , but not cd . i liked it movie better , since it seemed more realistic johnny depp actually singing , but it still good . also , " mr. sandman " different . it hard describe what differences , but they definitely there . parts , i think it sung octave higher , but who knows . aside these differences , this soundtrack awesome . if movie made you jump out your seat dance , then you gotta get this cd .	1
i've this cd since it first came out it blessed me so much . it definitely people who true worshippers because it highly annointed . i love whole cd but my favorites tracks #4 - #9 we use these tracks our communion services . i also used these tracks our women retreat everyone blessed	1
i'm not raving mathis fan although i like his music . stopping off cd outlet allows you preview cds before you buy them , i put headphones just out curiosity see how mathis sang warren songs . wow , i pleasantly suprised . after hearing don't take away my heaven ( my favorite song cd ) time this night over , i hooked . this cd become one my favorites ! those who say mathis doesn't sing it well ( fill blank ); perhaps this because it not way you first heard song . highly recommend mathis fans nonfans alike	1
yeah i like missy , but i'm not sure this her absolute best . i like it , but i like her latest album better . me , while all songs really good , two best work it you hear me ?. you hear me such beautiful , heartfelt sad songs around . i love it play one so often . it such nice tribute lot great singers who died too early . it beautiful . anyway , this cd very good , but not her best	1

this cd amazing ! first time i heard it record store , i havn't stopped listening it ... such refreshing change top 10 mainstream . it all latin flavor without overbearing . anyone appreciate this cd especially those who like move ! some songs bit slow but even those make great mood music . even though its short album - i promise you won't ever skip song	1

really puzzled so many bad reviews this great batch ofsongs . my expectations so low , these songs soincredibly likeable . " bad sound " really just verynice , very informal , very fresh recording . i'm not even fanof beth orton , i think this just one mostwonderful rewarding efforts i've heard years	1
disraeli gears cream breakthrough achievement . their most famous piece work , their highest praised too . , it deserves all this . album fully entertaining . some spots may lower than usual standard , but it doesn't really get boring . length okay , some say it too short , but i like my albums this long . songs then . album kicks off strange brew . though it isn't much opener ( i'd put swlabr instead ) , it still nice song some nice clapton blues licks . after , bruce kicks agressive bass line , eric follows guitar riff everybody knows : sunshine your love . standout thing this song baker drums , course , you can't forget clapton solo . last two songs singles , so album really starts after sunshine your love . world pain got some mixed up melodies , may require few listens get used . i like song . dance night away one my favourite songs album . eric ginger really make this one . clapton rhythm guitar tone excellent here , leads sound pretty psychedelic . i really like drums during chorus . blue condition isn't very good track . it drags , lyrics sound strange it repetitive , plus it isn't fun last two . i like some parts it though . tales brave ulysses sounds lot like white room , song band would release later . white room much better . it album instead , put opener , this could my favourite album ever . anyway , song isn't bad . not much say it , though i'm not fond lyrics . swlabr damn fine track , most fun album . hooks get your head you'll singing them no time . great solo there . we're going wrong excellent . atmosphere set up ginger drums , then eric joins soft guitar then some nice licks . i like jack vocals this . i don't know what happened near end , when eric ginger go crazy play something completely out context , but then jack closes song nicely . outside woman blues i'm not much fond . blues lick repeated too many times , it isn't song i particularly like . take it back got fun start , i like john vocal start , but then it loses its magic . group finishes album mother lament , joke song , doesn't spoil album any way . i like how they sing boy-by . anyway , damn fine album , very enjoyable some nice songs . i highly recommend it .	1
both first fifth symphonies considered gems bernstein later mahler cycle dg . previously , they available separately full price each . but now , thankfully , they released together , songs wayfarer featuring thomas hampson , 2 1 price . shame amazon not recommending this one instead 2 cds separately . i guess it more profits than recommendations	1
i not know this group before . their songs much easy listen , optimal musical experience	1
vocalist lead track well aria several other tracks throughout this album , i am dissapointed i not get recognition i promised jenkins . however , i think album beautiful i am pleased i involved	1
explosions sky debut album , originally only released extremely small numbers cd-r , remastered rerelesed , much anticipation fans . ignore band self-doubt written cd itself -- this solid , amazing album . less buildup/ " explosions " , eits crafted truly all-encompassing grandeur , while this album feels less produced than their later efforts , it defintiely matches up more recent work . my only complaint less impressive sound quality . standout tracks song our fathers , glittering blackness , especially magic hours	1
once again , kindred family soul more than satisfied neo-soul music lover . entire cd truly remarkable , i love " grown folks " feel it . i unsure if they could top first one , but " this life together " right . no song this album skip over	1
i like ludacris . don't get me wrong . but this album kinda annoying . blow it out yer ass song hard listen repetitive . splash waterfalls song also really redudant , if you heard it radio many times i , you might agree . he just talks through too much this album ... instead rapping .. beats kinda weak repetitive .. there 3 good songs this one : diamonds back , we got , eyebrows down . rest them kinda annoying . but like i said i like luda .. just get red light district or word mouf instead	1
its great lay down listin this cd night just listin ramblings old man . dead radio city hard put into certain category because it touches them all . burroughs goes disturbing revelations dark comedies simple life findings . music backing his voice this album pretty good even though it sometimes eclipses his voice times . burroughs great monotonic voice this album which creates great atmosphere really drills home his jaded , disgruntled , sarcastic message . all all every song here not winner but most album pure nirvana	1
good beat + punk riffs + catchy , irreverent lyrics = best punk album yearsthere likely lots disagreement what kind music art brut plays . it punk , post-punk , indie ? classify it how you want . bottom line me this great album , likes which i haven't heard since ramones or sex pistols . this what music supposed : fun . if you want world-changing political message your music , listen u2 . if you want fun album harkens back punk anthem classics like " beat brat , " you must buy this album .	1
this cd absolutely , 100% lives up it hype . not only it collection great , dynamic , energetic songs but , it also pivotal it release . just " never mind bollock , here sex pistols " 1970 , " nevermind " 1990 . this changed landscape music . " nevermind " essential listening history rock roll . cobain killing himself even made work much more monumental	1
this cd contains all excellent music astounding tim burton film , " nightmare before christmas . " music even better than movie no song disappointment . cd comes booklet not only gives words songs , but gives indication which if characters signing . cd worth money spent !	1
randomly decided check out what rating this awesome band got , only 4 ?? theyre definitely 5 ! their sound really unique , their songs really good . exit , emergency my favorite song entire album , sunrise goodbyes really really good , bob bonnie such sweet song one my favs also , one more won't hurt definitely one my favorites , basically all songs all really unique sooo good . houston calls one my favorite bands ever since they came out	1
excellent condition when arrived fast shipping awsome cd !	1
i don't any their albums , but i remember lot their music . i autographed 45 queen-bee(bo mom)label season whitch . i saw them every teen night they western bowl ( cincinnati , oh ) , there hometown late 60 early 70 . we followed those guys all over tristate . my early days groupie ! happier care free time	1
probably her best dance-able track ever . however , james fernandis " jjmf " doesn't know what he talking . he giving you vinyl track listing . there goes eight bucks . amazon track listing accurate except they removed word " edit " because this idiot . severely sucks because original " groove " best mix madonna track i've ever heard , even better than three-way ones someone mixed few years ago . tracy turns this track gold , but it doesn't appear available long-form outside double 12 " vinyl . i think abba sample ( flutey thing ) lame both album price mixes . other mixes also inferior , but least they very hard-hitting beats distinguish themselves tracy , which needs surround matrixing , boosting subs , some reduction mids mains during club playback . i think it certainly worth trouble if you find version , though . it full digital recording , so i don't like idea spinning it vinyl when it ought available cd . copy sirius played pristine edited cd single version	1
fivestar , wonderful , creative , excilent rb album jacksons first album group shows maturity their material . micahel jackson already fire off wall leading singles such " don't stop till you get enough " " rock you .

i am usually quite miffed when sarah nettwerk decide re-release old sarah songs but this case i am * very * happy ! this two-disc edition " mirrorball " perfect long-time sarah fans it covers her first four ( best ) albums it isn't polished 1999 release . sound quality excellent it almost feels like mclachlan concert . excellent addition die-hard sarah fans	1

joe jackson so underrated it crime . only artist i compare him aspect " dan reed network " -- go look them up mesmerized . but " you can't get what you want " just so defines 1980 me -- it splendid song . there it , 5th track disc 2 -- just click link play it windows midea player or realplayer -- isn't just great song ? check out " steppin ' out " well -- if you -- find video " steppin ' out " -- damn new york city such spell viewer early 80 .	1
i must admit i never really payed any attention towards while he alive but when his unfortunate death occurred , it made me curious check him out considering how critically acclaimed his only album . i bought it i discovered very talented mc . summer 2000 , much anticipation built this posthumous release good reason . diehard big fan , they may heard some material appears here . " ebonics " circulated single streets " enemy " appeared d.i.t.c. album . but not everything new . those not very familiar , this obviously sound fresh you ; but plenty verses previously appeared freestyles but now it provided new backdrop attempt make it sound better . they succeed . primo produces top-notch material three tracks touched , particularly " platinum plus " which kane destroys . pete rock ron browz wonders " holdin ' it down " " size em up . " injected casual listener "' 98 freestyle , " which often lauded greatest freestyle all-time . also shows diversity impeccable storytelling skills displayed " heist " " casualties dice game " ( despite its weak beat ) . what i like this better than other posthumous albums hip-hop this actually sounds like style production he would rock over . it great album it only supports claim he " king punchline . " ' ask beavis / i get nuthin ' butt-head ' become legendary . he amazing lyrically . he raps way he talks raps swagger jay-z would later inherit . he dearly missed it unfortunate he only alive one album master .	1
we accidentally left this cd car we sold . we held out quite while our empty case , but whenever we'd hear one songs we'd tell ourselves , " we replace cd ! " so we finally . we not typical buyers ; we don't buy music/videos indiscreminantly , not huge music library . but this one , us , " must " ..	1
i such high hopes this one ! however , after dozen tries , i cannot stand this music . it uninteresting possibly contains worst songwriting lyrics i heard years . or maybe it schmultzy music so unbelievably weak . whatever it , it no magic , no risk , no intelligence .	-1
ok , so i know that gonna raise some hackles . but , i can't think last time adult i this much music stick my head . back when i first heard ewf it time i almost nothing but listen music . now i barely time . but i make time this cd . melodic contemporary without selling out their roots . how many bands this . i am so grateful they came back edge midtempo middle age pulled out some real funk . why everyone assume just because you over 40 you wanna hear midtempo ballads only ? other choice uptempo garbage no melodies so many vocal runs you wanna prescribe something make it stop . these guys voices still great- so nice hear maurice ( even though he doesn't tour ) phillip their thing . i wish someone would get stevie , prince handful other great rb performers work artists who respect their music but bring back some edge they sorely missing . this collection music certainly shows how well work . ok- maybe kenny . thing coulda left off - but it last track , you skip it ... i don't mind it much i thought i would	1
i like caravan , i like stuff like camel too . but , they don't leave you too impressed , not even bothered , it doesn't engrave itself within . caravan makes nice little pittoresque undisturbing prog pieces . that it . they neat , cute , good , smart , musically interesting - but not too daring or substantial . not essential . i recall 70s when neighbour girl came home after her flute lessons played small pieces together her brother piano then their mum used drum bongos tambourine . it nice , really , but musical experience it just makes you long real thing . yngwie malmstrom not heavy metal artist , he just guy who loves play guitar , especially scales . caravan land grey pink needed , i don't deny , get album your collection . but caravan generally speaking you might just proceed hatfield north once even though i would go step further egg like . it ok , i don't expect you agree .	1
bill great . also check out my favorite relaxing artist , genie . my fave whisper	1
this man grown into life his music shows it this former boyband member(dreamstreet)is man who enjoys singing it shows this recording it not those expecting anything like his former boyband status it rocks it rolls it good listen unlike justin timberlake his himself this cd i like i would say give it listen	1
happily freed jonathan cain drippy grip , neal schon reaches his full potential this double-album . i think , among other things , percussion , sheer energy evident this album help push it far beyond what accomplished beyond thunder ( beautiful though album ) . this probably my all-time favorite cd category guitar-players-gone-solo . muy excelente	1
people blew this cd way out proportion how good it . yeah it sold 9 million held #1 top 40 charts good minute , but c'mon people . he remade song when girls preschool playing jump rope . i think he decent job , when trying please certain crowd ( mainly crowd who listens lot alternative music very little rap ) . now rest cd really didn't appeal me except batter up e.i. ( before they became hit singles ) some it pointless singing weak catchy rhymres attempt get your ears tuned , get airplay radio ( good example this track loven me ) . i sit here type how bad nelly rapper , but would very pointless . so however many people not this album , you get it add sales or you real it just not buy it never think it again	-1

bangles - greatest hits . what i say ? i really enjoyed this album . not only it contain my favourite tracks " walk like egyptian " " hazy shade winter " but there other tracks , honest , i hadn't heard before but found them catchy all same . i rate this album alongside belinda carlisle greatest hits - which i reckon great " road trip " album . i unashamedly admit liking lot 80s music - whether lyrics make any sense or not , isn't all end all - so bangles get my vote .	1
my fancy apple pie la mode gives me happy face shiny brown eyes . knowing i am independent woman . i know i find sexy daddy who bring me emotion make me feel like i'm dangerously love . even though ........ my story beauty sweet , sassy gospel melody . i know i am talented . forever i am not nasty girl , i am forever bootylicious i my mother thank . so i want say thank you . but my goal life become suvivor like destiny child when they recorded this album .	1
this far one worse things i've ever heard . right up there chingy or changy or whatever it . they should ashamed . it miracle say " laffy taffy " still show their faces public . shame shame . record , d4l , para-quote your own lyrics , no " i can't it it like you " nor would i want . i would never suck so bad . 1 star here it comes	-1
back day , there group perfomed groups brought whole house down . blue magic member latter . this collection filled classic gems nobody able replace ( sideshow , three ring circus ) , introduced me tunes i never heard before , but just beautiful tunes everyone remembers ( land make-believe , teach me ) . even there dance tunes bounce give you reason jig it up ( look me up , magic #) . anyone who into real music must this disc , because it not always who you heard radio or who performed concert , but how they affected you while listening . these guys definitely part legacy never denied	1

this review contains nothing new what you already read other customers who heard , own this particular album . this straight up country music album , what country album should . i bought this album mainly because i blown away song " your man " . although songs here strong , besides smash hit " your man " , highlights this record : lord mercy country boy , way down south , gravity . why i didn't give this album full 5 star there some songs i didn't particularly enjoy : " no rush " drag , too slow my liking therefore i think it entitled appropriately " white noise " okay song , i just never fan jon anderson . overall , josh second release worth listen . enjoy	1
sundays come out cd once decade , thus putting me constant cravings new material . though camera obscura very original very much their own band , they satisfy cravings only harriet wheeler could touch . truly vast intimate same time , voice speaks something very deep , sad lovely inside you	1

213 always revered west coast super-group public never got hear . but demo tapes leaked basement sessions always tease fans braidless snoop dogg , dj warren , pre-fedora nate dogg . last five years , each aforementioned promised this album list different labels , different title different themes . what it boiled down snoop , nate warren finding themselves some spare time their hands . hard way portrays crew artists search creative vigor they dozen plus years ago original 213 . warren trademarked himself laid back mc . hits like " this dj " , more recent , " i want it all " , he never expected raise his voice , or stray his effortless flow . snoop , other hand , one time edgy mc range emotion . his sharp venomous verses tracks like , " pump pump " " shiznit , " snoop deft sticking words up under your ribcage . older tracks reference points because those days 213 hail . it not overly laid back snoop , slightly less laid back warren , impromptu nate . exactly what we're getting . too smooth , thus energy-lacking effort , sounds more like gap band album than any hip-hop triad . most blatant rap tracks like , " 213 tha gangsta clicc " " mlk " dominated aggressive synthesized beats . softer side things shine through because better half this album comes smooth tracks like , " summer " , " run up " , " lil ' girl . " warren g cadences throughout album taking all-too close resemblance his half-brother , dr. dre style delivery . " mlk " " absolutely " major proof . lyrical side things , nate steals show . " mary jane " " so fly " two album more exciting cuts reveal nate fabulous quality . he doesn't stay boxed-in hooks , but rather nate dogg dances around most verses this album one-of-a-kind baritone croon . luckily , dave chapelle rick james persona only guest , lasting interlude . but , wake rick death , humor lost . while 213 didn't water-down their album outsiders , much desired considering years hype . one most disturbing facts 213 album it no producer . warren refused produce anything since lackluster sales his last album . result , this album uses music supplied producers who no cognition what original 213 , or should sound like . only reputable producer fits mold dj pooh , who responsible " groupie luv . " while nottz , hi-tek , kanye west wonderful producers , this wasn't their place . one effort seem match early vibe , " joysticc . " this track uses " juicy fruit " percussion , thick synth tones new wave chorus . track nate dominates " so fly . " this outstanding soul chop ( vinyl hiss ) provided none other than missy eliot . we even forget smilez southstar tried this same beat before . otherwise , this album barely separates itself eastsidaz album . perhaps hardest reality this album jaded element . it hard watch your heroes get so cocky they forget why they're originally it . it widely hoped this album would return way things . instead , we three aging stars total ignorance their history together , using their fame wealth large subject matter , over foreign production . after dozen years believing 213 west super group , this album only affirms fact it truly westside connection who wears crown . 2.5 outta ' 5	1
i listened this cd few times love parts it . but first i address something ... regarding " fallen rock zone " lyrics , why would these dissuade anyone listening cd ? song not favor pedophiles any way . you just scared because they say masterbater ? seriously . i love first half this cd because it pumped up fast paced . second half more downer . singer very good his voice , its more high pitched ( he like alto ) , like mars volta . difference here i stand ra , but not tmv . i became interested this band when i heard " rectifier " chronix radio ( internet via shoutcast ) . flaws , i think they just repeat too many lines . come up some more lyrics ! yes , i like rectifier , but he says " rectifier " like 20 times during it . this makes songs less shelf life because you get tired them . anyway , i really like this cd because it seems something you listen anyone . i'd rather pull this out than flames , opeth , or trivium when i'm someone i don't know too well . much more accessible music . enjoy	1
i love john hiatt . he so under-rated over-looked . he so talented . great writer great musician . bring family , perfectly good guitar , slow turning ... all rock ! check out any his albums ... all great	1
this recording established fan galas ' work , it far more demanding listener than any other her vary varied works , except perhaps schrei . it aims , instance , spots emulate tedium insanity such it seem self-indulgently repetitive , or quiet , or extreme . one might well ask if demands placed listener justified ; one might well answer , quot ; no . quot ; get most out it , however , one must obey command quot ; play only maximum volumequot ;; good headphones hour dedicated nothing but concentration should also strongly recommended . complete opus galas ' work , there no choice but buy quot ; endurequot ; this recording open attentive mind , but really little make it seem , some way , almost academic spite galas ' perfectly self-evident sincerity . rewards certainly there patient ; otherwise , simply buy everything else her	1
who sell out milestone recording , years long standing favorite mine . i own two different vinyl copies which i cherished . my decision buy this cd based friend recommendation fact there " extra songs " . i unprepared just how many additional songs included this release , most them simply jaw-droppingly astounding . my personal favorite bonus track sell out who version " melancholia " , which i heard previously only pete townshend demo he released " scoop " album . notes " scoop " tell perhaps it roger who unhappy melancholia it wasn't quite " macho " enough . also coca-cola track just simply rocks . what amazing band who ! this record epic ! if you unfamiliar this record then i seriously advise stopping your first several listenings rael ( i ) order truly experience album it released intended heard . only after should you dive into all these bonus tracks your reward ! remastering here excellent should played excessively loud volumes over over over again order truly appreciate it . this quite simply inspiring should belong collection every music lover any interest ' 60 music or british pop . sophistication craft , range genres song song , songwriting playing no equal anywhere . even if you think you may not like who ( perhaps you only heard classic rock ' 70 anthems , or maybe you thought tommy pretensious long-winded ) then you owe it yourself hear them their absolute creative peak !	1

heard these guys 2006 taste chicago just before ray davis ; tough headliner usurp . my morning jacket delivered awesome live set lot fans place : i picked up cd they maintained layered , reverb-heavy sound they live album . trippy , immediately impressive original but reminiscent what innovative old school sixites rock bands worked : melodic recognizability . they've certainly picked bones classic artists bits songs , but their mix stuff magical i look forward their next album . well !	1
i am great fan allison moorer , very anxious her produce new cd . my first reaction her pop-like songs this cd disappointment , mainly because i didn't expect them allison but also because that not my favorite style music . nonetheless , after giving album fair chance i find it wonderful recording . first , allison performs these pop , or lets just say " happier " songs , very well . she showing she perform mainstream music right up there very best . i soon found myself enjoying these songs addition rest . still , allison true calling where she stands without peer , her spellbindingly haunting , smooth liquid gold ballads . no one even comes close allison here . well , " getting somewhere " not neglect this aspect allison . my opinion , " new years day " worth entire price this cd . " how she it " wonderful . " hallelujah " " where you " so smooth beautiful you might danger melting . these classic allison moorer highest caliber . then , allison ends her " getting somewhere " track . it pure allison , fantastic song . how any fan hers deny themselves these tracks ? i not comprehend why other reviewers disappointed this album . so allison tried few " lite " songs , big deal . give her break ! she them quite well any case . unlike some reviewers , i think band best she . i've always thought her other bands amateurish , although even lent bit it own charm , made you realize allison so good she didn't need great band . guitar " fuzz tone " poor , but i'm guitar freak . one criticism i cd some muddiness it . if i didn't buy it this reason though , i would bigger looser . allison , thank you very much this recording effort , please don't wait so long make ! maybe someday , when your heart finally touched right place , you could even record christmas album . your voice would awesome singing many classics such " what child this " , " silent night " etc . i'll buy many you sing . good luck ( god care you allison )	1
these guys greatest this best collection available . take advantage it buy it , you won't dissapointed	1
i think asia one great rock bands all time . they easy criticize but what there not like ? great lyrics , great music , great singing .... asia pre-payne still my most enjoyable music off shelf . i continued follow wetton his solo journey . i miss strong cd beginning end hoping icon would it . it not but it start . songs lyrics thoughtful well produced but i also wanted them let go bit some fun . there some tracks here some their best but overall it doesn't stand up their original ' 90s cds asia . this just teaser though . i want cd these two icons rock	1

great mix shows band deversity . very enjoyable . i think this audioslave best work so far	1
keane one greatest bands all time . fact they use piano/keyboards/bass/drums every song , no guitars all , shows they more musically sophisticated than all other mindless guitar rock that out there . there more than enough guitar-based bands . " somewhere only we know " best song all time . beautiful lyrics , solid piano backbone , steady , moderate tempo , make it brilliant album-opener . album upbeat pop/rock , like " bend break " " this last time , " slow , sorrowful ballads , like " she no time " " we might well strangers , " gentle , peaceful melodies , like " sunshine , " slightly ethereal , unearthly ones like " untitled 1 " " bedshaped . " plus , all lyrics intensely personal honest , ones everyone relate , one way or . all together , album classic , one ( if american public knows anything music ) live known one greatest albums ever made . every song masterpiece . there no fillers .	1
this 1988 disc revolutionary many ways example what hip-hop might become it not entire generation heavily marketed dervishes parachute pants manipulating stereotypes fast buck guys who used word " bitch " punctuation while shamelessly exploiting their own culture . 18 years later i still recite lyrics every song verbatim i haven't heard any songs over decade . radical , extreme lyrics over mile-wide grooves all unrelenting pace . fans james brown band , jbs and/or maceo parker recognize many samples . excellent , brilliant " radical extreme " . get it	1
one best things blues or blue rock simplicity it . since there specific defined rules 12 bar blues system , we consumers subjected almost every kind imaginable . i myself , never get tired endless blues guitar heroes like srv , johnny winter , eric clapton , bb king , albert king every other professional or local artist emulates their heroes create blues rock . repetitive ? sure thing ! boring ? never ! i understand when critics blues complain all songs sound same , because i make same argument endless pop hip-hop gracing our radio stations 24/7 . so consumer blues rock , i've heard same stuff over over . then there sonny landreth . sonny , everything bit different . his blues not quite traditional ; his rock not quite rock . but whatever it , it needs played loud ! we consumers blues rock should celebrate sonny his band creating something truly unique different . blues guitar player , myself countless other players grab slide play few tunes open or , maybe get crowd going , but none us really care truly commit slide guitar full time . it takes lot get guitar player stray comfort zone standard tuning . sonny all bets off . his style truly indescribable point i would throw my hands air if i ever tried emulate him . this record top bottom true piece work . if i stolen i would definitely buy copy . i only few complaints , which very minor admittedly nit-picking . i think " broken hearted road " misplaced track order . i really wished rockin ' opener " native stepson " immediately followed high octane " gone pecan " just keep energy going . i really like " broken hearted road " , but i find myself skipping it because tempo . but , this live record , so if sonny chose play it order , so it ! second , i love instrumentals , but i wished sonny would added few more tracks he sings . sonny voice doesn't blow anyone away , he knows guitar how he makes his living , he got such amazing selection great tunes he sing , why not throw couple ? i don't ever want associate sonny countless " instrumental guitar " players never sing , because anyone owns any his solo studio records knows he write sing . thirdly , maybe this due editing , sonny rarely speaks crowed during breaks track . like i said , he may several conversations crowd , but it could edited shorten running time , but i always enjoy hearing those kinds things records . lastly , i want more ! more tracks , volume ii , extended cut , dvd i'll take anything this point ! buy this record . every tune least one or two points blow your mind ! i'm like , " what ... how he doing ? " if you ever get chance see sonny live , go it !	1
lang lang who ? he not poetry cortot ; he isn't technically gifted horowitz or barere ; he not structural playing arrau , nor deep sonority rubinstein . what frustrates me most he tries copy horowitz . i symphony hall last year listening him play mozart , chopin , rachmaninoff , schumann liszt , his last piece horowitz arrangement liszt second rhapsody . who hell he think he ? he lacked power , articulation clarity , magic . when horowitz played carmen everybody went home astonished if they run into force nature . i went home full question marks . he plays fast . really fast . yet his rachmaninoff unethical , his chopin sonata stale lackluster , his liszt so embellished it becomes patchy lopsided . i fell asleep when he played kinderszenen . lang lang concerts like circus acts - what happened purity music-making ? it really possible walk stage flashing lights like some rockstar would , then launch into mozart sonata ? if he really turns-out future classical music , i think it would time me hide monastery somewhere eastern europe listen cortot recordings rest my life . day would sad day indeed	1
rem monster incredible cd . opening chords whats frequency kenneth closing seconds feedback you this no ordinary rem album . this my favorite rem album . most rem purist dismiss this cd post grunge bollocks . they dead wrong . if you see this cd cut out bin buy it , heck buy two give one friend	1
there already plenty other well written reviews this album but i just wanted add one thing . don't afraid because you've heard this album lumped matchbox 20 or other similar bands . i'd recommend this more someone who fan say u2 , velvet underground or 90 brit pop than generic late 90 " alternative rock " . lyrics dark , guitars unique complex bass drums tight . forget whatever you might think this album check it out .	1
this remastered collection maria callas ' art converted me . i've hard callas legend most my listening life , hard her singing , not only these pages . i always wanted more voice , feeling its limitations created decline other aspects her art . even ceding her genius , always there remained uncomfortable appreciation ; voice itself way . listening this superlative disc simply opened my eyes ears ! after 40 years listening this stuff experiencing so many singers again again , this recording callas suddenly revelation me . this singing imbued amazing integrity . i'm astounded . ebben ? ne andr lontana ( la wally ) offers unheard callas , channeling her dramatic understanding into music , instead alongside it . i always felt callas fearful singer , when it came right down it . how wrong could i ! one track after , this collection presents fearless art full bloom , singer capable pathos not only grabs you , but blesses . her j'ai perdu mon eurydice ( orphe et eurydice ) mesmerizing , completely free true . puccini almost classical its restraint , wonderful experience because it . her singing arias gioconda louise incandescent . i dont know what brought me light , but i recommend you listen this recording maria callas . sequence arias presented especially fine , serafin , pretres , karajan contribute notably - maria callas complete revelation every way , supreme musician command high art . check it yourself .	1
anyway , zevon starts out one his great puffs smoke : " some days i feel like my shadow smoking me , some days asbestos don't shine . " i love image shadow smoking person -- it evokes lung cancer , state yellowed teeth , death , yet , lyrics carefully crafted : some days zevon , i'm going presume there plenty chain-smoking going this album , feel his shadow smoking him asbestos not shining . even face certain frivolous lawsuits , implication remains there days when asbestos shines -- when warren still casts his own smoke . later smoke , we're reminded warren " smoking down [ his ] asbestos-faking life times , " lump hits cancer . oh , this painful puff . it so painful , so many levels ( smoke-1 special essential viewing ) , warren . but like all nicotine works music , it somehow raises spirit -- both listener singer-songwriter .	1
very funny . very stimulatng . this my second hip hop cd ever ( after gnarls barkely st. elsewhere ) i can't wait find out more mf doom dangermouse . if you like clever rhymes/adult swim/alternative music or whatever , give this album listen . ps : i no hip-hop credibility all , so apologies those who cringe reading this review	1
up this point , my knowledge bonnie prince consisted master everyone , ease down road , i see darkness ( which , my humble opinion , contains greatest love song ever written all around ) . i absolutely no knowledge matt sweeney . given , when i popped superwolf , sound initially caught me off guard . i persisted , course , rewarded fantastically woven tapestry lyricism melody . it chock full sweet , easy melodies , harmonizing vocal overlays , well-placed crescendos characteristic oldham earlier stuff . favorite tracks : bed sleeping - " bed sleeping , love making , you know , love , i am yours taking . " lift us up - " people , don't you wonder how lord brought you under ? " only someone running - " if you melted , then i would melt myself all into you	1
" born usa " bruce best selling but also most misunderstood album . music very catchy more more commercial " pop " sound than his earlier records . fact , it produced 7 hit singles which also received heavy airplay mtv . this all contributed bruce transformation rock outsider pop culture icon - almost point parody . but bruce , through his integrity authenticity , managed hold his true identity continue make great music . this album doesn't reach artistic heights bruce best work , such " darkness edge town " or " born run " . but springsteen still writing high quality songs , including standouts like " no surrender " glory days " . yes , this pop music . but it still better than 98% other pop music out there . despite upbeat tempos joyful melodies most these songs dark overcast them , springsteen includes his usual cast working class characters bottom economic ladder desperate find better life . these aren't corporate bigshots benefitting " reaganomnics " 1980 . but regular joes whom " american dream " still mostly fantasy yet come true . course , reason this album so often misunderstood many people took title track jingoist anthem rather than bitter tale ex-vietnam vetern it clearly . this isn't bruce best album . but it still one well worth owning .	1
nice companion volume bob seger original greatest hits album 1994 , " greatest hits 2 " not only focuses seger latter-day material , it also goes long way towards making up fact " greatest hits " featured more ballads less rock n'roll than average bob seger concert including grinding rockers like " katmandu " , " rock roll never forgets " " fire down below " . there ballads here too , though , it good thing there , because title track seger " beautiful loser " album one his best slow songs . among lesser-known songs two latter-day sides " manhattan " " new coat paint " , well brand-new cuts " satisfied " " tomorrow " , two hard-rocking songs some his best music years . it shame " greatest hits 2 " , like its predecessor , ignores bob seger early cameo/parkway singles his first several lps well . but it still fine addition " greatest hits " , even if seger two live albums remain best introduction his music	1

wait new juliana hatfield album often more painful wait cd release should . thankfully ever it worth it . this amazing , fan reference point i'd say it sounds like lyrical bite bed combined heavy guitar riffage total system failure . wierd thing no matter how much distortion feeback it layered tunes still shine through , video bouncy little guitar tune i'd rather here blaring radio than ashley , kelly , lohan , et al . no offence , i'm quite fond some them but abscence juliana radio , television most magazines hurts my head sometimes . maybe her tendency break up cheery tunes jagged noise cussing time time puts people off , i don't know . everytime i read something her website where she sounding more more disillusioned record bix grind i fear she'll give up one day . however , time we fantastic juliana hatfield record gorge . here ( hopefully ) many more .	1
i've reading reviews say this cd pop album , it sounds like beatles and/or beach boys ..... i couldn't disagree more ....... it rock opera , if ever there one , finely tuned hip shakingly fabulous !! if you've never heard luke voice , you incredible surprize !! he draws you into his world lets you wade around his creativity . what more would you ask musical genius ? some songs tender make your soul swoon , some rock roll mantra , but all them stick your aura like glue . he chatting god through some it trying answer questions himself .... or perhaps , all us . personally , i like dancing around house luke god ... it like what forbidden , sweetened heavenly cosmos . oh , way , astrological aspects ?.... he got them ..... most intrinsically , talented muscians ...... keep dreaming , luke , we like mystical ride . cheers , kiw	1
this may fun listen ... 16 years ago . lot music back then aged into some best music all time . this not . this cd just not good honest you . it very immature ( which not bad thing ) , but you tell , like reviewer below me said , they lived off controversy not true talent . if you want some real rap , or just good music general , i think you should look elsewhere	-1
this my most favorite cd ever . performance delivered this band nothing short breathtaking . style guitarist very original unique . style singer amazing , he write poetry better than any famous poet so truthful personal , it just gets you . his voice sounds so intense also . drums very moody , range sweet , soothing beat hardcore pounding . thing this band live show far best you ever see . they cover amps stage flower petals singer holds boquet flowers starts thrashing it around when music starts . singer flail his arms spin around fall ground while telling his emotional confessional message audience , drummer beast pounds his drums like madman , guitarist swing his guitar uncontrolled uncoordinated ways all around his body . bassist saunter around stage if searching some sort answer . it truly amazing show take your breath away . ticket see them worth any amount money . live show far better than cd also . please support this band . even though this band christian they not all preachy type , they deliver their beliefs way makes you want comfort him or praise lord him . if you aren't already believer don't surprised if their music and/or live show makes you believer	1
this my personal favorite . it shame mccain doesn't greater following . everything this album poetic every sense . instrumentation fantastic lyrics , true brilliance music , amazing . there fantastic acoustic version " i'll " quieter , tamer features lyrics , though it loses wonderful saxophone pieces song trademark . true , this album quieter all around , noteable exception " anything good me , " which really only ' rock ' song here . " beautiful life " " just your thing " eloquent commentaries life today . though this album doesn't much upbeat tunes like " guinevere " or " alive " common edwin mccain earlier albums , it poetic moving . edwin mccain best songs rarely released radio waves anyone who misses them really missing out	1

then just pick up appetite destructionafd one greatest rock albums ever made . i wanted hate album so much . i alternative/avant guard snob when afd released . me , these clowns just hairspray band . but i took long car trip some chick i banging her roommate . roommate played tape least three times trip . end , i hooked . that mark truly great art . if it draw someone who predisposed hate it , its got something special . i looked forward next album , ' lies . but when it came out , i disappointed . it ok , but hardly cultural epoch afd . nice boys kind fun . used love her humorous novelty song . mama kin decent cover , but no real improvement over original . rest disk just crap . but what hell , its just ep right ? something tide us over until next brutal masterpiece . then came gnr death knell , two use your illusions . over-produced , bloated , boring pretentious . everything i always hated hair-metal first place . gone sound alley ways sunset boulevard , replaced sound computers , maids beverley hills hookers blow parties . rock roll sung guy custom-ripped jeans who just came out session his hair stylist manicurist . nothing see here . move . so , if you want see genius promise gnr , just pick up appetite destruction , pretend they just broke up after creating one greatest albums all time	1

o.k. , i certainly understand criticism " movement , " new order first album . most songs sound like they're remnants joy division , both bernard sumner peter hook , sound like they're trying desperately conjure up ian curtis vocals wake his unfortunate suicide year before ( 1980 ) . most songs kind doom-and-gloom feel , eerie lyrics , so typical joy division ( i.e. " denial " : " here i am house full doors but no exits/ light grey like stains my windows " ; " truth " : " oh it strange day/ such lonely way/ i saw some children dance/ i watched my life trance " ) . although , perhaps , band still searching its own voice , i still like new order " movement " quite alot , much , fact , any pre- " republic " album . other reviewers noted , first song " dreams never end , " least representational song album , foreshadows some new order best work future albums . its main riff also pretty much lifted cure song " days . " ( that o.k. -- new order , later albums , borrowed cure " forest " " just like heaven , " its songs " sunrise " " all way " ) . break-out dance song " movement , " , course , " chosen time , " which really should included " substance " album . its infectious bass guitar riff , " chosen time " rates one new order greatest obscure classics . i also like last three songs ( " him , " " doubts even here , " " denial " ) which , again , though clearly evocative joy division , provide true flavor this album . one criticism : some songs include extraneous sounds merely unnecessary distractions melody . overall though , i personally enjoy " movement , " much band follow-up , " power , corruption lies , " which i also awarded four stars . course , pcl marked new order clear break its haunted past	1
i found myself alone listen quot ; still watersquot ; . it honest raw airy way morcheeba presents themselves . this album worth buying if song alone	1
this cd really great ! i just love lyrics	1
bep one my favorite hip-hop acts late 90 . their debut album " behind front " even their sophomore album " bridging gap " continued musical approach ideology more akin tribe called quest , talib kweli , de la soul , roots than current gangster rap trend . after this however , bep apparently figured out they make more money intellectually depraved dance tracks than they original music . it shame . money business perfect example album crafted bottom top pop appeal . 2004 ( elephunk ) bep left artistic music community joined commercial music community . it sad see them go	1
i stumbled across this year it came out when visiting friend slo town during his college years . quot ; yellow pillsquot ; such interesting song i take chance . i still album . it one albums my humble ( not really ) opinion one top 5 or 10 albums epitomizes early new wave style . i recorded this road trip cassette , ( american ) beat other , which i would say makes same list . though i heavily into punk time , i still open ( musical ) mind . i never heard second session cd , but i am going purchase this solely their first effort , save vinyl posterity . go it	1
you missing out you haven't listened this one . some best music so far . this one awesome !!	1
this exceptional collection . recorded two decades ago it still over all best set haydn london symphonies . haydn remarkable career notorious among other things encompassed mozart life , witness beethoven start . most remarkably still he able evolve adapt changing music he heard through life . court composer who defined what symphony would then , he listened enriching genius mozart wrote his set london symphonies 1791 1795 . there his very own genius clearly shows , writing music little envy later mozart masterpieces . 60 haydn went court composer playful entertaining music high quality almost pre romantic composer subdued but real passion , impeccable taste , thoughtful meditation . then he just went his third career mass oratorio composer . secret interpret haydn understand , he serious composer , not showman like mozart or passionaria like beethoven . haydn ever gentleman his music should always played restraint elegance , even more extroverted pieces like these . colin davis succeeds admirably create unrivalled ensemble . certainly , you find individual symphony here there " better performance " than what mr. davis serves here . but virtues here ensemble , scope over total 12 symphonies rolling 4 cd 70 + minutes each . mr. davis `s work here simply tremendous feat , unmatched . bargain prices it steal	1
pearl jam , me , always interesting band listen . they became household name their smash debut album ten their sophomore album vs . but ever since then , it seems like they've shying away spotlight . it not they didn't hits - " better man " , " who you " , " last kiss " , " given fly " all chart-climbers - but they nonetheless significantly less famous than they used . perhaps this gives them room try out many new things they their albums . nonetheless , this album proves , pearl jam show they rock out now just good they used , but perhaps even more passion . i sort-of caught off-guard after putting cd into my player " life wasted " - i not expecting it so loud , especially beginning , i admit i jumped out my seat . yeah , this song basically defines term " rock " . probably highlight album full them , song starts off simple ac/dc-riff , intensity maintained through end ( which yields mighty-fine guitar solo , i might add ) . " world wide suicide " immediate turn-on any listener , opening strains catchy chorus rollicking ending . catchiest song album , i dare you not scream " world wide suicide ! " eddie vedder . it very hard . this also perhaps pearl jam greatest lyrical moment ever - imagery beginning , " morning paper " , very striking . " comatose " short segway song , but cool groove some nice guitar effects . eddie vedder voice seems awfully strained , however , particulary during breakdown after second chorus . " severed hand " just may " druggie " anthem 2006 . it pretty obvious it drugs , just listen lyrical imagery during verses . main riff reminiscent " smells like teen spirit " , it weird off-kilter chorus , it finishes spiraling guitar solo . put those kids shame . " marker sand " just may best song album - blending angst-ridden verses beautiful , lighter-waving chorus brillant . best all-around song lyrically album , it points finger god , asking him where he all this mess , without denying him . " parachutes " beautiful , beatle-esque song nice change pace , but gets old two minute mark . main reason this same thing happens whole song no instrumental breakdown . it still nice song listen , however , fits within album . " unemployable " lyrical masterpiece , lyrics man without job . song seems okay until great chorus , repeating line so catchy , you'll replaying this song over over hear it again . " big wave " cool surfer anthem , some weird-but-incredibly-awesome guitar effects . more substance would've made better dividends , but good song nonetheless . " gone " springsteen-esque masterpiece haunting it heart-warming , happy it depressing . anything borrows line legendary pete townshend ( am i right ? ) very good , this shows . " wasted reprise " just some short b-3 work repeated line " life wasted " . nice segue into next song . " army reserve " uses some u2-like guitar effects very nice lyrical imagery . instrumental outro very nice too . " come back " slow-burning bluesy song good its own right , but more or less disrupts flow album . " inside job " epic masterpiece . it begins some chilling guitar work two minutes , then come vocals ... music slowly rising , slowly rising ... then ... yes !! everything comes together end , but when it stops , it really not finished , it resonate you long after you hear it . mighty fine effort band loaded ' em . if you any doubts pearl jam before , please qualm them now , because when pearl jam releases great album after this one , you can't possibly go critiquing them .	1
i hate rolling stones . they one worst bands history !! this my opinion their only good album . this some greatest songs featuring shattered . get this albums dire straits , gnr , foreigner , metallica but stayfar away bigger bang , beggars banquet , sticky fingers , exile main street albums which suck big period	1

zimmer wrote thin red line assistance john powell . now glennie-smith writes orchestral score vietnam war drama . " what war ? " starts low strings then transitions militaristic percussion soft french horn playing main theme . " look around you " starts off bit emotional low strings sounding almost funeral like distant-sounding bell clangs . around 2 minutes 45 seconds , low strings grow silent replaced ticking clock soft , high-pitched stings slowly builds tension low strings soldiers leaving their homes go off war . track ends high strings soft brass blows . " flying high " good track which dominated vocals . male voice sings opening track then songs tenses up high strings female voice helicopters carry soldiers battlefield . " final battle " only action song bunch , if i even call it " action " . it starts same male voice " flying high " then turns into tense , electronic percussion section before fading into long , quiet solo male voice . " final departure " most heartbreaking song . it very mournfully played mainly strings . it ends solo trumpet salute troops their sacrifice . wonderful score . sadly , glennie-smith hasn't anything big states since then . i eagerly await his next big project randall wallace . until then , pick this one up thin red line , saving private ryan , band brothers great raid . if you're fortunate enough find it , pick up u-571 well	1

feel this disc immediately makes itself known its listener : brit-pop stylings what only described minimalist scandinavian-style backbeat . vocalist voice top , sweet form , providing wonderful contrast atmospheric thumping going behind her . extremely listenable whether you're yourself , or need some background friendly gathering . track #5 , its reference behind wheel quot ; capriquot ; , confirms credibility this band continental origins . track #10 ( i think ) quot ; erica americaquot ; , best songs harkens global image promise america provides . this cd no mistakes , no missteps , no regrets	1
this new record former manitoba involvee dan snaith relatively short , naturalistic trip . track titles , artwork , music evoke usually-innocent pastel mind-wanderings , complete background saturation effects . several tracks short interludes which despite their short length very enjoyable listen . " subotnick " , " bees " , " hello hammerheads " employ sparse vocals which lend album more personal feel . " lord leopard " employs straight hip hop beat carry nearly baroque harpsichord melody , resulting ironically catchy product . other standout tracks include " drumheller " which likewise very short track but calm evoking its soft melodies unique sixteen beat . " pelican narrows " perhaps best track , utilizing four tet-esque analog acoustics create fuzzy , warm , happy feeling . perhaps only negative aspect milk human kindness its relatively short length . however , it certainly well-worthy purchase	1
i first heard this album one npr programs 2 years ago when i driving home work . i prayed announcer would reveal title composer music , when she finally , i rummaged around car random scrap paper write info down . soon i got home , i bought cd line . when it arrived , i thrilled . music extremely mystical : polyphony heterophony voices instruments throughout entire cd fantastic . songs easily embody feelings their titles ( serenity , perseverance , grief ) , i feel like i am ocean taking nap shore while my dreams float outerspace	1

i misgivings when i heard divine miss doing christmas album ( jewish gal all ) it seemed just way make some money , ( i know streisand two ) , but i pleasantly surprised . this one her best efforts ! she sounds great , song choices good arrangements , cover alone worth purchase ! bette wisely steers away overly religious songs ( emmanuel generic enough cover both faiths ) . i especially liked title tune ( which i'd never heard ) steve allen . duet johnny mathis isnt up her duets manilow , but still fun . hawaiian mele kalikimaka campy fun goes back bette hawaiian roots . she covers chestnuts like i'll home christmas yourself merry christmas like pro . reworking her hit , distance , christmas song , inspired highlight album . i saddened read liner notes arif mardin , prouducer who helped launch midler died , album dedicated him . my only complaint like all bette releases late , set too short ( i found out target version extra song , too late ! ) . also why white christmas again ? she covered rosie clooney tribute . christmas song would better choice . aside quibbling , i loved it . this one christmas cd you play over over years come .	1

years i've read this fluke success band defied labelling . album gets 20th-anniversary status - still selling well - got grammy this year - well , somehow i don't really see fluke . i see it what it - superior musicianship , top-notch writing , instantly recognizable voice brings listeners places few others . when this album first came out , it rarely left my stereo ; now , twenty years , i four copies it i am aware - it possible there more , numerous relocations my part ; if i couldn't find my current copy after moving somewhere , i apt just go buy save time . this apex dire straits , their absolute shining moment ; it showed mark knopfler guitar master he , well his unmatched talent penning good songs . he deserves all accolades he gotten bringing this watershed effort fans everywhere . there nothing say music hasn't already said , other than personal favourites album without bad song it ; " ride across river " , which i could not listen sitting down ; " man too strong " , which fairly spooky ; " walk life " ( i busker australia relate ) , one his most upbeat songs ; ubiquitous " money nothing " which drove former employer crazy every time i played it ( 20 years , i'm still love guitar riff , though i'm sure mark knopfler tired it ) . this band may left critics scrambling description , but they knew how make their adoring fans happy way few bands ever accomplished . it says something people who loved them then still - point making this album 20-year event .	1

jill sobule obscure artist . though she labored over decade now , she only gotten tiny taste commercial success . this crying shame . maybe people shy away thinking she going precious folk-singing , lillith fair refugee ? maybe she too smart general public , who miss irony her songs ? could . her one hit , " i kissed girl " tongue-in-cheek commentary lesbian chic but it unfairly branded her gay performer , which she not ( not , quote " seinfeld , " there anything wrong ) . likewise , her other minor hit , soundtrack film " clueless , " " supermodel , " song shallow young girls shallow aspirations which taken many endorsement such empty dreams . really , i view her more wry , randy newman sensibility cyndi lauper-esque voice . her music very poppy , classic ' 60s ' 70s way ( carole king , kinks , early bowie ) , [ ... ] . she knack taking serious and/or dark subject matter very light , hilarious manner ( prozac users " happy town " album same name , extra-marital affairs " girl affair " her self-titled cd ) . she shines light desperate outsiders compassion ( i.e. , " mary kay , " her ode ms. latorneau " pink pearl " ) . here , " underdog , " it central theme all songs . washed-up showbiz personality joey heartherton ( " joey " ) , chubby young queers making ( " underdog victorious " ) , cokehead couple ( " last line " ) israeli prostitutes ( " tel aviv " ) , jill presents them all delicate balacing act tenderness back-handed comedy . think her christopher guest pop . music here buoyant tuneful any you'll encounter . all all , this collection may just her best yet ... that high praise , indeed . you should really check this unjustly neglected artist out - she smart , funny , writes fantastic pop songs . , if you're still skeptical , consider this review comes guy who also counts zappa , little feat , tom waits favorite artists	1
when i saw this lp store , read words cover , i sense this going something special . 70 turned into 80 , my favorite bands clash , jam , buzzcocks , undertones , cure etc . after this record , although i still loved those bands , gang four instantly top my list . gang four politically charged funky rhythms noise sounded like nothing before , i started expanding my listening choices bands such medium , medium mission burma , band boston called native tongue many others . all owed something gang four who just so revolutionary . this album so grounbreaking time . i saw them live 81 or 82 nyc it great performance . i haven't listened this album quite lot years i read songlist , i could still clearly hear each song my head .	1

look sharp !, joe jackson debut album , also his best . he yet turn into crank here , lyrics filled righteous anger biting humor . " sunday papers " attack press sensationalizing things , expresses how i felt when murder campus my old school made newspapers tv news , leading fellow alumnus telling me he'd never wear school jacket there meet his favorite actress , well my feelings how news sensationalizes crimes people mental disabilities , which promotes discrimination against them . " she really going out him ? " " happy loving couples " humorously satirize romantic breakups , " one more time " " throw it away " show guy dissing his girlfriend wanting romantic vacation country regularly arrests foreign tourists trumped-up crimes , which not surprising considering jackson belief young australian tourist jailed indonesia drug-smuggling charges unjustly convicted . only problem this cd it too perfect ; joe jackson would equal it follow-up , then swiftly decline .	1
i've listening clash since i 5 years old ( thanks older siblings ) so i'm readymade joe strummer fan . first solo album ' earthquake weather ' makes me so happy . i distinctly remember traveling longest highway reach record store best drive home day album came out . i remember weather , light , smell day . suffice it say , i extremely pleased album still am . said , i've mixed feelings every joe strummer solo album since then . i little patience ' ethnic experimentation ' per likes paul simon peter gabriel , mostly because they don't seem sincere . cannot said this album . first listen , i same knee-jerk reaction afro-cuban-reggae beats , but darn it if joe didn't pull it off sincerity teenage groom . i continue impressed this man intelligence sensitivity . strummer maintains career long consistency easy trace - london calling , through sandanista this solo release .	1

fratres my favorite this cd . it so crisp , so cutting , so absolutely gorgeous it nearly makes me cry every time i hear it . i used hate violin music . i guess i'm getting old , ( i'm 21 ) because this stuff just absolutely cuts my heart . it not overly complicated music mushes around , it like bared knife , simply elegantly lifting out your innards , higher , domain . buy this cd	1
this cd sees crr change direction . they've changed so much they no longer sound like same group . this lot departure daniel wylie . when he left group , band left inferior songwriting now lack direction . they sound like third grade u2 that no lie . not even one song this cd save it . i'll give ' emptiness ' pass marks but only because it best very bad company . if you expect hear same sound classic ' enjoy melodic sunshine ' , you major disappointed . this record can't hold candle ' enjoy ' . so it major , major , disappointment	1
monster hit when it opened 1954 , still staple community theatre groups , pajama game delightfully refreshing score never takes itself too seriously . whole it offers better-than-average number stand-out songs : " i'm not all love " , " hey there " , " small talk " , " steam heat " , " hernando hideaway " ensmble " 7 1/2 cents . " there , however few stumbles . " new town blue town " dreary . " her " silly although bob fosse dance routine made it work stage . both these dropped movie version , so i suspect authors also felt this material weak . movie retained all original cast leads except janis paige babe ( replaced doris day . ) day sings babe songs better , so your choice cast album movie soundtrack depend whether you need whole score or not . ths reissue ... once again sony first-rate job . sound full bodied rich , though necessarily mono , package includes some well-written liner notes	1
i think herbie hancock one most influential men jazz scene after miles . his music very variable just like ' chameleon ' one his hit tracks album ' head hunter'may , you think herbie music fusion electric sound . or his careers miles many more musicians mainstream jazz . but herbie music herbie hancock himself ! it chameleon ' who ' change his colors easily surrounded environment . herbie music colors same things chameleon he taught us his amazing abilities most becoming all jazz genre through many marvelous album music . this record maiden voyage also qualified something else . album genre called modal jazz . song - same name album title - 1st track " maiden voyage " typical modal theory . just like many men loving jazz , i don't know jazz theory well either . but true attraction this piece beautiful melody . example , first last track , " maiden voyage " " dolphin dance " most perfomed jazz standard . sometimes , because its beautiful melodies this record more relaxant easy appreciate rather than hard bop or funky jazz , etc ... though you not hard jazz cat , this " maiden voyage " bring great inspiration you . if you begin hearing this music , you might under delusion you quiet sea . this great most beautiful album . don't hesitate buy something else	1

i confess , while i love clapton , his albums often hit-and-miss affair . i can't say i am fan numerous recent blues tribute albums he put out lately . me i enjoy his work cream , his guest work , his first few albums , one he recorded band , few older live albums , bits phil collins-produced record early 80s . after it fall-off , but i am thankful all great music he turned out over years . i listening 461 lot lately . it holds up exceedingly well . groove laid-back , solid musicianship expert song selection . it makes great road music , especially " willie hand jive , " " i shot sheriff , " classic closer , " mainline florida .

i write this review because this band lyrics music haunting my soul past year or so , particularly last three months following release " love , loss , hope , repeat " . i picked up advance copy cd month before it came out , after i already huge fan their last cd , " indian summer " . cd , incidentally , nearly flawless every way . so much so i convinced no band could ever reproduce piece art like twice . however , " love ... " not only matches brilliance " indian ... " , but it equally par every way . no pictures look no liner notes read , i let music speak itself . boy oh boy , it ever . after repeated listens , not only it get better better but i want hear it again all more . this band managed get very close fire greatness crafting music supremely higher order . i felt like they my own , i got go see them play this tour little club rhode island , they took it even higher level . carbon leaf actually amazing band see perform live concert . i'm already wishing i could fly down virginia see them again . i'm certain next time i see them , it arena . i wish they could stay ' mine ' forever , but not going happen . they poised brink ready explode , i can't wait see it . this semi-jaded music lover not rabid fan band very long time . look , after lifetime buying cds listening music , i've learned one thing . there only two types music , good music bad music . carbon leaf great music . go ahead . enjoy , world	1

... this really worth buying even if you already own original mirrorball . there enough songs here aren't earlier release , including far more generous selection her first two albums ( vox , into fire , i not forget you addition path thorns ) , make it worth price . album whole also much better sound - it less produced actually sounds live , unlike parts its very polished predecessor . it bug me they didn't just release complete concert first place though	1
no nostalgia here , just objectivity . very hard mclennan recent passing . i found last 2 lps reformed duo : welcomed , eagerly anticipated , ok , perhaps i expected too much creators one my 5 d.i.d. lps all time . they nice , but not over top this duo who given us so much beautiful music over years . actually i hesitated purchase this until flood great reviews forced my little lifeboat over precipice niagra . i popped it way home work one those early june evenings when sun alternately breaking thru potentially dam busting summer shower skies mid atlantic usa . first track ok , nice chug . nice mix . haven't heard this since " there anything ... " urgent . then lp just unfolds this cacophony sunshine gorgeous melodies then until end . i so stunned i called up friends held up phone yelled you remember groove these guys ? me don't this my age no more . this most stunning lp i heard past 5 years . this surpasses all your expectations it beauty , production , sheer magnitude its songwriting . it like way we ultimately want our musical friends return when they've away . lads saving up this . first 2 reformed lps i won't discount , but this time it like " 16 lovers lane " where they went brass ring ... they got it . i loved grant songwriting sighed over his lyrics so many years - group solo . but this lp , i finally tapped completely into robert - every one his songs perfect here . " part family " hilarious could song rest my life all those kindred souls who come wonderful wombs , but god knows why , we just gotta stretch out bit .

keyboardist bob baldwin remembers advice his jazz pianist father early his career , " get your props your body work , not some sad hit pre-determined some power-hungry exec . " bob latest album , all days work , embodiment philosophy . instead one or two standout tracks lot mediocre filler , this disc loaded compelling , memorable tunes first note last ... every one which would sound awesome coming out radio or your player . bob emphasizes percussion this collection , so there plenty movement this music . i've always liked bob baldwin style playing , i'm especially pleased results he gotten this one , he moves smoothly piano rhodes all other sonic colors his keyboards . i enjoyed his previous release , brazil chill immensely , all days work picks it up right where he left off , rio , evolves stunningly there back his home base , new york city . selections this disc all originals i might add they range brazilian vibe ( " day-o " " very last night rio " ) ultra-funkiness " you feel it ?

if you buy this album hoping hear bandwagonesque ii , you'll surely disappointed , i initially . just i ready weed this cd out my collection , i gave it what i thought would farewell listen . i discovered album some real gems such " escher " , " ret liv dead " , short , uptempo instrumental " get funky " . i couldn't say objectively 13 great album , but it enjoyable 60's-influenced , slacker rock charm compensates 13 sloppy production . vocals overall tend bit weak , but harmonies rich . i would urge fanclub fans who dismissed this album flop give it listen , perhaps recommend it those who haven't heard it yet	1

my introductory words fountains wayne those written above : " it like emo , only good ! " truer words probably spoken ( i.e. " sun mass incandescent gas/ gigantic nuclear furnace/ where hydrogen built into helium temperature millions degrees ! " courtesy they might giants ) but there pretty true . fow awesome group whom term " power pop " not justice . mostly this because word " pop " slimy grotesque . fow really put together good album b-sides rarites here , this especially appealing longtime fans group . this isn't best introduction band , but it hell lot better than hearing " stacy mom " ( most unjustly overplayed song ever . i mean really ! they such better songs ! ) over over over radio . this album excellent because it truly entertaining liner notes awesome collection classic fow b-sides their new single " maureen " , kickass song . " california sex lawyer : one my favorites album , if you read liner notes it even funnier . besides raucously funny lyrics , it excellent song that fun listen . " i want alien christmas " their infamously char t-t opping uk single . this song so badass . fact , other two holiday-themed songs awesome too . course , there " ... baby one more time " , which basically sparked ton other bands same thing acoustic covers this song , but this one recorded first . some kids my high school even baby one more time cover , i don't think they any clue who fow . oh well , it excellent song showcases their trademark sarcasm biting humor music . basically , you should buy this cd , because it cool , fow really cool . great collection tracks great band	1

boc come kinda my favorite act representing feelings , or life itself , true it actually - therefore after 4 months mental boc-listening after hours spent their homepage-wonderful-wierdo-games [ they're no longer :( ] , i saw new album released boy i happy . tchp truly wonderful , but not all like i thought it would ; more dark , sincere or serious feeling , or maybe like your inside soundings ' true self - but that " over all " . first part track 8 " sherbert head " probably best piece music i know , getting chills every now then i listen it . other " dark " half it accompanies first half just it should - even though one could listen intro forever . sherbert head album " final " track i see it " slow this bird down " two out-of-this-world tracks cd . but without setting other songs , well , it all small things we all know . can't wait ' til release trans canada highwa	1

bob dylan may alone stage philharmonic hall during most this 1964 concert , but he friendlier , even gregarious times , he jokes audience even requests their assistance when he forgets opening verse " i don't believe you . " he entertainer here , role he seems reclaimed recent years he barnstorms world never ending tour . otherwise , this concert finds him transitioning relatively idealistic troubadour " times they are-a changin '" more cynical , introspective poet " it alright , ma ( i'm only bleeding ) . " latter performance highlight this collection . dylan would perform this song many times decades come , but only rarely effectively he 1964 when it new still five months away its appearance " bringing it all back home . " dylan clearly enunciates each word , no doubt impressed his achievement , but also intent audience experience it fully . joan baez turns up four songs , best which duet " mama , you my mind . " but most memorable moments when dylan his own , offering excellent readings " don't think twice , it all right , " " lonesome death hattie carroll , " " hard rain a-gonna fall . " i prefer later , post-64 dylan , therefore , rank this set below previous entries " bootleg series . " but it terrific concert makes particularly intriguing listening experience when one contrasts it 1966 1975 concerts . brian . fairbanks	1

one who thought ricky skaggs " brand new strings " bit too mellow lacked usual bluegrass drive , i pleased hear hard edge back this instrumental album . although instrumentation feel definitely bluegrass , it nice variety tunes ( major keys , minor keys , appalachian , celtic ) . few tunes include non-bluegrass instruments , such accordian and/or clarinet . my opinion , it worked well , but i see where purist might find it disconcerting . two tunes ( " going ceili " " crossville " ) also " live charleston music hall " album . i would preferred either all new tunes , or make it mega-album all his instrumentals , including " get up , john , " " rawhide , " " amanda jewell , " so . definitely great album bluegrass fans	1

since this review after kamelot released two later cd , it rare instance able look forward future instead usual longing past . music here better than previous ( fourth legacy ) growing toward brilliance epica black halo . khan voice noticely developed band overall performance sharper than former but much more improvement awaits latter . however , kamelot less-than-perfect works better than best music lot other bands easily rates four marks . ( please see my profile brief discussion my rating philosophy . )	1
i've lingering over this cd past few weeks finally decided buy it so happy i so . this all i've listening past few days . great opener ' good morning baltimore ' best closing song i've ever heard , ' you can't stop beat ' , this recording gem . one my favorite songs this soundtrack ' nicest kids town ' . it kind beat that hard not dance . favorite ' mama , i'm big girl now ' . it reminds me songs leslie gore . my favorite line comes amber von tussle " once upon time i used dress up ken/but now i'm woman i like bigger men/and i don't need barbie doll show me how " . ' ( legend of)miss baltimore crabs ' glorious song villain . wonderful drumming violins background , velma von tussel great solo song . ' it takes two ' such great slow song . i just imagine 1960 prom . everyone slow dancing lights low . band set up stage . i can't help sing . ' welcome 60 ' wonderful song . it seems everyone favorite . it one mine too . harvey fierstein great edna . ' big , blonde , beautiful ' good song . good message all big girls proud yourself . ignore what everyone says you strut . " bring pecan pie/pour some sugar it/sugar don't shy "' (you're ) timeless me ' such cute song wilbur edna . ' without love ' my number one favorite this recording . link proclaiming his love tracy who locked up solitary confinement seaweed proclaiming his love penny who tied up her bed . " darling i'll yours forever/'cause i never wanna be/without love/so darling throw away key "' i know where i've ' glorious gospel song . sung motormouth maybelle her experiences learned them . ' cooties ' such childish sounding song but it kind song should it own dance . it too much fun . little song follows ' you can't stop beat ' so funny dark . i don't know name , i just refer ' blood pavement ' . " don't drink drive/please keep your head/or come graduation day/you'll dead " . i recommend this soundtrack everyone . it kind soundtrack doesn't sound like musical soundtrack	1
i saw mastodon unholy alliance tour last year they stole show . there music just perfect blend heavy metal . id recommend this cd anyone who enjoys metal . this cd doesnt disappoint neither these guys .	1
there some comments previous reviews regarding this album length/number songs , " angry eyes " " edit " . first , this originally vinyl album , which explains its length , " greatest hits " album , it contain songs lm most known time , least casual radio listeners . second , notes album jacket explain " angry eyes " , fact , not edited ( cut ) this album . rather , version this collection alternate " short " version recorded same time original " long " version their second album . i , too prefer full version , but least this short version more cohesive feel than most songs get cut down ( engineers ) time . anyone who really into lm , course , won't satisfied just this collection , but it few things recommend it . it , after all , collection lm songs , you can't go wrong - no matter how you slice it . if ( my case many years ago ) casual listener buys this collection then seeks out more lm albums , then it its job . after all , i didn't become really avid lm fan i am until i started listening appreciating entire " loggins messina " album , which i bought specifically full version " angry eyes " . also , this album contains stand-alone " single " version " peace mind " . song here identical what their " sittin ' " album , except it begins its own , rather than beginning segue " make woman feel wanted " . this version handy if you wish make your own expanded " best " compilation , but don't wish include entire " trilogy : lovin ' me/to make woman feel wanted/peace mind " . any rate , this good taste loggins messina ( their band ) fine songwriting musicianship , it whets appetite more .	1
if you're vu fan you haven't heard this album , it bad reviews or people just plain saying it hard listen , you should still give it try . one thing , lou reed really gets crazy his guitar i heard her call my name , creating feedback squeals make you want cover your ears . it really second side this album makes it what it ; sure , first side some good songs , but roar second side really embodies this album purpose , which i believe make album 1968 sounded like something no one ever imagined . there other people doing proto-punk , like electric prunes before them , but sheer loudness fury , no one could top this album . it sounded like garage rock , but completely stripped down pure noise . without andy warhol or nico , they really able free record whatever they wanted . i mean , sister ray 17 minutes long , if you're into sort thing , you'll fun time listening it . otherwise , you'll get bored quickly . i personally think it varies enough keep someone interested . there virtually no chord changes seventeen minutes straight , it mainly becomes battle guitar freaked out distorted organ . i think i read somewhere engineer walked out studio during recording song , simply saying , " call me when you're . " you could play this song 16 year old like me they would never believe it came 1967 . it just doesn't sound like sixties today . funny thing it didn't sound like sixties sixties ! i recommend this album , but warned : this abrasive difficult 1967 ever got . ale	1

neil diamond may throaty quality his voice but he still records same ac style songs wonderful manilow . difference manilow relied more thoughtful ballads while diamond recorded mostly mid/up-tempo love songs like quot ; cracklin ' rosiequot ; , quot ; cherryquot ; , quot ; americaquot ; , quot;i'm believerquot ; . us manilow fans , it bit more reality but every now then song like quot ; copacabanaquot ; allowed us escape world forget misery bad or lousy relationship . but , manilow songs spoke me personally because i've quite few awful relationships women hearing song like quot ; weekend new englandquot ; hits home . previous reviewers all made comments song selections this cd . this one full manilow ac hits ... five songs made top-10 pop chart : quot ; could it magicquot ; hit #6 , quot ; copacabanaquot ; hit #8 , quot ; i write songsquot ; hit #1 , quot ; somewhere nightquot ; hit #9 , quot ; weekend new englandquot ; hit #10 . each those top-10 pop singles bigger ac charts , that one big reason why some songs may not familiar public large . quot ; this one youquot ; , example , hit #29 pop but flew #1 ac . everyone knows quot ; copacabanaquot ; it #8 pop peak 1978 belies it massive popularity . it sold million copies remained #1 ramp ; ac chart incredible 5 weeks ! prior this , four other manilow singles each sold million or more copies . quot ; beautiful musicquot ; , quot ; jump shout boogiequot ; , quot ; all timequot ; album songs not hit singles . quot;you're my only girlquot ; , his newly recorded song 1989 , closes out cd . it wonderful song , showing manilow still quite bit range his voice ... it follows award winning masterpiece quot ; i write songsquot ; this cd . i would've closed cd song ... new song track #9	1

" inside " got most cohesive innovative concept album ever released . alice great knack incorporating his personal experiences into humorous provocative songs just grab you throat ingrain themselves into your psyche like really good stephen king story . songs this lp based actual people alice encountered during his stay psychiatric hospital he voluntarily entered seek treatment his alcoholism . stories involve characters ranging man obsessed his dog compulsive gambler couple who hacked female husband into little pieces . latter song , " millie billie " , tender duet sung alice marcy levy fades sound circular saw grinding millie poor spouse bits . also included couple personal songs alice penned .

this one my top 10 cds all time . check out my other reviews you'll probably surprised . but this cd left lasting impression me when i like 16 or so . it some most well-crafted sy songs my opinion some sweetest , sublime , fuzzed out guitar sounds ever . track 1 perfect song . track 2 ( junkie promise ) rocks harder than anything they've ever . they played it conan obrien tore it up !!! track 3 beautfully hypnotic tripped out sort way . this track first reeled me i under influence wild irish rose watching my friends play tekken 2 . track 4 ( washing machine ) very episodical visual song which morphs dischordant punk chill summery breeze jam slowly winds down into practically nothing . kim gordon snotty tuff girl attitude shines through more than ever songs like ' little trouble girl ' ' panty lies ' . how any true fan alternative music hate this cd ? good experimentation noise distortion , yet structured songs ... better than previous " expermmental jet set " album . give it whir	1

what other music you folks listen ? i've always enjoyed apples ' discs single listen , nothing more ; music rather superfluous . i'm growing rather tired whiny voiced robert schneider , not mention his electronically enhanced nasal whine heard many these tunes . comparing guy brian wilson big mistake , just vocals alone , not mention songwriting skills . i'd compare him other wilson wannabes , like guy high llamas or others elephant 6 collective . essentially , disc full basic , repetitive 3-chord rock tunes , some back-up vocals ... occasional odd electronic instrumental track thrown , well ' kitchen sink ' assortment ' throwaways ' tossed good measure . poor-man fountains wayne jeff lynne complex , perhaps ? put some wondermints if you want listen band sounds like brian wilson !! or , better pop/indie sounds , pick up minders , long winters , or linus hollywood	1

blondie self titled debut came out 1976 , followed 1977 plastic letters . but it wasn't until 1978 parallel lines band exploded terms commercial critical acclaim . they would release one more equally great album form 1979 eat beat . but 1980 good but flawed autoamerican , it seemed like band striking out bit too many directions they weren't quite seasoned group point really pull it off . less said their final 1982 album hunter , better . after 17 long years , blondie surprised everyone coming out no exit 1999 . some accused them jumping whole reunion craze mid late 90 , but it really just case band got back together found out they still lot say musically enjoyed playing each other . no exit shares lot similarities autoamerican , but it succeeds all areas where autoamerican faltered . album sees group striking out everything their trademark pop-rock rap ( guest appearance coolio ) swing , country pretty much everything . most time album works . out 14 tracks , there only 4 i would call fillerish , but remaining 10 tracks strong , strong stuff . anybody who long time fan gave up them 1982 hunter , would wise check this album out it kind ignored general public ( least here states ) when it came out . while not front back strong their next album ( 2003 curse blondie ) , this still represents return form inimitable deborah harry boys	1

" last stand saber river " first three excellent westerns tom selleck made tnt 1997 2003 ( i'm still hoping there'll least fourth one some day ) . selleck starred five made-for-tv westerns total , three which based louis l'amour stories . this one , however , based book elmore leonard , difference obvious both lack idealism extreme violence . selleck paul cable , confederate cavalryman who come home civil war ( only slightly ) early . he knows war lost south , he worn out , he only wants take his family back their homestead arizona live normal life . his wife , who told he dead , less than thrilled him back home because she resentful he left fight war first place . suzy amis excellent job martha cable . she not stereotypical beauty who runs around bustle under fancy dresses . she tough frontierswoman who experienced many hardships gets her husband out some tight spots movie progresses . while majority movie good depicting divisions north south caused civil war which civil war then exacerbated , subplot inner struggles paul martha cable face far more interesting . it great movie until end , when we get additional time-worn subplot confederate soldier who just can't give up lost cause . no , it not selleck character who this problem , but selleck already covered this territory 1982 " shadow riders " ( though it wasn't his character who wanted keep fighting movie either ); john wayne " undefeated " well-known film lost cause plotline . spite needlessly melodramatic ending , this strong western . selleck tnt kept getting better better " crossfire trail " " monte walsh " . check out all three , you'll join me wishing number four	1

i confession make ... i am closet kutless fan . i enjoyed few their songs their self-titled review even found myself identifying " sea faces " before ccm chr made it most overplayed song year . worship album wasn't bad , seeing it several strong tracks few re-worked praise tunes i found myself enjoying . i bought hearts innocent amazon used since i wasn't exactly sure expect their new album ( youth pastor , i don't exactly all much money spend music ) . after listening this album , i found myself enjoying music little more , but lyrics lot less . i've always found kutless lyrics songwriting style their weakest point . they tend take two lines cliche followed thundering pre-chorus word or short-lived line repeated line chourus 3 or 4 times ( see pride away their first album ) . now , it seems they've found something say , i'm little worried message they're sending out . their first single , " shut me out " , interesting lyrical twist i honestly didn't expect kutless . essentially song seems ( notice i say seems , i could wrong i am not one who wrote song question ) say i'm going say what i've got say i don't care whether you agree me or not , i'm going put up you your differing opinions/argumenative ways so i speak my peace . other words , i'm right you're wrong but i'll put up you wrong so all rest these people see how right i am . seems bit sketchy me not quite message i'm shooting teach my students how live out their faith , because it not right , it loving god people god brings into their lives ( i know , someone start lecturing doctrine such , but attended graduated fundamentalist bible college , please save your time focus point this review , music/message band ) . their other single " smile " , also sends mixed messages . according song , my smiling good attitude , or perceived attitude , or seeing person smile , they light christ their lives . i am not exactly sure what that supposed mean . many christ-followers find themselves situations very much less than ideal , whether abusive relationships , poverty , or even disconnectedness church . many them don't go around smiling some sort " pie-in-the-sky/it all gonna ok " mindset . they hurt . they really hurt . so best we offer them smile ? i'd take some prozac over this sort " jeszac " they're selling my kids . conclusion , i'm not attacking ministry kutless , i think they reach people name jesus good things kingdom . i just happen disagree very strongly much unoriginal lyrics drab music they producing . just my opinion . feel free disagree me , but don't get angry start lecturing . i'm just contributing discussion doesn't get brought up nearly enough	-1

well , this said any " best " album , if you new artist . but kim richey case , this particularly true , because rise ( 2002 ) she departed quite dramatically sound her previous albums . proof what i'm saying , just scroll down lowest rating reviews rise see how many fans felt betrayed change . conversely , some those who discovered richey thanks rise disappointed her previous efforts . richey first three albums loosely catalogued " country-pop " , even though production becomes " glossier " she moves " kim richey " ( 1995 ) " glitter " ( 1999 ) . i suspect her record company yore , mercury nashville , behind this gradual but steady shift . however , since sales didn't materialize , they dumped her . free fetters , kim looked new sound describe her situation convey her emotions . " rise " born . understandably , lyrics bleak biographical ( when she sings " i never liked foreman standing over me " " girl car " i don't think she simply talking clich�s ; you agree me , guys mercury nashville ? ) but music also different . she producer bill bottrell must tinkering shop all sorts instruments when recording rise : melodica , birdie , vibraslap , mini-moog , bozouki , washtub bass , farfisa , wurlitzer present , among others . result singer-songwriter album irish middle-eastern influences . how some people find it bland , i don't know . you surely understood , i'm fond rise , but i also enjoy some songs her previous albums , especially her debut . instance , " just my luck " " i know " terrific songs , very catchy , but often other songs these three albums just unmemorable . new songs this collection , " electric green " stripped-down live version same title song rise " break you down " occupies same turf . it may indication richey stay course started rise . summarize : buy " collection " , see where you stand pick her precedent discography accordingly .	1

musically , wynton his usual best this cd it great production . i would focused this review music cd , however , wynton comments video very little music cd , so this review mostly his comments video selling cd . if wynton political spokesman , than i wish he would honest his people favor refraining blame white america all hardships they face . unfortunately , wynton always unhappy black man racist . maybe this good thing because it might his main driving force creating such great music . once again , we see social problems black community never solved because distortion truth problems consistantly involving bad choices blamed others . come wynton - tell your people step up plate hit home runs like you instead wallowing their failures . it now time because nobody new buying old excuses any longer . buy cd but don't buy this racist retoric .	1

' 74 jailbreak fairly good album ac/dc , considering it actually compilation songs they recorded throughout 1974 1975 . only five songs kind disappointing though . 1 . jailbreak- one my all time favorites . it great rocker , it ridiculously catchy chorus . 10/102 . you ain't got hold me- this song just okay , but not terrible . guitar riff during verses good though . 7/103 . show business- this song good if you just feel like listening good , upbeat , bluesy song , but it gets old quickly . 7/104 . soul stripper- i really like this song , because it sounds different than most songs they before . phil rudd drumming percussion this song exceptionable . 9/105 . baby , please don't go- guitar this song amazing . very catchy . 8/10'74 jailbreak good purchase avid ac/dc fans , but not people only like " back black " " highway hell " . it worth buying just ' jailbreak ' though	1

i am ardent fan all things metheny . just when you might tempted let slip realization what overwhelming superpower he pure jazz composer , arranger , virtuoso , comes album like trio 99-00 . there great composers great artisans , but no one surpass metheny terms levels greatness he reaches both these realms all one package . mind bending first track would enough say it all if there not 60 more minutes needed filled cd . " ( go ) get it " both impossible follow impossible not pursue . go get it indeed - you dared try keep accurate time it runs circles around you yet somehow never taunts . how anyone play - much less compose - such delightfully incomprehensible yet enigmatically accessible piece music ... well ... just go get it . next arrangement i dare say more listenable than original standard - phenomenon occurs more than once this album . exotic chord progressions coltrane modal monument " giant steps " come life this grooved-down guitar-a-delic adaptation i find eminently easier ears than coltrane scholarly but brutish revelation . other ' new improved ' selections " lone jack " ( which i feel succeeds far greater uneffected trio format acoustic upright bass than it disco-tainted embryonic stages pmg late 70 electric bass mark egan ) " travels " which just might single best track this amazing album . so moving melodic identity so flawless all-acoustic execution this studio version original live song it could easily number one hit country charts even instrumental if it not " jazz piece " . what other jazz trio you going find plays music like this ? none . outstanding track annihilates any doubt metheny composing genius " we sister " . how he sit down write something like this ? words hard find accurately describe what this song , but it employs two overdubbed acoustic guitars weave out haunting tonal center while bass percussion provide ethereal , distant accent . truly amazing . i wish i could write something like this . it hearkens back " story stranger " , trio masterpiece metheny years earlier ornette coleman sidemen charlie haden billy higgins . similar accolades given brooding guttural " just like day " . rounding out set two more standards , " capricorn " " whole lot livin ' " , couple more metheny originals , most noteworthy " sun montreal " which showcases metheny jedi master skill chordal melodies . absolutely delicious . percussionist bill stewart brad mehldau bassist larry grenadier comprise other two thirds trio admirably keep up metheny stride stride , which no small task many points this cd . summerize , you not find more eclectic set music still purely jazz any other jazz guitar trio anywhere . if there any questions left pat last trio effort , here your answer .	1

this album great , really i could put this any time bump he ** out it . lyrically flow-wise i think this posibly keith greatest work . beats also spaced out funky . they grow me first , but short time i felt them completely . i think they perfectly compliment keith insane steelos this record . i also say some people need shut up stop comparing every kool keith record dr. octagon stop bringing up automator when ever beats he rhymes over mentioned . this kind whining surpassed levels extreme cliche this point . personally , if i choose one keep black elvis dr. octogon , i may actually go funkier black elvis	1
play , start , classic . i think tracks overall great arranged professionally , but also each track listened individually you still get same feeling ! 1 . honey - this top song catchy beat , i seem able listen it over over again . ( this song gets even better 118 remix single)2 . find my baby - i never used like this song , but now i think its great . my first impressions repetetive boring , but if you listen carefully appreciate song , it become favourite ! 3 . porcelain - my favourite song off album ! beautifully arranged , its gorgeous song ! if you've heard music album " animal rights " or " everything wrong " then its not what you'd expect moby , but great track . 4 . why my heart - brilliant :) simple piano pattern , blues vocals minor melody make it song you listen anytime , when your peaceful , upset , even when your just relaxing . 5 . south side - it good song , but i think gwen stefani singing takes away originality . 6 . rushing - not great but it fits atmosphere album . 7 . bodyrock - now this good song . not moby all , but damn its catchy :) 8 . natural blues - this song means alot people who appreciate good blues music . me =] 9 . machete - nice basic techno-ish beat . 10 . 7 - skip it , you wouldn't notice . although i used this cassette it first track side , which made good intro . 11 . run - i wouldn't clue what guy saying , i'm too lazy look up lyrics but its good song . i don't know why they released extended version , i think its long enough . 12 . down slow - skip this one too . or fast forward it tape = p13 . if things perfect - yeaah its okay ... 14 . everloving - my second favourite song this album !!! it so well , it starts nice acoustic builds up what soudns full symphony orchestra or somethin like . 15 . inside - not big fan but its near end cd , where its winding down . 16 - , - wow this surprisingly good song . i never used like it but i now . 17 - sky broken - sort haunting way , but still . 18 - i don't really like this track , but its perfect album closer . also , if youve seen new live hotel tour dvd , its opening sequence , which good start great concert . well theirs my extra long review . hope you read it all didnt skip boring bits like i this cd . : pby	1

you'd surprised , wouldn't you ? this set actually absolute treasure trove black man enterprise into 1960 agendas . ' born ' immediately comes mind . " i'm one few people remembers born , i'd like it you , i lady volunteer ? " after any reafricanizing movements you may seen late 1980 youth culture , you find unrequitted boiling point kind here man who perpetuated better points those ideas . some things richard says little off , some even lame ducks , but some blow one mind . he like some coltrane comedy thelonious monk-the amateur audience not yet ready train . let me say this too , richard pryor melds his act so ingeniously within his warner bros . albums , white man like me , it difficult times understand what he saying , nevertheless his awesome ideals . this vein spirit richard , black white , obvious its reach laughs . like blueprint most beautiful human i've ever seen	1

this cd packed timeless music . rollins ' performance this classic 1957 not only solidified him one greatest tenors his generation , but , all other material his illustrious fifty plus year career , stood test time make him one all-time greatest musicians regardless style . backed duo legends bassist ray brown drummer shelly manne , rollins cooks beginning end . he prime form , still relativly unknown tenor when this album came out , he plays like man ahead his years . sonny tone hard , percussive , rasping , even playful , full spectrum colors moods . what makes this truly great album every single note rollins plays highlight . his soloing stands up repeated listening rewards effort something new each time through . manne brown contribute fantastic performances their own , matching rollins producing phenominal solos their own . even usually aggravating practice sticking alternate takes behind originals hardly makes difference . rollins , manne , brown so brimming ideas , longer alternates offer listener just much more good thing . this one those albums needs every jazz collection , even cover photo classic . buy this cd if you not already own it , you not dissapointed	1
imagine rolling stones rhythm section , eric clapton lead guitar , stevie winwood keyboards . heck , even you singing your shower could sound good . wang dang doodle such killer song , clapton guitar simply sings , so elegantly tastefully , you don't know its clapton , but instinctively look cd notes see who playing those tastey licks ! this vinyl record one my all time favorites . when it came out cd remastered bonus tracks , i ignored stupidly high price took leap faith . if you like clapton blues guitar , stevie winwood piano solid rhythm rolling stones ( who doesn't ) , you love this album . i'd give it 5 stars , but i'm stingy stars , so 4 star it .	1

gershon kingsley moog-work , i would far pick this collaboration jean-jacques perrey over kingsley " music moog " any day . while stan free one man band " hot butter " still my top pick moog music 60s-70s era , " sound way out " one delightful kitschy listen . where stan free straight musical moog covers popular music , kingsley perrey become playful sound effects acting musical notes ; everything cartoonish computeresque buzzings space-age bleeps junilant baby giggle . if you're one many folks these days who like throw retro-martini parties complete smoking jackets , shriners ' caps , hawaiian grass skirts , bowling shirts bongos , than i say without shadow doubt you found perfect soundtrack your fiesta . don't delay ! this album way-hep !	1

john lowery ( stage name : john 5 ) returns his sophomore , last , release under shrapnel records . most artists , each album following debut usually not impressive or original , but songs sanity just opposite . formerly involved marilyn manson , john held back musically , his guitar skills let out bag his debut , vertigo . while it seemed tricks licks wildly integrated because it first opportunity john received display his solo talent , songs sanity refined sharp . john handles all guitars , but there two noteworthy guest appearances . steve vai contributes lead guitar second half each two main solos " perineum , " albert lee contributes lead guitar first solo " death valley . " john also handles all bass , except " fiddler " larry klein josh jones . john drawn comparisons likes steve vai , it seems fitting both vai lee contribute . he quickly making name himself guitar world . songs sanity just original debut , but slightly more impressive . like vertigo , this track listing both metal bluegrass/country . here , however , songs sound like they performed more feeling maturity , which makes better album . one solo effort under john belt , he experience , it appears evident he made some technique adjustments	1
loved new sound , heavy beat , am looking forward their first full cd release may 4th ! funky lyrics too ! i certainly fan this music	1
it hasn't stated below reviews , it worthing point out " compound eye " set out old-fashioned double album . it all fits one cd but separated out into sides one through four . such , like any sef-respecting double album , it entitled desultory mess unified only it willlingness deviate style track track . " compound eye " succeeds kind white album lo-fi similar pop-smarts . it could said robert pollard nowadays looks backward main influences here could culled late seventies through early nineties . punk , no-wave , extreme lo-fi ( it daniel johnston or early smog ) , messy early-flaming lips rock ..... all evidence here . all filtered through resolutely indie early -r.e.m influence always inflection guided voices aswell ; my mind , similarities pollard stipe quite arresting though even stipe famed obscurity seems tame compared pollard abstruse lyrics . all all , album comes not really tribute but summation kind music pollard influenced , turn , went influence . again , white album comparison valid . but time , when hi-fi productions coming back into fashion sufjan stevens davendra banhardt previously lo-fi artists smog animal collective flaming lips joining fray , question ( this one could never asked beatles ) how relevant latest robert pollard album doesn't make any great progression previous releases either himself solo artist or guided voices . perhaps not very but then it always worth pickin up work artist who doing what he knows . " compound eye " , pollard it very well indeed that really all that relevant me	1
i played paul jones 15 years . his wife , bessy , raised me while my parents worked , back seventies . that how my brother sid i learned how play blues !!! this record wasn't pauls fist recording but it his first major label . this recording really good but you really see paul live catch showmanship he posesses . hats off mathew johnson bruce watson fat possum records oxford mississippi	1
i several traviatas my collection , it one my favorite operas , callas fan , i would often resort famous live recordings 1955 1958 order satisfy my fill her violetta . her early studio recording cetra didn't characteristics violetta yet would make it her own role . good her voice recording , it didn't dramatic elements gave her traviata heartbreaking qualities we come associate those two recordings . i am callas fan , i would admit , no one comes close violetta callas . but , there alternative those who aren't very close her voice . without compensating theatrics vocal beauty , here traviata well-rounded cast talented both vocally dramatically . first all , there romanian soprano ileana cotrubas . while her coloratura isn't accurate bel canto queens ' coloratura ( callas , sills , sutherland ) , her performance first acts spinto lyric coloratura outstanding . there feeling you get she woman who tries show good face partying crowd well . then duets sherril milnes , she expresses emotions much like those callas express . last act particularly heartbreaking , it this scene where i judge violetta creature only few sopranos such cotrubas create . difficult fioritura first act , most sopranos technique well-built tessitura easily manage it without paying much attention details drama , because partying voice quite easy replicate performance . second last acts though , more difficult . other supporting singers , i would argue domingo much more effective singer fat man , pavarotti . he gives great , heartbreaking performance alfredo , fact one best ones i've heard . lastly , conductor , carlos kleiber , gives one impression he able conduct seance verdi ghost . he truly knew score well , just like giulini , ghione , serafin , recently , patrick summers . i think one strongest points any recording conductor . if performance conducted beautifully , usually all you need make impression listener . listening kleiber conducting create palate imaginations would transport you easily world where this opera transpires , what conductors like summers , giulini , ghione , serafin , summers easily . five stars this one	1

back mid 90 , i dismissed pulp just britpop band . come find out , i wrong . good friend gave this me cd exchange i say i'm thoroughly impressed . standout tracks clearly ( imo ) " mis-shapes " , " common people " " i spy " . music rather jangly times distinctly dance-able beat . what won me over though lyrics . jarvis cocker manages create fantastic mental image go his lyrics , which alternately humorous serious , occassionally silly ( " sorted e wizz " ) vaguely malevolent ( " i spy " ) . cocker delivery very basic - he doesn't lot range , but he makes good use his voice some spoken parts songs send chills up my spine . all all , this great album . i wish i'd given it chance back 1995	1
born 1961 , i , until recently , not get much enjoyment popular music forties . passionate audiophile geek , i love exploring music all decades which there recorded sound . though my first flirtations hits 40 not go over well , i not give up . i came back decade . it rhino records wonderful two volume collection " songs got us through wwii , " really turned me around . i now find myself getting lots pleasure popular music this era . this collection : " g.i. jukebox , " complete winner , just like double rhino collection i mentioned , it transports one time american culture . sometimes cheesy ( nothing wrong ) , always pleasing hear , songs this disc warm relics bygone era . i highly recommend this compilation one all .	1
serse one my favorite handel operas since i first heard old priestman lp westminster ( maureen forrester title role , lucia popp romilda ) . despite its frequent raggedness quot ; harpsichord speedquot ; continuo , this thoroughly dramatic engaging performance . i've waited decades new serse which could benefit new performance standards we take granted baroque opera today . i strongly disposed like this disc , since although i've found mcgegan bit uneven past , his more recent handel efforts , particularly radamisto , superb . i can't fault singers or orchestra this performance , but dramatic spark makes serse so special seems me missing . i went back compared my old priestman recording even more convinced definitive serse yet come . it surprising there haven't more recordings , since this work lot potential appeal , one handel most accomplished pieces . maybe i'm just too picky , but i'd love see someone reissue priestman cd -- while they it , his equally engaging rodelinda ( fortunately , there better competition latter )	1
this best rocking , shouting , one cd overview black gospel 1947 1963 , produced man best qualified job , historian self-described gospel " monomaniac " anthony heilbut , who devoted his life music . if you like singing ray charles , aretha franklin , sam cooke , wilson pickett , whitney houston or lou rawls , or `60 soul motown or stax-volt - you'll love this cd . this where it all came . it all here , sweet falsetto crooners ( r.h. harris , claude jeter ) , church wrecking baritone shouters ( silas steele ) , earthshaking basso profundo ( classically trained . robert bradley , equally home german lieder or gospel shouting ) , choirs ( st. paul baptist church ) , quartets ( dixie hummingbirds , soul stirrers , swan silvertones ) , women ( mahalia jackson , clara ward , delores barret campbell ) , men ( brother joe may , professor alex bradford ) , one caught ( wilmer " little ax " broadnax , woman who lived her life man macho world male gospel quartet much admired tenor lead spirit memphis quartet ) . there not weak number this album , most gloriously good . there half dozen rare " spirit " " live " recordings , including rarely recorded legend queen . anderson , absolutely scorching swan silvertones medley segues searing dewey young baritone shout soaring claude jeter falsetto tour de force . i think it best thing ever captured this much recorded group . packaging liner notes impeccable , including authoritative 20 page history music performers . this project clearly conceived ideal follow up seminal 2 cd set " gospel sound " produced columbia 30 odd years ago heilbut legendary john hammond . there no overlap all two collections - they focus primarily different artists , where same artists appear ( mahalia jackson , dorothy love coates , dixie hummingbirds ) different ( equally powerful ) songs used . you'll want columbia collection well , since one cd covers pre-1947 roots , including unbelievable precision harmonies golden gate jubilee singers 3 tracks , second cd rivals this coverage period wwii 1960 . after these 2 albums you might check out heilbut other gospel collections shanachie , " gospel women , vol 1 vol 2 " , " kings gospel highway " , " great men gospel , vol 1 " or dorn/friedlander collection " gospel music " or " jubilation , vol . 1 vol . 2 " .	1
this my favorite oakenfold release . it so original it music selection . awesome driving music	1
i discovered this bit late but what beauty , what voice !! all i say thank god annie lennox !	1
this live cd perfect every musical way . music so awsome i crap myself everytime i listen this cd . songs taken hatebreeder something wild(the guy who wrote other review doesnt know what hes talking because follow reaper wasnt even out when they this show toyko . great buy . its very expensive cd but its worth money . i wish i could gotten it cheaper but oh well .	1
i love this cd . first off , i must say , i love power pop , knack , cheap trick , shazam , deal , etc . etc . granted , music all listener personal taste ( you negative reviewers this cd obviously none , ha ha ) . but seriously , this may one all-around best pop cds written . ever . period . i am not even jellyfish fan nor i impressed presents author unknown mr. falkner . chalk it up maturity or just sheer genius , but this album bee knees . it just everything ... lyrics fascinating intelligent production , wow , production complete surprises pace-changes always interesting make you want go back hit " play " one more time . this one those cds you could get lost desert island it would just okay ( hmm , solar powered ipod maybe ? ) . more details : amazon.com review - dead accurate , it really hard add much else . few artists or works compare this cd because songs fairly unique quirky , beck kinda way , while remaining always happier lighter confident side pop . i suppose references owsley cheap trick appropriate , but songs this cd longer stand themselves works art unlike typical 2min30sec power pop song strokes or hives . there sounds cars , beach boys , heck , even elo . tunes here aren't glammy , but times there some queen type bravado underlying , but more spirit or swagger then actual production . but ahhhhh , production .... every note twist turn each song grander purpose only genius ever understand . we simple fans must just try try , course , appreciate .	1
this album all more . brothers johnson no joke.in pocket guitaramp ; bass haven't same since they arrived scene . i'll good you still fresh today . together quincy jones they help create some most important music over past 30 years . i wish they could get back together	1
rebirth album breathed new life into angra after personnel shuffles following fireworks album but temple shadows bit blow - not terms musical skill , but it just band embraced such silly half-baked ide base poor concept album around . so they really needed acquire some forward momentum this disc - third full length album ' new ' angra . large band pull their chestnuts out fire . everything this release shows some conviction purpose - band here sending forth reasonably well rounded collection songs very much established angra vein . no big surprises here all but me that just fine . where this album wins out over it predecessor consistency . album less highs lows . we get everything we expect such bunch songs address melodic hard rock , couple segue into melodic metal few mellower numbers . but mentioned , this album whole wins through consistency . alas , around since early 90 angra no longer sheen new band generate excitement so this album probably only going heard established fans . which pity , but thos fand who kept faith well pleased this collection songs . personal faves here would include voice commanding you ; so near , so far breaking ties . it good see varied writing credits here which show what band effort this album . it also lovely see these guys still coming up different influences their music - take so near so far it use sound signatures not usually heard rock genre . it not case back holy land where all sorts instruments thrown listener , but use varied ' world ' influences definitely give angra edge , making them more individual some indefinable way more likeable bunch . minor gripes would slight issue whole ' english second language ' thing - though lyrics advisor employed presumably his job try iron out some clunkiness lyrics . lyrical concerns come across touch more dour than we're used this usually upbeat mob . but don't worry'bout above negatives - fans love this it would darn good place start newcomer start their education into angra catalogue . hearty 4 stars	1
cd amazing !!! i always fan bread , ever since i high school . i never grew tired hearing their songs over over again . when i saw digitally remastered cd amazon.com, i so elated because i couldnt find any their cd stores . it even better , i played cd over over again . so , it worth givin 5 stars ...	1

phil collins written banal , stupid , unmemorable , often uneven score this disney dreck musical , tarzan . his lyrics not rhyme all . they often try , but not work . his music bland highly unmemorable . actor playing tarzan , josh strickland sounds like cher jenn gambatesse jane needs work her english accent . orchestrations sound incredibly synthesized . nothing acoustical , nothing brassy , nothing remotely good . ( poor work usually wonderful doug besterman ) . show itself far worse than this cd . costumes scenic production incredibly tacky lame looking . book highly cliched structured quite poorly . this cast album filled awful music awful show . if you wish hear unmemorable music , bad performers dreadful lyrics , buy this album . if not , please not . you won't regret it .	-1

while i am partial bands like lamb god demon hunter i admit first band turn me this breed heavy metal music chimaira . when i first heard `pass out existence ' i floored brazen brutality musical diversity this band possessed , here , their third studio effort they don't let up but instead turn up heat create yet fantastic album . brilliant savagery they pull through tracks like opener `nothing remains ' `comatose ' yet delicate manner they bring new depth light tracks like my personal favorite `salvation ' tragic closer `lazarus ' which deals suicide friend . musically they one more talented bands out there , lyrically they shine especially this album . any fan two bands i mentioned outset , chimaira pure adrenaline adrenaline junkie ... you know who you	1

if ever there m.c. potential rekindle rap " golden era " supastition man . 2years after his " 7years bad luck " debut he dropped this mini-album ( 7 new tracks , intro plus 2 previously released singles ) teaser leading up his 1st full length soulspazm " chain letters " . after brief intro , " boombox " explodes through speakers amazing illmind produced beat captures supa breath-taking flows brilliantly . both " fountain youth " , " i remember " " homecoming " very nostalgic , reminiscing good old days hiphop , his childhood , how it him before he made it how he reps his hometown . beautifullly jazz crafted beats back these joints perfect results .

origin symmetry finds muse firing all cylinders sparing no prisoners their pursuit alternative rock throne radiohead jumped after ok computer album . their influence glaring element muse nags bit listener ; but thankfully , muse songs back it up . each track powerful laced dramatic crescendos soar sky high ( singer/guitarist matt bellamy vibrato croon ) then come crashing back down all their thrilling glory . muse wastes little time cutting straight meat their songs ... hooks come early upfront very little time spent detours ( although live setting sees them going bit overboard keyboard intros ... but that okay ) . bass strong drums pound unstoppable pounce . guitars blazing strong no punches pulled . me , matt bellamy voice could make or break this band average listener . some people not appreciate his breathy voice drips melodrama every word some may simply roll their eyes when he starts hit those high notes float around jeff buckley range ... but i like ti i think it adds nice prog rock touch it all . muse stretches things out works wonders their pop songs . they not afraid take risks fact , they strong band who deserve listen	1

some us who fans good while now , it seems hard place these timeless songs 2006 , but really thinking it , it half way through year , i don't know single album more explosive , gentle , soulful all same time than this album . truly thing beauty proof excellence still exists popular rock roll . what hard believe band only got better through record company mishap . not only they undoubtedly more patient people , but band become much tighter , logan evolving into technical genius behind drums , gutiars becoming solid fabric sound behind ever distinctive crooning skip , while timshel keys crown entire band sound way makes this band delight see live , not only rock out their new record . if they come your town , not pass up chance hear them ! perhaps only few days after release this album too soon anticipate next one , but anyone who fan , ( you quickly become one if you aren't already ! ) hear this , best rock album 2006 , know only greatness awaits this wonderful group	1
best king good introduction most underrated band hard rock . this collection covers their six albums atlantic 1988 out silent planet through 1996 ear candy . many best-of compilations , most best songs here well few questionable ones . here breakdown what included each album some comments : out silent planet : " king " " goldilox " . i can't argue these selections they both best most popular songs album . gretchen goes nebraska : " summerland " " pleiades " . first all , i would recommend all newcomers buy gretchen goes nebraska first since this band their very best whole album plays like one long highlight . you can't argue these selections since they among most well known . it would nice if studio version " over my head " included but since live version woodstock ' 94 included , i can't complain . faith hope love : " it love " , " mr. wilson " . this where band went very poppy . " it love " their most well known track " mr. wilson " very good . i would replaced " mr. wilson " " we finding who we " but no big deal . king : " black flag " " lost germany " . although " black flag " album most popular song , i would placed " prisoner " or " chariot song " here first . " lost germany " awesome deserves here . dogman : " dogman " " cigarettes " . " dogman " great but i never big fan " cigarettes . " all great songs this album , i'd probably put " fool you " here . ear candy : " train " , " looking love " , " life going " . both " looking love " " life going " great songs deserve here . however , i would replaced " train " " mississippi moon " , which best song album . unreleased tracks , all three very cool " sally " " lover " both very melodic while " april showers " shows band their funkiest . they're not among their best work but they not typical throwaway new tracks you get best-of collections . stated earlier , while i would recommend newcomers pick up flawless gretchen goes nebraska first , best king good introduction awesome band most tunes included among their best work . if you like what you hear , check out all their other albums . there not bad one among them .	1

i am largely disappointed this album . some reviews i read hailed dj spooky attempt conjoin multpile genres his expirimental style , but me result incoherent bravado noise . only enjoyable tracks those featuring guests such kool kieth sir menelik , but spooky silly pseudo-intellectual music-science rationalizations his overly filtered effects , it sounds less like music more like someone fun mixing board	1

this 1998 album last mariah came out before she stopped just flirting went full-speed into hip-pop , starting 1999s " rainbow " going last year " emancipation mimi . " now , don't get me wrong , woman few good singles this new hip-pop era hers ' ; fact i like all 4 big singles " mimi . " however , new output pales next fantastic pop songs " #1s . " album shows how good she ... huge ground-breaking ballads like " love takes time " " hero , " makes-me-wan t-t o-cut-a-rug dance tracks like " emotions " " someday . " plus her specialty , fabulous mid-tempo gems like " always my baby " " dreamlover . " who could forget one most popular songs all time , " one sweet day " boyz ii men . single spent 16 freaking weeks #1 hot 100 , more than any other song ever ! plus , this album shows how good she when she just flirted hip-hop , 2 great cuts " fantasy " ( although not this tacky version odb , but original album version ) " honey . " there so many good songs missing didn't make #1 , so get " greatest hits " those . fact , just get " greatest hits " because it includes almost everything here plus good stuff like " can't let go " " make it happen " " without you " " anytime you need friend " aforementioned " fantasy " original version " butterfly . " i am disappointed because neither " #1s " or " greatest hits " " breakdown " bone-thugz it , one my faves mariah . i wish mariah would lose some " hip " gain back some " pop " so she could make music good this again . this disc good rb/pop gets .	1

this some absolutely beautiful music mozart , sung wonderfully cecilia bartoli . i especially love two arias obbligato basset clarinet or basset-horn opera quot ; la clemenza di titoquot ; k621 . mozart already written great clarinet quintet k581 anton stadler , who invented bassett clarinet , extended lower range warmer tone than conventional clarinet . these played very nicely peter schmidl this cd . but highlight this disc taxing concert aria k505 , added delight obbligato piano part , played feeling andras schiff . it best both worlds : combining mozart exquisite piano writing , orchestra , his penning heavenly vocal lines . cecilia bartoli delivers all counts . this absolute must all serious mozart collectors	1
fat joe comes back 17 months after his last album his 7th solo released his own record label this time . i every one his albums since " don cartegena " those 5 , this his worst or 2nd worst one , but it still pretty good worth while . shorter than most his albums , only 12 songs , you get 4 ok other 7 good , one or two them real good , but no classic material songs here ( 1 close however ) . guests minimal , rapping 2 songs doing hook 2 others . production average , not good he usually . streetrunner grind music each 3 songs , scott storch dj khaled 2 songs each runners adn nu jerzey devil each track . his fans i'd recommend it but he much better work past . #1 - 8 #2 - 8.5 #3 - 7 ( f/ lil wayne) #4 - 6.5 #5 - 7.5 ( f/ game) #6 - 7 ( f/ h-mob) #7 - 8.5 ( f/ lil wayne) #8 - 8.5 ( nice beat) #9 - 9 ( tight beat) #10 - 8 #11 - 8.5 ( dedicated his mom) #12 - 9.5 ( tight beat -- deeper song best song here)joseph cartegena -- . 8/19/72 -- bronx , nycheck all my review	1

srv friends play up storm . herein arguably definitive recorded versions " cold shot " , " pride joy " " things i used " . horns really add warmth sound , but stevie ray front center . eric clapton said he awe stevie ray vaughan his flow ; way solos just poured out him , there some blazing examples this recording . yes , man great guitar play , absolute master form , but something rarely mentioned his singing emotive his playing . he great voice this night too	1

this people who enjoy real music band not all artificial . this album avril . you hear music , instruments . there no immitation filler . when listening this you almost feel you watching live band . what people expect when she left came back ? she didn't reinvent herself into something she ain't . she raw core use real instruments . album good beat continues throughout cd . i agree boy friend more pop album but rest what avril always . i like certain songs album not so great others but give me album i enjoy every single there rare treat . but i applaud avril staying true herself . allowing us see growing up doesn't mean turn stuffy , whorish or dead . i rather see avril any day act out girlfriend school age then watching gwen lead biotch party high school when she her 30'ish . all fans avril true music fans who don't appreciate fake music this good album you	1
understand just how much time passed since this release , try imagine time when there only one live document fans grateful dead . today , literally dozens upon dozens shows available through normal commercial channels , hundreds shows traded among aficionados , it seems almost comical imagine there once time when this only `official ' live document grateful dead . well , you've got start someplace , right ? , said , this one heck collection . there hardly anybody who would argue grateful dead band best suited recording studio . although they manage eke out occasional masterpiece , most their studio work sounds either way too loopy , or way too antiseptic . grateful dead just not sensibility required assemble tracks meticulous , orderly fashion . especially early stage their career , they viewed recording studio means breaking rules creating aural havoc , incredibly varied results . freedom constraints byword , but this attitude conveyed itself much more effectively live environment . live shows actually brought sense normalcy equation , since experimentation limited what they could create using nothing but their instruments their imagination . live/dead conveys just how successful they this regard . " dark star " , first ( only ) track side one , linchpin spawned band reputation most intuitive band rock roll . song itself - meaning part actually pre-written - consists little more than odd little melody limps pace molasses . it could disaster . grateful dead instinctive creative enough recognize potential offered , though , they waste none it . music doesn't accompany melody so much it surrounds it , basking wealth possibility could alter direction any moment . world rock roll , musical interplay rarely this instinctive . rest album operates same plateau , but varying degrees . " turn your lovelight " almost interesting , but operates more conventional base up-tempo blues jam . " death don't no mercy " equally heartfelt , but slows things down where you could draw breath each beat . " st. stephen " " eleven " most fun tracks listen , since they accurately capture playful , creative spirit made this band reputation what it . if you like your music succinct , cut , dried neatly arranged , this not album you . however , there hundreds thousands people who think outside box , music fans mindset already know anything i might say music grateful dead . you only listen , what better place start than beginning ? tom rya	1
i just picked this album up today i blown away . first all , despite mono recording , sound awesome ; clarity depth excellent . i shied away previous mono recordings , they tend get muddied , but this music suffers no such fate . kenny dorham sounds good i've ever heard him , bobby timmons just beginning shine . if you fan classic jazz , this must-have your collection	1
ok . rascals great . one best 60s groups ( but then what 60s group bad !? ) . this cd , compiled rhino - who saving good music ( endangered white rhino ) releasing great compilations 60s rock roll soul stars such this - great purchase , features many hits , some early single tracks , rascals . now , gripe little . some reviewers said sound quality this disc isnt very good . that crap . people say get me angry beyond belief . sound quality would need really , really , really crappy me say its bad . i one think old music should sound old , remaster it sure , but i think people complain too much poor sound remastering . part what makes this 60s music great , fact its 60s . age naturally going heard recording , which part sound songs should . its way they created . me , if you dislike sound , you dislike music . it age what i love ( partly ) . besides , mastering good anyway . disregard other reviewers , who should obviously listening modern music , " good sound quality " , who dont realize remastering only so much songs recoreded older technology . these people got free ... their annoying idiocy lolthis cd must .	1
this album includes group soothing songs consolidate certain musical instruments encapsulate virtually perfect jazz album .

" starting over " skillful piano play king , more keyboard fender rhodes work loeb , ricchiuti king track marginally modified vibe than others . chuck loeb " presence " definitely its own charisma its own brand magnetism . enjoy !	1
i played this cd time i bought it 1989 until i bought debravation 1993 ( every day never got bored once ) . cd features best work debbie solo wise ( also so debravation ) but this collection hits back it up . okay not us but they hits . first time this issued 1989 there lp version less songs , cassette 2 more songs cd full 4 songs bonus put lp didn't . hits this cd " i want man " which number 2 modern rock charts ( held out ian mccullogh " faith healing " ) number 13 uk number 2 australian charts . " kiss it better " only issued promo track college radio where it reached number 12 " sweet low " which issued 2 times 12 " single going number 17 club play charts 1990 . two other singles " brite side " " maybe sure " . if you debbie freak like me then you probably own picture discs , 12 " singles 45 these singles uk where debbie harry considered queen she . if you don't any picture discs this album then look ebay because they worth it . now onto cd itself . what said this collection -- listen " lovelight " which melds debbie ian astbury cult quite well . punk " comic books " , " bike boy " thrash metal " forced live " . spanish/latin beauty " calmarie " , fun " bugeye " , rap/dance " get your way " what i consider best vocal debbie put record -- " i'll never fall love " - she just glows . plus you get what i consider most personal song debbie harry chris stein ever wrote -- " end run " break up their long union basically fall original punk rock scene . song very very deep . so besides hits songs listed you also get great cover art fact this only cd any work songs produced debbie harry herself . cd originally reached only 123 here us but got number 12 uk well throughout europe australia speaks well foreign markets than it us or warner squat this excellent collection . i so many copies def , dumb blonde they all well worth buying again again . a+++++++	1
this album not worth it . i took my time listened all songs it , they just weren't all good . music strange , not all catchy . tunes not popular . i would say ian van dahl much better artist this kind music , not lasgo	-1
after seeing these guys live few times during glory days , i lot respect them . this album killer . every track rocks . those you who haven't seen movie , go check out clay pigeons , which features " timebomb " opening track . soundtrack tons other awesome alt/country/punk music it . i recommend too far care anyone who likes cmt country radio ..	1
this album one first solo records jazz . , fact it early product chicago scene , which most famously included art ensemble , make it historic recording . this not music just anyone , but if you into avant-garde , it forbidding beauty only enhanced knowing it conceived executed 1969 ! braxton opens 9-minute tour de force dedicated john cage which sounds somewhat like cross coltrane 1961 quot ; chasin ' tranequot ; 90s evan parker solo . close listening required quot ;d edicated ann peter allen , quot ; which played barely audible level . this exemplifies one braxton core concerns -- experimentation pure sound well form . unfortunately , there one such experiment i judge failure , original side 4 , quot ;d edicated leroy jenkins . quot ; braxton , this 20-minute piece , repeatedly , deliberately , honks , ayler-style , interrupted brief forays into higher registers . i'm sure his mind this represented some sort formal exploration context quot ; honk , quot ; noble sax tradition going back earliest days jazz . however , not all such formal experimentation worthy , end , presenting public . my recommendation this -- listen quot ; altoquot ; side side . rather than trying digest it whole , listen each original lp sides separately , which physiologically more closely corresponds human attention span than 70-minute cd . if you open-minded , i think you hear beauty this great late-60s record	1
me personally i don't like it but movie pretty good . my husband likes cd	1
sad songs this " psychotherapy soundtrack " perfectly reflect my sadness purchased this cd -- even though i got it free borders !! instrumentals often given bad rep because some them ( bad ones ) merely pop compositions vocals removed , leaving just boring repetitive accompaniment . what mogwai sounds like . even worse , every song slow ballad but long rhapsody . it true -- mogwai even slower than tortoise ! musical arrangements follows : 1 ) establish baseline ; 2 ) make slight deviation norm ; 3 ) repeat several measures ; 4 ) rinse repeat . it doesn't like this ! m83 trs-80 post-modern instrumental bands , but they're not boring . mogwai boring . that bottom line .	-1

after creating one finest albums 90s almost perfect tour-de-force emotional grunge - 1992 " dirt " - one most touching eps i've ever heard - 1994 " jar flies " - aic final output before staley death this self-titled album , aka " tripod " . " tripod " never really got acclaim akin " dirt " , although certain tracks got deal airtime such dingy heaven beside you , it rather underrated grunge era . however , i feel it lack consistency " dirt " times feels little bloated , but then it also contains some aic finest work very unique eerie feel it , it final works before tragedy . opening two tracks kick things off typical aic grunge style . grind menacing sluggish riff combined infectious chorus melody , trademark aic their best , brush away probably my favorite more straightforward rockers album its stellar guitar interplaying cantrell staley desperate cries `i gotta get away ... brush away loose ground ' . vibes anguish depression continued multiplied tenfold punishing sludge factory , which feels like , well ... sludge . this pinnacle album , definitely up there aic best achievements . band bludgeon their way through 7 minute entirety huge walls down-tuned guitars one staley best ever performances , his delivery full such deep frustration anguish it genuinely touching . heaven beside you then adds different angle depressive gloomy atmosphere , replacing crushing chords delicate acoustic playing ( yes , odd strum power chord , naturally ) rather desolate detached vocal performance cantrell staley , both adopting almost `laid back ' style which works very well . after this break booming guitars , albeit very emotional intense break , head creeps opens bang , big guitars distorted vocals layne , fantastic opening . rest album not quite heavy , exception god am so close , both solid rockers , tracks such shame you , frogs over now slower stripped powerful guitars . shame you first sign `happy ' vibe , although it quite open interpretation , it could either taken rare glimpse sunshine or desolate , `given up ' type ballad . two closing tracks , which band also use close out " unplugged " session both very touching hold eerie feeling i mentioned earlier - feeling tragedy followed album . overall this fine piece 90s grunge music , portraying band while not their peak , still create some fine music vocalist like layne staley , there heavy emotional aspect , emphasised his death which followed album .	1
this box makes great listening its own , but if you directly compare it hitsville usa box mono masters , differences quite dramatic . stereo sound softer , smoother more colorful , but mono tracks punch intensity stereo tracks only occasionally match . i don't think anything botched here- stereo mixes ( where unaltered ) very similar my lp box stereo motown hits- it simply best their equipment could back then . some remixes appear genuine effort match organic power mono tracks , results fascinating . but i'd say hitsville usa it where it matters- it swings harder , more authentic , costs less . get over mono-phobia- hitsville usa mandatory purchase .	1
pete yorn brillant artist . musicforthemorningafter quite wonderful album listen begining end without skipping through songs . guitar so rich warm , followed yorn fantastic voice , making great combonation . if you want take first listen see what it all check out first album definately !	1
fresh his well-received score latest bond epic , " casino royale , " david arnold turned far more somber serious project michael apted important film beginning end slavery british empire , " amazing grace . " this not first time arnold worked apted , note bond effort " world not enough , " so we expected two rather comfortable one . good match it proven this time around . arnold produced score serious subject matter . it intelligent , moving times quite poignant . one might expected arnold simply integrate well known hymn which naturally plays role story number variations it ( much like his integration bond theme into his 007 music ) , but instead he created his own themes , including especially haunting main theme , fine score . arnold proven himself action-adventure genres we waiting more mature score , tasted bits pieces host other works . here we see david arnold capable composer across spectrum . well produced emi , soundtrack somewhat disappointing its packaging ; promotion " amazing change " appropriate deserving mention , but more could film music themselves . promo " music inspired film " bit much though given none it actually film .	1
while many today country ( matter , every other genre ) performers crank out " hits " packages one or two number one tunes , reba mcentire put out this disc slim ten tunes . said , however , all ten these songs legitimate hits . " rumor it " " you lie , " mcentire well song selection here . what you get small sampling ten reba best tunes . many today artists struggle find enough " hits " compile hits package , but reba around long enough simply pull few tunes her catalogue make solid hits album worthy purchase . she small group artists who such things . other names list would include george jones , willie nelson , george strait , merle haggard , alabama , dolly parton . that good company folks . my personal favorite this disc " fancy . " entire disc gives listener chance listen mcentire when she beginning loosen her country bindings feel out other styles music blues broadway . mcentire savvy , doesn't need resort controversy or pandering prove just how great artist she . purchase this album if you want some great country pop country tunes . long before faith tim considered " dynamic duo " dixie chicks singing western swing birthday parties , mcentire establishing herself one greatest female performers country music . also note fact she made her mark when country genre dominated men . highly recommended	1

second record texan noise-makers . it filled short quot ; tunesquot ; , or rather pieces , built mostly around guitar , bass drums . but they perform their music cross amateurish playfulness artistic conceptuality . not they bad musicians , but they understood charm simplicity lo-fi bands nineties use great effect . this record deserves better recognition important art-rock/alternative influence	1

i've big bsb fan since 1999 all their import albums bonus tracks . i think this album their worst , but still good . my biggest complaint this album lack darren hayes penned track lift me up , they said interviews not up par rest album i could not disagree more . boys didn't hardly anything writing this album , which not my complaint , but darren hayes track could over powered almost any track entire album . i darren hayes version bsb version they both stellar . bsb awesome job track which hard me say because i am darren hayes fanatic i wonder what they thinking when they left this track release didn't even include it b-side . anyway , never gone solid album , just pissed they didn't include darren hayes track because it eclipses most songs album . solid return something new . good album , just could slightly better . too bad us fans , we get no bonus tracks unless we buy import version album which always better than us release . record companys give us worst version any album no matter what artist . compare any import album any us release you find us release stripped comparison .	1

every bit this album just plain rocks . kids , forget whatever you think rock , this blueprint . listen this live leeds , you got pretty good idea which all real rock music based . even jimmy page would probably agree	1
suzi quatro great introduction rock roll when my early teens 70 th`s here intense female light screaming vocal exploded my ears . that`s fore sure . there`s no playlist listed here this import , but i first print 1990 , stumblin not included among these 20 greatest hits , but maybe emi included it 2005 print . but there more enough goodie , goodies cd . it smashes directly into here megahitcan , masterpiece songwriters chinn/chapman . suzi " rock roll " scream queen , which plays bassguitar , heartbeat driven rythmic punch bass which realy set`s standard . track 2 48 crash also delivers much same quality previous one . suzi voice raw scream quality , fits perfect this early 70 ths hit . track 3 daytona demon , weird breathing vocal beginning , but doesn`t holds same standard . too much , too messy . other words , " not demonic " give me good creepy feeling . track 4 devil gate drive . we back simpel good rock roll feeling . this one knows it roots , its very well performed every department . track 5 too big , minor let down . it drive , thats sure , but little extra missing . great pianoplaying background , though . track 6 wild one , not wild enough , nothing other great songs same title . this orginal chinn/ chapmann production . track 7 you mamma won`t like me . just ok this one , funky it anyway , sometimes good , sometimes not . track 8 i bit off more than i could chew . it`s suzi doin " psychidelia " rock roll change . not everybody taste . track 9 i may young " honky tonky " rock roller which swings ok . track 10 tear me apart , quality rock roller , good singin melody follow . track 11 roxy roller , ecco , good bassdrive , but melody which easily forgotten . track 12 if you can`t give me love chinn/ chapman classic which realy delivers . it drive , guts , glory , much soundpicture stumblin classic smokie sound , where chris norman came who sang duet suzi stumblin . track 13 race something else change . it begin`s ballad , but suddenly changes weird rythmic pop song , which far rock roll . track 14 she`s love you , song which refrain which goes , that`s it . track 15 mamas boy , much same problem . track 16 i`ve never love good standard rocker heart soul roots back 50 ths . track 17 rolling stone , here first singel 1972 , ecco flower power music , but sorry say not good . track 18 all shock up , interesting take presley classic , it swing`s very well all trough . track 19 keep knockin , classical rock roller , where suzi gives us orginal interpretation off . track 20 wake up little suzi . classic which everly brothers ricky nelson better . anyway , this glam , bam , quality rock roll suzi quatro , good introduction quality rock roll " scream queen " 70 ths . if stumblin included this 2005 print , you extra gem , lucky you	1
im only 15 white kid but i think i know good music when i hear it , stanley clarkes school days my all time favorite jazz album , bass playing blew me through puberty other musicians all jazz legends . this truly amazing album	1
well start i thought this going good album . sadly i mistaken . i usually don't make bad choices because i always screen my music before buying . this time i didn't which mistake . it started out good but after hitting 4th or 5th track they all seemed sound same nothing impressed me anymore . it just seems if band stopped trying after first 4 songs . don't get me wrong there couple tracks i really like lot . it just many tracks nothing me sound same . here my ratings ... 1 . dopesick - 10/102 . beginning end - 9/10 3 . return zero - 9/104 . glass jaw - 8/105 . deep colors bleed - 7/10 6 . mailbomb - 7/107 . bedsores - 4/108 . slowburn - 3/109 . somewhere - 6/10 10 . lesser god - 2/1011 . pitch black - 4/1012 . if only - 7/1013 . thick skin - 3/10overall : 60% d-this cd just got so boring just wasn't good . i don't know maybe it right you . i am warning you though your research before hand otherwise you could end up like me .	1

i can't get over how awesome tom waits . i think he my generation neil diamond . he writes songs things i don't understand all . i listening opening track off this gem understood song war bolivia over collard greens . i'm not sure if what song really , but his delivery so silky smooth you really don't care . he reminds lot josh groban his voice . it very smooth pleasing . i date supermodel iowa last week put this disc . she got little mad because she thought she going get some love because i put mood music . i told her her love delivered later , but just quiet listen vocal stylings next bryan ferry . weights one those artists it not cool like , kind like telling people you love mtv now . i'm not all ashamed admit i like tom weights more than chris deburgh this point . he still not josh groban or peter cincinnati , but he certainly won't make you puke when you listen him . get this cd because tom neato	1
this music so good it makes you stop what you're doing so you start playing air guitar sing ! johnny rivers ' music not what you need play when multitasking . you'll never get your work . start here introduction his recordings , then start collecting original albums . rivers one few artists whose ' filler ' material just good ' hits .	1
this far one hancock best recordings ( least since headhunters , thrust , manchild days ) . he captures strange haunting sound twilight jazz , pop rock . when i come home long day there nothing better than mixing gin tonic putting herbie fantastic version " norwegian wood " . musicians seams completely tune this record , not just showing off talent but really putting there soul into it . if you dig miles davis " silent way " or coltrane " my favorite things " then you going love this fantastic record . tracks like " mercy street " , " when i see you " , " manhattan " " love stronger than pride " made good stuff , they played depth skill rare way makes classic . short this record put next any great jazz masterpiece	1
this seems older group his earlier recordings . i love ' my world ' .. il mondo . i know this song spanish it so beautifully engelbert english . all songs chosen this cd really nice listen . if my cd broken or damaged i'd certainly buy replacement this same one again	1
me ice-t one best rappers ever i've spent long hours listening his hardcore gangster rap . kind odd middle-aged white guy but what i say ? his your face , pro-freedom speech attitude one i hold myself . he one founding fathers gangster rap one it most innovative lyricists . i've seen ice-t his rap act only once but seen him his band body count four times he puts tremendous show . seven deadly sins lot more edge it than ice-t preceding album , return real . result it better effort some solid tunes . there not much mix beats though , which weakness , but you play it through without skipping quite entertained . seven deadly sins scores solid 3 stars : retaliation * common sense * check your game* ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ ratings : cds rated simply how many good songs album . great songs get two stars , good songs get one star . songs get no stars those i might like but not enough give it star or ones i find boring or actively dislike . cds not penalized songs i don't like because they easy enough skip over . there no maximum number stars cd get , but course more stars it gets , better cd . all reviews , these my subjective opinions album .	1
i fan leon russell since he band high school - i records but needed cd	1
i am so dissapointed this cd . i bought it because i " blow blow " " jeff beck jan hammer group " i love those cds . this crap sounds like somebody heard those recordings , practiced one week tried imitation them . i don't like one cut entire cd . i only gave it one star because i couldn't find way give it less .	-1

this collection , rock instrumental 50 classic great addition any collection , you don't hear these recordings hardly all . availability these cd very good thing , get all these hits together excellant price extremely hard find . all these songs original course , rhino , counted real stuff . this cd should given 10 stars .	1

trane cherry perfect foil each other . far this type music goes , this one best albums . this much like coleman album coltrane sitting . musical interplay " blessing " outstanding . it interesting hear coltranes soprano sax here , first time he played it album i believe . this very important album history jazz , it wort getting fact alone . some my friends who not like jazz , especially this type , actually like this album . if you want explore music john coltrane don cherry individual artists there some better choices though . like most music coltrane involved he makes very bold musical statement . also nice version " bemsha swing "	1
it some songs i am looking but i am looking jingle bells , guy lombardo royal canidians . alubm fifties . i album but would like it cd	1
honest , i didn't like this cd much first . it really grew me , though , all i've listened last three days . true , it leap outside realm what you'd expect esl thievery corporation . not bad thing - who wants never surprised ? it not nearly ... happy i expected it though , reading others reviews . it definitely funky , but sort dark vibe it , too . it rocks . buy it . absorb it	1
that how describe this . album . era where lowest common denominator junk gets played radio , anyone review any piece garbage amazon , giving it 4 or 5 stars when it deserves 1 or 2 , this great change . granted it some 30 years old , but it still relevant today it when it released , which just one great things it . this definition album which sum greater than parts . thankfully , far greater . individual songs , 2 chord deals doesn't work out real well . they seem boring , repetitive , etc . however , when you listen it start finish , they flow together , blow you away . start finish , you feel revitalised , like you just learned new life lesson , maybe end , it truly feeling counts , essence great music	1
these widely considered finest recorded performances one premier baritone popular singers ever . it shame dick haymes not opportunity follow these recordings even more . statement other review haymes voice " ragged " little bizarre , because most anyone listening would describe these performances ( i hate use word ) " smooth " . these recordings only available high priced alternative editions japan rare out-of-print english edition . but this edition adds bonus all haymes various singles capitol ( never cd before , all very rare any form ) . if you enjoy haymes , sinatra closest competitor , please try out many various cds put out dick haymes society , all available through amazon , live radio performances , studio transcriptions other things , all good quality discs rare collectables someday . this 2 cd edition very special . if you like sinatra ballad records 50 capitol , get this too !	1
when i first listened " bless martyr , kiss child " , eloquent makeup brutally efficient hardcore norma jean , i never thought they could make album could come close matching shear superiority album . i wrong , i'll tell you why ; not because " o ' god ... " necessarily matches up , but because two literally uncomparable . when josh ( lead vocalist ) left band , he also left traditional sound made norma jean special well , brought it his newest project , chariot . then , after brief vocal hiatus , cory joined band lead vocalist , he , like josh , brought innovative sound him . so comes brilliantly simple but never outdated cliche , every death there rebirth . further prove my mondane use this cliche , norma jean " reborn " , they proved it their sophomore album " o ' god ... " album itself , priceless commodity artistic sound , brings such energy , vigor , individuality world hardcore music lacks today . album hits hard immediately #1 " murderotica " , passionate , short sweet ( 1:58 ) collection bliss . cory yells " our knives say ' we're making way this , ending '" , it takes lot not jump out your chair start beating up air vivaciously . #3 " bayonetwork " single album , one only three songs cd actual singing vocals it . rough melody cory sings " this me this blade my heart " . guitars , heavy crunch tuning called " minor " which unheard many , but makes sound guitars much more different other hardcore acts . best song album #8 " absentimental " , comprised use fast paced metal mixed traditional use breakdown previously demonstrated " bless martyr , kiss child " . i listen this song whenever i either need get pumped up day , or i'm really pissed off something ; it therapy i promise , try it . i recommend this album anyone who smart enough know what pure art , because that what " o ' god aftermath " , pure art . lyrically superior , heavy sumo wrestler , brilliantly passionate , blissfully heartfelt their intentions ; norma jean not go wrong when they made this album . they become inspiration me many others , displaying belief something beyond ourselves not prevent us writing heavy music . so go , buy this album , blast it max , live dream ..	1
i love this cd , i think it one best bluegrass collections bela produced , host different styles artists	1
i never fortunate enough see cale live , so i treasure this . every song completely different original , so it like two discs adventurous brand new music . one question though : i heard least two comments people great sound quality . mine , however , sounds like medium-quality bootleg , hugely disappointing . anyone know if there multiple versions this	1
man midwest introduced me david allen coes music . i am glad he . after i got this album played it all my family friends i think all them liked it much i . anyway if you care anything outlaw , renegade style country music then this definately must cd ! it remind me hank jr ., willie nelson , waylon jennings certain extent . too bad you not hear sample quot ; ridequot ; song . probably song most people remember david allen coe . song also puts me mind alan jacksons quot ; midnight montgomeryquot ; song ( similiar subject )	1

i've fan coltrane while now , slowly building up my library , i warned wild later period so i began his early stuff continued way . i remember first time i listened love supreme , i speechless , it blew my mind ! then i listened live birdland , when coltrane came his solo afro blue i thought my heart gonna stop ! ahh . so once i listened quartet albums thousandth time , i decided it time go forward . some reason i picked live seattle my step into coltrane later formed world , i think it because i loved birdland so much i jumped live album . when i first listened , i couldnt get through cosmos , though i liked out this world some parts others songs . so trouble album i didnt listen it while . though i didnt go out buy more albums right away , i started reading knowing much coltrane i could . musician , hes always one my musical idols , but then he became idol its own , i truely admired him all he worth , there no like him ! i started listened sun ship i dug it so i decided try out live seattle once again , when cosmos began , i felt like i falling into trance . i closed my eyes my body swayed back forth , i felt music deeply my heart soul , when i got body soul i tears my eyes . i love john coltrane	1
not quite classic , but highly superior album . milk rhyme just well he makes beats , which fire ! dilla-esque approach tempo songs , milk delivers piece sv ( w/ dilla ) era nostalgia . plus w/ detroit legends like elzhi , phat kat , others ... black milk drops gem hip-hop heads .	1
i fervently hope norah jones not turn out one hit wonder . there just so little excited music today . this music touch you , unlike commercial kaka predominates	1
possible exception track 12 - sick punk ( already recorded cd ) , this cd nothing but tripe ! this cd full painful ballads horrible lyrics deserves negative rating if possible . i also considered nuno one best ( if not best ) guitarists world ... but after this his previous solo effort(s ) ( he dressed girl cover one cd ) , not mention mourning widows , he really lost whatever magic he once commanded . sadly , least jason becker good reason his fade . he set aside all made him great - playing guitar . far other raters go - stop lying public ! nuno one greatest guitarists , but nuno seems dead . don't buy this cd without first hearing samples abysmal tracks first . buyer beware !!	-1
there always something hokey steppenwolf . their coolness contrived , i don't think anyone my neighborhood took them too seriously . comparing steppenwolf let say jefferson airplane would like comparing monkees beatles . but steppenwolf live album they acheived something little bit above their usual guilty pleasure status . yeah , it not true live album , blah , blah , blah , but whatever applause tracks they added later doesn't interfere ( too much anyway ) good cuts . i mean lot people bought got live if you want it stones . there several fake live albums those days . but there some good cuts here . tighten up your wig , draft resister , power play , twisted , here there eventually yes , monster version monster . all these my ears sound much better than their big hits end disc , magic carpet ride , pusher born wild . get original studio version one their dozens greatest hits packages hear hits . lyrics , well they what you could call blue collar activist or radical 60 dummies . however i say if you look words monster latter half suite , you might think it 2006 ... " though ( america ) past its share injustice/kind spirit many way/ but its protectors friends sleeping/now it monster not obey . " all together now " ... their vote meaningless joke . they babble law orderbut it all just echo what they've told . yeah , there monster looseit got our heads into nooseand it just sits there watching . now we fighting war over therethat no matter who winsyou know we can't pay costamerica , where you now , don't you care your sons daughters ? don't you know we need you now , we can't fight alone against monster ?

i am just normal middle aged guy doesn't typically reveal my " sensitive " side . however , i popped this broadway recording cd player saturday morning almost fell apart . brian stokes mitchell , don quixote , masterful job drawing you into heart mind wandering , opportunistic knight errant . course classic always , " impossible dream ( quest ) " not justice unless turned up point stokes mitchell vocals cause pictures wall tilt ! knowing story don quixote sancho panza leads one laugh hysterically " golden helmet mambrino " . you can't listen this piece without chuckle . lastly , final sequence mary elizabeth mastrantonio aldonza proclaiming herself dulcinea acknowledging her love quixote , don quixote cry his armour , reprise " quest " overlaid " psalm " just extraordinarily incredible finish . my listening eye pictured great last gasp inspired hope don quixote challeges cast never give up quest . likewise , massed vocals crescendo embue listener always , dream impossible dream ! yourself favor , buy this cd . listen it loud . listen it long listen it over over again . you won't regret experience	1
i truly appreciate rhino records re-released remastered alice cooper " billion dollar babies " " welcome my nightmare " which included bonus tracks more . rhino 4 cd box set rather disappointment because they chopped up or only gave us " single " versions many his tracks . so when i saw " welcome my nightmare " come out re-released remastered rhino , i hoping rhino would re-release remaster alice cooper entire catalog . least , rhino should consider remastering alice cooper " love it death " , " killer " , " school out " . " love it death " , " killer " really need some extra attention . first only issues these two albums warner brothers just sound weak , muddy hissy , just simply old-world mastering technology . " i'm eighteen " sounds alot better rhino " best alice cooper " cd . check it out yourself . come rhino , please finish what you started .	1
this might not very first gangsta rap album , but rage ice cube voice premium production dr. dre this album set stage mainstream gangsta rap even without help radio or mtv . acronym niggaz attitude these guys packed all attitude compton into this disc . mc ren ice cube spitting your face street lyrics like p***ed off chuck anyone who heard this couldn't dodge impact subject matter .

while mr. ho probably represents ultimate authentic hawaiian traditional singing , i can't say i really go kind rough , old-fashioned folk music , its macho depictions intertribal warfare patriarchal oppressiveness . call me wimp , but i much prefer softer smoother sounds early 1960s " lounge " music , all those cool daddy-o lyrics mellow instrumental accompaniment . you just can't beat something like les elgart or dick hyman soothing background your next full-tux cocktail party	1

roxy music career divided into two fairly distinct halves . mach i flamboyant early mid 70 version mixed experimentation unique rocking side . mach ii creamy dance band late 70 early eighties . while both bands their highlights , i definatley prefer early version . this cd documents band playing live their glory years . strong , but unusual selection songs enhanced strong performances . number these cuts eclipse already amazing studio versions . my favorites include both ends burning , if there something pyjamarama . bryan ferry obviously enjoying himself these performances rest band contibutes sublime moments throughout . fans early version this band , viva must . those fans later years may wish check this out before purchasing	1

after highly succesfull " empire " album , queensryche forced tour extensively order meet demand their concerts . after long , greuling tour , band members went their seperate ways extended period time , eventually re-united record their fifth studio album titled " promised land " . phrase " promised land " actually metaphor american dream success . queensryche discovered ( commercial ) success , which what " empire " gave them , really wasn't all it made out . so they hit studio , instead writing futuristic totalitarian digital age ( found some songs " warning " " rage order " ) , or social commentary love songs ( case " operation : mindcrime " empire " ) , queensryche decided instead look within lyrics revolve around personal issues . end result " promised land " , which , say least , masterpiece . instrumentally , this queensryche creative peak . theres still " metal " parts found songs such " damaged " " my global mind " , but theres much more variety this time around , plenty clean guitars , guitar harmonies , guitar solos actually add songs without giving feeling they just there fill up space . however , this album few road bumps . " dis con nec ted " still continues same dark , moody atmosphere all songs leading up it , but it clearly inferior quality rest album . " my global mind " step-down quality well . however , they still descent songs fit well album . rest album nothing short exellent . my favorite songs " i am i " it eastern flavored guitar harmonies open up album positive note , fact my second favorite queensryche opener behind " walk shadows " , " bridge " , which nice , short , emotional song written chris degarmo which talks his torn relationship his father , title track , which really hard describe , " one more time " , it beutiful mix clean distorted guitars topped off great chorus almost gilmore-like guitar solo , " someone else " , which song jampacked emotion great singing . conclude , this album exellent , my second favorite ryche album behind " operation : mindcrime " . it might take some people couple listens album sink , but once it , it exellent . i highly recommend this album	1
kix made best pure rock roll record their careers blow my fuse . i don't understand why this album would excluded any fan hard rock or metal . song song album just smokes . smoker " red light , green light " just blasts wonderfully so ... i can't imagine anyone not instantly liking " cold blood " or " don't close your eyes " they memorable hooks . kix this point time better than acdc but never got recognition they deserved . this band very influenced sound but bon influence fun entertainment . steve excellent vocalist this genre if you don't know kix this their best effort overall nothing they after or previously came close . highly recommended listening	1
charles mingus ' 1956 release , pithecanthropus erectus , one his very first great albums . mingus recorded many great artists this point , including max roach , dizzy gillespie charlie parker . mingus also recorded few good albums early mid fifties . however , it pithecanthropus erectus got mingus noticed jazz world . this became first album string albums would some best most important albums era . although many these albums surpassed pithecanthropus erectus , this albums still remains essential charles mingus catalogue . title track incredible compositon attempts recreate dawn man music . it one his best compositions . foggy day very cluttered sound . i'm not sure if i like it or not , but i think it one weaker tracks album . profile jackie great song puts alto sax player jackie mclean spotlight . album ends love chant , which highlight . playing this album incredible it essential mingus fans . however , some his following albums would stronger compostions . this still must	1

although venentian snares ' reputation one fastest ear bleeding electronic acts moment one he seems steer away some albums ( winter belly snake , rossz csillag allat szuletett ) , its reputation he wholeheartedly embraces winnipeg frozen sh*thole . this album recalls his noisy debut making orange things he made speedranch - loud , fast considerably less complex glitch/idm than his usual output ( but lot more complex than normal gabba/speedcore ) . said , i'd say winnipeg frozen sh*thole quite bit better than making orange things ( album i've only just grown enjoy gave rather scathing 1 star review 8 months ago ) due more cohesive sound , more attention beats rhythms much more intelligent use samples . music gabba driven breakcore . relentlessly fast never quiet moment , album one his most dancable ( providing dancers taste extreme ) . emotion isn't really name game here neither complexity ( there some ' wtf ? ' moments but compared lot his stuff winnipeg frozen sh*thole relatively straight-ahead ) . although not brain meltingly complex higgins ultra low track glue funk hits or experimental doll doll doll it makes up it very danceable catchy only way venetian knows how . if you want your next venetian snares album little more than gabba driven noisecore mentally unstable dance then pass this up time , but its great album so don't go too long without it	1
finally , blue note jackie mclean co . given time opportunity practice/rehearse/jam before tape started rolling . not disparage records like mcleans scene , strange blues , alto-madness etc ... they wonderful but all extremely loose seem tetter times not emotionally but what hell coming next kind way which beautiful ... its just new soil little preconceiving seems let things grow unhindered . donald byrd trumpet , paul chambers bass , walter davis jr. piano , pete la roca drums ... oak-solid band who swing out mcleans furrowed like phrases ... relentlessly . i highly recommend this music	1
yes , one earlier reviewer states it , black snake rules indeed ! this song kept sneaking back into my brain time again after i lost my tape quot ; hearing atomic roosterquot ; many years ago . when i bought cd , i recalled this just o 8 superb tracks . this cd competes best work elp which one somewhat reminded whenever piano dominates . but e.g. there great sax well . there isn't any dull moment this cd ! i keep wondering whether it really just three people ( excluded singer ) which produce such tight sound . bonus track quot;devil answerquot ; album atomic rooster which apparently big success . but it doesn't really measure up rest quot ; hearing ofquot ; , so i'm still doubt whether i should buy one	1
britney outdone herself this one . this ballad just so amazing . i listen it i drive down beach i can't get enough it . i think it one britney best . buy it ! you wont regret it .	1
i just got this cd concert , it every way awesome ! i am lead guitarist also particular who i listen . my opinion best g3 eric johnson whom i seen concert 3 times , once when he 17 years old , time he absolutely best guitarist i ever seen , ( i also met him we talked stratocasters how he modified his get those amazing tones , he real nice person ) opinion still stands . eric johnson still plays chords his songs , which i feel great guitarist , plus most technical tasteful leads . i don't think i heard joe satriani or steve vai play any chords all except 3 last cover tunes , now don't get me wrong , i think all 3 great ! i joe satriani albums also love them , but eric johnson vituoso good reason . i plan purchase dvd also . incidentally i worked some really hot lead guitarists who never play chord either , guess what ? i don't think they any idea what chords tune . why i appreciate virtuoso eric johnson , complete guitarist . i heard seen him play clapton , hendrix , almost any style flawlessly . i his " total electric guitar " vhs ,.... wow ,... i could never learn play so well ( i spent many hours trying ) . some people born spectacular-eric johnson . overall this wonderful live concert 3 great lead guitarists great backup musicians . i highly recommend it fans musicians alike .	1
this album wasnt good i hoping . its pretty strange whole album christina ricci , but content great , beats grouch nice . very good chill/kick back album	1
i'm not really fan any compilations ultra records put out anymore , least ultra chilled . i haven't really heard other compilations like ultra dance first ultra trance but judging track list , they pretty generic mixed cds . i bought ultra trance 2 whim . i fortunate enough find used copy opposed shelling out { money } new copy . i can't comment bonus dvd since i don't own dvd player so i comment first disc . my major problem disc 1 botched mixing job provided david waxman . songs so not flows well together . i think reason songs david waxman used . somehow duncan sheik " high " last song i would think remixing . it wasn't bad trance song but it just not fit songs it stuck . songs started sound like one repetitive loop middle cd i found myself literally bored tears . i hated way sylver livin ' my life " ended where plummet " damaged 03 " began . just goes show me what little skills dave waxman dj . i may not dj , let alone know how mix songs but i wouldn't botched job like he those two songs . still i adored songs like 4 strings ' " let it rain " , sylver " livin ' my life " , " never " roc project feat . tina arena . female vocals infectious melodies what i find irresistable trance music , especially those songs . i would given this cd 3 stars but i loved those songs last three songs so much i decided generous . far mixed cds goes , " ultra trance 2 " not one best mixed cds i ever heard but not one best . series needs dj who actually make music flow one cohesive unit	1
this one first japanese traditional music cds i wanted . if you watch lot kung foo movies , you recognize this sound it usually played during meditation or beginning fight scene . this great cd if you wanting relax or it would great play during dinner subtle background music . if you wanting something more upbeat , i highly suggest " japanese taiko " joji hirota	1
my money , " omen " trilogy most fascinating progression styles i heard soundtracks movie series . first one bagged oscar provided gothic power energized movie . second one beating rawness combined electronic edge . but number three --" final conflict " my opinion tops not only series , but one goldsmith best works . this soundtrack continues portray ominous evil this series , but completely different style others . unlike choral electronic driven entries before , goldsmith really lets whole orchestra loose here . addition movie allows him balance portrayal ultimate evil ultimate good ... contrast makes some great listening . my favorite tracks : " main title " , absolutely outstanding " hunt " . " second coming " riveting well . it shame music attached mediocre movie . it not likely this soundtrack get attention goldmith received " star trek " or even first " omen " . varese sarabande terrific job this release however , this remains underrated score deserves more attention	1
this almost perfect album . it so close i give it 5 stars . other reviewers written , there no one compare amy rigby , but like everyone else i'll try . i would describe her 60% lucinda williams her alt-country sound 40% jill sobule her witty poinant lyrics . i enjoyed every song this album first song " wait till i get you home " which upbeat just made me smile , last song " sleeping moon " beautiful lush song felt too short . you wished it would go little longer , like relationship song . every song painted picture . some people say this album good her first album " diary mod housewife " , but i think it better . songs this album seems more " developed " , more confident . it feeling someone who ease who they their music . her first album , although strong , felt like she tried too hard . only reason why i described this album " almost " perfect because fourth track " let me little bit " . this song seemed weaker than other songs , but even this song pretty good . i know this review very general not very helpful determining whether spend your hard earned money it or not ; all i say " buy album , you won't disappointed .	1
listening andy williams brought back lots memories . you just don't hear these songs played free radio anymore . now i listen anytime i want . great cd	1
what deal all whining this record ? why complain this kind music ? anybody lucky enough discover derek music should thankful . think what sorry shape mainstream music these days then think greatest keyboard player planet who hires best guitar players play his records then ask yourself what am i complaining ? man this guy rocks ! every cd he recorded must people want their brainwaves stimulated . i highly recommend blood snake . i ask myself any these negative reviewers ever heard black sabbath , jeff beck , or dream theatre ? real heavy music lovers please stand up ? i	1
this far modest mouse best album . it hard most people understand first . this album whole different feel it than rest their albums . this first modest mouse album i ever heard , i couldn't get into it didn't want first . but friend convinced me sit through it 3 or 4 times , now i can't get enough it . yourself huge favor buy this album . close your eyes listen it all way through one or twice , if you still don't like it , you poor taste music you suck . if you love this album like i , you'll also love ugly casanova album titled sharpen your teeth . great modest mouse album fruit ate itself	1
powerlight one their best albums ever . i would rate this par faces raise album where each track superbly produced different other tracks . 2 choruses heart heart subtley different each other this point exemplifies musical subtlties present across album . even after 16 years , i still get lift hearing tracks . miracles so powerful , maurice voice consistent clear . fall love me so simply catchy chord changes during intro spine tingling . unfortunately , they went downhill here , but it would nice see this line up return studio again	1
it surprising how many mediocre artists sell so many records , how really interesting artists disappear into obscurity . linda perhacs no exception . blessed beautiful clear voice , batch lovely songs mind willing experiment , she produced stunning work which long lost world but thankfully brought light again . album flying start " chimacum rain " which sets tone rest : layers stunning vocals sympathetic effective backing . " paper mountain man " less unique but still very good , reminds listener heart . songs like " dolphin " , " call river " " morning colors " especially remind me tim buckley great happy/sad blue afternoon period . least succesful this great set songs " moons cattails " , which sounds too contrived less ' spontaneous ' if you . title song " parallellograms " surprising lyrics ( lot mathematical words ) daring experimental break , which also hints tim buckley work - unique superb " starsailor " . me , winner this fine collection " hey , who really cares " : nothing strange or daring there , but very gentle , melancholic simply beautiful . all this album head above many works sold millions it deserves far greater audience . happily , it seems linda perhacs decided enter world music again produce new album ( only her second since end sixties ) end this year . hopefully this new album ( if it good first one ) cause more deserving response .	1
this latest installmenet myrtle beach show typical panic . easily proving it worth . i might give light fuse get away edge my favorite live release . but live myrtle beach certainly gets job , fresh new batch jam , while we all start getting juiced tour . no phish , dead , ... over year off . prepare hottest , hungryest tour jam scene yrs . definately take this disc you shows	1
those get this album it nothing short masterpiece . those don't it anything but masterpiece . before judging this album one way or other i recommend multiple listenings over fairly extended period time . try listening it 8 or 9 times over period couple weeks . i've actually known people who first thought this album awful , but after while their ears opened up it they absolutley loved it .	1
many years i looking thorough rick astley greatest hits package . finally this one issued . i think rick great voice , it shame his career sort died . i suspect he written off dance/pop teen idol never really taken seriously . but i think his voice every bit good josh groban , he should seriously pursue kind career josh groban . i loved rick updeat dance tunes , but ballads like " cry help " " hopelessly " showed his true vocal prowess . i also like some his songs not perform well here states such " ones you love " his remake " ain't too proud beg " . all his hits here , big ones not so big ones . i recommend this cd highly .	1
this album well worth purchase if you enjoy electronica . however , electronica wide range styles ranging your big beat your trance what you . if you like dance beats steady change like cool off more down-tempo things this album combines all elements , steady listen	1
" flush " one alice best lp , hands down . those who disappointed it too busy looking something else . this record straight-forward rock bit new-wave era flavor . no ballads , anthems , or shockers here . other words , not what many come expect alice cooper , but ten quick gutsy rockers averaging slightly less than three minutes piece some pretty hilarious lyrics . while all songs great , ones i love best " model citizen " , " pain " , " clones " . saw " flush fashion " show ny palladium ' 81 , thought it great . overall feel sort like " west side story " tone " school out " lp bit " clockwork orange " twist . very stripped down comparison extravaganzas alice known , but not disappointment	1
i fan king over 15 years now ( wow , long time ) , i've fortunate seen them concert almost 30 times , i've met them hung out them ( after shows ) many times . i appreciation king band individuals - they all seem like great guys , especially jerry . i asked jerry 3 years ago solo album him , he said he working putting something together . i real excited when it finally released last year . i'm really happy jerry able get his music finished put out there fans . but same time , i'm little disappointed end result . music this album really , really good . assuming jerry wrote all/most music , he good sense melody transition within each song . some songs still growing me , but my favorites " no love " " all way home " . i really like acoustic base used most songs - acoustic guitars missing recent king albums . one thing i don't like in-your-face presence electric guitars . there isn't much sonic " real estate " subtle acoustic guitars bold electric guitars . thing bothers me bit lyrics . lyrical content doesn't bother me , fact , ty last solo album ' safety ' similar theme . but , times , lyrics make absolutely no sense . i'm guessing jerry using words almost instruments , lyrics there compliment whole song rather than tell story . my biggest complaint would production this cd . ty awesome guitarist , but i think he should leave production duties someone else ( thankfully , new king cd produced michael wagner ) . drums sound ok , but cymbals buried mix lack crispness sparkle . bass guitar almost non-existent mix , times , electric guitars sound muddy . i realize ty basically free resource jerry , but i can't help but think how much better this cd would sound some really good production . overall , i like this cd although my comments above may sound harsh , i'm audio engineer i critique these things every cd i buy . coincidentally , i don't buy many cd these days because i can't stand most music put out . jerry cd really good effort , it cd get lot rotation my cd changer	1
very good movie -- would preferred different ending , but that way it went	1
thank you , public enemy ! this ill compilation must-have any hardcore pe fan ! i love all remixes they , but other songs good too . best cuts remixes party your right fight , louder than bomb , you're gonna get yours . collection b-sides alone , this very impressive album . i recommend you buy this album great collection party jams , pe fan or not !	1

dualdisc not play mid high end players . while i could get dvd side mostly play , " cd " not work all . find out what problem i went onkyo web site . their players not support this format since " cd " side not actually cd ( accorning philips ) . so if you play this disc it ruins your player , player warrenty void since this disc not supported format . beware ! oh , what music i hear 5.1 side quite impressive	-1
straight up : dip set garbage . this album no exception , although comparison all albums they released , this one better ones . trufully , cam'ron very limited lyrical skills , it displays throughout this album . although during this time this album released , he just signed jay-z roc-a-fella records ( you saw how long lasted ) . also around this time , some dip set artists ( jim jones juelz santana ) starting surface . they themselves also weigh this album down . i like first single " oh boy " . also second single " hey ma " good also . album hugh highlight would " welcome new york " featuring jay-z , well thought ou t.t he album also many low points . lot these songs like " loosing weight 2 " shows how very limited cam'ron skills behind mic . memphis bleek beanie sigel absolutely nothing song " roc " . production good , like daz produced " leave me alone " , but cam couldn't pull it together . just blaze kanye west would also toss few beats this album also . " come home me " average best . it few good songs lot skip material . if you're used hearing cam albums , then you might want check this out few good tracks , or download it hear how it sounds like . this isn't one i could fully get into . lyrics : cproduction : b+guest appearances : c-musical vibes : coverall : cfavorite tracks : oh boy , welcome new york city , hey ma , peace everyone	1
appleseed cast went little bit more experimental this album , it turns out perfectly . they kept their amazing sound , yet altered it , matured it , complete mellow guitar riffs , intense hooks . only thing i didn't like this album even though it instrumental parts amazing , there extremely less emphasis vocals , one things drew me into band . overall , if you want something really enjoy road trip , or while you're your desk working , pick this up	1

damn ! peter keeps sinking deeper into underground this compilation reflects his new location . exception few tracks some fractured loops , hardly vocal sight , just hard , dirty , nasty tribal drums mixed jagged techy melody fragments electro synth washes bleeps . energy this one just builds , builds , keeps building . peter trademark sexy vibe ... this may peter best mix cd date ; some repeat listenings needed before it takes away title his essential mix . if you rauhofer or * 69 fan you've already ordered this . if not this convert you	1

let face it : none this stuff supposed make sense . when it released , it became icon drug-hazed reality . little scraps words images float out , intertwine intruigingly , then drift away again . what lessons we supposed take ? end life , we all children again , chasing down ice cream truck . but what we internalized more rote - phrases expressing life essential absurdity pointlessness . but timeless : " say , what chance returning deceased war verteran ... " true during viet nam - true now during iraq . well , think it over - then take off your shoes	1

all stars universe my rating this album bud . bud together monk probably tadd dameron , bebop piano . period . this album shooted bud top stairs bebop pantheon . i can't judge this album ... it masterpiece twenthieth century , how could you rate it simply " five stars " . we way over here . this album you'll find some bud wildest interpretations standard tunes some his wonderful compositions such celia or fruit . this something pointed out clearly , bud not only greatest bop pianist but fantastic composer too . he one few who equalled parker dameron bop lines writing . bouncing bud , dance infidels ( not presented here ) , hallucinations , tempus fuge it , celia , fruit many more form alltogether picture impressive composer unlimited fantasy creativity ( not mentioning monster chops bud piano ) . i suggest this album every jazz lover , but particular those so love new generation pianists ... all bill evans keith jarrett " alumni " scandinavia . come back root . bud man . strange fact . i version this album made sudamerican market which 20 tunes . there 7 more tunes after body soul , they taken different sessions i guess . those tunes : oblivion , dusk sandi , hallucinations , fruit , nightingale sang berkley square , just one those things , last time i saw paris . booklet doesn't say almost anything these tunes ( some them bud alone ) , but quality this music i judge myself .... stellar . jazz giant masterpiece , buy it don't esitate .	1
out amon tobin first three albums , it extremely tough pick best one . if i pressed , i would name this very close second " supermodified " just barely ahead " bricolage " . i'm talking two points separating three albums . said , " permutation " different beast than his debut album . released only year after " bricolage " , this album continues one veins , yet infused darker jazz sensibility create dense headrush leaves you breathless , eager start again . some amon best work this disc , " sordid " featured toyota commercial great effect . this album 70 minutes non-stop brilliant sample cut-ups melodies hidden underneath jerky drum-n-bass programming , trip takes you throughout endless permutations ( sorry ) sound space , ends " nova " , close perfect chill song any written . i cannot say enough good things this album	1
pretty good hard-core rap , includes usual self-aggrandizing macho posturing , but rhymes entertaining , music sophisticated . there nothing really special or unique here , everything atl number others , but they what they well , admirable . fans ice , ice cube pe should find much admire . `another execution ' excellent reggae influenced rap " menace society ' also quite good	1
if you never listened son volt , not buy this album ! son volt one those bands i listen very long time . i love their lyrics style playing combining folk , blues , rock music . however , this " retrospective " missing several key songs including " catching " , " cemetery savior " , " right through " , " question " , " blind hope " , " caryatid easy " , " live free . " i am not biggest son volt fan , but i least know these songs really define son volt stint music industry , not covers or mediocre acoustic performances . this album , like many other compilations , lousy attempt record company make little more money off band stagnant . son volt still kicks ass	1
37 i'm old enough remember all teddy solo work when it first released played local rb radio . my moms bought albums , 45s or 8 tracks we enjoyed music . now i'm older listened lots lots " performers " no real vocal talent , i've truly come appreciate genuine talent whose passion truly felt his music . that almost non-existent today . i like all songs . this good collection . however close follower teddy decades , if i building collection limited only one cd i would omitted following : " life song " , " more i get " , " shout scream " " we try " , instead included : " hold me " , " love power " , " it don't hurt now " " my latest , my greatest inspiration " . i think would ultimate , single cd teddy collection . overall this cd well worth money ; far disappointing . but i believe many long time teddy fans would make same substitutions i suggested	1
darn good album brilliant song quot ; apple my eyequot ; . pete ham beautiful voice fantastic sentiment leaving behind beatles label . there ever anyone like him since ? hopefully this reissue remastered . all material great . ham guitar end quot ; constitutionquot ; excellent . molland quot ; i love youquot ; favorite mine . too bad he turned out such dip , putting out atrociously produced not-really live lp , let's-make-a-quick-buck collection some demos his shoddy , his horribly embarrassing covers cd many badfinger classics take away people buying legitimate stuff . joey --- come back reality !! it not money --- granted this album isn't perfect , like quot ; straight up , quot ; but it my second favorite badfinger lp . thanks mike . turning me it	1
this album truly something else , even though i nothing but positive things say all madonna albums . although her albums always differ each other ( only similar thing them they all rock ) , this one takes whole new direction whole new way ( techno/electronica ) . best tracks album : drowned world/substitute love , ray light , skin , nothing really matters , frozen , power goodbye . sounds interesting lyrics , she new things her vocals .	1

stellar regions very cool collection studio outtakes later years coltrane life . playing great it wonderful hear his exploration so many new ideas . it marvel think how further developed these songs might become if coltrane lived longer . i'm glad this released public because it stands fascinating audio document one greatest musical minds world ever known . i'd recommend this experienced fans john coltrane , not those who just beginning their search through his vast back catalogue	1
i don't exactly consider myself ostrich my head sand , but somehow i never discovered joe . until six months ago . here i've sitting around all this time waiting ( then complaining ) new albums kenny wayne ., jonny lang , like , then here this guy who just blows all those guys out water sitting right front my nose ! amazon even kept recommending him me their great little " recommender " pops up when you get their website , but i've ignoring all like fool . then recently i heard dj announce song joe bonamassa , i knocked out ! coincidentally , i saw joe open up b.b. king week later , sold hook line sinker . i bought one his cd right there afterwards , him sign it , shook his hand told him he new fan . amusingly , during his performance he recommended audience buy any one his cds sold after his set , jokingly ( i hope ) adding , " ... well , maybe not second one . " well , i assure you it big joke , because this album great all way through . some hard rock , some acoustic stuff , amazing hendrix-style tune ( pain sorrow) -- all great stuff . definitely buy cd , but try find package bonus dvd if you . this guy incredible . he every guitar player i've into all rolled up into one , yet he his own man same time . this cd/dvd box set worth twice price . i thought dvd might one , maybe two songs like some those goofy dvd " singles " come extra cd . dude , dvd almost two hours long , music smokes ! sound isn't dts 5.1 , you'll turn up volume your stereo little higher than when playing dts or dolby 5.1 concert dvd , but sound still very good . this guy got it all -- amazing , shredding guitar chops , blues feel galore , great voice . don't stay dark like i past five years -- buy his whole catalog ! you won't regret it !!!!	1

i just couldn't stand this album . they sound like billion other bands except 100 times worse . i don't see why people would listen it . there so many other good christian bands out there . example my favorite band mxpx . supertones , five iron frenzy , calibretto 13 , craig brother , roper , even relient better . i , unfortunately , seen them live . they opened supertones . they not put good show . cd . it just no originality . it would much better if they something new , not something everyone heard billion times before . you should not buy this cd , i recomend buying any mxpx cds . they amazing .	-1

this very first ever cd release fabulous 1964 lincoln center cast recording rh king i . production starred ris� stevens ( going my way fame ) anna darren mcgavin king , frank porretta lun tha , lee venora tuptim , patricia neway ( original cast sound music ) lady thiang . all roles well sung ... ris� stevens offers slightly more " operatic " take anna than we're used various recorded versions film -- fabulous . darren mcgavin good king , but he no yul brynner , though different take role also good thing . patricia neway turns very moving performance " something wonderful . " this recording first time " small house uncle thomas " appeared records , this cd release restores " western people funny " which cut 1964 lp . lp cover art reproduced cd release . this album not essential one casual listener ; newcomers score probably want stick movie soundtrack or 1977 revival album yul brynner constance towers , but true fans show ( or anyone familiar album lp ) grateful rca/sony brought this recording back	1

i've owned this cd several years now , but never gave it serious listen until just other day . what i heard astounded me ! gary burton not only assembled some finest tango musicians argentina produce this cd him , he managed select playlist some what i consider piazzolla finest work : tanguedia , triunfal , soledad , revirado , decarisimo , concierto para quinteto , among others . many musicians long history working one piazzolla , so every note seems spring forth effortlessly . though one not often associate vibes tango , burton manages work them unobtrusively seem natural part musical flow . his vibes shine especially biyuya , caliente , tanguedia , concierto para quinteto . soledad , lead bandoneon skillfully replaced burton vibes . cd so good it often seems like piazzolla himself performing . love astor , burton ensemble offers more than hour spectacular music . if you love astor well , it behooves you add this cd your collection	1

i originally wrote looong @$$ review this cd because it so outstanding , but some strange reason it , several other reviews i wrote , not get posted -- so , i very brief point this review ... plush bomb-diggety -- if i may steal old mid-90s rb cliche ! cd itself goes beyond conventional chill-out reaches new level genre . indeed , plush gushes wonderfully everything 2-step ( steve austeen w/gillian o'donovan ) groovy-ambient-funk ( wonderbraa , alex cortiz , mum quantic ) acid jazz ( cadien hatler ) samba ( s-tone victor davies ) everything . there even killer , albeit more laid-back , remake prince " controversy " hefner actually ( my opinion ) sounds better than original ... i always said it takes real skill effrontery redo anything prince ! other chill-out albums should take notes plush trying create something new very mundane world chill-out/downtempo music ... after listening this set it obvious there more style music than drone beats hallucinogenic singers ... plush indeed set new standard chill-out -- if you even begin categorize it format . now , let hope this review gets posted this time !	1

jeez , i feel like it 70 again ; defending mccartney : anyone who doesn't get it : his solo work not beatles . he never seemed care much lyrics " meaning " , opposed john george , but focused great melody , harmony , catchy , if sometimes almost meaningless , lyrics . no one seemed mind when he it beatles ......... all amazing . this album may his best ; simple songs , simply recorded , heartfelt . his tunes lyrics deceptively simple ( junk , man we lonely ) but listen closely what he saying . he doesn't shove your face how he feels , unlike lennon " how you sleep " or even ringo " boogaloo " . this album first glimpse we all got into who what beatles , basic it , opens new door . still my top ten	1

this album elton john bernie taupin sixth album three years . during time elton explored variety sounds , trying find his sound . " madman across water " cusp quest would fully realized elton next album , " honky chateau . " while seeking his sound elton managed demonstrate incredible potential broadly manifested this album . first five songs particularly show wonderful range styles compositions ranging solid pop " tiny dancer " " levon " heavily orchestrated " madman across water " " indian sunset . " lyrics occasionally murky often misquoted . yet , there lot power piano backing arrangements incredible . still maturing voice elton new different time , appealed broad array audiences trying find stability after psychedelic turbulent 60s . one interesting feature some elton early music periodic influence gospel or soul music , most strongly seen this album " all nasties . " influence would not last much longer elton went down musically more cohesive path this point . over time elton played keyboards various types , but his recent album " songs west coast " he returned piano once again , recalling relative innocence this early music , though maturity talented , seasoned artist . i think it tribute power this early music elton returned it once again album released decades after this album . music this type incredible amount power appeals much emotion it ear . listen again artist made it big based power his music not over-polished commercial pop hyped many fm stations today . truly solid album any collection .	1

more i learn bob dylan musical background reading biographies his own chronicles vol . 1 well listening music he influenced , more i appreciate his eponymous debut album . it energetic collection somewhat dark folk traditional covers ( much like many folksingers early 60 greenwich village scene ) couple his fledgling originals . all all it great debut -- he sings songs plays harmonica really energetically , somewhat more forced wheezy accent than he usually sang , originals two best songs album , showing spark creativity he would later fan into prolific blaze . album collection folk songs dylan singing clubs coffeehouses around new york , it both reflects his sponge-like absorption influences well his proclivity borrow his contemporaries . few songs copped arrangements his friend mentor , dave van ronk , like " fixin ' die " " house rising son . " fact , when van ronk heard album , he exclaimed , " bobby lifted my arrangement ! dylan got his just desserts , however , when animals made rock hit out his arrangement " rising sun . " other songs culled anthology american folk music , ( one most important folk collections dylan listened ) like album closer " see my grave kept clean . " album two originals , " talkin ' new york " " song woody , " both pay homage woody guthrie different ways . first humorous but very true life story dylan early days new york , which he jokingly mispronounces " greenwich " rolls off casual talking blues style his idol , guthrie . second less borrowing guthrie music , but tribute . dylan addresses his observations state world woody , who big hand helping young singer start frame his worldview . it touching original great prelude classic original dylan tunes come . overall , it strong but not phenomenal album -- world would later find out , dylan true magic songwriting , though his interpretive folk enjoyable true spirit songs , it nowhere near transcendent his greatest work soon come . listen hear his roots folksinger , anticipate magic come	1
i just found out couple days ago new caliban album coming out , i immediately couldn't wait get my hands it ( upon it release , soon store opened i got my copy ! ) anyway , this pretty good album like last , except it very straight forward this time around . it doesn't sound technical , but it still heavy sound you would expect band . only reason why i'm not giving it 5 stars because i hear way too many similarities trivium brilliant album released last year ' ascendancy ' i lay dying awesome ' shadows security . ' it sucks there too many hardcore bands metal scene today , because same sounds often repeated it doesn't help make great bands like i mentioned earlier including caliban stand out too much . but anyway , this album still worth it if you love hardcore	1
it sounds weird , doesn't it , because everybody these days makes lame assumptions all melodeath bands hail sweden , denmark , poland , etc . well , if you thought true , you're dead wrong . hailing state virginia comes two masterminds compose technical melodic death metal group arsis . james malone ( guitarist/songwriter ) michael van dyne ( drums ) execute their talent well this cd . even though they may perform live 4-piece , two founding members real talent behind arsis . now , cd . this cd make you s**t your pants first time you listen it . guitars sound like they digital effect them , bringing out their technicality . drumming fast f**k . this cd appeal fans later carcass , arch enemy , gates . this could easily outrival " slaughter soul " gates greatest true melodeath cd invented . if you fan technical death , melodeath , or just plain metal , you need this .	1

there bumper crop strong discs multitude very talented international tenors this past year - juan diego florez , roberto alagna , marcello alvarez , ramon vargas joseph calleja most prominent . right up there among this select brethren this debut recording mexican tenor rolando villaz�n . deep , fulsome sound his voice , he brings sharp emotive power his performance without overdoing it some others pool pagliacci tears . fact , villaz�n true lyric tenor genuine understanding pianissimo . it near-flawless voice seems ideal lovers would-be lovers mainstays italian opera . verdi , puccini donizetti standard fare such robust voice , respect , program somewhat predictable . truth told , i could without " la donna � mobile " verdi " rigoletto " , which most overplayed italian song this side " o sole mio " . same time , he provides some nice surprises beginning first track , stunning aria cilea " l'arlesiana " , " la solita storia " , where his vocal control exemplary . coincidentally , calleja performs same song his similarly programmed " tenor arias " ; both versions distinctive memorable . regardless , even old warhorses performed ad infinitum likes pavarotti domingo , villaz�n brings dramatic clarity , lyrical command purity tone familiar numbers such carlo act i aria , " io l'ho perduta ... lo la vidi " verdi " don carlo " ; marcello act iv recitativo , " il duca d'alba inosservato ... angelo casto bel " donizetti " il duca d'alba " ; rodolfo act i aria , " che gelida manina " puccini " la boheme " . what comes across consistently virile , full-bodied voice , almost baritone weight quality , makes slightest quiver his phrasing very effective shading his performances . example , if you compare villaz�n version calleja donizetti concluding aria , " tombe degli avi miel ... fra poco " " lucia di lammermoor " , villaz�n delivers more emotionally naked rendition reveals edgar heroic lover , whereas calleja sings more cautious haunted vulnerability makes his edgar more sensitive soul . neither right or wrong , just different . villaz�n rounds out his program early 20th-century so-called " belto " selections puccini mascagni balance bel canto standards . throughout this impressive debut , he ably accompanied masterful musical direction marcello viatti leading m�nchner rundfunkorchester . i still think jury out far his designation " fourth tenor " ( he only 32 ) , but given what he accomplished here , i certainly think villaz�n considered true contender	1

i got tuned into goldie 1997 while watching much music artist biography . i bought saturns return next day got hooked . timeless my opinion very good cd while some people may give it less thans tellar review , i think they should concider their tastes closely before buying amp ; cd . he builds this cd very well each track something different give . inner city life its jazz influences but all good songs stem or get their inspiration other artists or froms music . i every independent piece work he he hasnt dissapointed me yet	1
i followed enigma project long time , haven't found myself disappointed single release thus far . ( , considering i am reviewing older album . ) ' cross changes , ' second chapter enigma project , offers philosophical insight into micheal cr�tu personal beliefs , form ' enigmatic ' symphony soft composition chanson . while each album seems hold it own unique interpretation life , i believe purpose this album inspire love , peace wholeness within its listeners . lyrical value ' cross changes ' seems surpass its instrumental quality , which , times , rather poor comparison some micheal other works . however , lyrics reassuring inspiring , none-the-less , make entire experience worthwhile . buyers who curious enigma probably shouldn't start this album , it seems one those things you appreciate only after hearing some latter releases . ( my case , least . ) first album i purchased ' love , sensuality , devotion ' ( greatest hits album ) -- good start , considering you get fair idea what enigma all . way , i am curious track number 2 -- everytime i listen it , i faintly hear sandra chanting " open your heart , push limits ... " background , though it could just my imagination . it strange i mention , because ' push limits ' released after this album	1
representative fine mix traditional irish music chieftains perform , this concert gives fan chieftains nice sampling what they're good occasional error judgement accompanies live performance . highlights include fine opening medley gives band chance show how well they play together , matt malloy outstanding flute solo " mason apron , " still stuns me every time i listen it , closing medley allows each member shine . but guest stars don't really work me , nanci griffith doesn't bad job but adds nothing special concert roger daltrey sounds out his element " raglan road , " while " behind blue eyes " interesting worked through chieftains sound it just doesn't fit here . i am sure " stone " ( special dance when two lovers meet ) fine when you see it , it loses bit cd . but these not major problems sound solid concert performance . this fan , it pretty good time	1

while neil written recorded wealth outstanding material throughout his career , his albums tended bit uneven . perhaps that why there so many neil diamond compilation albums shelf these days . this collection culls best selections his late 60s early 70s uni/mca albums . fact , this set essentially expanded version now out-of-print his 12 greatest hits . while album supplanted studio versions sweet caroline holly holy strong live versions hot august night , this collection restores original studio recordings . hot august night , neil last mca album before leaving columbia , represented stellar live version cherry , cherry . but good version , i would dropped it ( cover he ain't heavy , he my brother ) cold water morning , glory road two-bit manchild . that minor quibble though , this set contain all essential recordings period breathtakingly pristine sound quality . several reviewers complained lack certain songs ( heartlight , kentucky woman , thank lord night time , etc . ) . record , this compilation neil best work his uni/mca recording era ( 1968-1972 ) . early singles ( thank lord night time , kentucky woman , solitary man original studio version cherry , cherry ) recorded bang records 1966 1967 . best collection early bang records material classics : early years . america love rocks recorded capitol while most later era songs like september morn , if you know what i mean heartlight recorded columbia ( beginning jonathan livingston seagull album 1973 ) . best single-disc collection neil columbia material probably 12 greatest hits , volume ii . fans interested purchasing career spanning retrsopective may tempted buy greatest hits 1966-1992 or essential neil diamond but both those compilations suffer inclusion inferior live versions place original studio recordings . career spanning box set , my lifetime , largely avoids live version replacement issue plagues other compilations but it suffers its own share problems , namely abundance mildly interesting ( but ultimately unnecessary ) rarities . most efficient method compiling your own triple disc , career spanning box set purchase these three titles : classics - early years [ neil bang records recordings 1966-1967 ] , neil diamond collection [ uni/mca sampler reviewed above ] , 12 greatest hits volume ii [ best capitol columbia years ] .	1

quot ; portrait sonny crissquot ; mixed album underrated alto sax wizard . while slower numbers quot ; clear day , quot ; god bless childquot ; quot ; smilequot ; magical numbers , remainder album not quite hold up . first tune quot ; million or more timesquot ; not very creative , basically sounds like 60s tv show theme song ( we say quot ; hoping cut hit singlequot ;) . jazz standard quot ; weequot ; quot ; blues closetquot ; swinging but this 1967 , not 1957 , band walter davis , paul chambers ( especially ) alan dawson , i expected it more experimental . instead , quartet seems more home slower tempo ballads . all , quot ; portrait sonny crissquot ; deserves 3 1/2 stars , but since i can't i rounded it up . if you want get better portrait sonny , check out newly released quot ; complete imperial sessionsquot ; blue note	1

sherrie austin artist neglected airplay country radio . songs should #1 hits simply buried heap cds other artists who made it limelight mediocre music excess record label support . this album gems public should heard more , never , singles like quot ; lucky lovequot ; quot ; put your heart into it . quot ; my personal favorite , however , never even released onto country radio , probably since it leans more toward alternative music , song called quot ; tenderly . quot ; sherrie sing it all , she penned 7 10 cuts album . quot ; wordsquot ; excellent title this very lyric well-written masterpiece	1

this , hands down , best creation siccmade ever released . granted , i haven't heard many releases siccmade clique even dislike few rappers label . i've heard quite bit , though , including but not limited sicx two albums , debut dead 4 life course this kut . i got soundtrack movie now eat project(also featuring sicx , but only movie . yes , this sucks . even though now eat advertises sicx featured ) i've heard many brotha lynch x-raided records(lynch , sicx original swartzaniggas ) . anyway , all kutz siccmade i've heard , my opinion this best them(although i'm sure most would argue ' seasons da siccness ' ) . sicx started out rough , cheap production black market , cedrick singleton released ' dead 4 life ' , which its own time would cult classic . due black market drama(as usual ) , album not released immediately after recording sat quite few years . around time album recorded(early 90 ) many other classics came effect , including x psycho active brotha lynch ep 24 deep seasons . comparing this album other hardcore releases set sicx far normal . course , most siccmade artists definitely far norm . sicx got reputation credibility horror stories he rapped no one doubted him second . fast forward february 1999 . siccmade finally got their start buisness , working acts such loki(a so-so white rapper sacramento ) , brotha lynch woman zagg , his brothers sicx tall cann . siccmade released sicx second effort , if these walls could talk . production brotha lynch hung , art battle sicx , handful fingatips , beats impeccable addicting . every single beat album smashes . its not too different normal formula lynch uses , but yet it stands its own when compared other albums production(definitely better then dead 4 life , far ) . sicx got bust beats he actually feeling instrumentals unique their own way . slow beats ' one(featuring loki d-dubb)'and killing fields'(originally meant ' head drama ' mixtape ) pounding bass ' not cho average ' , all songs album perfectly mold together(aside killing fields ) . lyrically , this album harder then anything loki , zagg , cos , or anybody could even dream writing . i would say sure brotha lynch sicx illest lyrics you'll hear out sacramento . sicx paints dark pictures , covering topics sherm-smoking 40-swiggin ' raping woman front her children . most people don't understand sicx because he his music truly sick core . thats exactly why i love it . its not specific one style , either . its got gangsta , hardcore , horror , shock value . my favorite track ' razors alcohol ' featuring t-t he-time siccmade roster , also known correctly swartzaniggas . this track features cos , tall cann , sicx , fignaytion production brotha lynch hung . lyrics what caught me , after turning subwoofers , it over . you'll hear it understand . crank up bass volume , crack open 40 rap . fignaytion sicx owned track , although cos tall cann g first verse almost comparable . fignaytion my favorite rappers sicc , although he no longer swartzaniggas . fignaytion also makes appearance ' basket case ' , my second favorite track . song begins fig mic , ' tombstones my mind ' , fig spits hard verse . his voice more unique than other artists sicc . he blends well tracks hes sicx . i would loved hear album them , although thats out question . hell , i would love hear album sicx . who knows when this , sicx currently incarcerated undetermined amount time . sicx stay up keep representing like real gang-banger he . confusing tid-bit , back cover , bottom mauroon-colored letters , lists ' blood drop ' outro but nowhere heard . sicx doesn't " talk " " talk " like almost every rapper out there right now . which why hes out jail since he young man record psychotic behavior . buy this album , its definitely worth it . i even bought two gave one homie . support sicx . this latest release sicx but hopefully not last . check ' dead 4 life ' if you like this album . i own both , they're excellent . i bump it daily , tweed session isn't complete without kick-back tracks ' marination(featuring d-dubb )' or ' unholy ' background . free sicx . 66 point 6 yo fm dial	1
stone roses ' " turns into stone " includes alternative take " elephant stone " ( interesting , but not good one band monumental debut ) , full version " fool gold " ( same one heard version debut commonly available ) , b-sides , songs written before after their first album . except " simone " ( one their trademark backwards songs ) , all this available " complete stone roses " ( together more alternative takes ) , though , pointed out previous reviews , some songs truncated " complete " order fit 21 songs . so , question day whether it worth it get " turns into stone . " before we answer query , i want talk album itself . it some these early tracks we hear band biggest influences . one hand , there no question they borrowed some more poppy , dare i say bubblegum bands mid-sixties , such herman hermits gerry pacemakers . other hand , one clearly hears influence mid-sixties psychedelia such byrds jefferson airplane . course , roses ' first album expanded these sounds gave birth late 80s brit-pop movement ( i.e blur , oasis , happy mondays ) , great influence ( together my bloody valentine ) over " shoegazer " sound ( i.e. catherine wheel , ride , slowdive ) . i really like all herman hermits type songs , especially " mersey paradise " ( which i wish spot first album , together " sally cinnamon " ) . " something burning " reminds me alot mellower version " fool gold , " whereas "" one love " comes dangerously close self-parody . answer question posed above it depends how big stone roses fan you . die-hard fans , listening shortened version " one love " " something burning , " seems inadequate almost cruel rocking instrumental part songs , basically showcasing john squire ( perhaps reni too ) , edited out . rest , " complete stone roses " supplies enough supplement roses ' two primary studio recordings , making this album somewhat superfluous	1
this godfather his zenith . time this project , he already established himself kingpin funk/soul family . composing soundtrack not like doing album all your own material . he proved why he considered american musical giant ; usual , he dead serious all his arrangements , covering all subgenres rb . ultra funky " make it good yourself " , down-home sound " dirty harry " , hauntingly melodic , " mama dead " . this shows james brown 360 degree perspective . you see sides his songwriting you may not see any his other recordings . just alone , it worth getting if you consider yourself interested his work . it defintely milestone his illustrious musical portfolio	1

i great fortune growing up vicinty " lighthouse " hermosa beach , california , which one time oldest jazz club west coast , now indie music cafe some sort . age 13 or so i remember standing outside club sidewalk listening tremendous music made inside . howard rumsey gracious enough leave top half dutch door open sound clear good . i saw mjq , cal tjader , charlie byrd , mingus , lionel hampton , many others . unfortunately , i never saw miles davis . i imagine if he brought " second quintet " hermosa 1965 this recording would exactly what i would heard out there street . sound surf smell salt spray imagined , but essence intimate jazz club recording captured perfectly this outstanding box set . it expensive , so buy it friends burn copies so you all get some	1

i believe only reason this album not liked more than hes previous effort purely due it hes next release . album more 1990-sick part 2 than knew inovative effort i think alot fans expect much there rappers create knew ideas beats instead just cranking bass feeling beats bouncing ride . black bossalini this better than sick although both albums simply impressive . spice 1 one games best flowing mcs pretty much only his trade mark annoyingly boring blow call takes prestige off hes name . however he given deep riding beats again this album work it comes off much enjoyable way . opening 2 tracks great openers especially im high . its great song listen way . ant banks steals show fetty chico mack typical deep funk groove master producer recognize game up there one best well . ballin fun track diamonds one best softer produced tracks i heard any artist . hook extremely catchy . this spice 1s best my opinion . it makes me wonder how he could drop so low hes follow up this immortalized . its not even worth rating	1

i heard this cd ( 25 romantic classics ) . main problem 25 tracks most them not pure romantic music . air string could not classified quot ; romanticquot ; because general theme closer tragic than romantic . same thing goes vivaldi allegro . performance mozart piano concerto made poor " israel chamber orchestra " weak , i am still wondering putting this performance cd although there dozens great performances mozrat piano concertos . performance beethoven fur elise quite poor . it went faster than usual , addition extreme use sustaining pedal . i believe any amateur could perform it better than soloist here . i wonder why chopin prelude no . 7 such cd , its quite out any conceivable thematic context addition short . preludes such no . 6 ( tolling bells ) no . 15 ( raindrops ) could much better such cd romantic music . add , pianist didn't use tempo rubato playing this piece . so semi-romantic piece totally destroyed . rest tracks too humble serious critic . i don't believe this cd makes any addition any classical collection	1
few records justifiably claim " groundbreaking " , but here one - mesmerising example two highly creative musicians peak their powers pushing their ideas out edge . using infectious poly-rhythms jerky , high tension riffs vocals permeated their brilliantly successful collaboration talking heads ' " remain light " their starting point , they mix-in ingenious looped samples insidious guitar , synthesizer percussion back-beats produce something completely unique . not only like nothing else around time but , like all truly great albums , one hasn't aged time . often sounding more like inventive slice modern " electronica/dance " it almost impossible believe it produced over twenty years ago ... , course , great deal what followed since traced back this amazing record . darker far more " left-field " than " remain light " , " my life bush ghosts " no easy listen , but repeat playing it becomes equally addictive ... worthy successor wholly successful exploration just how far brian eno david byrne complex fusions electronica rock could taken . file under " essential , timeless under-rated slice musical genius " .	1
anyone who ever denied love child ... lonely children , wounded children , violated children , sorrowful children , discarded children ... too intelligent insightful considered quot ; pop , quot ; this album belongs psychology books healing childhood abuse , not cool 80s dance music . if there category healing , literary concept albums , this would top 10 . sometimes just hearing your feelings expressed , knowing you're not alone dark , all therapy you need . give this one someone still hurting	1

least abrasive , altogether , most listenable form heavy metal 80s empire know pop-metal . groups , mostly california england , began forsaking heavy riffs flashy solos favor melodic pop songs clean , shiny production . def leppard definitive group play this kind rock . sexy , photo ready boys long curly hair , they took metal world , charts , storm . band originaly part " new wave british heavy metal " where british bands played metal faster more libido than ever before . soon , however , they cleaned up their work they helped start pop-metal scene dominated charts during 80s . production their hit album " pyromania " very smooth clean all rough edges most rawness removed . it opens anthemic rocker " rock rock til you drop " which sounds like ac/dc playing it safe . many track such emotional power ballad " photograph " show band feels quite vulnerable times constantly trying make very serious statements . most , if not all songs , make use pop hooks harmonic choruses though there occasional riff or guitar solo . mtv ( back before it turned evil ) major player band success . videos aided band hits they became network usual darlings . though their music essentially pop/rock , it hardest most abrasive form pop/rock ever played . pop-metal created almost sub-culture which all teens wanted grow their hair out put ratt warrent posters their walls . pop hair-metal eventually die off , particularly when nirvana nevermind came out , but records still sold day more more people becoming fans . though it may not challenging loud other metals , pop-metal bands , like def leppard , offer great way listen something easy see what 80s metal movement all . pyromania may place start .	1

firehouse zone this time . no doubt it . songwriting superb this easily their best release quot ; good acousticsquot ; coming close second . melodies smooth lyrics better than usual . quot ; day week weatherquot ; got best firehouse song ever . quot ; acid rainquot ; quot ; if it changesquot ; also dynamite . so good songwriting this time around , you almost forgive them previous childish lyrics like quot ; rock radio/turn it up ' til your speakers blow ! quot ; hey , let fair , they've matured lot these songs aren't disposable their early hits like quot;don't treat me badquot ; . lot groups 80 unmercifully dumped some fairly some unfairly . firehouse lasted because they grown into something more than product it time , they actually make real music . if you compare them pretentious acts like trixter , mr. big , lillian axe , you see why they out-lasted their competetion . some not familiar this genre often compare bands like firehouse bon jovi which not fair comparison . bon jovi while musically competent , doesn't songwriting talent firehouse . it shame their bass player quit after this album because i think he brought lot band sound . his absence sorely apparent their follow-up cd quot ; o2quot ; . summarize , if you recently discovering or re-discovering firehouse you'll pleasantly surprised . they come long way i hope they continue make real music	1

music makes cd worth getting ; however , so-called special features ( i.e. , worthless advertising ) ruin your ability enjoy music computer system . example , my computer cd/dvd player , buggy software part disc makes music unplayable . different drive ( cd/rw ) , music portion disc played ; however , times their annoying macromedia advertising interface pop up , sometimes multiple simultaneous copies , stopping music . if you kill advertising " stubs , " you left side effect annoying beep whenever you move mouse pointer over web link . please put more tracks music cds -- complete score songs -- but leave off bogus " special " features ! (and matter , i don't appreciate cutesy attempt other cds " hide " extra music tracks putting minutes silence before final tracks . this especially bad multi-disc players where you don't want long periods silence -- least not until all discs played .	1

first off , best my knowledge there no commerically released cast recording black rider . music this album arranged differently than stage show , all main vocals tom waits . said , this easily tom waits most underappreciated album . first listen , it intimidating ; even die-hard fans real gone may trouble getting through tracks like " oily night " . lyrics , let face it , terrifying , if you're not expecting it , it rather jarring . thing album once you hear it , you just hear it again . it crawls into your head just won't get out . it easy see why black rider cult following . it seductive entrancing , it just won't let you go	1
first off , those you wish deftones still sounded like they back adrenaline around fur , go home ya nu-metal lover ! nu-metal , over finished anyone who tries bring it back deserves worse than savage disco record burning day . deftones one lucky bands era actually style something more than just 6 power chords , dread locks angry lyrics . fact , they really only band survived genre music . disturbed may still around , but thats mostly because we still angry rich white kids rebelling against their parents . disturbed message old . deftones message would too , they not evolved like everything else life . if you look all their albums whole , you see they evolved each release , way true artists . sure , you still feel anger tension saturday night wrist , but its evolved ! gone rap metal days , grinding heavy metal adrenaline around fur fame . enter atmospheric more ... alternative ! yes , deftones seemed step into whole new avenue music , blending atmospheric , electronic sounds alternative music , some metal trip hop . well , like you couldn't see coming , they edging their way more mellow style years . i personally feel saturday night wrist one their best records , though i am huge fan their last album , self titled deftones . i thought it portrayed awesome emotion , vast landscape post apocalyptica well rounded record really more collective sound group than any its individual parts . sadly , many not feel same , including band themselves . well , it one sided songwriting session , i see why . saturday night wrist , each member contributed equally , despite their interal battles , able craft amazing album great many memorable songs . songs like " beware ... " , " cherry waves " , " combat " , " kimdracula " , " hole earth " song named after very famous nintendo cheat code my favorite songs , me most accesible . song named after nintento cheat code awesome instrumental , likes which we never heard deftones before . it very emotional creepy must hear ! every track this album great quality it , each very enjoyable , least me . i waitied long time serving deftones , this worth every minute . music , it witstand test time . time weeds out fads true musicians . deftones aged well time , proving they no one trick pony , certainly not just angst ridden children suburbia	1
ambient , etheric , melodic sound . she voice angel . great if you love sarah mclachlan .	1
almost good ... i hope you dance , course same artist . not really super country music fan , still i am music/artist fan . although sara brightman may more range possibly more beautiful voice than lee ann , patty loveless or jamie o'neal , these three female country artists so very good it impossible avoid listening them pour their hearts into their music . alison krauss my all time favorite female country artist , course lee ann very much blend alison , patty dolly . certainly , nothing wrong sounding similar three very best female vocalist last five decades ! wonderful country cd lee ann womack wonderful vocalist	1
britney spears debut disc ... baby one more time one best bubble gum , senseless , fun albums ever this arrogant , ungrateful pop princess . forget what she looks sounds like now , her debut she cool , surprisely good singer , most catchiest songs ever . standout tracks include : born make you happy , sometimes , bottom my broken heart , thinkin ' you , e-mail my heart , course damn ... baby one more time . song soda pop she sounds belts like christina aguilera , who knew ? ok songwriting so childish but hey this popular back then so don't blame me guys ! britney real potential back then , too bad all cigarette smoking , late night partying destructive behavior shot her voice hell . oh well least we remember how " normal virginal " she oh so long ago . enjoy	1
this one first rock amp ; roll records i ever heard . my brother bought it when it first came out he played it death . his record so many scratches , hisses amp ; pops it , i decided i needed my own . this classic album . i wasn't looking this quot ; high hogquot ; disc , but when i accidently stumbled apon it cd shop recently - i buy it . what throw-back this - good old times when nothing mattered ... no bills pay , no job worry ... just school your friends . now almost 30 years later , i listen this disc it still sounds great . jim dandy one million singer unique set lungs . other band member i remember drummer tommy aldridge - who went other classic rock bands like whitesnake , ozzy pat travers . boa could rock best them . i feel they highly underrated band . they their best their hard rockers , but every once awhile they'd come up slow ballad would just knock you back few rows . classic songs here : quot ; swimming quicksandquot ; , quot ; why shouldn't i smilequot ; , quot ; moonshine sonataquot ; , quot ; jim dandyquot ; . great album cover too ... who knows , jim dandy very well could precurser david lee roth . attitude , hair , open chested shirts stylings all there him amp ; boa	1

this followup never ever amazing . these guys aren't just underdog go distance big boys ; they're ones come so good , you wonder why you've never heard them before . when you're talking more publicized chicago-area alternative bands , here shocker : kill hannah doesn't just compete bands like fall out boy ; my opinion ( well growing number fans ) , they beat them . regardless whether you agree or disagree above statement , i hope you least give these guys shot purchasing this cd . you won't regret it	1
grainger one group british composers turn century who fascinated oral tradition folk songs which starting disappear earth . holst , vaughan-williams , delius , butterworth , all wrote distillations this wonderful music . grainger even recorded it . this recording few oddities it . perhaps fennell could said not quot ; touch his feminine sidequot ; , so slower , lyrical pieces may not his forte , but some cases they hypnotic quality . county derry certainly sentiment . his performances marked exhilarating virility , he strong passion which maybe chance show itself better wind ensemble recordings , but this one still fennell energy love . also , he may considered symphony orchestra wind ensemble surrounded strings , but i forgive him it because he so lovingly quot ; dished upquot ; * fine collection grainger us , anyway , grainger may shared view well . grainger didn't give us lot time see feel places perceptions any his short pieces , but if you catch them , they certainly there , fennell i think caught them knew them well . molly shore these brief , mystical moments . grainger so worth pursuing , this recording must , so other fennell/grainger recordings . i really don't think anyone sensed poignant beauties grainger little jewels well fennell . * favorite grainger phrase , e.g. , quot ; molly shore , dished up pianoquot	1

glenn hughes truly one greatest musicians / singer/songwriters alive this album shows yet again dimension his abilities write great music always surprises listener . i must say however much i love all glenns work this album certainly self-indulgent ie : it really album glenn dedicated glenn hughes fan . it not " mainstream " want better word , some his more recent releases . label it states " career defining album " . this mean critics think this his best work date ? this marketing cliche shouldn't apply glenn because everything he just so good - yes this album different but so return crystal karma . problem glenn he such prolific songwriter his style / moods change album album it hard choose favourite .	1

this one most unbelievable live jazz recordings i ever heard . i dealing passing michael january 2007 wanted something i not my collection . it would worth buying if just amazing rhythm section playing featured german big band . when you add solos contributions michael randy , it becomes legendary jazz recording featuring two best ever . i would recommend this any fan jazz , funk , big bands . it truly landmark , ( sadly last ) , recording brecker bros .	1
i give this album 4.75 stars , unfortunately that not choice , while i realize 5 would most likely suffice , if i you wouldn't care look into why it not 5 star attempt keller . first off , i'm assuming 5 stars would keller live , . . . you just see him live fully get his divine energy . i understand this too commonly thrown cliche ' majority " jam bands , " but while i cannot speak all , after going only 2 keller shows , he far best live performer my book . his shows intimacy down home good feeling them watch him just groove laugh his way through set barefoot like watching your little brother finally rid himself those training wheels fly down street screaming " i'm doing it ! " this album great . i listen it each my 4hr trips my mom , dancing singing whole way down , but i can't stress fact you must , i repeat must see him live . i also own his studio albums laugh home , while home great songs " above thunder " " you what you eat , " nothing outweigh reminicing i find myself when i put " freeker speaker " all other top notch songs , including immaculate intsramentals like " mental instra " so if you can't find ticket his next show , yourself favor buy this album , kick off your shoes , dance like mad-man your indian ru	1
this cd may hard find now ; if so , consider just buying dvd setting your player hear music tracks , uniquely interspersed randy newman commentary . it fascinating . you may know randy newman family steeped music , expecialy film composition . his father lionel newman . he written many popular songs , but his music movies probably last longest . his music pleasantville best he ever . opening " pleasantville suite " better expresses unrealized yearning than anything i've ever heard . newman already worked style aaron copland many his film scores , perhaps most memorably " natural , " but tilt he puts this style pleasantville fascinating . following film demeanor , he work patronizing " americana , " into playing , finally into complete involvement order support deepened understanding characters grow into . pleasantville story trapped people happy not knowing they're trapped , becoming desperately unhappy knowledge , finally living out unknown future . newman music suits perfectly . he already recognized his gift film score ; this work seals reputation	1
schulze first ever solo recording ( 1972)strangely , uses no real synthesizers all ( quite feat someone known premiere synth player electronic music last 30+ years ) , but rather features klaus organ various electronic devises ( sound effects might more appropriate here ) electronically enhanced real string orchestral section . very difficult , music suggests slightly eerie , barren winter landscape , more attentive listener , quite treat . this music not schulze fans his later rhythmically charged drum machine rock music , but listeners avante-guarde music , stockhausen cages world , this really masterpiece . too bad schulze didn't more this before moving into more progressive rock arena .	1

i agree kenny , kittie " spit " insipid pile horse manure . like most other bands this genre , this cd devoid almost any thoughts creativity or ingenuity , not mention vacuum left due lack talent featured . all lyrics hallmark proverbially angst type common these bands . why you girls so angry ? you signed record deal major label ! shoot , you're lives must really suck . they any idea how many bands ( actual talent ) would anything get signed major record label ? obviously this band manufactured catch nu-metal craze only they used four faux goth girls who could barely play their respective instruments . these girls try play boys but they just can't make cut . oooh , power chords over simple drumbeats inaudible bass topped off crummy preteen lyrics sung woman sounds like hissing cat . gee , count me out . not recommended unless you slit my wrist cry my heart out crowd whose suburbia lifestyle must really suck . cry me river . i guess this band could so angry because they know how bad they but i doubt it ..	-1

this one 3 albums fogelberg i'd consider masterpiece , or nearly so ( other two " nether lands " " home free " ) . i'll agree those here who note " someone telling you stories " relatively weak , although backing chorus members " eagles " keep even song throwaway . overall this highly enjoyable acoustic/country/rock/pop - similar some ways eagles , but dan expressive voice , lyrics , melodies actually make it better than most eagles ' work . production joe walsh terrific , there just touch " hotel california " slide-guitar sound , without overly . walsh mainly lets fogelberg other musicians ( who also outstanding ) shine very natural , real sense ; this not all overly layered or gimmicked-up . my favorite track here " raven flies " , " morning sky " standout , but all songs strong ( save above-mentioned " someone ... " ) , fit very well together . getting back what i easily consider dan best 3 albums , " souvenirs " what i'd consider his signature sound , it certainly one his best ever . other hand , " nether lands " no weak tracks , flows well , loaded incredible lyrics music - if decide only one , i suppose it would my top choice very close race . but " nether lands " different sound than typical fogelberg album - quite bit lush orchestration wonderful instrumentation departs standard " country/folk/pop " sound i associate fogelberg . " souvenirs " more live folk/pop concert sound vs . lushly beautiful orchestration " nether lands " . dan first album " home free " very spare intense ; sounds almost if he playing all instruments himself . " home free " little spotty ( many tracks soar his very best - especially opening song , others slightly weak ) but also not missed . " souvenirs " though me most representative df very best work ; it " must " even casual fans .	1
except appearance quot ; indiana wants mequot ; several compilation albums , motown not issued any . dean taylor music rare earth subsidiary back early 70s . this cd first collection any kind taylor comes universal spectrum label u.k. although taylor few minor hits besides his signature quot ; indiana ... quot ; deserving some sort collection cd , maybe motown knew something here . this collecton mish-mash tracks - few second-rate sound-alikes quot ; indiana ... quot ; , few classically motownesque songs , few attempts covers others ' hits would better left studio few compositions just don't gel . taylor accomplished songwriter several big hits - quot ; love childquot ; , quot ; all i needquot ; , et al - other motown superstars but beyond quasi-novelty quot ; indiana ... quot ; , taylor not really succeed performer . his voice no real distinction nor appeal stylistically he not dovetail any other material he attempted . singer , he something burt bacharach , perhaps . collector standpoint , within 19 tracks included , this cd gather up all his top-100 charted sides although it bit challenging listen this number unsuccessful other cuts . sound quality mostly ok most tracks stereo excepting 10 , 12 , 14-16 , 18 , 19 . however , track 16 , originally album , must come poor source it sounds fairly bad here . six-page flopover liner notes booklet track details single-page musical history taylor . this fills void motown reissue realm but unless you're collector or devoted fan his stuff , little recommend here	1
here i sit this saturday morning cd " little night music " playing living room , i found it almost impossible focus anything but this rapturous music . once again i'm swept away genius sondheim - music lyrics far better than anything else ever heard broadway , this score particular one his finest achievements includes : " glamorous life , " " you must meet my wife " ( " ... let me get my hat my knife " ) , " every day little death , " " weekend country , " " miller son " " send clowns . " len cariou , glynis johns , hermione gingold , patricia elliott cast couldn't better . this recording won grammy award , score much deserved tony award . this should every musical theatre lovers collection . " little night music " gets my vote musical most deserves re-filmed . no disrespect hal prince , but elizabeth taylor film wasn't all it should ( julie andrews would perfect role desiree armfeldt ) . hollywood making musicals again - perhaps there hope . if glenn close revive this piece broadway ( rumored ) i hope they tape it they " sweeney todd , " " passion , " " sunday park george " " into woods .
