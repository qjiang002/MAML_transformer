michael moriarity my hero ! he just one coolest actors my opinion . he such great b-movies this , , it alive 3 : island alive . how awesome he ?? anyways , i think this movie hilarious ! i think lot people take this movie too seriously , thinking it going your typical movie . but you shouldn't because not only this b-movie , but it supposed funny . my favorite part when " stuff " started bubbeling out ground old hick guy just starts eating it . who would ?? i just started laughing butt off when happened . so if you watch this movie , just sit back enjoy it what it worth , don't too critical it . what i learned stuff : dairy products evil ! especially if they come earth ! if you like stuff , i recommend : watching other b-movies , such island alive 3 , zombi 3 4 , etc	-1
it time someone make strong pitch hollywood new version " fahrenehit 451 " . although i appreciate what truffault trying accomplish back sixties , movie just not hold up well 2007 , particularly when shown high school classroom . advancements cgi could transform bradbury novel into very frightening exciting thriller . my students spent more time laughing adaptation than appreciating it thematically . said , book gained value exponentially them because movie didn't satisfy their understanding . lose wires jet packs !	-1

ok , so i am not big vampire movie fan , so maybe something fact i thought this movie sucked . but i am always open minded all sorts films , so i thought i would give this one whirl . it started out some potential , but within first 20 minutes i knew it going hopeless . i should just turned darned thing off . it so unrealistic ( ok , i know it vampire movie , so what i expect ) but i just didn't believe main character ( kerr ) would things he ended up doing thru out movie . then girl ( izabella miko ) who 8 lines movie ; just lame pointless . she must felt like such loser telling people , yeah , i'm this movie " forsaken " , i'm it almost entire time ... but .... ahhh .... well just call me zombie girl . anyways , i highly recommend pass this one , unless you complete vampire fanatic	-1

" world according garp " my top 5 list favorite books all time . it one those rare books makes you laugh out loud , but still really feel emotion characters , story really sticks you . ( i made joke ellen jamesian just other day , lol ~ yes , it dumb joke no one else got , but , that how it goes sometimes :) i introduced book college , well after book movie released , but i never heard either one . i read book just couple days ~ i couldn't put it down , i chatted it up everyone who would listen . i've re-read it several times since then , i still think it terrific . naturally , when i found out there already movie . . . i thrilled ! i ordered it right away . . . but i wish i'd never wasted my money . it own , movie might alirght . but when you're invested book , when you know characters , robin williams just isn't garp . i love robin williams , he great comedian , that not question . i just think casting this part way off base . if you can't believe main character , rest it crap . if you've never read book , i highly recommend it !!	-1

i don't usually make point watch films this bad ( predictable plot , laughable dialog , horrible music soundtrack , etc ) , but when i saw my all-time favorite actor jeremy brett brief but memorable role " shameless " ( originally titled " mad dogs englishmen " ) , i couldn't resist . it bizarre experience witness actor -- who so perfectly embodied iconic sherlock holmes beloved granada tv series -- appear such odd role drug-supplying sugar daddy . it even odder see glimpse him modern-day sexual scene young woman . regardless , usual , he stole movie even if he only barely it . i only wished director used brett his fullest talents instead aside eccentric . young elizabeth hurley makes mediocre attempt portray bored little rich girl drug problems . thomas howell his best seem sexy grunge biker kind way . but brett booming voice , subtle expressions dynamic presence wakes you up just long enough pay attention his character . once he disappears screen , you realize all too soon rest film worthless . it takes great actor lift up role muck , i'm sorry see this brett only chance modern-day storyline his usual historic epics before he passed away . he briefly commented interview why he role , soon realized film disaster . " mad dogs englishmen " ( 1995) -- " i mad it , but i wanted show world i still alive i could other things apart sherlock holmes . i hope they don't release it ... "	-1
im not sure why i gave this second star ; maybe its because i feel guilty always loathing everything john malkovich associated ? directed written spike jonze charlie kaufman ( same duo who gave us equally pretentious " adaptation " ) , this one centers around unsuccessful puppeteer ( john cusack ) who figures out how enter into body actor john malkovich 15 minutes time manages turn talent into riches fame but oh my he still isnt happy even tho he gets hang out cameron diaz	-1

***** i liked this film lot . it entertaining , suspenseful , made me think . it staying me i'm continuing think it . " simple plan " asks question , " what if you found $4.4 million gym bag woods ... would you keep it ... what if you thought there reasonably good chance you'd never get caught ... no one would ever know ? " this what happens central characters . dvd cover advertises , " sometimes good people evil things . " once they make their decision , plan their plan , movie illustrates how consequences happen completely unanticipated . bill paxton plays main character wonderful typical " good " middle-class accountant small rural town . bridget fonda excellent job his wife , who very idealistic moralistic until she realizes scenario not hypothetical --- fact , she decide what , she makes decisions different what i would expected . billy bob thornton predictably great , course , playing rural man ( main character brother ) who never chance town he lives just wants truly life , his own way , what right ; he handicapped , however , his intelligence , his eccentricity , his background . i felt lot sympathy his character , since i'm person more like his brother , it fascinating see how he lived thought ... movie progressed , his middle-class brother gained empathy difficult life he led , too . i didn't think any pacing slow , other reviewers said . i thought starkness pacing fit beautifully movie it gave me chance process what going . one moral decision led , each them made me think " would i ? " " could i ? " it made me see how seductive certain crimes certain circumstances any one us . this quality , very suspenseful , provocative film . i think it would equally enjoyable men women but definitely not children all , themes very heavy mature . there no special features or subtitles . i generally like subtitles , but they not necessary this film hearing people , everyone speaks very clearly . i cannot imagine how anyone would dislike this movie . there some violence , but none it gratuitous . i generally really dislike violence movies , but it worth it experience i took away after watching it . *****	1
fantastic film ; memticulous carefully built , loaded highest suspense you may expect . this clever film noir , eastwood outsider . he not detective , but jewel thief who watchs something he never see . this brutal murderer reach highest governement levels which very well planned chase made behind traces eastwood . great script . hackman absolute convincing best role which he represented more than any one else ; immoral , corrupt , decadent perverse villain . intelligent puzzle artistic film prove once more than industry craft may join . one best films his career .	1

this american remake original danish movie , starring stellan skarsgard , which more interesting than this remake . i always wonder why , when hollywood remake , they change things make movie interesting first place . even though i give this remake 4 stars , mainly because al pacino robin williams restrained themselves , hollywood changed ending . check out original . i give danish original 5 stars .	-1

i remember seeing this movie years ago college continued like it ever since . movie starts off 1988 calgary olympics . doug dorsey ( d.b. sweeny ) talented hockey player kate mosley ( moira kelly ) pairs figure skater . both mishaps during their big moments , doug suffering career ending injury kate falling during her performace failing meet her own expectations . movie picks up few years later kate trouble getting new partner doug skids unable fulfill his dream becoming star hockey player . added mix kate russian couch anton pamchenko ( played great roy dotrice ) who decides rick kate new partner they struggle get back 1992 olympics . first glance this sports movie figure skating , but not entirely so . scenes involving leads ice surprisingly abstract neither professional skater . truth this character driven story most action takes place off ice . it absolutely charming watch two lead characters go dislike one , extreme rivalry finally ending up love . thing absolutely makes this happen chemestry leads sweeney kelly . they magic together screen , so much so i am surprised they never paired up again movie . i highly recommend this light hearted romance everyone . side note dvd , only special feature theatrical trailer . there no deleted scenes . this where i question , because version film this dvd i've scene tv recent years not one i remember seeing college . i distinctly remember end scene medal ceremony . i somewhat like version because what doug kate won version so much more . so where version alternative ending ???	-1
i love this film . everyone must see it , least once . just everyone should taste ice cream or smell bouquet fresh lilies-of-the-valley , or fall love ... ya gotta see this . " la strada " part body work , its core , thread autobiographical sentiment so powerful mysterious , scholars still dissecting his films frame frame . although fellini says , criterion collection dvd " extra " " i no message humanity ... i am sorry " , we still believe if we decode images , stories , fantasies dreams fellini experience/imagination , we find profound truths . certainly , experience viewing fellini film proven worthwhile vast audience across geographic , linguistic cultural boundaries , over time . there something this fellini guy stuff ... but what heck it ? i think fellini films distillations beauty , humor , dreams , pathos , nightmares pleasure pain living . when fellini insists he doesn't message , he probably right . he not trying sell ideas . he only trying give form his thoughts dreams nightmares fantasies experiences memories . result something we would call " art " . those us susceptible aesthetic , fellini master . la strada film " neorealist " core . ravaged countryside , long , lonely vistas fields , sea , faces poverty belong large part " neorealist " post-war films look unflinchingly harsh realities war-torn italy . circus , which here forms environment , backdrop individuals who reveal their characters tragic landscape . reading film artist biography " fellini fellini " reveals his attitude toward " auguste " clown " imperious " white clown " , their relationships , power structures , circus metaphor life itself . " 8 1/2 " , film-maker concludes acceptance life circus- parade clowns , lovers , friends associates who enter spotlight give resolution film . who argue ? i think life like circus pretty often . there reality " " circus behind illusions there reality " observor " outside . flip this into any social situation watch it fit . we develop compassion sympathy main characters . giulietta massina luminous female protagonist clown-a kind " auguste " figure ( according fellini own breakdown character types ) . she butt jokes , lost soul , sidekick " white clown " , hapless , confused child . anthony quinn oh-so-dark zampano , strongman ( kind " white clown " authority figure ) who blusters , bosses , bullies frightens . end film , man cries edge sea . he broken , lost , betrayed trust innocent , little reason believe his own soul may saved ... except fact his tears falling . his recognition sanctity life comes late .	1

russians yankees team up save world " meteor " , one last gasps celebrity-disaster movies 1970s ' . ( like " airport " movies - you'd bunch celebs tossed around no other purpose than their headshots printed strip bottom movie poster . ) " meteor " , huge chunk asteroid , blasted out its benign orbit after wayward comet , now heading towards earth . called " orpheus " , chunk 5 miles wide promises kick off nuclear winter arrival . only hope left two space-based missile platforms lofted into orbit nasa soviet union - each pointed targets earth rather than into space . ( i don't remember if platforms , named hercules " peter great " actually violated any treaties , but their owners sure seemed keen keeping them secret . ) americans learn incoming asteroid first , fatally positioned one their spacecraft asteroid belt moment comet collision . they then learn hercules " light " -they'll need extra missiles , since they don't any time put new ones into space ( henry fonda president puts it memorably , they can't just " conjure some out thin air " ) they'll go russians help . waiting orpheus hit , plot boils down scenes scientists realigning their missile platforms away earth , other scenes showing devastation wrought smaller " splinters " . ( interesting move , there aren't any subtitles international targets . ) even if you find special effects lame , score annoying plot thin holed if it too struck meteor , " meteor " surprisingly gets some good mileage its stars . sean connery great post-bond role civilian designer hercules - nasa fixture who resigned when his program taken over military ( " hercules " apparently designed just this eventuality ) . brian keith also great dubov , connery russian counterpart . script most yankees getting russians , so he never foil connery , but he gets some good scenes going genial enraged soviet , improbably speaking all his lines russian . karl malden also rises above what seems like incredibly unnecessary role nasa bureaucrat - he neither scientist , engineer or politician , but he keeps connery maverick line . landau , great actor , plays thankless role cold-war hawk general who fears russians more than shooting stars . fx actually pretty good pre-cgi ( mostly excelling space sequences ) . music seems repetitive , but laurence rosenthal score also evocative russians oncoming asteroid . much movie drags many sequences seem redundant . ( they need all " splinter " scenes ? " avalanche " sequence most ludicrous - world coming end , but there no hint any faces those out skiing alps sequence . ) said , plusses minuses this flick make it memorable , plusses make it worth watching . script places control center hercules underneath old att bulding tribeca , i admit i can't pass place without thinking this movie	-1

i much prefer irony tragedy , after blue i not sure what look forward white . i wound up liking white lot . movies " human condition " , me , almost invariably obvious . while this movie quite bit exploring how man reacts love withdrawing love , impotence power performance , revenge circling back love , i thought it handled such off-hand , dead-pan humor very sweet film . way , it struck me amuse-bouche , one those unexpected treats first-rate chef surprise good customer start meal or sometimes courses . movie quality freshness unexpectedness . zbigniew zamachowski masterful job karol , sad sack if there ever one , who gradually shows determination well obsession . i suppose one must just accept obsession unexplainable plot device movie , but dominique got off very unsympathetic start . she'd wilt most men . karol obsession her seemed bit unreal . i found karol developing into resourceful , intelligent guy whom i began admire . dominique , though , didn't seem change much . after all she put karol through -- unnecessarily cruel most time -- i couldn't empathize much karol , but simply accepted things reason why i enjoying movie . i couldn't help thinking if karol just few viagra handy , none his troubles would begun . but then i thought dominique essential characteristics , i think karol would better off somebody new . i don't see future them . one things i liked lot this movie it kept me guessing . it going romantic comedy , or black comedy or some kind excruciatingly dull exploration sexual inadequacy ? karol really just sad loser when he seemed sort resourceful sad , funny way ? what he trying his property purchase ? where dominque fit or this just cameo delpy ? something sad going happen after i'd figured out it seemed combination black/romantic comedy ? i like movie i can't quite see end . people said this movie equality part trio . i saw this movie clever , bittersweet struggle dominance , not equality , laced little revenge . i thought it sweet , bittersweet , clever movie	-1

many reviewers this site said they would want see film focuses hardships extremes immigrants face when coming united states . this , i respond : we've seen hundreds times films . same goes sports films . we've seen movie glory road other films like coach carter , remember titans , hoosiers . they exactly same movie different team . that not say these films aren't decent sports flicks , but film industry needs take step back when making film potential just like every other film its genre . said , exactly what jim sheridan america . story so original acting makes this film glorious triumph . basic story follows family irish immigrants who come america same notion all immigrants : attain american dream . but , they all sooner or later find out , american dream ideology 99.9% people never attain . they trouble finding place stay , end up apartment top run down building many its residents junkies . father johnny ( paddy considine ) struggling actor , who hasn't able get part since death his son frankie , who fell down stairs . mother sarah ( samantha morton ) takes job ice cream parlor earn rent money . oldest daughter christy ( sarah bolger ) probably one smarter people film , sarah bolger gives flawless performance such young girl . she stereotype oldest child who forced grow up too soon . her younger sister ariel ( played sarah bolger younger sister emma ) typical naive little girl who asks fifty questions everything . there some really touching scenes throughout course film , one especially comes mind , where father almost squanders away all family money trying win e.t. doll youngest daughter . there essentially three miracles film , christy , who also narrator , relates these three events set three wishes her brother frankie told her before he died . other great scenes film involve family their relationship man one floors below . when they first arrive house , christy calls him " man who screams . " this man name mateo ( played brilliantly djimon hounsou ) he brilliant artist quite bit emotional problems . he sort figure " morality " film , often giving out endless amounts advice . mateo some sort disease ( we only expect it probably venerial disease ) he gets sick throughout movie . america features one best ensembles i ever seen . every actor perfect every scene . djimon hounsou paddy considine give best performances entire film , jim sheridan wrote directed every gorgeous shot film . while i agree one other reviewer how christy modern camera story set eighties , stupid facts like these should not detract overall message film . overall message , then , not just how immigrants face hardships when they come america ; we already know previous films and/or experiences . film such deeper message , relating not just immigrants , but every person who watches this film . i really not want give message away , but rather i leave it up you go rent or buy this treasure film . this truly one most unforgettable movies i ever seen	1

this movie incredable . i don't understand how people dislike this film . this movie deep intense story made it great children their parents , feat rarely accomplished . but rather than stay depressing traumatizing , this film goes drama side-splitting humor within 13 seconds . best part this all seemless perfection . music , which key element any disney film , great here . although it doesnt ' distinct broadway feel it , it still very strong . it power brilliance comes something eles entirely , i'm not even sure what.in end though , this one disney greatest efforts . clean , brilliant animation , flawless story , adn increadable music all come together something truely spectacular . only sad thing this became begining end disney animation . so treasure this gem , because here out , it all downhill . :	1

plot synopsis please read amazon review . i wish talk reasons why you love this film . longtime fan both sam raimi ( evil dead series ) bill paxton ( aliens , twister ) , i went see this opening night . not many people claim this i'm sure because it , such small film received next no marketing . shame . this film best tradition modern film noir including blood simple fargo , both made cohen brothers . film buffs able draw connections those films their filmakers , so i won't bother get into . should you seen either these films enjoyed them , i suggest you stop reading immediately rent simple plan . if not , keep reading i try express why this film so remarkably brilliant . why i hope you take look it . simple plan , its core , four people . underneath all plot devices twists , it how they relate one . notice i did't say characters , because this film doesn't actors simply delivering dialogue . it people you get know , understand sympathise they undergo most brutal dilemmas . sure , finding mysterious bag filled money excellent plot device , but heart this film much simpler than . it basic human flaw committing criminal act trying weasel your way out it . forced most unthinkable things process . that what gives this film such depth . you watch these people try figure out how cover every angle so they get away stealing whole lot cash . end it falls apart two reasons : details human factor . they say devil details this never truer than crime . human factor , where greed concerned , people cannot trust one because they fear other person greed while unable satisfy their own . many respects this film almost homage blood simple fargo , but many ways i think it superior . i often draw comparison scene which both simple plan blood simple where body increasingly difficult dispose . even afterwards , after emotional toll taken , once one evil act committed , sure follow . it so painfully facsinating watch person work out their problem camera , frantically going over details their mind , all while their heart beating mile minute . bill paxton this better than anyone . he such likable man ( both film life ) you can't help but feel sorry mess he created . his entire performance balancing act getting away seemingly harmless crime , keeping his partners bay their mouths shut while prodded his conspirator wife . may make them all sound malicious , but really opposite actually true . they're all normal folks , like we've all seen hundred times . end it really gets you because you imagine how you would react same situations they find themselves . after all , you faced choice steal couple million dollars no one would miss , what would you ? but then again , nothing ever simple	1
i found this inspiring , thoughtful , extremely interesting take new paradigm science , quantum mechanics . this movie explains non-technical terms philosophical ramifications theory ( almost universally accepted ) how it relevant our everyday lives -- even non-physicists . it interviews many well credentialed credible physicists , philosophers , theologians , making it engaging even most cynical viewers . interspersed drama showing theories action regular person . me , it helps reconcile spirituality ( christian my case ) scientific theory whereas before i always felt my love science reason constant conflict my spiritual beliefs . no longer ! watch movie , which most part not dogmatic not judgmental but instead eye-opening logically satisfying even " religious . " i love it	1
putting it simply , this film work genius . tom stoppard fanatic , i adored it moment i read play , which even version he considerably unhappy . he significantly more satisfied movie , there very little doubt why . he clearly handle what he doing writing whom he working . any who ever single existentialist thought should see this film -- they may or may not like it , but that not what matters . this film amazing	1

i just read dirk " spolier " ending mothman prophecies say huh ? demonic , fallen angles ? what ? we watch same movie ? if all you go movie , might impression you're left . but if you've ever looked into events happened around point pleasant , or any books subject , you'll see mothman more ufo related than anything . same time mothman sightings point pleasant area wave ufo reports , men-in-black , all sorts goings-on up sky . fact , mothman played only very small part drama , it far predominately ufo related , keel makes clear . unfortunately , producers chose abandon this aspect story entirely , so happenings point pleasant lost their entire frame reference . if you see this movie thinking this way things actually happened , you might come conclusion mothman evil , demonic , fallen angles , whatever you like . but if you research incident all , you'll see you're only getting fraction story movie . if , like dirk , you thereby think you know all what mothman actually based just movie alone , then all your conclusions end up based simply hollywood writer imagination script nothing more . mothman anything demons angels or any religious overtones far truth you could possibly . don't judge movie , read book	-1
hands down one best documentaries ever made . you see variety reactions here , it film engages audience despite its incredibly controversial nature . i'm amazed how split responses regards guilt arnold jessie friedman ( specifically crimes they accused together ) , even more surprised sympathy expressed towards mother , elaine . regardless whether her husband son actually guilty ( record , accusations highly implausible evidence non-existent ) , her behavior selfish atrocious . i'm sure she experiencing her own turmoil thought she doing right thing , but it astounding see woman such poor sense familial commitment claim righteousness over others . especially considering her choices starting this family . fact , it this destruction family dynamic makes piece so compelling . seeing it disolve firsthand , via home videos made friedmans , absolutely fascinating . provided you stomach graphic frank discussion pedophilia , this documentary fantastic	1

this film worth watching over over again , if only see sinatra rendition " lady tramp " , which he sings riveting style musical finesse . based book play john o'hara , it boasts some snappy dialogue fabulous rodgers hart score , songs like " bewitched , bothered bewildered " , " i could write book " , " what i care dame ?

some might suggest there now three things not discuss polite conversation : 1 ) politics 2 ) religion 3 ) viet nam . viet nam , battle would become known hamburger hill resulted over ninety per cent one american platoon dead . yet body count would still necessary see which side suffered greater losses . directing mass charges via waves infantry modern warfare initially chronicled during korean conflict only later officially recognized ' war ' . importantly , hamburger hill also battle before it made into movie also war named but never declared . overview , modern war , film-making or army life , " we soldiers " merits full consideration . mel gibson turns flawless performance walking point this sortie became first major battle viet nam conflict , later unofficially entitled " war .

this one my favourite movies ' 30s . i love everything this film - smart , fashionable sets fashions - sexy , snappy plot - black white photography which just shines ( great watching late night all lights out ) . norma shearer gives terrific performance - surprisingly modern natural , film moves fast pace never dulls . i won't give away plot - which still holds relevance today marraige or partnership ( double standard tackled this film still around ) . ending - its perfect ! you wouldn't want it any other way . previous reviewer stated ending film rather spoiled it her - it contradicted feminism apparent earlier scenes . however , what we here both partners accepting other flaws - if it seems its norma character making all effort that just because she stronger two ( made obvious throughout movie - while her ex husband drinks himself into unemployment her love life career goes strength strength ) . ultimately though , this movie fascinating daring ( its day ) insight into sexual politics ( mgm-style ) among smart set early thirties , viewed such modern viewer . above all else - this movie fun ! if you're fan vintage hollywood then you should love this movie	1

this film motivated me my own research i read much material case i could possibly find -- especially arguments those who maintained three teenagers guilty . honest , i natural skepticism west memphis three claims innocence . coworker mine brutally murdered some years ago two her " friends " who also coworkers arrested murder . i refused believe it first . but it became clear over time evidence overwhelming conclusive . still there those who refused believe facts zealously argued their friends ' innocence . when all said - it come down facts whether or not one chooses face reality believe facts . first , please allow me correct few misconceptions some other reviewers . michael moore mentioned credits refers one little eight-year-old child murder victims , not filmmaker . couple reviewers mentioned necklace worn damien echols which supposedly blood it some victims . actually , nothing more determinable than common blood types found . one almost microscopic spot pendant consistent blood type damien echols ( one accused ) , other micro-spot consistent blood type shared both jason baldwin ( one accused ) steven branch ( one eight-year-old victims ) -- well 11% rest caucasian population united states . all experts agree tiny micro-spots blood transferred number ways -- especially teenage boy wearing necklace against their bare skin . police photos verify jason baldwin also worn damien necklace . police photos taken two days after crime -- show damien without his shirt reveal absolutely no cuts , abrasions or scratches whatsoever . closest thing credible evidence prosecution could manage produce four very tiny fibers found houses damien family jason family which deemed prosecution microscopically similar fibers two victims . but even prosecution expert witness , lisa sakevicius criminologist state crime laboratory acknowledged this inconclusive could just well come mass-produced products obtained off shelves local wal-mart . furthermore , charles linch southwestern institute forensic science dallas refuted claims microscopic similarities his testimony . no fibers whatsoever found home jessie family . during appeal process forensic scientists examining crime scene photos autopsy photos identified human bite marks two victims . this confirmed forensic odontologist . teeth impressions taken three young men prison . none these teeth impressions damien , jason jessie matched these bite marks found victims . highly coerced " confession " jessie misskelly jr. ( 17-year-old borderline retarded boy iq 71 ) so filled obvious errors it obscenity it treated basis making these arrest . i should mention this so-called " confession " came after submitting this boy 12 hour grueling without lawyers , parents or counsel any kind included polygraph test which he passed but told police he failed . judge burnett would not allow jury hear these interrogation techniques . jessie misskelly jr. refused testify court against jason baldwin damien echols stating he simply " not going get up there tell bunch lies " . this spite offer remove his life sentence . read dan stidham ( jessie lawyer ) case synopsis copying pasting web address below : http://www.wm3.org/live/caseintroduction/synopsis_dan.php scenario painted police prosecutors against three teenagers simply scientific impossibility . how earth could there massive blood loss caused ceremonial satanic cult killings three persons middle night without leaving one single micro-speck blood or any other body fluids scene ? they sneak fbi forensic team clean up after them when nobody looking ? luminal testing could reveal blood presence only where police laid or transported bodies . it should also mentioned none scarce shoe prints scene matched jason , jessie or damien either . . scientific view -- see this crime scene analysis profile one america leading forensic scientist which also gives some insight who might actually committed crime . i must warn you - it bit gruesome say least : copy paste this web address : http://www.arwar.org/wm6caseinformation/turveyequivocaldeathanalysisandprofile.htmlso let us briefly summarize . much so-called evidence based notion damien admitted interest wicca religion occult which many local people perceived satanism . this not evidence committing murder . you go any suburban shopping mall bookstore or small town library anywhere middle america find plenty books such subjects . furthermore , neither jason nor jessie ever expressed any particular interest wicca or occult . both damien jason wore mostly black clothes loved heavy metal music . so what ? police actually confiscated 15 black t-shirts jason home evidence prove god knows what . damien undoubtedly troubled teenager troubled family . he bit wise-ass teenager . he wrote some morbid poetry . so what ? couple young girls claimed months after fact they heard damien say he committed murders . any reasonable-objective person listening those testimonies would found them implausible put it politely . young burglar/drug addict who juvenile detention facility claimed shy reserved 16-year-old jason confessed him second time they ever met ghastly stories drinking blood genitals murdered child while worshipping devil . counselor facility warned prosecution this young man not credible gave them detailed reasons . there no evidence jason this young man ever met . even if they -- story ridiculous . still , judge burnett would not allow jury hear counter-testimony or information could challenged credibility this witness . so-called " confession " jessie scenario put forward police prosecution would involved massive amounts blood left scene . there not even one tiny micro-spec . physical impossibility . simple fact all forensics either exonerating or completely inconclusive . " there lack physical evidence tie anyone or anything crime scene .

one major problems i encounter people who viewed this cinematic masterpiece kurosawa film pretentious boring . more importantly , truth readily available viewer if he or she just watches film . however , point film . what truth ! we viewer foreknowledge crime criminal charged . " rashomon " always one my favorite films akira kurosawa , although i not place it top five his greatest . but kurosawa fascinating insight into truth dares us look what we hold " truth . " there any absolute truths ? if so , whose ? this film attempts let viewer decide who telling truth . relativism , [ corollary skepticism ] truth or belief truth relative position person who making statement . which turn directly questions ideal objectivity : since this undermines belief people get outside themselves order get truth . therefore , if truth depends observer viewpoint , how there universal truth -- or even absolute truth ? i believe kurosawa attempting show audience although truth may not absolute , there still truths . therefore , even though each characters kurosawa thrown into this film give us different viewpoint truth they witnessed it , individual themselves give enough their perception [ through their own objectivity ] , which truth still found . kurosawa so wonderful way giving four different versions murder rape : one witness , three versions people involved crime . me , film telling many ways , some which i am sure i am wrong , however , film fascinating way kurosawa uses non-verbal area film : visuals themselves . many kurosawa films , cinematography all talking . much gathered this film just looking scenery , trying not focus too much dialogue ; visuals themselves much , if not more , story . who telling truth ? why there different versions ? this i leave others decide themselves . film , attempt get truth really fascinating . telling sign kurosawa knew what he doing especially evident when looking reviewers amazon disagreeing each other . kurosawa what he set out : what truth ? toshiro mifune bandit who charged crime , he terrific acting job . movie also stars great takashi shimura woodsman who discovers scene crime . this classic highly recommended . however , it may not appeal all viewers . rent it first . [ i own it ] but since this film foreign , ambiguous many areas , some viewers may problems it . [ stars : 4.5	1

this film long one my top ten favorites quality acting screenplay , importance theme : secret network could operate within intelligence community beneath radar legitimate agency oversight . film seems especially prescient now , given fictional network goal planning u.s. invasion mideast . voila , 30 years later , u.s. invaded mideast . when redford character finally confronts rogue c.i.a. leader plan , he connects dots says , " this whole damn thing oil , isn't it ? " exactly . let clear why u.s. armed forces iraq , rather than , say , ecuador or nepal : it strategic importance region oil . yes , plan transform iraq into democratic nation , which lead entire region direction . but u.s. isn't committing its treasure citizenry all troubled regions globe equally ; we iraq because it strategic linchpin region . without access mideast oil reserves , world economy would shaken its foundations . there many troubled , undemocratic regions world -- example , much africa ; yet we fight now establish democracy only one troubled region , mideast . coincidence ? no . simple self-interest . cliff robertson character says film conclusion : " when people cold their engines stop running , they're not going ask us why ; they'll just want us go get it . " realizing he embarrassment c.i.a. ( inevitable role any whistleblower , even reluctant one ) , film end redford gives entire story new york times . robertson character , c.i.a. station chief who caught off-guard hidden conspiracy , says , " but they print it ? " redford taken aback implication -- government could pressure media suppress story -- then he avers , less confidently , " they'll print it . " this core democracy : free press keeps government answerable its people . without free skeptical press , all elections world mean nothing .	1

station agent touching , yet off beaten path kind flick i found simply endearing watch . fin ( peter dinklage ) just inherited train depot somewhere out new jersey . passion trains , he embraces this his home . however , he only wishes left alone finds that not easy he would thought . first , he discovers joe ( bobby cannavale ) who set up food truck outside his home . joe conversationalist , desperate talk anyone everyone . next fin meets olivia ( patricia clarkson ) , who almost runs him off road , twice . these three appear nothing common , despite all odds , they form friendship heartwarming see . all three actors gave amazing performances . dinklage , always , commands every scene he . i've missed seeing him since bastards cbs quashed threshold , so it nice see something him it again . cannavale amused me his character , joe , who really needed " get life . " idea quite time not something he easily grasp say least . clarkson radiated olivia , character trying put her life back together again after lost her son her husband leave her . what i liked most this flick honest portrayal it gave us life through fin eyes . there chronic stares he got just smaller than average . plus , there scene grocery store where cashier didn't even see he standing there , so she didn't ring him up until he could get her attention . it just made me think what it must really like not fit standard mold physically . all all , excellent film	-1
i'm starting appreciate john lecarre novels more than i when he all over bestseller list . this film version one acted well , but 30 minutes there just wasn't anything engage my interest . not its characters not its plot . good cause worth building story around , but not this story . i quit watching , so i guess i could wrong , but i doubt it .	-1
big fan anime comedy ( intelligent , yet lame humor ) i eager see el hazard " magnificent world " . because high price set , i some hesitation ( because some poor reviews amazon ) . well , i say bad reviews wrong . this dvd series totally awesome ( although i admit it started bit slow ) . i promise more you keep watching , better it gets . plot highly intelligent ( involving dimensional time travel ) characters very interesting ( distinctive special powers ) . some say humor el hazard juvenile ( but i would argue no more juvenile then southpark ) , seriously what good comedy isn't juvenile ? some also say story sometimes too redundant ( because many episodes involve doomsday device ) , which i respond " we call original starwars trilogy redundant because they involve death star " ? no , ofcourse not . yes this dvd set lacks some extras , but i think pioneer great job . dvd menu presentation beautiful , box very elegant too . hopefully you get this set around 40 dollars ebay ( beware bootlegs ) . it very hard find good authentic set . sequel " alternative world " which i just ordered , individually should cost around 30 dollars if you shop smart . my fellow anime comedy fans , i also reccomend " niea under 7 " " his her circumstances " . animation = 5plot = 4music = 4characters = 5comedy = 4total = 4.4 star	1
opening strip scene reminiscent barbarella - too bad those aren't basinger legs though . nerdy scientist falls galactic beauty presented kim basinger . i never understood ackroyd characters . keeping form , he once again unfunny mud . basinger tries so hard - too hard - rescue this film , but that no small task considering ineptness this way silly film . ok so she munches batteries , thinks she cook everything kitchen mealtime . she seems genuine betty crocker given her favorite foods nuts bolts . jon lovitch also tries prop up ackroyd this weak script . however , his contribution seems way overstated me . he doesn't much . funny scenes inwhere teenage girl eventually decides her step-mother not like other people . basinger character magic purse annoying creepy critter it who tells her what . think , jar-jar blinks . i suppose it ok backdrop housecleaning . but that it . flat mechanical	-1

film begins gripping scenes haunting music ... fighter jets landing , powerful spiritual music sad almost like funeral - setting tone what come . ben affleck plays cia agent jack ryan perfection . there great casting all major roles key characters book . although book , city denver location used terrorists attack , choice baltimore , maryland makes sense , since there port which clearly point entry contraband . fact film remains true intentions spirit tom clancy book . there political maneuvering , espionage , edge-of-your seat gripping moments after attack very well executed plot . suspense builds story unfolds ... topic fascinating timely . it almost like " 007 " films old ... you more or less know what expect , but ride so engaging , you caught up drama events . nuclear bomb discovered desert bedouin , left buried downed airplane during ' 73 israeli war . he suspects it some value make money selling it . agent purchases it mere pittance , vastly less than its true worth ... so realistic . after unexpected death russian president , his replacement investigated cia . us president , his advisors cia busy extracting information this relative " dark horse " discover his stand major issues . past , jack ryan written paper him , extrapolating his views world events ... he accompanies delegation us visit russia ensure nuclear disarmament going according plans . each side assesses opposition wary reminders past ever forefront their minds ... how difficult it learn soviet arms during cold war , us agents died trying access . information ... now delegation freely shown labs , nuclear reactor storage facilties . times indeed changed ... us president attends filled capacity football stadium baltimore , md when suddenly , unexpectedly rapidly secret agents usher him out ... huge explosion occurs , mushroom cloud indicating nuclear bomb went off . during disaster , jack ryan seeks his superior , only find him taking his last breath . he pays his last respects uses his cell phone id bage enter white house . jack discovered irrefutable evidence proves it * not * russian attack . nuclear substance originated united states . fingerprints explosion subsequent fall out positive proof . however , suspense builds us president russian president stand-by preparing war ... trying read each others motives action . unraveling peace accords takes minutes although it took years years create peace disarmament . difficult decisions faced us president depicted superbly ... raw emotions arising during such national disaster naturally conveyed . only failure film choice selecting disgruntled fascist group culprits attack . keeping it closer story line book would paid off huge dividends short long run . years following 2001 sept . 11th attack , using ancient history such nazi-like fascists enemy just not play well audience . it leaves huge credibility gap ... this why it reminds me " 007 " films . despite this one major flaw , which i deducted one star , film hit this viewer . i highly recommend it . erika borsos [ pepper flower	-1
i absolutely loved this movie . it fast paced , funny , exciting , really revived my interest history . parents should definitely watch this their kids move forward any interest history their children show afterwards . they should come up something like this math science well .	1
yeah , that how i felt when i noticed lack gore lack development characters . even zombies same thoughout picture . how zombie go one part town next what would take serious muscle car least hour ? regardless , it worth owning scene where they rise out cemetery . kid downright annoying but , when i kid i liked him ! suppose it not time kids yet , aye ? regardless it could better . flawed but , if you viewed this before first one ... don't let it stop you getting first ! first one rocked . i thought 3rd one produced much better than this well ... but they just keep killing this series part 4 5 i once again heard terrible	-1

there very few films literally brought tears my eyes . they must films uncompromising emotional power . films like magnolia , passion christ , now johnny belinda . it story deaf dumb young woman named belinda . treated unintelligent workhorse all her years , belinda life changes forever when lonely new doctor moves into her small coastal nova scotian port town . he takes immediate liking her , proving her family she not " dummy " they think , he teaches her read lips . but after drunken sexual assault leaves her pregnant , rumors begin fly throughout small town , both belinda her loved ones must fight what righ t.t he performances wonderful . course , jane wyman simply steals show her oscar-winning performance . she brings incredible heart , warmth , emotional resonance character belinda , she it without ever saying word . rest cast marvelous well , especially charles bickford , who lovingly portrays belinda father , stephen mcnally , who turns belinda attacker into one most easy loathe characters ever put celluloid - yet film still brilliantly keeps him level realistic personality - no one caricature . director jean negulesco brings understated visual beauty film reminiscent silent ages , when one use aesthetics make up lack aural stimulus . every shot perfectly composed work art , turning every moment belinda into masterwork lighting raw , majestic nature . seaside settings utilized so well they put johnny belinda league such legendary jaw-droppers l'avventura black narcissus . but this film much more than just visual appeal . it both heartwarming heartbreaking , often simultaneously . there so many thought-provoking themes gnaw johnny belinda - way people view handicapped , bonds parenthood , power rumors , justification violence self-defense , overall morality humanity . even film setting could considered allegory belinda - brutal waves ocean constantly pounding against serene shores . film also , i mentioned before , emotionally overwhelming . while it certainly focused narrative , belinda foremost progression feelings , they so well conveyed i simply overcome joy , pain , heartbreak , hope . while film often described melodrama , it far soap opera . there no miraculous moments sudden verbal triumph belinda , no ridiculously overacted moments teary-eyed abandon - johnny belinda terribly real experience . there aspects story remain unresolved - not loose ends , but difficult problems would most likely also remain unresolved reality . however , i don't want give impression johnny belinda depressing . i felt uplifted rapturous just often i felt overcome grief fear . i felt so much these characters i wanted so sorely things turn out certain way - but i won't reveal whether they or not . i say film ends note nearly unbearable poignancy , this moment massaged my tear ducts . my only complaint concerning film max steiner score . he perfectly suited epic films like king kong gone wind , but here it feels somewhat overdramatic occasionally awkward . he tends play up melodramatic angle spot score ubiquitous manner , which simply doesn't fit film like johnny belinda . still , it tends work more often than not , it not major enough problem work seriously film detrimen t.t his picture true gem . it unavailable years , but thanks warner brothers , it finally dvd release , restoration simply glorious - it more than justice this cinematic treasure . yourself favor see johnny belinda	1

i enjoy this movie very much . amazon.com great deal wit	1
this movie might save few kids if their parents get it . real evil fact many large corporations target kids time they diapers . commercials aimed directly little kids get them eat foods harmful your health . fast food only one many fall into this category . adults realize poor diet harmful your health but kids lured these " pushers " garbage contrary everything we want kids eat . once they hooked they nag you until you get them next fix french fries . think it clown , play areas , free toys , yummy food , what kid would not love it . least movie makes it clear eating this stuff cause your organs shut down shorten your life span . sure adults just say no , but kids trust enough actually believe no one would harm them just make buck . parents must stop this schools need keep this food out ofthe cafeteria . i just want also touch industry aspect exploits work force uses lobbyist maintaintheir cheap disposable work force . sure corporations enjoy big profits when you hire people , pay them almost nothing , provide no insurance , fire them without union mediate , put them harms way no regard their safety but this how we all lose . we all pay taxes cover housing , medical , law enforcement , education , etc while corporations enjoy increased profits . they stay business because government looks other way happily taking money so they blast us commercials election time vote them . we all pay price high our integrity what stake right our way life	-1
katie holmes stars " pieces april " , interesting film thanksgiving family . katie holmes plays april . she bit black sheep her family something rebel . she moved new york went out drug dealer , but now she trying put her life back track . she got caring new boyfriend ( derek luke ) , who she lives their modest , kind run down apartment . april family visit them thanksgiving this year , she really wants get things right , especially since it might her mother last thanksgiving dinner , her mother cancer . everything should fine , april thinks , she got all cooking figured out her head , she just it . doing cooking , however , becomes little more difficult when april oven breaks down . left no other choice , april goes door door her building , looking place cook her turkey , even if it only couple hours . april manage piece together perfect meal ? resonable meal ? she manage make meal all ? this film digital video , which i think its advantages disadvantages . digital , image fairly crisp , which means all cooking scenes really clear . you see she not working cleanest kitchen , or most delicious turkey , or using best ingredients . video , it looks little lower budget than your average film , which kind emphasizes smallness delapidation apartment . i could lived without all shaky camerawork though . i found this comedy section my dvd store , but it more like drama , i think . there funny moments , but they kind rise out situation , rather than played laughs . there sad moments , moments tension , whole range emotions . gets bit grim , little depressing times , but then again , it could lot worse . most characters likeable , when they're not , you understand where they're coming . i quite liked soundtrack , which seemed feature quite lot songs magnetic fields band ( according subtitles ) called " 6ths " . magnetic fields list bands i've meaning check out , so it nice hear some music them . special features include 15 minute behind scenes piece called " all pieces fit together " , which contains rehearsal footage interviews cast . there also audio commentary director original theatrical trailer . not what i expected , but interesting enough . worth look	-1

don't waste your time this , folks . this movie bad bad bad ! horrible acting , stupid story ( prince directed it himself , hey , he can't good everything ) outrageously ridiculous dialogue . but few songs aren't bad ( mountains , girls boys , sometimes it snows april ) that why i'm even giving it one star . this really dumb tale prince morris day valet jerome benton going france where former gigolo who falls love . one thing good i say this slop hogs it better than laxative-on-film " graffiti bridge .

" greetings " offbeat satire very young brian de palma starring equally young robert de niro . vignettes focus three friends . first there jon rubin ( de niro ) , aspiring filmmaker who idea creating " peep art . " this would consist filming " private moments , " then letting people view them through tiny windows , thereby re-creating peeping tom experience ( more this de palma much better 1970 film , " hi , mom ! " ) . however , if you expecting see amazing performance one great actors his generation early film , you going disappointed . de niro comes off overly mannered bit forced his performance , especially comparison his two co-stars . his best moment off-screen he talks woman through going bed his peep art ( she repeatedly forgets not talk ) . but he lot better two years later decent career , least until he started making credit card commercials . first there lloyd clay ( gerrit graham ) , conspiracy nut so obsessed jfk assassination half-naked woman sleeping his bed just opportunity show paths indicated bullet holes not match up ( unless jfk shot while standing his head ) . lloyd shares his deep , dark thoughts directly viewing audience he argues vigorously convince us he right . but sometimes he finds people real world assault his blow-ups zapruder film reduce assassination rorschach test . finally , we paul gerald shaw ( jonathan warden ) , who would like find right girl . his problem he his induction physical going vietnam really hurt his love life . fortunately , lloyd jon fully ideas how paul get army reject him , everything pretending gay coming sergeant ( lloyd idea ) volunteering shoot not only vietcong but also any american troops color ( jon brainstorm ) . there no real narrative thread here , which hardly criticism because " greetings " more ancestor " groove tube , " " saturday night live , " " second city tv " history contemporary sketch comedy heavy satirical bent . difference what de palma his friends come up " greetings " more experimental guerilla theater than really polished sketch comedy . but there something compelling its enthusiasm , which makes us forgive filmmaker his actors when things go bit too long . de palma admitted influenced godard french " nouvelle vague " cinema , which inspired going out street trying improvise scenes ( only they not enough film improvise , so they ended up rehearsing most film save money ) . but even this early work , de palma clearly into doing everything you movie camera ( inter-titles , split-screen , slow-motion , fast-motion , etc . ) . " greetings " historical footnote cinematic history inasmuch it first film u.s. given " " rating ( later changed " , " which what it would qualify today because some shots nude women ) . terms social history " greetings " represents some counter-culture politics late 1960s . it almost thirty years since i first saw " greetings " " hi , mom !

film wonderful snapshot decline fall american town . scenes parties flint rich folks gm executives , interspersed poor workers evicted their homes , great . i also loved seeing reagan hearing flint citizens talk how he going bring jobs back . this president who put our country road bankruptcy . moore wants save his home town help people poverty . he sincere guy . i'm less convinced proposals he mind would accomplish anything . i see it , problem flint not gm bad corporate citizen , or government isn't doing enough help poor . real difficulty flint prosperity 50s 60s illusion begin . after second world war america chose base its transportation system automobile . this seemed work ok while , because gasoline seemed plentiful cheap . unfortunately , this approach transportation some nasty side effects . it made our towns ugly our people fat , not mention changing climate . today we're coming end era cheap oil passing hubbert peak . oil comes millions years ' worth stored sunlight , when it gone , it gone . next few decades getting around all going become increasingly difficult . we'll wishing we invested streetcar lines walkable cities instead all those freeways . automobile still subsidized tune billions dollars america today . that just money down rat hole . more perspective dominance automobile american life , i would suggest kunstler books " geography nowhere " " long emergency .

i'm not very familiar books daniel handler ( lemony snicket ) but , even judging this film alone , i'm going say his work appeals me lot more than harry potter . kids enjoyed it lot after watching it they wanted second round . story centers three adorable gifted children who're abruptly orphaned when their parents die mysterious fire . their search new home well-meaning new guardians constantly interfered malicious count orlaf ( jim carrey ) who hunts after bauedelaires ' family fortune . main reason why this film so genuinely unsettling because story relentlessly uncovers deepest fear every child , namely death parents large risk ending up ill-natured new guardians . most fairy-tale don't even dare bring up this nightmarish idea , but " lemony snicket ... " entirely revolves around it . equally effective , course , ghoulish landscapes , dark scenery amazingly eccentric characters . most time , it feels like you're watching typical tim burton film that giant compliment , since his style practically unique ( sinister , witty heart-warming all once ! ) . there lot cgi here but not point annoy you , since all these exaggeratedly fake special effects ( leeches , aunt josephine seaside-house ) contribute morbid atmosphere . cast terrific well , jim carrey count orlaf one most memorable performance date . i admit i initially feared carrey performance would far over-the-top , but he surprisingly mature convincing . bauedelaire-children very well cast well so billy connolly meryl streep most important supportive roles . great cast completed respectable names ( luiz guzm�n , catherine o'hara , jennifer coolidge , cedric entertainer ... ) small roles . sublime film . it funny , it interesting , it creative ! i recommend taking chance this one- if you like art , if you like jim carrey , if you like unique plots , highly recommended all type audiences !	-1

" all family " certainly ground-breaking tv show , episodes selected this vhs video give you pretty good idea why true . archie bunker , all his bigoted splendor , comes life right away premiere episode series , entitled " meet bunkers " ( first aired january 1971 ) . addition first episode , this tape also gives us season-one program ( episode # 8 ) , " lionel moves into neighborhood " , show season two , " flashback : mike meets archie " ( which 18th episode series ) . this 1998-produced color video columbia tri-star home video presented ( some odd reason i've yet fathom ) " ep " ( extended play ) mode . ( well , least copy i received ep mode ; perhaps some other copies * * recorded sp ; i cannot sure this . ) but this ep recording makes no sense me all , since all 70 minutes could easily fit tape spool " sp " ( standard ) playback mode , give better quality boot . it also seems strange columbia produced some tapes this series 10 " all family " videos sp mode , while others ( like this one ) recorded inferior ep speed . most curious indeed . but , even so , video audio look sound pretty good here , considering limitations vhs format . fact , hi-fi mono sound this tape actually sounds * better * than audio any multiple aitf boxed sets dvd . dvd audio tracks seem tad " weak " me . completists beware ! --- these columbia/tri-star videos " aitf " not showing complete , uncut episodes . some large chunks programming edited out this video , others this series too . which , again , seems strange , because there no commercial interruptions here , obviously no need trim anything time reasons . but , obviously , columbia used truncated , syndicated prints these " all family " videos . example missing scenes --- first episode this tape , final 2 3 minutes epilog scene missing ( when archie mike/meathead talking greeting card edith received earlier episode ) . it * * , indeed , all just " filler " , without much substance , but it would still nice see shows uncut . if you desire see complete , unedited shows , you'll purchase seasonal boxed sets " all family " dvd . dvds present shows uncut form , which great see , because there some often-excised scenes shown dvds you've probably never seen before , due chopped-up prints shown commercial tv . smile-inducing dialogue courtesy mr. archie bunker " meet bunkers " .................. archie ( talking daughter gloria ): " pull skirt down ! ...... every time you sit down one them things , mystery over !

when i first saw this film , some five years ago , it truly knocked breath out me . first time , director allison anders gives us glimpse into mexican-american gang life east la echo park , female perspective , this time . past , we seen our share male experiences ( example zoot suit , written playwright luis valdez ) . once , we see gritty side gang life , young mexicanas ( or chicanas , depending who you ask ) struggle stay alive , amidst rampant drug dealing , violence gang initiation their relationships men who less than honorable them . mi vida loca actually trilogy stories . ( mousie sad girl , lowrider la blue eyes ) first story life long friendship fellow gang members , mousie ( seidy lopez ) sad girl ( angel aviles ) . these young women best friends , until day sad girl sleeps mousie boyfriend , ernesto ( jacob vargas ) , becomes pregnant his child . world they knew before ruptured , their lifelong connection friends . second story takes glimpse lowrider culture . this culture perpetuated , predominantly , young chicanos who build their lives around re-finishing airbrushing " low rider " cars ( many , old school chevies ) , complete flashy airbrush images ( example voluptuous women gang affiliations ) , trick tires rims . this story actually wonderful example modern magical realism , when car takes life its own . third story centered around la blue eyes , beautiful brown-eyed woman who writing convict , she falls love through exchange letters . question , when they finally meet , sum those letters even measure up their encounter , or young woman ultimately deceived , whole time ? i reccomend this film , if not fact it compelling , but this important culture society we should all learn something more . very important study gang life , how it evolves neighborhood many only hear evening news , but never get know	-1

i heard this film director ken loach few years before getting see it , i can't emphasize how impressive film - it not only realistic war drama , but examines expresses complexities one greatest problems 20th century - struggle working class people some kind system other than capitalism not tainted authoritarianism anti-humanism lenin , trotsky stalin ussr or mao mainland china . regardless downplaying right-wing " business usual " extremists like angel garralda ortega ( who wrote review attacked this movie below ) , there really ( still ) libertarian communist movement - made up anarchists - based idea worker shrugging bosses landlords off their back - not forcibly banning exploitation use state it laws , but rather libertarian idea not letting oneself exploited , not exploiting others - abandoning essence capitalism anti-authoritarian manner . also , mr. ortega it wrong - sporadic killings republican side opening spanish civil war only amounted some 3 or 4 thousand deaths fascist supporting landlords spanish catholic church officials who orders kill libertarians republicans sight . anarchist cnt organization opposed such vigilantism punished those individuals it . contrast this hundreds thousands millions tortured executed republicans , libertarians , liberals , workers , small businessmen , progressive catholics , protestants , so who opposed franco after civil war end 1939 . also , poum not trotskyist . it independent socialist organization broken trotsky , it leading figure , andrs nin , executed stalinists - like so many militia fighters such anarchist camillo berneri . amazon review , jonas liljestrm gothenburg , sweden explained basic point i am making better than i could : " historians who attempt rehabilitate franco reputation often tend overlook fact whereas republicans generally tried avoid unnecessary acts brutality during war , nationalists exactly opposite . mass killings , rapes , looting wanton destruction commonplace they terrorised civilians newly conquered areas , trying discourage them putting up resistance . repression political opponents continued virtually throughout duration franco regime . fact franco fought communism no reason glorify him . after all , hitler same , but homicidal aspects his politics so blatantly obvious it would quite impossible depict him anything resembling heroic figure . my opinion , defending franco outrageous ethical point view it would defend hitler , mussolini or stalin . " but i digress ... this film accurately shows how there popular libertarian socialist revolution madrid barcelona spain 1936 crushed stalinists year later , leading inevitable disheartenment loss civil war those who wanted preserve liberty democracy . actors this film likely unfamiliar us viewers , but i know lead , ian hart , later first harry potter film . sure also see magnificent spanish civil war film " libertarias " directed vicente aranda . it focus more squarely anarchist cnt , instead independent marxist poum . artificial eye releasing region 2 dvd this film , available uk version amazon . i very strongly recommend this excellent drama one best ways learn spanish civil war	1

released 1949-this movie stars toshiro mifune one his earliest roles tokyo cop murakami , who gun stolen which leads his relentless drive recover weapon-which used crime spree . we actually see very little yusa-the man who winds up gun -- i'm not totally convinced use name not coincidental considering japan occupied yu-s-a time . perhaps mifunes attempt retrieve missing gun restore his honor symbolic japans attempt restore it honor after war . then again-i may reading into this it may not any such thing -- however kurosawa himself-in regard problems american spca this movie stated " i never any other moment experienced stronger sense regret over japan losing war " regerdless , other films such " madadayo " " rhapsody august " -kurosawa touched conflict atomic bomb-and not implying he anti-american -- i thnk it possibility yusa could symbolic meaning . theory aside , this excellent movie-which preserved quite well considering it age conditions when it filmed -- when neither mifune or kurosawa major stars japan still recovering war . while mifune my favorite actor--i'm so used him playing samurai -- this role took little getting used -- but his performance quite good-as one would expect ! basically , this story revolves around murakami ( mifune ) who mentored sato ( takashi shimura ) their pursuit missing gun yusa ( isao kimura ) . if nothing else-this film fascinating it historical presentation post war japanany mifune/kurosawa fans should enjoy this movie ! while quite different-a more recent movie same basic premise which very good " missing gun	1

just name alone -- " darkman " -- you know you expect something spectacularly refreshing superhero genre . indeed this . sam raimi taking directing , liam neeson playing lead role , danny elfman scoring music , how could anything go wrong ? well , although it not timeless masterpiece enjoyable eveyone , it one those films well worth cult status it recieved . darkman , we given story love , madness , revenge . scientist peyton westlake devolping breakthrough product : synthetic skin . unfortunately , his lawyer girlfriend -- julie -- exposed some city organized crime , criminals decide bust up westlake some payback . although not quite brutal murphy near-death scene robocop , this one vicious nonetheless . finish job off , they set explosives westlake laboratory where he lies helpless blood-spattered floor . bomb destroys lab alright , but it so powerful westlake body flung building into nearby harbor . he alive , but horrible condition . nearby hospital where his identity unknown , he subjected strange tests . before long , he awakes his bandages . he now terrible flashbacks tortured his hightened emotions , yet barely feels any physical pain . he finds while his body mind complete mess , he quite strong . he escapes hospital sets up murky new lab abandoned building . now story truly begins . using his synthetic skin technology , he able disguise himself virtually anyone ( after all , his severely disfigured facial features might raise few questions folks crossing street ) . but all great things come cost . skin terminates after set amount time , so he only stay public so long . he uses different disguises get his enemies -- well his girlfriend who believes man she loves dead . mental torment julie slipping away him , animalistic anger he must unleash those who've harmed him , he becomes more driven than ever . he tracks down bad guys , giving them dose their own medicine side sweet vengeance . westlake seemingly dead , new breed justice born . before long , this anti-hero realizes his calling , becoming only thing he now destined : darkman . visual style certainly one more interesting aspects darkman . character peyton -- when not disguise -- wears torn bandages over his face , shadowed grim hat . his trench coat mysterious haunting batman cape it flaps breeze . not surprisingly , he also takes some nice one-liners witty tricks . it just me , or this sound like great candidate representative dark superheros ? accompanied finely woven storyline , intense characters , stylish to-the-bone action , sense new form heroism risen which we all relate , this just seems too good pass up ! conclusion , darkman must-rent if not must-own . there seems lack truely stylish original concepts modern cinema . but this succeeds giving us something out ordinary , well worth second look . so see what all whispering witness new face crime-fighting all it terror fun darkman dvd ! because somewhere lost crowd , lurks legend ...	-1

i just received my 2nd copy this video , my vcr ate first one . it great video , parts it little cheesy but it well worth money . there 3 sets 12 reps per exercise , you work shoulders first , starting muscle building exercise , overhead press , then you go front raises , rear delt raises , lateral raises which cory calls toning shaping exercises . she repeats this pattern all muscle groups . then it biceps , first 3 sets normal bicep curls palms out , then 1 arm concentration curls , then hammer curls . you repeat concentration curls 2 more times , but last exercise " tri-set " instead hammer curls , you normal bicep curls bicep curls where you turn you arm top . after biceps she work forearms , forearm curls , wrist curls , reverse wrist curls . i usually skip these insert few chest back exercises which not included this workout . lastly , it triceps , you lying tricep extensions first , then french press , kickbacks last exercise lying close grip bench press which really works your triceps . there also brief warmup cooldown . this workout half hour very thorough muscle groups represented . it move fast pace , reps little fast , which i end up pausing tape often rest or finish set . but really only negative this video . i think cory pleasant instructor , she encouraging , motivating inspiring . i plan using this video twice week addition my other workouts , i am anxious see results . this tape i am sure i get them	-1

remember movies we used see where you went away feeling good what you saw ? this one rare ones they made recently where good guys ( not necessarily wearing white hats ) obvious bad guys ( not necessarily wearing black hats ) always their good guy heels . i left feeling like i could watch one again again while learning little bit american history	1

book better than movie but i like this genre so i gave it try . glad i	-1
not long time i such dislike movie i freeway . i am fan dark comedies so i thought i might check this movie out , it reese witherspoon after all , how bad could it ? well , really bad . first all good note , reese witherspoon good enough movie , although her character isn't all likeable nor you empathize her all much . but reese good job what shes given . my main beef movie i would not call it dark comedy . it more like comedy also wants dark , graphic serious , or dark graphic serious movie wants funny . result it movie doesnt know what it or what it trying . both funny parts serious parts horribly mixed together way it feels like two different movies fighting screen . but hey , if you find shot neck , or stiff lifeless grandmas their throats slit horrified expression their face funny , you just might like this movie	-1

it no accident 100 people took time review this film they took time because it remarkable film . i read quite few reviews here many reviewers touched cancer their personal lives this real gentle story obviously hit home . i always enjoyed emma thompson , loved her remains day but thought she sort measured . she measured this performance well because character but she so real her porformance seemed act courage .... love . i think supporting cast equally strong . it also if they knew what this woman up against , but exception nurse , they not want acknowledge it . i believe this strongest acting performance i ever seen , either stage or film it would ironclad oscar emma thompson medium big screen . finally ms thompson thank you .... some they only manage whisper telling story cancer journey ... it lonely one so aptly captured here	1
my watching this film resulted conversation friend beginning politics spiraling down future our world . premise film disturbing say least . i never true fan charleton heston who my opinion always overacted . however , edward . robinson seemed comfortable playing this character he many different roles he played . his performance truly heartfelt , bringing mind current debate " ending one own life dignity " . i shutter think this life it should though . but robinson character acted decision counterfeit courage ultimate hopelessness accompanied it such way you could very well empathize him . i found other actors somewhat bland . perhaps this acting point time , but some actors make most roles others cannot . story line unique , but script lacking . re-make today steven spielberg might worthwhile seeing . perhaps most striking element i took this film unshakeable chilling unsettling feeling this could very well our world if we not wake up	-1

many reviewers this site said they would want see film focuses hardships extremes immigrants face when coming united states . this , i respond : we've seen hundreds times films . same goes sports films . we've seen movie glory road other films like coach carter , remember titans , hoosiers . they exactly same movie different team . that not say these films aren't decent sports flicks , but film industry needs take step back when making film potential just like every other film its genre . said , exactly what jim sheridan america . story so original acting makes this film glorious triumph . basic story follows family irish immigrants who come america same notion all immigrants : attain american dream . but , they all sooner or later find out , american dream ideology 99.9% people never attain . they trouble finding place stay , end up apartment top run down building many its residents junkies . father johnny ( paddy considine ) struggling actor , who hasn't able get part since death his son frankie , who fell down stairs . mother sarah ( samantha morton ) takes job ice cream parlor earn rent money . oldest daughter christy ( sarah bolger ) probably one smarter people film , sarah bolger gives flawless performance such young girl . she stereotype oldest child who forced grow up too soon . her younger sister ariel ( played sarah bolger younger sister emma ) typical naive little girl who asks fifty questions everything . there some really touching scenes throughout course film , one especially comes mind , where father almost squanders away all family money trying win e.t. doll youngest daughter . there essentially three miracles film , christy , who also narrator , relates these three events set three wishes her brother frankie told her before he died . other great scenes film involve family their relationship man one floors below . when they first arrive house , christy calls him " man who screams . " this man name mateo ( played brilliantly djimon hounsou ) he brilliant artist quite bit emotional problems . he sort figure " morality " film , often giving out endless amounts advice . mateo some sort disease ( we only expect it probably venerial disease ) he gets sick throughout movie . america features one best ensembles i ever seen . every actor perfect every scene . djimon hounsou paddy considine give best performances entire film , jim sheridan wrote directed every gorgeous shot film . while i agree one other reviewer how christy modern camera story set eighties , stupid facts like these should not detract overall message film . overall message , then , not just how immigrants face hardships when they come america ; we already know previous films and/or experiences . film such deeper message , relating not just immigrants , but every person who watches this film . i really not want give message away , but rather i leave it up you go rent or buy this treasure film . this truly one most unforgettable movies i ever seen	1

this what happens when musicians ( least most them ) foray into fields which they should not trod . i great fortune seeing neil diamond " live " shortly after release this movie , like always , he brought down house . he just may one greatest entertainers who ever graced concert stage . singer-songwriter , they don't make ' em better ( remember he honed his craft during golden age late 60 famous brill building new york city where artists such carole king gerry goffin , howard greenfield neil sedaka phil spector ( name just few ) also honing their crafts ) . point mr. diamond second none field rock/pop music day he stops recording entertaining music industry huge loss . this movie - let me just say this : if you take away music sequences , what you left some most horrible stuff ever seen film . this movie so inept even legend like lawrence olivier ( who plays cantor rabinovich , mr. diamond jewish father)stinks . his acting so ' hammy ' it embarrasing . i mean , when he blurts out " i hef no son ! " after realizing his son ( mr. diamond ) sleeping ms. arnaz , i lost it ! lucie arnaz ? oh my !! how " i don't love lucy " ? her acting so amateurish it hard not giggle . this 25th anniversary edition dvd not impressive , either . picture quality poor ( very grainy ) . sound quality very good , though , but dts not appreciated unless you surround sound system accommodate it . my advice wait year or so until this movie comes down $9.99 ( which it ) - even though it some fine extras , it just isn't worth current price . best part film ? " songs life " sequence . beautiful song touching moment this otherwise awful film .	-1

rich , sharply observed social satire proceeds farce tragedy logic integrity . what pleasure . although hal ashby , firs t-t ime director , gordon willis , almost new feature cinematography , deserve highest praise their contributions , i split lion share credit film success bill gunn biting , hilarious script perfectly cast ensemble : beau bridges deceptively nuanced deceptively tough role : elgar enders , unmarked , unformed trust-funder whose scheme renovating tenement house into groovy bachelor pad his trial fire waiting happen . his relentless lessons humility would exhausting if they weren't leavened ( dark ) humor . bridges chewed some scenery , he might garnered oscar . it , he opts bewildered spontaneity sure looks like great acting me . elgar mother joyce ( lee grant ) marge ( pearl bailey ) , tenant elgar building , lengthy , hilarious scene over bottle after bottle fortified wine would comic touchstone if only more people knew movie . observes marge : " you get those hamhocks little better if you take those gloves off , honey . " diana sands fanny copee flat out hilarious when script calls it ( broadly pouting , sussed what light touch elgar : " complaints ? well let see ... roof leaks , oven door broke , toilet runs all day , you're awful cute landlord ...

some re-writes this movie bit hard take . while new opening little hard take , it establish animosity fred lily quite well . it also makes " too darned hot " acceptable . censored lyrics not awful , but they rob porter some his depth . katherine grayson rises occasion quite well . her early scene contrived , but after she firm footing . howard keel wonderful . his acting just tad square , but part format time . ann miller dances up storm . , speaking dancing , what treat carol haney , bob fosse bobby van featured dancers . there isn't really complete rendition " openin ' , show " " bianca " cut entirely . but rest numbers come through great . why 4 stars ? partially because cuts . but also color just little fluctuation times . this isn't restored print , but it isn't bad either . i wish they few more 3-d excerpts special stuff . i also they sent some 3-d glasses .	-1

this honestly one best films i've ever seen my entire life . actually it so good , i am compelled write review ....... something i've never before . i first saw this movie home cable . when i started watching it , i really didn't think much it ( almost expected it mediocre actually ) because i hadn't once heard anything good ( or bad ) . i figured movie profound i found out it should least created some sort stir among someone i knew ... i haven't gone through all reviews , so i don't know if this mentioned prior me mentioning it here , but what really struck chord me(and actually what movie teaches you general ) everything happens your life effects you . it affects how you look things future , it affects your confidence , it affects your attitude , etc . okay , maybe this course given but bigger meaning seeing this movie really opens your eyes seeing what always said really true !! especially when you see it front you like . seeing it your face really goes show how individual attitude towards events their live go either one way or . end , life you live go one way or too ;) basically , everything occurs us ... we control how we react therefore how it affects our future . event not control us ; rather we control how event affects us after it occurs . very quantum theory/kabbalahistic/spiritual i would say . i actually plan watching this movie time time ( " what bleep we know ) order keep this important point forefront my mind :)	1
this great story which wrapped entertaining sub-story well acted all . this julia best work my opinion . albert finney always favorite his role here absolutely charming . i would highly recommend this film	-1

i guess i understand why this movie so savagely criticized during it year release , 1986 . prince still enjoying huge popularity based largely success " purple rain , " both film soundtrack . critics love knock someone off pedestal , which what they prince those days . many claimed movie nothing more than ego trip . they couldn't believe prince nerve fire director then assume role himself . it all way too harsh criticism movie isn't trying anything more than fun romantic comedy . course , poor critical response alone doesn't usually keep public making movie popular . yet " under cherry moon " bomb he box office . probably main reason this movie , although shot color , released black-and-white . some unfathomable reason , general movie-going public more often than not horrified prospect seeing black-and-white movie . now don't get me wrong , i'm not claiming movie released color people would flocked it droves . i'm only saying it would attracted more audience if it color . i acknowledge this movie target audience prince fans . since i am one myself , most my life , i'm not most entirely objective viewer . but i make no apologies my love this movie . it not " guilty pleasure " me , because i proudly hold this one my favorites . i only seen it couple times before dvd release - unfotunately i missed it theaters ( i couldn't get anyone take me , i only 12 none my friends into certainly not my parents - though my dad went me few years later see " grafitti bridge " opening night , but that review ) . but since it dvd release 2004 , this become one my most-watched discs my collection . soundtrack killer , tunes make up one best prince albums ever . there even some great stuff heard movie didn't make album ( some which issued 12 " vinyl ) . plus , i think movie looks great - cinematographer michael ballhaus , who multiple academy award nominations his credit ( dp numerous martin scorsese classics ) . i wonder how movie would feel color , but i think black-and-white right way go . even though movie set then-contemporary times , it feel something ' 30s . there so many classic moments this movie , i won't try list them all . but here few ... christopher tracy ( prince ) giving his " bela lugosi eyes " ... tricky ( jerome benton ) tossing rose petals into tub while christopher takes bath ... christopher freaking out when he sees bats eatery ... " wreka stow " scene ... car race christopher mary sharon ( kristen scott thomas ) . acting , i've heard lot people saying prince performance no good . i don't see much truth claim . after so serious " purple rain , " it nice contrast see him so loose funny this . jerome benton proved he could just fine even without morris day his side ( " purple rain " ) - i'm surprised jerome hasn't much additional acting outside prince movies . obviously kristen scott thomas moved this , her first major role , become oscar-nominated , highly repected leading lady . how dvd presentation ? pretty good , such largely overlooked movie . widescreen transfer 2.0 stereo mix aren't anything phenomenal , but get job nonetheless ; movie looks sounds fine . features , anyone expecting full-blown special edition like 2-disc " purple rain " disappointed . but least it not completely bare-bones release - four music videos included , though unfortunately not presented optimal audio/visual quality ( though they passable , i would've preferred 5.1 mixes ) . highlight live performance " anotherlover " which taken never-released ( least not domestically , not sure if it saw light day anywhere outside u . . ) concert video documenting parade tour . mtv held interesting ( i . . - very weird ) contest determine where " under cherry moon " would it world premiere . ten-thousandth caller mtv hotline would accompany prince premiere , which would held their hometown . mtv ran special covered premiere party - unlike premiere " purple rain " unfortunately this program not found " under cherry moon "' dvd release . lisa barber contest winner , movie indeed premiere her hometown sheridan , wyoming - very unusual place big movie premiere . when asked what he thought town sheridan , prince summed it up single word : " purple .

completey utterly unfunny performances oldman roth . stoppard may brilliant playwright but filmmaker he not , botched great potential his play big screen . we get instead literal utterly uncinematic treatment his much-touted play . watching first fifteen minutes " heads , heads , heads , heads , heads , heads , heads , heads , heads , " colossal torture , like status elipticus . it suited stage maybe but never play well big screen . hopes it might pick up , dashed entire film seem lack any momentum or any type cinematic sensibility whatsoever . classic blunder failing recognize two different mediums . don't take my word it , watch it yourself see .	-1
head honcho [ ... ] i watched well over 200 reality/political films give " why we fight " my highest recommendation . this needs shown prime time television ; if it it would prompt thunderous public outcry badly needed government military reforms . it covers facts many don't know united states , like our penchant endless involvement military actions over seas . film launching pad infamous eisenhower farewell speech which he warns america growing military industrial complex . then , unique compelling style it pinpoints famous people , places moments time candid footage revealing quotes ; it also delves into personal perspectives few ordinary citizens affected sept . 11 resulting occupation iraq . it visits key players government exposes what really drives war machine . it looks military contractors congress their incestuous relationship . it also reveals much too influential role so called think tanks play crafting our national policy . addition soundtrack features some great musical talen t.t he information presented this film something every american should know , but they don't know it most part because people who want those war wheels turning don't want people know what they're doing or why . it seems war minded even believe people not any need know . people beg differ . " why we fight " my personal top ten most important movies list which why it would great gift . informing people kind gift really worth giving .	1
this more realistic then some may admit . you see it all time stories tv , reality twisted point where no one knows what truth really , best example michael jackson . everyone their opinions media great tool use if you power get it your side . what this movie all abou t.t he movie depicts evil intentions 2 immigrants trying become movie stars filming their brutal murders . plot pretty original . i don't think i seen any other movie doing this although i may wrong . it interesting how they using hand held camera video lot scenes help realism . you see behind what shown video he shooting . there quite bit satire irony this movie . almost point overwhelming , but overall i recommend this movie anyone who enjoys good cop movie . i would say this somewhat similar movie paparazzi . storylines bit different , but both show how media changes things around make better story .	-1

sudden death i got this movie because i powers boothe fan , came like film itself . it gotten lot poor reviews , but i disagree i think film lot value mainly because chemistry actors . my favorite parts film those interaction emily joshua foss ( powers boothe character , never mentioned name except ending credits . ) duel wits these two priceless this best character ( emily ) powers boothe ever plays against my opinion . i believe it bears much more resemblance two `under seige ' films than `die hard ' its critics claim . children make this film so unique , they big part why characters where they , when they ; why plot unfolds way it . there violence , probably young children shouldn't watch it , but older mature teens might like it because emily tyler . this film deals , least surface level , many issues such government ineptitude , job-related disability , divorce/marriage/child custody , more . powers boothe , dorian harewood , colm meaney terrific villains . powers boothe especially plays great sociopath , low baseline mood , superficial charm emotional distance --- although more insight than most . whittni wright plays emily mccord , nothing listed imdb her after this film --- pity really i would love see more her . ross malinger plays tyler mccord he terrific , i'm happy see he moved good things since . film scored john debney , it his worse piece work ; subdued especially action film , unoriginal , not outstanding any way although believe me i've sat through far worse . there official soundtrack release but good luck finding decent-priced copy . debney went wonderful job `passion christ ' , whodathunkit he got well-deserved oscar nomination it . my gripes : this tenth anniversary we please widescreen release i think we've waited long enough , collector edition powers boothe commentary would nice but i won't hold my breath ... not lot extras dvd , but few good behind-the-scenes items ... idea noone needed go inside or outside stadium during game , or noone would cellphone or there would media blackout something like this really stretches credulity . it worth $10.00 price just good piece cinema history . i would like see prequel or sequel , say , emily joshua foss meeting up someday but now i guess thanks `deadwood ' powers boothe too famous sequel ( foss seemed quite dead film end , but this hollywood after all ) . finally : recently audio book `sudden death ' released audiotape narrated powers boothe , it terrific worth price if you find it . if you disliked movie you might like this audiobook , if you liked movie you'll love this audiobook	1

" throughout time , whenever tyrants arose preached mixture world domination complete intolerance most other human beings , their first targets often small group people noted giving world monotheism , bible set basic laws followed thousands years . " " [ t]yrannical regimes always seem one common link --- their deep hatred jews .

cary grant ingrid bergman make superb team together , it really shame they only acted together once before , " notorious " ( which i would also recommend anyone see ) . ingrid really perfect this role , considering she just reproofed her scandal overseas married man , she shines , especially those moments rare , open comedy ( moment when she screams " how dare he make love me not married man " then shrieks loudy before stomping off into her bedroom hilarious -- not simply because line bit ironic statement , but because you would not normally expect her something nature . ) cary grant , , course , sublime , his cool , ironic british humor cast-off attitude setting off ingrid smiling charms excellent balance , though most charming aspect grant performances he always manages look buffoon , somehow , yet still completely tangible audience . when we find out he lied his married hurt ingrid , we really should sympathizing ingrid over whole affair . yet when he dancing madly around inrgrid dance later , not knowing she aware his secret , he still grins broadly , if knowledge he , always , entertaining completely charming , we can't help but still adore him tha t.t he only thing i found tad daunting this movie camera work , some longer scenes . beginning , you given full view apartment where two lovers meet , granted , it lovely apartment . but after 5 minutes , you really begin wish camera would zoom , or refocus , or something , least , could hold your interest . looking same people same , pulled-out view longer amount time than comfortable really annoying , which shame , because it detracted severely actors ' performances . i really expected more donen , after seeing his work " singin ' rain . " but , then again , " singin ' rain " gene kelly co-director -- probably accounted difference . other than , it completely enjoyable film watch , i would recomment seeing it . dvd superb transfer , color sound really pop out , really showcases ingrid cary their very best	-1

this middle so-called antonioni trilogy focusing alienation emotional deadness modern life . some also include red desert postlude this trilogy . one constant films monica vitti , looking pretty ever , here la notte wearing wig . la notte least three films , l'avventura big breakthrough l'eclisse outstanding finish it quasi avant-garde moments stunning , hypnotic , modernist ending . while la notte might least trilogy , it doesn't mean film poor any measure . it actually wonderful , rhythmically spacious work fine acting mastroianni moreau . monica vitti adds appropriate allure too . mood pacing this film just something one easily fall love . time flies over nearly two hour running time . it practically no conventional plot speak , just glimpse into marriage over one day primarily one night . we also see typical decadent , emotionally sterile bourgeoisie inhabiting background , environment which our lead actors traverse . i enjoyed this film without doubt every time i saw it , but it won't blow you away like it counterparts l'avventura l'eclisse . dvd decent quality but let wait until people criterion get their hands it	-1
william shakespeare play " much ado nothing " extremely funny piece literature . i thought it very cleverly planned out humorously executed . dogberry his men constantly mixing up words their meanings it gave readers comic relief . deceit mistaken identities added so much humor already capturing story . i believe shakespeare main point writing this play show many times , people get worked up over simple miscommunications . you mishear something wrong , or your anger , you tune out someone before getting all facts . all we would need fix certain problem would going source information , but many times we take easy way out . we jump gun little choose believe whatever told us despite our gut feeling information wrong . example this would when leonato heard hero scandalous evening borachio . despite fact she his daughter he would know her better than anyone , leonato believes lies told hero . leonato , her father one who raised her , should known his daughter well enough know she would not dishonor her fianc� herself . especially night before wedding she waiting . instead choosing believe his daughter , who firmly denies any all sexual relationships , he joins claudio , don john , don pedro disgracing her . one lesson learned " much ado nothing " never should people automatically assume something correct . we should " take everything grain salt " - test everything . people world these days so willing lie us readily so without second thought . many times people lied without even knowing someone so . true , sometimes lying deceit all good fun , but it still possibility hurting someone . even innocent lying its consequences . benedick beatrice both believed almost immediately what they overheard their friends saying garden correct completely true . neither person decided test what they heard . see if what said true . because both not check see if information they heard correct , everything worked out . both assumed what they heard true acted it . there no visible consequences . what mess you would if benedick decided what he overheard could not possibly true . beatrice would made fool out herself while thinking benedick felt same way . same could said other way around . i would recommend this play other readers . if people don't like read , then i would not tell others it . combination not liking read difficulty understanding old english would not make very fun pleasurable read . many would miss out humor cleverness shakespeare brilliantly displayed his audience . readers other hand would most likely like this play . humor lightheartedness makes it enjoyable play . i found myself constantly wanting know what would happen next how it would end- how shakespeare would wrap it up . happy ending also nice touch . yes , old english adds challenge reading . sometimes hard understand language makes you stop think what shakespeare trying say ultimately makes you stop realize what he truly trying communicate his audience .	-1

i can't add anything this film wasn't already said more in-depth reviews , but i say movie , it enormous fun . kurt russell , who child star disney , perfect this role snake plissken i can't imagine many other actors who would or could play this role way he . he both very convincing , yet he also appears know this film just pure fun too . john carpenter career very up down . one film dead perfect only followed complete flop . great thing him when he " " director , writer , musician , he very . some other classics his you might want check out original " fog " " thing " ( again terrific performance kurt russell storyline much closer novel ) . both truly creepy films excellent musical scores . they both still stand up well although both relatively poorly box office their time . they later became cult classics vhs dvd . fyi : carpenter also few wonderful non-horror films worth seeing . he directed " music heart " which really earned him much deserved recognition oscar nomination his lead actress , meryl streep . look surprisingly pleasing performance gloria estafan it well . it great story trying teach music inner city elementary kids . he also directed original " assault precinct 13 " suspenseful well-executed cop film , wonderful sci-fi film called " starman " which kind et adults . jeff bridges ' performance flawless earned him oscar nomination	-1

i watched this film part my history studies post-war europe before everyone docks me because i gave it two stars , hear me out . i'm no godard fan so i may not able appreciate this film fan new wave might . i'm just your regular joe movie-watcher . masculin feminin paul , 21-year-old french citizen just retired his 16 months army . paul believer marxism throughout film promotes worker party while denouncing us involvement vietnam , du gaulle government most forms westernism such condoms , psychadelic rock ( many songs masculin feminin style similar kinks , jefferson airplane etc ) even coca-cola ... yet paul often seen playing pinball mini-bowling game you see arcade . paul seems pro-french identity kind guy he often eats cheese drinks wine . preserver romanticized french culture . however , paul friends interviewees ( paul works ifop , major french polling agency time ) seem not care change towards quasi-american consumer state . paul girlfriend madelein rising pop-singer , her room mates materialistic consumers , one who owns car , people paul interviews seem only care themselves . this very accurate terms how ' baby-boom ' generation french youth began rebel against traditionalist governments europe . like teens 1950s us , teens began form their own demographic . however , this where my fascination ends . godard apparently never heard music editing film editing . many parts movie , godard fixed camera one person face portrait shot kept it there minutes time even though scene 15-minute back forth conversation . volume music went very high very low instantly many parts during dialogue , making it very annoying if almost distracting audience . few parts when paul whistling , recording whistling obviously overloaded sound buffer i heard static speakers . i thought this volume problem my end so i turned it down , nope ... it sound editing . this just poor recording editing . furthermore , sound editors this fascination using same gun-noise sound ( which sounded more like cartoon car noise ) over over over again very unlikely times . other times , ambiant noises would drown out dialogue such vehicles outside cafe or even drinking noises . sometimes sound didn't kick up five seconds into scene . because this french new wave film , i won't attack how there virtually no plot random scenes just plain silly . however , i strongly recomend not getting this film if you're just general audience not new wave fan . otherwise , you might like this new wave classic but i'm no expert subject . i just extremely disapointed lazy filming , recording editing .	-1
" sunday , bloody sunday " one most acclaimed adult dramas early 70s , one first major films address gay relationships . murray head stars young hippie simultaneous relationships physician peter finch businesswoman glenda jackson . finch jackson know each other , they even share some mutual acquaintances . needless say , even though finch jackson completely enamored young man , they're also both frustrated his inability give more or commit himself . film explores these relationships over tumultuous week . film directed john schlesinger his follow-up oscar-winning " midnight cowboy . " it solid drama obvious interest its early , relatively non-judgmental depiction gay relationship . note , relationships handled sensitivity but also interesting complex . penelope gilliatt-penned script ( her only film ) top-notch received numerous awards ( national society film critics , writers guild america ) well oscar nomination . finch jackson turn very good performances , which rewarded oscar nominations . although murray head performance often criticized bland , i think his cipher-like qualities works well here ; you're not supposed fully understand exactly what jackson or finch see him . although it reflective its era , film holds up fairly well . overall , " sunday , bloody sunday " interesting exploration adult relationships - straight or gay .	-1

well ... i dunno if you're fan carpenter films or not , but every fan his work tell you his movies age like fine wine . if you like slam-bang action mixed sci-fi horror , i recommend this movie . i'm not saying it best movie ever committed film , but i say i enjoyed it quite bit . it takes while really get moving , i don't mean action-wise ... happens pretty quick ... what i mean conceptually , story didn't really gel me until half-way through , but time before spent character development , so i can't completely shame it there . plot fairly simple ... year 2176 earth teraformed mars colonization ore processing . they haven't worked out all kinks really just kinda stumbling around harsh , alien environment . when mining crew stumbles upon ancient martian artifact , they release disembodied essences former martians who possess bodies anyone they come contact . humans who possessed martians become savage , sado-masochistic beasts who mutilate their flesh kill anyone they come contact . enter into this madness crew mars police officers who unknowingly arriving infected mining town escort prisoner jail penal facility . poop hits fan , police forge uneasy alliance criminals jail against martians . there some pretty good stuff movie : it pretty darn violent ... if you like frequent beheadings belimbings ( i made word up !!! ) , you'd prolly dig this one . makeup effects incredible ... when i say these people mutilate themselves i really mean it ... we're talking screws face , barbed wire cutting into flesh , gashed open mouths , filed teeth ... these things scary lookin ! there one really cool scene shows martians ' memory their former selves mars ages past . i really wanted see more ... here hoping buzz slither its alien flashback scene lives up hype . then there concept itself : enemy can't killed . you kill one them they hop your body continue fight . it kinda staggering . also , this movie felt like it made 80 ... i dunno what it seemed way , special effects up par time it made , but it just flavor . it kinda like carpenter film , assault precinct 13 . wow ... carpenter made " zombie movie " without zombies !!! what didn't work : two words : ice cube . who their right mind ever thought this jackass good actor ? oh ok ... he funny friday ... but that it ! just stop now ... make him go back rapper ... yesterday . ugh . my opinion he stunk up movie royally . i could deal everyone else movie , but he just ... just ... eeeugh . jeez . if they wanted tough rapper guy i'd happier coolio ... least he fun hair ! thing kinda stunk wish my mind it bit more violent gory . i mean ... it ok ... ok , i mean really good ... but i dunno ... i expected lotta violence gore . i think my unrated horror movie collection me spoiled	-1

let me start saying i may need quit listening opinions some my co-workers regards movies watch , least when it comes horror genre . numerous people where i work told me this movie , " descent " absolutely one best horror movies ever made . their defense , my co-workers weren't only people this opinion , many critics other moviegoers said same thing . well , apparently hype built up me regarding this movie more than film could live up , because i sorely disappointed , but more later , now i give you my plot summary last year supposed horror spectacular , " descent "" descent " begins young woman vacation her family friends , when her husband her daughter suffer tragic accident . one year later prodding those same friends , she accompanies them spelunking adventure , problem none her friends ever this cave , fact it newly discovered cave no one explored yet . so they attempt explore unexplored these brave young women become trapped cave . making matters worse , this cave not like any ordinary cave , this one inhabited bloodthirsty mutant creatures who just found their next meal . beginning watching this movie i really interested developing story , shocking opener really caught my attention , giving me sense this movie going different than most horror movies actually giving you unexpected . however , once story gets part where girls inside cave , which actually where majority film takes place , things begin go awry picture . first , filmmakers doing good job using claustrophobic atmosphere , giving audience sense entrapment anxiety which served heighten suspense regarding possibility impending doom . then filmmakers introduce fact i felt completely derailed movie , this cave no one , these girls hardly professional . so , who their right mind would put all their friends lives possible jeopardy just first explore newly discovered cave . it absolutely stupid , especially when placed viewed context character interaction companionship each other , none these girls would this each other . after this occurs mutants show up , plot point i hoping would help put movie back right direction ; however , this where movie begins unwind even faster , because it now just one gory scene after , movie nothing more than your average monster movie . decision i somewhat agreed , yet still didn't agree decision keep mutants origins unknown . one hand this served add mystery why they attacking these girls , you just assume they're cannibalistic , but other it would nice know how they got there . even though " descent " hyped one best horror movies recent time , both my friends many critics moviegoers , me it merely average addition genre already full mediocrity .

sucess popularity bloodsport makes this movie one van damme very best ever . bloodsport also marks van damme first role main character movie . ( previous film he role " no retreat no surrender " which he played villain but much smaller role ) . bloodsport went make 3 more sequals , however without van damme . this first installment overall best , " true classic " , althouh i find certain elements more appealing some sequals . story bloodsport fairly original its time acting not too bad , even though half people this movie seem barely speak english well ( van damme included ) . now when i say not too bad , i'm coming fact i'm pretty hardcore cheesy martial art movies - most baaaaaaaaad acting . great thing story it based true events frank dux ( played van damme ) , who first westerner ever win kumite hold several records . soudtrack this movie , i hate admit 80 film , very nice . i enjoy both original music composed paul hertzog , some songs , survivor i think ( same group who performed eye tiger rocky iii ) . i even enojyed opening credits scene - it sets tone movie wonderfully . real meat potatoes bloodsport , course tournament . there plenty fights , many very short , some don't look very realistic . not many fancy moves , but its always treat see bolo yeung villain , " chong li " , platform . final fight dux chong li lasts 7 minutes , but lot it slow motion some those " now somewhat cheesy flashbacks " early training scenes . end fight showcases van damme leaping spinning split kicks quickly became his signature move seen more his following films including kickboxer double impact . if you wanna see fight van damme bolo yeung , sure check out double impact .	1

yes , this film feels like diatribe . it probably less factual than film version john dillinger exploits director john milius made seventies . so why i recommend this film over milius ' more polished account ? well , this film campy , over-the-top way just so entertaining . secondly , lawrence tierney title role such magnetic screen presence . his tough ferocity keeps film campier elements check grounds it some semblance reality . there also good supporting cast here gangster veterans marc lawrence elisha cook jr.

film days heaven isn't just three migrant workers lonely farmer . there lot deeper meanings involved film . director paid special attention everything film . camera didn't just capture birds nothing . there lot transcendentalist anti-transcendentalist views . majority film made transcendentalist views . example , entire film shot outside showing how beautiful nature . including birds run free field humans . it also always shot dusk or dawn , showing off beautiful sunset . transcendentalist idealistic . therefore , linda transcendentalist . she always loved playing fields always something look forward . linda seemed see good people saw things nature people wouldn't even think . example , when abby , bill , linda escaping river away authorities she saw many beautiful places way related each one something she knew , like shadows rock where people dancing . film also many anti-transcendentalist views . one thing when locus came over took farm . this anti-transcendentalist because nature not work workers or farmers favor . there really no way controlling locus they made farmer go crazy . he already upset seeing abby bill , but decided he going kill bill over it . thing belief good evil . farmer good , but turns evil wanting kill bill after seeing him abby together . example this when bill good man then all sudden he kills man one day steel factory . he then chance start over farm become good , but ends up killing farmer self defense , becoming evil again . bill abby both show signs individuality . they both show this which they both selfish . abby decides marry farmer because once he dies she inherit his fortune she , bill , linda live happily ever after . farmer suppose die few months , but ended up not dying all murdered bill . this could god venting towards bill . it very selfish wrong use farmer his money god got back him not farmer die like he suppose . there many ways person could interpret days heaven . person could think god camera that why some things shot circles all nature . or person could just think it coincidence director not mean anything it . whichever way person decides interpret film , person find film meaningful .	1

ok , check it out , there two jack blacks . one guy tenacious , you see him all time . he funny childish insane . then there other jack black . he evil creature who pervades films like shallow hal king kong , whose only humorous lines ones funny accident . well , long you aren't fat don't feel patronized gweneth presuming know what it like not desired all her life ( ha ) , then all means suspend all disbelief , logic , brain power watch this dumb movie . gweneth fat suit actually pretty convincing , although most movie she played actual fat chick ... who way should just left , without whole " ha ha dude thinks she skinny " nonsense . obviously , film dude trying cope dating big girl would lot more resonance if : ) he weren't brainwashedb ) his fat girlfriend wasn't replaced twiggy blond chick ) movie didn't throw ridiculous concepts your way ( like guy could sex 300 lb woman without realizing it)d ) tony robbins no way involved whatsoeveri knew i slumming it when i saw this movie . but i'm not sure what message this film . jack black character decent , considerate , great kids perfect every way . oh , except he really shallow no dicernable reason , other than his dad dying words him go out chase tail . weird part hal not bad person . movie beats you over head showing you he nicest guy face earth , so you can't really laugh him looking like idiot . rosemary so fat she superpowers . her butt actually creates typhoons ( i wonder if military applications ? ) . suddenly , hal mistakes ugly pimply girls supermodels evil skanks old shrews . tony robbins brainwashed him , fiend ! when hal finally realizes this he decides ( ooh big spoiler ) love rosemary anyway , learns valuble lesson . way there ton cliches like people thinking he dating rosemary just because her dad happens his boss , sexy neighbor his building who starts get hots him when she sees how non-judgemental he dating fat girl (' cause would make any woman melt ) . course there requisite best friend , played jason alexander , who repulsed fat people plots get hal dump her . then again , friend complete troll , so i don't know why hal would want him around . insult us further , they force some burned kids us hospital strike serious note how true beauty inside . too ... many ... public ... service ... messages ! pick ... one ..!! but brain-dead writing aside , paltrow really sells her performance when they actually show her fat suit ( despite gweneth postering when this film first released ) . regardless its clumsy benevolence , i rate this romantic comedy . , i give it rating totally unremarkable . nice gesture , farelly brothers . not bothered	-1
l'argent not only last film robert bresson , it also one his greatest achievements . especially when compared some his efforts 70 ( like ' lancelot lake ) this film shows return genius one associates director ' diary country priest ' , ' man escaped ' , ' au hazard balthazar ' , etc . film brilliantly illustrates how one negative event leads succession other events , gradually leading greatest human folly . this pescimistic look human nature , while it turns some people off , shows realistic yet stylized view life - it cycle karma ( one could say ) . bresson emphasizes smallest details his films - turns us very essence experience	1

inspiring italian movie describes simple , yet profound way basic things life such love , friendship , poetry , magnifisent , unique mediterranean landscape . making this movie massimo troisi dream upon realizing this dream he died just few hours later ; i am sure sence accomplishment satisfaction . humor movie very sublte . right beginning movie massimo troisi , man few words , monologue . this because he talks his alergy sea water his father , who man no words . he lives island where 99% population fishermen he allergic sea water , this funny . one best momments movie when philippe noiret asks massimo troisi describe his island he says : " beatrice russo " , girl he love . but end movie he records what his island : sound waves shore , cry his baby , sound birds , sound wind through bushes . this really what life these things unfortunately escape our notice . resemblence philippe noiret pablo neruda incredible . extras dvd great they really gave me desire visit chile course they made me nostalgic unique mediterranean region . not expect see any special effects movie . but look simple things life make you rich make you become poet . after reading some reviews give only one star this movie i am afraid recommend it case it ends up wrong people . i would recommend it people enjoyed " la vita bella " , " big blue " " cinema il paradiso " ( see my reviews these movies well ) .	1

this film literally sees little wrong child molesting . no , i'm not even slightly exaggerating . it also bizarre i am sole reviewer point this out . janey only 13 year old teenager . she indeed rather mature her age . nonetheless , janey too young legally allow fully grown man sex her . such adult male ( or female ) clearly breaking law . janey daughter woman who selfish undisciplined . father played fool . this dysfunctional family seems doomed . janey younger brother needs her love protection . she capable handling this responsibility ? matters finally get out control ? " rain " morally bankrupt . story line takes place new zealand . perhaps people associated american tv program " catch predator " " perverted justice " should visit this country . david thomsonflares into darknes	-1

that saying alot since he so many great movies . but this one it all . gloved killer , some brutal killings(not like what would come later ) , some very funny scenes interesting characters really surprised me . few words rating though : when bird originally released america back 1970 it edited form . now one must also keep mind there no pg-13 rating back then , it , pg , , x(now nc-17 ) . so this movie got pg it cut form . today it would probably get pg-13 rating . dvd release shown here pg cut film but this company also released uncut version little more violence it some nudity may or may not cut version , i can't remember . anyway , it appears now blue underground , their searches find decent copy this film transfer their dvd release , found very original cut this film including even more violence no one seen very long time . comes out i believe october two disc special edition filled features	1

ralph bakshi part sacred cult filmmakers who driven their passion their art . his films aggressive , non-passive every sense term determined inspire thought reaction . see his films witness images so powerful they seem break through screen enter you . bakshi , working-class hero , always determined let it known he made films very audience . two-fisted filmmaker whose films full kind grunge-poetry , ' graffiti animation ' , bakshi called it . ' heavy traffic ' , his raw-edged , moving , autobiographical film , goes beyond limits art , limits cinema , become part you , reaction audience gives this kind film basic part film itself . bakshi film flies like bukowski poem , some sequences so powerfully unsettling one forgets everything else . his sad , stark images city destroyed something or , recalls marco ferreri haunting images dead ape beach his masterpiece ' bye bye monkey ' .

i'm not sure what this movie . it all hollywood cliches such nude shower scene , older astronaut dies tragically , one astronaut turns other murders him , there man eating bugs , murderous robot , star trek style fight scene where he outsmarts robot his ingenuity . its ironic guy saved russian spacecraft since american movies always make fun russians even though they've put more astronauts space than we ever able . breathable air thing odd . all equipment they forgot check air mars when they landed ? could saved them lot trouble if they stuck post-landing checklist . i thought " mission mars " much better , indicating how bad this movie . mission mars hokey but least it interesting plot	-1
this movie all entertaining . combination " die hard " typical martial arts flick works many levels , but production values hong kong`s , don`t miss point . fans jet li welcome , but action fans careful . here we find scale helicopters burst flames , exploding building models , chopped off dummies , you name it . characters extreme their own context : jet li former military now becomed bodygard stunt actor , loyal , gentleman , honorable , deadly , you know , portrait typical good guy . bad guys also extremely violent cool looking . he doesn't fight or kick much this film , but he shoots lot , dodging bullets dozen bad guys machine guns no scratch all , his revolver shoots 30 bullets without reloading , he drives car inside hall uses elevator , happens right size ... well , you right mood watch this film without laughing many cartoonish production mistakes . but if you into hong kong low production values action films , you really enjoy one best ones 90`s . way , this dvd edition sucks . english dubbed , subtitles , poor sound no extras , not even filmography	-1

i consider plot , actors , acting , special effects believability all top-notch grade a1 quality . i never tire watching this movie whenever i flip through channels see it -- i stop watch it . cast hot , inuendoes cool , it range emotions -- years , i thought games came after movie surpised find out there games same name . there good mix seasoned , experienced actors medium-to-new ones , general tone serious , believable , punctuated joy sadness suspense . it hard not cry during couple parts , when someone dies , or rejected because their religion , even though they try hide it , i even seen it soooo many times , still shed tear ( when someone nice gets picked movie ) . loyalty sacrifice evident film uplifting inspiring . it one you get mad or frustrating if u miss beginning , not because it hard catch-up or follow , because it pretty easy follow , but beacause if you mis beginning then you know missed some good opening scenes few bits detail only add beauty this tapestry . this ultimate classic good one , far outshines starship troopers any day week . i think they should made sequal ( they probably should advertise those games ; i found all but one or 2 them sale try out- awesome ; can't wait ) . definitely movie you might want watch every few months , like breakfast club or one star wars movies , or star trek . beautifully conceived executed . this movie makes you feel like you there , part great , desperate mission save earth . suspenseful parts , ending too . excellent script , acting , emotions . i can't believe someone would not like it	1

i really like william holden early 50's: he fresh , full energy , upbeat , physical - when he put glasses , he born yesterday , intellectual vulnerable . he perfect leading man , very enjoyable watch this film . but real star born yesterday judy holliday , who won oscar her performance . her character , billie , goes through greatest change our story , shows off her incredible range . she starts out dumb-blonde squeeze big-shot con man , harry , played wonderfully broderick crawford , who made his millions junk business , now come washington " buy " senator order help his business . when he drops billie into her first washington social engagement , he realizes he going problems her : she " just ain't couth .

i compelled write this review after i read two reviews written salvadorean perspective claiming this movie essentially complete fiction . although , i haven't seen this movie several years i remember it griping shocking account events largely forgotten ( or even noticed back then ) average americans . i wonder if two salvadorean reviewers ever met or talked boyle , journalist whose experience movie based , or if they ever same places boyle during time . moreover , one key events depicted movie actually happen : december 2 , 1980 four american nuns who there giving aid relief poor people country brutally raped murdered group el salvador national guardsmen . like anything we view or read , stone movies should seen critical eye . course his movie not " ultimate truth " what happened 80 el salvador it should not viewed way . instead , it should viewed what it : one man perspective ( boyle ) what he witnessed while he there . how person perspective or account deepen our understanding history ? what questions it raise ? whose interests perspective ( or other perspectives ) serve ? whether this movie " accurate " depiction not important fact this movie get us thinking talking important issues surrounding justice , freedom , equality role our government overtly covertly plays international conflicts where those values stake	-1

this film powerful effect me . 95% people i know don't read books . i met millionaire not long ago , who boasted me he never read book his life . lady di reported never read anything --- except perhaps fashion mags . my children hardly read , their husbands wives certainly don't . my ex-wife never read anything . her father thought ulysses dirty book . i stopped watching television 1980 , i own 10,000 books --- but not fahrenheit 451 , which i'd read 45 years ago . this long enough me not compare film bradbury text , but message came through movie medium loud clear , very solid punch plexus . manner which it written , played directed , added its impact . this world sleep-walkers perfectly matched what already all around us . style strange , but gradually you realise this strangeness actually what now completely normal . people live work like automated morons . they can't think themselves , their critical faculties almost totally atrophied . they can't conduct stimulating conversation any kind : fact , present them idea , or attempt initiate discussion , they'll often become angry . some several low end reviews this site illustrate precisely what film depicts . ludicrous suggestions : remake it mad mel gibson . infantile spielberg direct it . bulk it out computerised sfx . these ghastly proposals precisely reflect mentality sub-humans which film targets , many them seem unable understand their own language , let alone write it , or spell it . this memorable film , those whose memories still function . unlike captain firemen	1

" house strangers " classic film noir vaults 20th century fox one their very best . under guiding hand brilliant director joseph . mankiewicz film emerged 1949 , remains this day , remarkable piece cinema thanks , no small measure , excellent screenplay philip yordan , low key black white cinematography milton krasner atmospheric score russian composer daniele amfitheatrof . stellar cast headed great edward . robinson . fresh his marvellous johnny rocco houston " key largo " , robinson plays gino monetti , italian immigrant who runs bank he founded new york lower east side . he runs it iron fist he his family four sons who work him , three whom resentful towards their father because poor wages they recieve domineering way he treats them . robinson gino monetti deftly crafted skillful piece acting . just right italian accent actor demonstrates once again he one finest players american cinema . watching his performance here one can't help but think what fine corleone he would made he around(he died 1972 year " godfather " released)richard conte , one his best parts , plays loyal son max monetti his trademark serious look his best oppressed hero style . impressive luther adler oldest wickedest son who what he best - ruthlessness . other two wayward siblings played paul valentine efrem zimbalist jr. romantic interest supplied ever lovely vivacious susan hayward whose star , this time , start its rise . but it robinson movie moment he comes into it . you simply cannot take your eyes off him ! five years later studio re-fashioned yordan screenplay turned it into splendid western called " broken lance " spencer tracy . this fact strangely omitted dvd fact sheet ! curious footnote : end picture we don't hear amfitheatrof finale music . what we get instead end title alfred newman score " razor edge " . why how this should anybody guess ! however , it fine movie fine package which commentary , trailer good behind scenes still gallery . also here , you won't believe , trailer elusive " boomerang " (1947 ) which strangely even weirdly disappeared any listing . classic line " house strangers " - when one robinson errant sons declines help him during his trial - ' i'm sorry pop , i don't want stick my neck out ' which robinson retorts ' why ? what so good your neck '	-1
koreans honor their greatest military hero this epic drama which takes place late 1500s . career tactics this admiral still studied u.s. naval academy , doubtless those other nations . screenplay based couple novels , so there some fiction , but life yi soon shin well documented , so there plenty fact supporting story . if you not familiar korean drama , it good keep mind this not hollywood product , but they very well special effects such considering non-hollywood budgets involved , it easy see past all enjoy tale told . it long series , but presents epic power , depth dimension well worth watching it unfold through each every episode . it would great also see kbs make other dramas available viewing through amazon , such " seoul 1945 " .	1
this challenging piece cinema one greatest filmmakers working today , catherine breillat . fact , it rather redundant call her work challenging because once name breillat mentioned , you automatically assume it challenging . many american critics uncomfortable her work because , methinks , american critics uncomfortable sex . if this film made 1970 , it would gotten more respect . while american general public would stay away film like this regardless critical opinion , i get annoyed when critics dismiss her work pretentious porn . quite often , reviews her work ( this film anatomy hell particular ) usually hatchet jobs her , not films itself . reviewers usually mention certain scenes , but never mention context or their relationship whole film . they don't seem really interested understanding her work . they seem uncomfortable her , essentially their reviews reduced name calling bewilderment . she really gets heart soul relationships . insight she rare any age . this film numerous censorship problems worldwide ( including outright ban australia ) , which me absurd . i seen many breillat films , i recommend seeing them all . this one actually among her more accesible ones , yet , it still make some people scream balk its truthfulness , which scares people more than its explicitness .	1
i watch this video one i own called " mr. robinson crusoe " starring douglas fairbanks because i usually fall asleep almost once , but film enters my brain dreams . i finally saw parts both movies while awake it so strange . " bird paradise " character says nature strongest thing there here more than 80 years later , never more true . if we could sacrifice few people tsunamis earthquakes hurricanes , i lot people i would willingly sacrifice , some even people power or world leaders , world would better place . relationship joel mccrae dolores del rio so magical you even ' forgive ' movie sacrifice dolores del rio volcane because love they , short it . i guess it really better loved well than not all .	1
far films go ... almost best movie i ever seen ... well , i am 18 , but i suspect it doesn't get any better than this . script , filming , acting etc . good ; but what makes movie content . only movie i seen manages portray romantic/married love without maudlin or stupid . relationship more his wife blows me away , especially last scene when he talking custard she screaming he calls her lion . it not typical movie characterization/etc . i couldn't believe it movie . also , it raises issue ' one conscience ' whole issue right/wrong compromise or not compromise . movie isn't pat idealistic ' sass king your thing , brave ' . rather , all manners men shown contrast ; driveling rich fiery nonconformist roper , all manners men . thomas more doesn't fit either catagory . he politician : not scottish covenanter . neither moral " just follow your conscience defy authority " ... beginning movie we see thomas more speak disparagingly martin luther favor ' corrupt ' authorities roman catholic church . thomas more , his principles , ' forced ' king henry execute him ... instead just assenting oath muttering through his teeth like everyone else . movie same . it doesn't just let us conclude ' it right everyone follow their consciences ' . thomas more not simply champion " freedom conscience " . like henry viii we ' forced ' make our own decision thomas more ... he some unbending , deaf rationalizations , uncompromising death fanatic ; par jihadists who detonate israel ? or there really truth out there , while all us busy swearing " succession oath " our times , shaking our heads misguided fanatics ... live successfuly , die our beds ? it makes me wonder	1

original iron chef great thing behold , both because competition intertwining japanese culture . original " iron chef " two chefs - usually japanese - would compete using main ingredient specified eccentric gourmet authority chairman kaga . kaga warlord-like character specially constructed cooking arena called " kitchen stadium " his castle where visiting chefs would compete against his gourmet academy , led his several master iron chefs . chairman kaga himself showpiece flamboyant , heavily decorated coats jackets . show campy charm evoked memories english-dubbed kung fu movies 1970s . iron chef usa entirely too .... american . typical us-versus-them fashion ( note- everyone who not " me " " them " ) competitors stoop anything . judges seem more like competitors " hollywood squares " game show yesteryear than dignified characters original iron chef . japanese judges would anything keep competitors losing face original , it quite comical see them wrinkle up their faces try find something complement dishes they obviously found hard swallow . making fun dishes seems point judges u.s. version . short , skip this entry hold out original " iron chef " come out dvd some day . it truly unique fun show	-1

this derek jarman debut films ( technically , he co-directed paul humfress , but humfress really just there keep things going if jarman screwed up ... luckily , he didn't ) . it actually jarman most homoerotic movie . dialogue latin ( first ... eat your heart out , passion christ fans ) , it street latin , not proper latin . jarman very specific speech because these soldiers ruffians ; they wouldn't speaking queen latin , so speak . many found famous painting st. sebastiane ( which jarman recreates end film ) very homoerotic , so jarman indulges quite freely erotic aspects story . film mythic sheen it , it film you never forget . opening scene roman orgy very memorable . jarman started out ken russell production designer , this orgy scene seems homage him . brian eno music really gives film world feel . not easily offended . there massive amounts male nudity here , but it shown natural , which it . essential viewing jarman fans ( or which i include myself ) .	-1

after growing up leslie ann warren version adoring it child ( singing wrong words all songs all year long until i learned some more next year it appeared tv ) , i hoping magical remake . i little dissappointed how over-produced this version - especially dance number when jason alexander telling town ball . i loved bernadette peters - especially song " falling love love " which gives some interesting backstory her character . whitney houston definitely overdoing it ... someone should reminded her this cinderella story . prince terrific his parents - well , they hoot ! brandy looks pretty sings well , but didn't really come off all sweet or real . many costumes - while gorgeous extremely elaborate - not terribly flattering , especially whoopi whitney which distraction . personally , i'll take leslie ann warren simple flowing fur trimmed ball gown over sparkly brandy version any day . racial diversity didn't bother me all . people making big deal their own issues not belong fairy-tale movie review . many scenes just little too long , few much too long . it would better movie if they tightened it up bit .	-1
truffaut second film after 400 blows , it finds him experimenting all over place . charles aznavour plays charlie kohler , once very prominent concert pianist , but now playing honky-tonk back alley joint . once he thought only his great career , but process lost his wife suicide ( she slept his promoter help advance his career he could never forgive her ); now he wants only obscurity . but he inadvertently gets mixed up couple thugs who after his two brothers , he falls love woman ( marie dubois ) . thugs end up kidnapping aznavour dubois , although two lovers made plans aznavour would pursue his " career " again , fate seems against them : she killed shoot-out end . truffaut said this movie " grab bag . " it seem everything it but kitchen sink : it rooted " " hollywood gangster movies , wonderful mixture comedy tragedy , almost no storyline . fact , truffaut throws storyline wind : it picture touches , quick , fleeting moments , rather than narrative continuity . its juxtapositions wonderful : fame obsurity , love hate , gangsters sense humor , lots action desire go nothing . it great movie - funny sad - one filled many memorable moments . definitely worth watch	1

i think when many say they knew after 15 minutes who killer , they're actually saying they guessed who killer just happened right . think this moment : what motive ? something i never figured out . killer didn't motive . that what threw me off . but i guess some would say crazed killer doesn't need motive . but come ! even deranged killer 7even reason killing . even norman bates reason killing . it could reason explained but i just missed it because movie so terrible . i don't know . i really don't want watch whole movie again figure it out . i know if you lot high profile actors secondary roles , one them killer sure ; but you're thrown off fact you andy garcia , d.w. moffett , sam . jackson . so all 3 fair game	-1

i like all john boorman movies . he way capturing essence time place ; even when it not one we familiar . he very well zardoz . plot zardoz fairly simple but few niches way . it goes like this : man strives create utopia his privileged society . he thinks he succeeded . alas , best-laid plans men , etc . utopia not turn out expected things going awry privileged class . course there outsiders -- " brutals " -- which not so privileged . it through outsider ( sean connery/zed ) few privileged attempt rectify their situation allowing him inside vortex ( where privileged live ) . , course , simplistic view plot . way , it not unlike super-power ( u.s. ? ) keeping brutals ( terrorists ? ) bay . but there always those not satisfied status quo . there more going this movie than meets eye it difficult keep track some niches . one must put together pieces order follow what happening any particular time well why it happening . one things i liked movie : sum parts greater than ending . you may watch movie more than once put parts together . some reviewers criticized cheesy special effects . well , this not star wars or matrix . it not even technically advanced world . not way we know it . it different type technology different culture . that thing i liked it . it new different kind world . zed brought distress disturbance into this world . that what made movie exciting me : zed insurgence into vortex adventure mind well body . he upset changed world privileged he himself changed his interactions them . so end expected , yet , it not .	-1
this movie all entertaining . combination " die hard " typical martial arts flick works many levels , but production values hong kong`s , don`t miss point . fans jet li welcome , but action fans careful . here we find scale helicopters burst flames , exploding building models , chopped off dummies , you name it . characters extreme their own context : jet li former military now becomed bodygard stunt actor , loyal , gentleman , honorable , deadly , you know , portrait typical good guy . bad guys also extremely violent cool looking . he doesn't fight or kick much this film , but he shoots lot , dodging bullets dozen bad guys machine guns no scratch all , his revolver shoots 30 bullets without reloading , he drives car inside hall uses elevator , happens right size ... well , you right mood watch this film without laughing many cartoonish production mistakes . but if you into hong kong low production values action films , you really enjoy one best ones 90`s . way , this dvd edition sucks . english dubbed , subtitles , poor sound no extras , not even filmography	-1
this film aptly compared berlin : symphony city , but what interested me most it its portrayal cinema universally accessible art form . while there propagandistic moments -- celebrating efficiency lifestyle soviet working class -- it easily transcends whatever purpose authorities ( or vertov himself ) may allowing vertov film it . you remember this film composed audience may seen films but certainly not film literate -- not many us now -- which say they not likely aware process making films , or reflected much nature film . what so exciting this film it presents both portrait city , life its inhabitants , well documentary ( self-reflexive ) study art filmmaking . there much learn this film different ways thinking film , i often show it my film classes this purpose . there idea film recorder objective fact , potentially present anywhere though always located somewhere , suggested images filmmaker kind eye towering over city , seeing both whole parts . there also idea film highly subjective , suggested images show personal reaction filmmaker , images show personal dangers faced " man movie camera " his effort capture difficult shots . we see , these shots , film not simply passive recorder events unfold independently filmmaker but also involved creation these events . we see editor , editing very footage we just seen filmmaker recording . we see filmmaker kind poet , making use visual metaphors suggest ideas : train relay suggests intercutting various scenes editor , window eye suggest camera . we also see capacity filmmaker manipulate create new reality , when we observe animation ( camera itself , seemingly taking life its own without cameraman ) , but we also see how this animation achieved . we even shown audience itself , implication included very picture we watching . some these metaphors ideas may seem heavy handed today , but only my description them . when you actually watch them they fascinate . editing also superb this film -- always appropriate scene it sometimes slow , sometimes more rapid kinetic than anything mtv produces . all all , i consider this essential piece cinema , well worth purchasing dvd while it still available . i hope it remains print forever , but hard time believing it , which why i just recently purchased personal copy -- when it already owned my campus library . ( picture dvd quite fine , better than vhs copy i seen ; music re-created notes left behind vertov superb fits film quite nicely .	1

huge fan this director , it no surprise i recommend film ... but only if you tolerate extremely challenging cinema . if you like films make you feel happy alive , this isn't you . if you like films don't make you think , this isn't you . much written film violence rape scene . less written ways director makes you feel uncomfortable ( sound , camera work lighting effects ) . trust me , it all works , if you good sound system or prone seizures you may just want stay away this one . noe likes dealing mass manipulation through things like film , this movie no exception . its violence rape scene don't make this effective film , however . it what leads up it ( reverse order , course . ) naysayers easily dismiss this film vile , they right . but it also honest unafraid . dismiss it without seeing it , however , shows how little some people know . you can't help but moved what noe doing , he isn't trying move you positive way . he making statement , it statement says revenge hideous sometimes necessary ; men beasts ( that sometimes saving grace ); people don't make most time they given . vile ? maybe so . but so ignorance	1

carole bouquet thinner conchita who somewhat severe . angela molina one who dances seems more natural . jean-claude carriere wrote script . he may greatest screenwriter all time . he over hundred credits some them among best movies ever made . here brief list those i seen : ogre ( 1996 ) , valmont ( 1989 ) , unbearable lightness ( 1988 ) , discreet charm bourgeoisie ( 1972 ) , diary chambermaid ( 1964 ) . there some symbolism cet obscur objet du desir . sometimes mathieu ( fernando rey ) carries around old gunny sack . we find out what it final scene . it represents conchita virginity . terrorists background seem rather contemporary although this movie 1977 . mathieu rich therefore represents established european society . conchita her friends represent underclass . both mathieu conchita really character types . he masher , rake who always working new conquest , although he somewhat naive . she tease who uses her wiles get what she him . bunuel plays this ancient theme burlesque , exaggerating her coyness his foolishness . ending may suggest some way he won , or more likely they still standoff , even while terrorists escalate bombings . question why there two actresses playing conchita more maria schneider , who originally cast role , but left because nudity or because conchita character too contrary , than it any plot or symbolic necessity . other hand , since she " obscure object desire " ( which really should " unobtainable object desire " ) , because bunuel wanted emphasize mathieu desire her nothing her personally , he used two actresses made it clear mathieu didn't notice difference ! bit absurdity here , but bunuel comfortable absurdity . all all interesting treatment ancient theme , but not one bunuel best , even though it his last age 77	-1
moonlight whispers surprisingly sweet tale two japanese teens whose first forays into young love escalates into sm relationship . it sort like endless love if it directed andrew blake . takayu satsuki teenagers going same school friendly since they both become members kendo club . takayu hiding deep crush satsuki , when she reveals she always liked him , two begin dating . although it seemed what he always wished , after two lose their virginity each other , takayu finds he not interested her normal sexual fashion . takayu more comfortable subservient . when satsuki discovers his drawer full pictures her , articles her clothing , audio tape her going bathroom , she initially sickened shocked . she begins dating classmate , uematsu , but takayu continues follow her insist he wants her obedient dog . satsuki finds she gets pleasure out cruel him , soon two begin strange relationship , struggling their perverted desires . ultimately , this remarkable film , unlike any i've seen before ( it makes you want seek out more foreign films ! ) , i mesmerized it . not soft porn or exploitation film all but sincere sensitive exploration character , psychology taboo subject -- intensely romantic . also this dvd interview young director , which also quite interesting . after ' losers club : complete restored edition ' richard perez , moonlight whispers best " unconventional " purchase i made amazon this year .	1

don't know why my first note hasn't appeared , so i'll briefly restate . claim-to-fame this film it avant-garde , push-the-envelope sexuality . amazon describes this film " unrated " , but that not what nearly all these listings selling . these new " " rated version massively redacted . fact , all what makes this film famous reduced some brief nudity . even though box continues bill it " sexiest movie ever made . " top , despite english only cover , my vhs purchase subtitled spanish . seller offered adjustment . he didn't know . but amazon needs drop ' unrated ' description , implies original . those still interested might look something like ' director cut ' . i still haven't found one . sorry if this duplicate previous post	-1

regarding andrei rublev , debate which official cut . criterion dvd comes what they call scorcese version which 30 minutes or so longer than ruscico version . however , ruscico version actually edited tarkovsky release . i would go both cuts see how two movies differ . you experience how cleverly movie edited without any compromises . ruscico version what you get all over world . i prefer ruscico version . events more discontinuous but stronger effect . example , beginning three monks walk away monastery due ideological differences start walking across field where it starts rain . crterion version you see this entire event . ruscico version tarkovsky cut out scenes where they walk away monastery just starts three walking field . you dont know where they came where they headed . this gives different effect when seen . all you see they talk walk rain . criterion cut you dont experience this effect much but just tend follow thread things . overall criterion cut tends definite thread things , sense it more straightforward filmmaking . ruscio more artful version two	-1

" technically third movie series , " inspector clouseau " finds alan arkin title role french inspector jacques clousea , character peter sellers started make famous two previous movies character sellers would become inextricably linked four more afterwards . " inspector clouseau " lacks boundless energy director shawn levy actor steve martin 2006 entry franchise or subtle sophistication any director blake edward actor peter sellers ' indisputable classics , but director bud yorkin actor alan arkin entry undeniably unique actually quite entertaining .

woody allen purple rose cairo ranks among his better films . film centers experiences poor woman named cecilia who played wonderfully mia farrow . cecilia trapped loveless marriage brute named monk who played danny aiello . cecilia job waitress small diner during depression although she tries work hard she can't help but fantasize chat movies her sister who also works same diner . cecilia only comfort movie theater watching glamorous but highly contrived movies rich people who aren't suffering poverty scorn her husband . cecilia eventually loses her job after catching monk unfaithful her she winds up watching purple rose cairo endlessly small movie theater their town . imagine cecilia surprise when one characters , dashing all-american type guy tom baxter , decides leave film , jump screen into audience , run away cecilia ! tom represents purity heart true compassion cecilia longs her real marriage . she knows tom fictional because he came off movie screen ; but tom maintains he never going back because he wants experience real world cecilia his new bride . course , all this horrifies movie theater manager hollywood studio produced film entitled purple rose cairo . how inconvenient this gil shepherd , too , actor who portrayed tom baxter film ! movie studio executives gil shepherd hatch plan get tom return movie -- but it work ? what would happen if tom returned movie but took cecilia him into land make believe ? purple rose cairo film you cannot afford miss . mia farrow cecilia , danny aiello monk , cecilia husband jeff daniels both gil tom all give some most convincing performances i've ever seen . their performances moved me engaged my attention much longer than i initially thought they would . this movie deals universal human desire escape pain boredom everyday life so many us experience replace misery world which there no real problems everyone money or very least secure job . cecilia represents us all she delights tom world relative innocence harmony . therein lies true strength this film . cinematography shines : i like scenes movie house where you see film screened within woody allen picture . scenes filmed amusement park reflect careful forethought concerning lighting camera angles . choreography amazes me : i love scenes which both movie theater patrons actors film stunned tom decision leave movie they all move simultaneously ways prove good judgment part woody allen his colleagues who worked this film . overall , purple rose cairo remain excellent film long human condition quality our lives imperfect . everybody dreams world where their true desires reality their troubles disappear . purple rose cairo elegantly explores this theme sophistication , wit poignancy .	1
this movie should great but misses widely . it all woodyesque elements whimsy , absurdity , profundity , pathos comedy but it never really comes together . farrow chattering , self-absorbed housewife not very sympathetic , since she practically every scene , movie feels weighted down this poorly written character . pacing seems awkward too . allen best movies almost always daring go-for-the-jugular-forge t-t he-critics air them . like too many his almosts , alice seems like practice movie . if allen unwilling wholly commit his own material just go it	-1

this sad , great , superbly acted movie struggle dominance scottish regiment after wwii . colonel jock sinclair ( alec guinness ) named acting commander his regimental battalion now expects confirmed . he up-from-the-ranks officer , hard drinking , bluff but sly , whose whole life regiment . he demands loyalty manliness his officers . but he isn't confirmed . coming replace him battalion commander colonel basil barrow ( john mills ) . he everything sinclair dislikes , aristocratic , privileged , military family . he also something martinet , man who prizes decorum his officers , man who prisoner war returned shaken . something weak man . stage set barrow try take moral command batallion , sinclair undermine him every step way . result both men , their own weaknesses , destroy themselves . number elements makes this , my opinion , powerful motion picture . setting batallion headquarters scotland , located towering , massive stone hulk building reeks tradition . it winter it cold , it perfect setting struggles going . customs regiment , playing pipes , all underline closed-in atmosphere this all-male society . cast excellent , actors playing soldiers ncos officers . dennis price , first-class actor , cool enigmatic battalion exec who may pick up pieces who may not so disinterested he appears . guinness mills extraordinary , both playing against type . while guinness flashier role , mills brings such depth well-intentioned weakness match equal two . you wind up understanding both men sympathy both . most all , i think , story . it fascinating look inside regiment , tied story real power tragedy these two men ruin their lives . this great story telling great acting . i recommend movie . criterion disc first rate . among other extras , it features excellent interview director , ronald neame , which he describes filming movie	1
this landmark film 1984 dark interpretation well known fairy tale legend , red riding hood . it focus splendid settings including murky dense forests , wooden cottages where villagers live fear danger posed man-like beasts prowl night during testing freudian times . film composed several scenarios where vivid dreamlike sequences take shape creating very unusual altered perception man ability determine grasp fantasy reality . every scene well thanks execution film direction neil jordan whose original thinking imagination led superb adaptation based angela carter " bloody chamber " book . dark , spooky atmosphere this classic fairy tale re-telling blessed use ancient folklore old wives tales which hint casting spell or curse anyone who uncivil others or society . angela lansbury who plays grandmother spins such stories young rosaleen , pre-pubescent teenager who go journey self-discovery both emotionally physically unravel hidden delights adulthood . despite such tales , girl unaffected her courage takes her unknown paths through dark woodlands where her character judgement tested forecast her values beliefs she behold adulthood . interactions unknown strangers , mostly men whose eyebrows meet middle lend itself powerful experience innocent teenager . general , this film more fantasy where excessive blood gore barely feature , instead portrayal genuine , well-mannered men their hidden devilish , cunning personality most threatening aspect difficult predict when one may strike . most modern vampire/werewolf stories , main attraction ensures film success character humour neatly stirred give all viewers general taste feel scary not too scary moments mixed into plot . stephen rea performance early film when he returned home filthy , long-haired , smelly hippie after sometime spent outdoors wolf overturned dining table during argument - remember same thing occurred 1994 " interview vampire " movie when hacked-off silly , bearded , overweight rogue lost card game ! well beautifully rendered scenes , music well composed which suspenseful adds eerie , tense atmosphere giving sense something always happening there always darkness never daylight . best thing this film no one could trusted anyone who thought they'd make good friends someone sure big surprise ! friendly seductive but sinister terence stamp example . constant nagging , bickering annoyance mainly women towards their husbands or girls constantly rejecting sexual advances seemingly-friendly strangers leads which drive man desire anguish frighteningly transform into werewolf full moon . this message film sending out men during those times always one charge , care should exercised whenever household arguments or disagreements broke out prevent ultimate beast unleashed within himself should dispute , whatever it may turn too ugly . human-to-werewolf transformation scenes well filmed hand-crafted 1984 convincing using remote-controlled models wolf-like beasts , but compared today standards scenes shown signs ageing . however my opinion , overuse today computer generated images could spoil horror film making certain scenes look corny or just not believable . dvd presented beautiful tin box which reflects show class . this now becoming rarity , dvd now commonly sold standard plastic box which cheaper if purchased on-line . it shown 4:3 aspect ratio but not 16:9 widescreen stated box good range extras especially expert 90 minute audio commentary available , but very well worth buy . apart dvd film disc , there excellent booklet included detailing events took place behind cameras , well history folklore legend wild beasts , character descriptions actors ' biographies brief , all explained colourful photographs taken film . running time 90 minutes , but i felt it should 2 hour-plus epic . it also rated 18 suitable adults only . it box delight should treasured forever . best effect , watch this alone dark before bedtime	1

one his essays german philosopher/critic walter benjamin compared film theater stating lens camera replaces audience spectator , but because camera emotionless actor unable feed off audience reaction . however , some films theatrical aspects not only used , but become part film itself . anyone who watched ichikawa kon actor revenge or shinoda masahiro double suicide this quite evident . while not taking theater into play , im kwon-taek extraordinarily popular film chunhyang incorporates traditional storytelling elements pansori , singer drummer , into play . instead just opening film , viewer treated listening pansori storytelling throughout entire film even his voice overdubbed over actors actresses . while this aspect film might bit distracting first , especially when film action cut stage visualized world chunhyang , it eventually sinks one enjoy told story while seeing it acted out actors actresses instead just realm inside one head . chunhyang tells story lovers lee mongryong sung chunhyang , former sun governor namson latter daughter courtesan . budding scholar who preparing exams would open him world officialdom , mongryong one day becomes bored his hours constant study asks his servant pangja show him some areas local interest . one spot he notices beautiful young girl swinging high swing he falls love first sight . he orders pangja fetch girl him , but servant reluctant because chunhyang reputation turning down every man who shown interest her . however , pangja go speak her , but instead returning girl he returns message mongryong interprets chunhyang wants him come visit her her home . night he visits chunhyang , girl eventually agrees marry him promise he would not abandon her because their differences social status . he agrees so so they marry they seem quite blissful first until mongryong father receives promotion which requires him return seoul . because mongryong return seoul his father because he cannot take chunhyang him , because married such lowly girl would destroy his chances taking exams , young couple must part , but mongryong promises return chunhyang after he finishes exams . however , during time mongryong away , new , corrupt governor takes over old governor position he seems interest our heroine . directed man who considered many father modern south korean cinema director nearly one hundred films , chunhyang might not first seem no more than simple love story , but its elements traditional storytelling , its intermingling history , romance , melodrama , it stand out great film within ever growing number spectacular south korean films .	-1

3.5 stars . i liked this movie heck lot better than original . however , battle mothers definitely go angela lansbury over meryl . not meryl bad job , it just angela outstanding . this movie filled little more holes me-though i find overall premises still far fetched ending wholly unbelivable . still-a good rental	-1

this one my favorite movies long time . recently i happy see it dvd which relief watching old , grainy vhs versions . i hadn't seen it years watched it today find myself amazed how well movie stands up time . it one those rare , perfect storms comedy where great writing ( truly funny line after truly funny line ) paired great direction outstanding performances all same time . dudley moore got oscar nomination " arthur " but lost ( although john gielgud won best supporting actor ) . if moore performance " arthur " doesn't win best actor oscar -it proof no comedic actor could ever win title ( example gene wilder " young frankenstein " ) . steve gordon crafts film beautifully keeping true each characters warm-hearted tone story . quite simply , imho movie rare gem . it only sad steve gordon passed away just year after " arthur " released . regarding dvd , it so/so . although video quality leap over old vhs copies , there still no widescreen version available . dvd few extras nice but it just not enough . one example commentary director stating how he greatly wished how certain deleted takes scenes could included ( because they hysterical ) , but he make tough choices final edit . dvd , perfect format include such material , certainly should offered it well . this , original " arthur " , classic comedy one books	1

i seen many historical war dramas far east ( mainly china ) most them not only historically inaccurate but strong bias toward enemy . yi soon shin , however , rare exception . not only drama very historically accurate but it also very comprehensive detailing meticulous battle planning admiral leads each victory but also political in-fighting chosun political factions ( second-guessing nature king ) which causes his eventual death . also , special effects great . battle scenes ( whether sea or land ) realisitic outstanding quality . only problem i find dvd not placed sufficient focus contribution ming china . then again , this not unexpected since this korean drama focusing great admiral . also , entire selection should 104 episodes . i don't know why it stops 101 . if you want more comprehensive knowledge subject , try samuel hawley imjin war ( which portrays yi soon shin more accurately quoting original sources ) . any who only intered fighting may also want check out stephen turnbull samurai invasion ( which more colorful maps detailed description battles japanese perspective ) . lastly , anyone who fan samurai warfare may want check out shogun : total war creative assembly ( now gold version ) .	1
this horrible movie no redeeming value . i realize such knock actually drive people purchase this . let me bring something you attention . this slasher movie effective gore . fact , time , gore more sick similar movies . however , there no scares , no suspense , no clever script , no story it stupic ending . i know , applies most gore movies ! problem this movie it overly mean spirited towards women ( i am man , 6 foot 235 pound big strong guy also raises family ) . story , which guy killing women b/c mistreatment his mother , seems like it written directed person shares same demons killer film . murders this movie so mean-spirited ( yet no cinematic value ) normal movie goer would offended . this movie not sick " good " movie way but rather sick ashamed manner . this woman-bashing movie should make any viewer feel guilty they patronizing this garbage . movie should entertainment value . there no cinematic , artistic touch this film . this simply mean , mean movie !	-1

ub iwerks . rights , very unusual name should equal walt disney . brief time , it . yet ub little remembered today , despite fact he true creator mickey mouse . he certainly far better draftsman than walt , technical genius who succeeded every endeavor he ever tried -- animation , archery , even bowling . everything , , except one -- escaping imposing shadow his old friend onetime partner walt disney . directed ub granddaghter leslie iwerks narrated kelsey grammer , this documentary takes us through various twists turns ub career . it one distinct advantage over iwerks/kenworthy book -- one see oneself extent ub genius through his work , presented on-screen first time decades . we see first primitive efforts he walt produced young commercial artists kansas city -- " laugh-o-gram " films " alice cartoonland " series . we also treated rare clips silent " oswald lucky rabbit " series ( far superior later ones walter lantz ) . course , earliest mickey mouse cartoons ( two which , " plane crazy " " steamboat willie " , shown end film , animated almost exclusively iwerks ) . seeing films , ( particularly ones he made independent producer ) one gets impression there some pretty strange things going ub head . his best work , most which produced before hollywood crackdown film morals , surprising edge it . one his cartoons independent ( he left form his own studio thirties ) st. peter heaven buzzed speeding motorist , whom venerable saint promptly gives " finger !

" only flaw this production it skips over some aspects his career , particularly brief period he assisted cartoon producer leon schlesinger making two porky pig cartoons . would reunite iwerks one-time studio cel-washer chuck jones , who states film iwerks one who got him interested animation . oversight understandable , given this documentary disney studio , not likely give competitors any free publicity . ub often unfairly portrayed animation histories more interested gadgets than art , he seem most home coming up new technical advances film . earliest multiplane camera ( device designed give dimension cartoons ) travelling matte process among his greatest achievements . but it likely he lost interest animation after mickey mouse because there nowhere else he could go . one man who knew him quoted saying ub , taken up bowling , put his ball closet after bowling 300 game , never use it again . mickey , ub already " bowled 300 " sense , sought new areas conquer . conquer he . returning walt 1940 after ten-year estrangement , he immediately set work devices would make disney animated world more real than it ever . donald duck cavorted latin senoritas dick van dyke danced animated penguins aid devices invented ub iwerks . even after winning two academy awards technical achievement film , ub retained his characteristic modesty . mickey mouse , he would say , " it not creating ( character ) matters , it what you it .

supremely dark losey film starring incomparable dirk bogarde , who takes what you think going routine " blank-from-hell " role turns it completely it head , insinuating everything doing nothing overt ..... making what he actually so much more deliciously evil . some shots here instanious classics still amaze ( shot james fox his fiance busting bogarde his sister , revealing only continually clarifying silhouette bogarde standing naked stair landing , while fox stares up , both appalled enthralled ; fox shivering silhouette he hides bogarde behind shower curtain deceptively innocent " game " ) . pinter script admirably daring , though it turn bit too fast melodrama allegory my taste --- it still pinter , all more brilliant it regarding pace , timing , -- course -- dialogue .	1

" koyaanisqatsi " took seven years make , 1975 1982 . there not narration tell you what think . this art film , my opinion , value up viewer : this film meaningful ? it value ? viewer i say yes . this film fusion music image . koyaanisqatsi there 17 pieces music five movements all relative relationship one . " grid " polyrhythmic piece music . there 11 polyrhythimic structues going once , it matches time lapsed photography occuring screen . 350,000 feet film shot . there definitely method this madness : after explosion grid , these polyrhythmic structures settle audience down film ends way it began : rocket ship taking off . godfrey reggio more than expected negative reaction some people when he made this film . what this film mean ? up viewer , like piece art work there may thousand or more interpretations related this film . this film only certain individuals ? probably . but i don't think there any pretense interpretating this films message . one not pretend like or dislike art object ; it no intrisic meaning or value only what ascribed it viewer . godfrey stated koyaanisqatsi related northern hemisphere societies ; super-sophisticated , hyper-industrial , technological grids we call societies . me this film how humans become one machines . how we don't live nature any longer . we become not affected technology so much more we become so engrained it we no longer see out it . technology becomes host which everything happens way , we not use technology , it way life . but like air we breath we not distance ourselves , we deny we separate technology instead moving us toward control nature it alienated us instead . norms nature no longer fully exist ; it rather norms technology . so doing technology become omnipresent . personally i don't pretend like this film or pretend it important . fact it , its message perhaps even more significant today world moves even closer homogenized society expense natural human diversity . this film shows homogenization this process globalization	1

wiktor grodecki brave filmmaker , one who unafraid address controversial subject , yet one who able make powerful sociologic statement creating metaphorical art film demands respect . grodecki interviews young boys ( ages 14 - 17 ) who male hustlers prague : he wisely removes ( most part ) interviewer questions allowing individual boys make spontaneous , searing comments . these young lads discuss why they became male prostitutes , how they deal selling their bodies , where they find their business ( train station , swimming pools , etc ) , how they feel johns their fellow hustlers , manner which they business including way which financial aspects come play - all way burns faces these young lads into our psyches . half way through this film grodecki introduces pavel rousek , man who day pathologist performing autopsies prague morgue his off hours ( using pseudonym hans miller ) creates , casts directs gay porno videos his home . rousek shown autopsy table gowning , gloving , grotesquely performing autopsy real cadaver while discussing both professions . there moments while he gloving he explains why he doesn't allow his boys wear condoms ( buyers his videos don't want see condoms ) , contrast his self protection vs enforcement prevention sexual protection his actors devastating . rousek miller then shown filming boys his home , explaining details achieving visual effects pornography : simultaneously we again hear boys views aspect their ' careers ' , creating pitiful tension . there almost no total nudity this film when it occur lighting so dark obscure it - making overall effect even more dense effectively tense . under all this lurid talk grodecki uses classical music - albinoni , mahler , mozart - which again provides contradiction makes topic digestible . final question grodecki poses his subjects involves boys perception ' soul ' while there variety responses , overall message these lads sell their bodies career , but soul ' what you think ' , something cannot taken you . several these boys screen presence faces , they noticed regular film makers , would probably give them legitimate careers . but power film comes words these boys , knowing completely their choice life , therein lies sorrow . this tough but very fine piece filmmaking . interestingly , grodecki absorbed this material used it create his subsequent feature film mandragora ( reviewed under title ) . this film more powerful two . not movie everyone , but certainly important document way life few know fewer understand . grady harp , september 05	1

i bought punisher when it originally came out so now i both original dvd its new extended cut . film itself , i liked original but new extended cut what it should . it gives film whole new look missing before ! i won't give it away but it new subplot makes film make more sense ( much like director cut daredevil ) makes it better my view ! personal note , those says its nothing but mindless violence it no regard human life obviously didn't watch film or read comics ! yes , there gory violence but this isn't freakin ' spider-man ( though i enjoy character movies well) ! punisher isn't nice character . i am not married nor i children but if my wife son ( my extended family ) gunned down front my eyes , i don't think i'd such positive attitude either . also , frank castle isn't so hellbent he can't see suffering around him . if so , he wouldn't helped joan ( played rebecca romjin ) creepy boyfriend hers or befriend ( sort ) joan her friends or left " gift " he left so note , frank castle wasn't totally twisted . anyway , back dvd , it animated beginning both film seperate . also , there 10 minute short explaining new extended cut well classic punisher covers comics . i would also recommend keeping original release extras ( it some good ones too ) . overall , if you stand violence comes , its good film	-1

james stewart masquerades hangman order save his brother , dean martin , leader notorious bishop gang . they then flee mexico beautiful hostage raquel welch . george kennedy plays lovelorn sheriff who pursues half-hearted posse . everything this 1968 western works ! first 45 minutes involves capture , attemted hanging , escape bishop gang , it simply one most memorable sequences western film history . some people complain stewart martin brothers but i've seen many brothers real life look more different than these two . even though martin plays outlaw he portrayed highly likable , sympathetic manner . he weary outlaw lifestyle desperately wants out . stewart welch offer him way out way stolen money true love respectively . they all dream new life montana . there just two problems : kennedy his posse wild mexican bandits ( bandeleros ) . although there some fun elements , film essentially serious western adventure/drama . it potently explores themes loyalty , temptation , pursuing finding true love , folly criminal path dreams better life . some complain ending too downbeat , but i've always loved it . fact , it wouldn't right it end any other way . [ spoiler alert ! ] it powerfully supports age-old notion those who live sword ( stolen loot ) eventually die sword . i must say george kenney outstanding stolid sheriff who puppy-love passion welch . she naturally finds him unexciting , however . hostage bishop gang she slowly discovers true-love first time her life ( martin , course ) . score jerry goldsmith outstanding . jerry obviously borrowed basic melody neal hefti magnificent composition " duel diablo , " which released two years earlier . goldsmith took basic melody ingeniously created completely different-sounding score . his composition fun western vibe it whereas hefti ultra-dramatic . both these scores rank up there all-time best western musical soundtracks , which include " good , bad ugly , " " how west won , " " mackenna gold , " " fistful dollars , " " rio lobo , " " bonanza " " magnificent seven . " too many western films take place texas but filmed elsewhere ( like arizona , etc . ) . " bandelero ! " contrast , actually filmed brackettville , texas , not far mexican border/rio grande ; some portions shot utah . these locations fabulous . " bandelero ! " western film-making highest order .	1

this ideal movie home theatre . i grew up working ranch richard farnsworth , james caan jane fonda totally convincing cowboys cowgirl . jason robards utterly evil this movie . i've liked them all several other movies but none good this one . breathtaking backdrop really well written story combined excellent array talent makes this one treasures my western collection	1
if you liked crouching tiger , hidden dragon , then see bride white hair . drawn same sword sorcery tradition , both movies feature strong female leads . case bride , we brigitte lin ching hsua , one hong kong most popular female stars . brigitte beautiful compelling ; more fey than zhang ziyi , she sorcerous assassin top her game . her meeting male lead , leslie cheung ( singer-actor best known us his role chen dieyi farewell , my concubine ) either accidental or destined , depending how you look it , but it changes her world his . visual style film spectacular , thanks no small part cinematographer peter bao . director ronny yu yan-tai , who compared ridley scott , not very well known united states yet , but he got pretty good following world-wide . ( yes , yes . he directed bride chucky . i'm not going defend or attack him , because i've never seen it . ) bride he conducts , like best fantasy hong kong masters , opera or ballet . every word , every move larger than life , everything fraught meaning , promise or threa t--t his not " everyman " action ; this epic . like many epics , it sometimes suffer excess . bride , my opinion , not quite good humanizing its characters tiger . both romeo juliet stories , but lin lien ni chang cheung zhou yi hang not fully rendered star-crossed lovers tiger ( either pair ) . they're archetypes . but they're grand glorious archetypes . who cares lien ni chang raised wolves who somehow taught her mastery wind instruments ? who cares how precisely villains came their genetic-defying bond ? isn't point this film , people who allow themselves bog down these issues , i believe , depriving themselves transporting film experience . go willing enjoy , you probably . those disturbed loose ending tiger , warned : bride isn't likely satisfy you much more . if " what then ? " haunts you too much , you find answer bride white hair ii . it returns all major characters picks up where other left off	1

i enjoy genre over top gore comedy but this one didn't interest me . story very slow paced uninteresting some pretty unimaginative gore . it also ridiculous not comedic way but ' stupid ' way . people smashing through stone walls lot . final ' ultra ' gory finale really didn't interest me either . watch troma terror firmer or citizen toxie if you enjoy this type movie . or wait poultrygeist which probably pretty tromariffic . i don't know when this made but i would guess it inspired troma . i appreciate effort but it didn't match let alone surpass troma gore comedy	-1

honors thoughtful well little " slice life " moral we've all heard before : what makes you happy take time live your life . director alex keshishian screenwriter william mastrosimone , however , don't knock you over head its theme and/or morals . there some scenes where you're expecting probable happen they don't: e.g. , after simon cooks gorky , rooster , you expect his master furious --- when simon finally meets up son he abandoned , you expect some kind tearful reunion ---- you certainly think monty going graduate honors . end results these scenes , however , avoid usual cliche . joe pesci delightfully understated his role , although he never really becomes coochy coo loveable , you understand his pains shortcomings ; brendan fraser starts out pretty snooty insufferable but he matures his relationship both pesci moira kelly ( who delightful courtney ) , fraser becomes more sympathetic character ; patrick dempsey adds some lightweight humor gorky master , josh hamilton eschews usual pain butt role believable touching change hear t.t he movie definitely manipulative , but its heart right place its cast takes it seriously , so it ends up charming little film strong reaffirmation human spirit	-1

" horse mouth " one those british comedies bring smile your face if you already love those kind movies television shows , indispensible dvd fans great alec guinness . he plays gulley jimson ( who novel author , joyce cary , based his friend poet dylan thomas . ) jimson broken-down , scabrous old reprobate artist , who also recognized those know genius . dressed shabby old clothes , guinness scowls , sneers , growls unforgettable voice , insults everyone , schemes plots his next big painting . he supported nosy , young would-be artist , coker , tough old barmaid who likes jimson spite herself . jimson worms his way into apartment upper-crust couple paint his mural their wall " resurrection lazarus " , hilariously catastrophic results . while fleeing police , jimson discovers bare wall old church scheduled demolition , tom sawyer-like , recruits army apprentices paint his next big mural , " last judgement . " guinness wrote screenplay , it criticized some softening novel , especially ending . but this movie perfectly reasonable interpretation perhaps reflects guinness ' religious faith ( check out titles paintings , coker prayer , jimson last line film . ) some described gulley sort proto-hippie , but there nothing soft , sentimental , or utopian him . he tough-minded , self-critical anarchist whose faith world besides this one , " world color " , carries him through his troubles . jimson stands incorrigible individual against small-minded materialistic elites hate fear real beauty because they hard time understanding it . this wonderful movie deserves its high reputation inclusion criterion collection dvd .	1

let me start off saying i enjoy book " shining " read it few times when i younger . stephen king obviously incredible author gift capturing mood clear concise writing . he not , however , brilliant writing screenplays . his dialogue so bad sometimes it makes it hard tell if actors ( mostly child who played danny ) really bad or if it just script . also , i realize this actually mini-series not feature film , but king felt need not only include every detail book ( including laughable hedge animal scene ) but even added more parts not included book . addition this problem , there countless times jack would character beaten ready kill only stop say " it time take your medicine " or " you little pup " person inevitably escaped . these two factors served drag movie so long all feeling urgency lost , leaving climax pretty anti-climactic . i know many people prefer " stephen king shining " original movie simply because it more true book , but compare new cheesy hedge animal attack old hedge maze chase . or blood wall transforming redrum murder new vs . spine-tingling scene mirror where mother sees redrum backwards . or simply compare acting jobs uber-creepy old danny cute cuddly new danny . i know it not fair compare so i'll leave you this- if you want warm fuzzy fairy tale shining , go new . if you prefer horror , try kubrick version	-1

i just want say i really , really wanted like this movie ... i just couldn't bring myself . it came ifc other night since i've this independent film kick lately , it starred penn , morton thurman , i decided give it watch through . i heard good things it , mostly morton performance well penn , so i honestly say i high expectations . those expectations , sadly , not met . first all i want say penn performance so overrated i left appalled he even considered among spacey , crowe washington year . morton other hand add some weight picture proved she commanding actress even when she says not single word . penn plays fictional jazz guitarist emmett ray , very conceded irresponcible man who spent his time womanizing obsessing over better known musician djamgo reinhardt . film follows this mans life he takes up hattie ( morton ) mute woman who na�ve enough love this man then leaves her marry aspiring news reporter blanche ( thurman ) who using emmett story . much underused anthony lapaglia brad garrett make almost too-short cameos gangsters who get involved emmett blanche . all all this very slow moving film eventually went nowhere . woody allen known classic director , maybe case , but this nowhere near classic . it mockumentary style directing annoying since it not funny nor interesting , sean penn just plain ridiculous ( his character ) this over hyped film	-1

it when mass hanging scene stupidly inserted two , not just one , long church hymns , cardboard-like preacher gallows conduct crowd sing them , condemned-by-hanging rapist kept monologuing 10 minuntes synchronize those two hymns , this movie beginning fall flat miserably . other ridiculous illogic part when marshal escorted two young rustlers murderer back where hanging judge resided , why he suddenly take route across vast desert instead going back original path where posse came ? there no way no excuse make such stupid arrangement simply just because director screenplay writers wanted show how difficult tough marshal got heroic dead-man-walking mission , then turned himself out next lame a-hero-was-born scene . there wonderful moments this film , but it started drag lag behind gradually . it often gave you impression both screen writers director didn't clue how make this movie going , they could only asked clint eastwood , marshal , lot unnecessary hollow scenes .	-1

this review dvd released mgm 2002 . pride yankees story baseball hall famer lou gehrig . his nickname " iron horse " which he earned playing 2,130 consecutive games new york yankees mid 1920 late 1930 . major league record many years until cal ripken jr. broke it 1995 . course lou gehrig also remembered courageous man who died amyotrophic lateral sclerosis , sometimes also referred " lou gehrig disease " . movie stars gary cooper lou gehrig . movie gem essentially four facets it . one area lengthy coverage his relationship his domineering german mother ( played elsa janssen ) . second subplot courting marrying his wife ( played teresa wright ) . third subject lengthy coverage his great baseball career final facet film gehrig facing his mortality relatively early age . course these four areas overlap into each other throughout movie . personal viewpoint , i would liked seen lot more his baseball career less his love life . ( i'm sure this intentionally get women into theaters . ) movie sugarcoated squeaky clean very corny times , but personally i'd rather watch movie like this than films like babe ruth or ty cobb movies made 1990 where they exposed all dirty laundry their private lives . pride yankees classic , especially unforgettable " i consider myself luckiest guy face earth " speech yankee stadium . wonderful treat see babe ruth play himself movie there also few brief scenes yankee great : bill dickey . nice feature shots various american league ball barks gehrig played . it also great see some shots old grandstands yankee stadium before it renovated mid-`70s . overall , this movie whole family , 6 96 , enjoy . dvd picture quality outstanding . black white transfer impeccable . i don't recall seeing slightest flaw throughout entire movie sharpness excellent . sound fine too . dvd lacked bonus features which shame movie so highly acclaimed so many generations . there lot his baseball career wasn't covered movie , but could covered documentary sportswriters sports historians . movie itself some interesting stories regarding how it filmed . i once read article regarding how they filmed cooper playing gehrig . since cooper right handed gehrig left handed , they would film cooper running third base home instead home first after getting hit then reverse negative . movie : advd quality :	1
there few pictures which makes us experience feelings emotions mentally disturbed character such way , moment , we seem disturbed character . " shock corridor " journalist goes under cover mental patient into psychiatric ward but slowly descends into real madness . film tried but only succeeded partly - we hear journalists desperate thoughts voice-over it sounds more like radio play now then real thing . lodge kerrigan 1994 debut " clean , shaven " however , caused many moviegoers leave halfway picture because portrayal schizophrenic man so believable uncompromisingly hard lot people just couldn't bear it anymore . but because " clean , shaven " first place ment serious character study not so much entertainment ( fact : " clean , shaven " indeed very little entertaining values average audience ) it remained unjustifiably obscure little picture . but fortunately , people good sense what " real cinema " depicting " true not relenting emotions " still know there way these movies anyway . because still happens , every now then such movie gets made . gets through . ( note : same director struck back hard last year " keane " , movie schizophrenic man who suffers paranoia hallucnations which so effective we feel this disturbed man almost breeding down our necks . ) polanski film here , " repulsion " attempt putting viewer straight mind person that caught mental downward spiral . this attempt resulted picture gets grip viewer such way , fear , disgust paranoia becomes part them , almost much character herself . catherine deneuve young woman who feels best ( if she feels something positive all ) beauty parlour where she surrounded women ( collegue customers ) only . outside world she she withdrawn little girl shivers every touch man ( it accidental or purpously ) . her blank , empty eyes show no emotions only when she scared even then deneuve keeps dead-pan face most time . because she doesn't open up her thoughts emotons viewer ( like journalist " shock corridor " ) we not know where her repulsion fears come or ... where they go . but polanski keeps camera pretty much her face anyhow we go her , stroling through streets london or dwelling her sisters appartment . we not so much voyeurs but more witnesess something or somebody we rather not witness . but like lodge kerrigan , polanski master manipulating menages keep hard core movie fans intrigued . his lowbudget-like approach , fully use claustrophobic surroundings pretty much literaly speak themselves ( desolate sounds dripping water , neuroticly ticking clocks , creepy cracking shelves , echoes slamming doors - completely effective realistic way , wich he would repeated often , like " tenant " course " rosemary baby " ) pays off . polanski more then just exceptional filmmaker - he visionair . halfway through movie , there no more reason argue : this cannot happy end ! but going down spiral made here rarely seen form art , which sounds , shots , plays light shadows , totally convincing actress , stretched limits - sometimes boldly go beyond . it not fun witness deneuve falling apart , but it every real movie lover witness this film . it hard , harsh , rough , daring . therefor all more admired .	1

i saw " atomic cafe " when it first came out 1982 , film lost none its zip intervening years . film montage military civilian footage americans attempting deal destructive enormity atomic power , overlain cheesiest a-bomb related period music . starting interview unapologetic paul tibbetts ( who flew enola gay its bombing run over hiroshima ) through nixon-khrushchev " kitchen debates " 1950s , film takes us wild irreverent ride through america terrified prospect instant annihilation . what neat movie not narrated except voices times . president eisenhower urges america ( its consumer greatness ) not panic . bert turtle teaches generation children duck cover when they see atomic flash . government films urge country into fallout shelters where they wait few minutes before coming up take look around start arduous job straightening picture frames knocked askew blast . catholic clergy filmed dispensing government build bomb permitting homeowners stock " protective devices " their shelters against those poor souls trying get . torrent disinformation misinformation fascinating , would funnier if possibility nuclear war not so real . ironic too population level trust government clearly unwilling level it level destruction bomb would perpetrate . film mis-stepped only once , allowing sympathy rosenbergs . subsequent years shown they most probably give nuclear secrets soviets . i feel pity their children abhor their executions without excusing their wickedness . " atomic cafe " agenda . juxtaposing pictures children hiding under beds school desks images obliteration bombed test homes , it makes clear fact nuclear war not mostly-survivable thing might lead some complacency atomic attack . film not stint showing horrors nuclear attack fallout . such , it great service laying out true cost atomic warfare well blindly trusting those who control detonation those awful weapons . dvd extras nothing special -- little more than trailers credits	1

seriously , i didn't even think this comedy until i came here saw people saying " it wasn't funny . " i got it part boxed set cary grant films ( purchased here ) , it only dud lo t.t here one scene , i grant you , light entertaining . not laugh out loud , but funny enough ( i won't spoil it saying which one ) . aside , film struck me rather unbelievable farce infidelity . most all , you could almost feel very talented cast trying keep this elephant airborne . grant simmons , particular , strong - but their efforts ultimately squandered . bob mitchum ok , but generally miscast , kerr beauty talent basically wasted . no amount acting would allow you believe anyone could act impetuously stupidly she here . she goes happily married tramp 5 minutes , no discernible reason . overall acting : ( grant/simmons : b)directing : fwriting : d-i understand this film caters more english tastes , that fine , but i found it most un-satisfying	-1

like many other reviewers , i went into movie thinking it would horrors war . but it much more than . it story prejudices how they exacerbate already terrible situations . it remarkable see interactions chechens their russian prisoner . human level , they so similar . life , they could friends . but moment , they enemies , no matter how comfortable each acting , you could tell they never forgot . movie started out very slow , but toward middle it started pick up . there some very funny moments . i'm not sure they supposed funny , but i good laugh . overall , not bad movie , but not everybody .	-1

garbo her first talkie marvelous this adaptation eugene o'neills pulitzer winning play , whore trying reform . marie dressler brilliant supporting performance washed-out drunk , everyone else letter-perfect . now caveat : technical shortcomings early talkies replete here , so you should stay away if stuff like what concerns you . added attraction , dvd also includes simultaneously filmed german language version movie different ( save garbo , course ) cast : quite bit darker , tho not ( me ) accessible . course one never forget magic hearing gg utter : " gif me visky , ginger ale side , don ' stingy , baby .	-1
both big fan this movie film student , i feel critics quick judge this film bad trash . this film sexy edge it , many other films " teen film " genre dare exhibit . new best friend fullfills fantasy those girls who secretly desire live dangerously party every night , without it actually becoming reality . house every girl dream , these girls alluring suavely tempting . acting far terrible , it great see meredith monroe more sophisticated darker role than her role andie dawson creek . dominique swain once again puts a+ effort her role cheeky deviant sydney . anyone who loved films like tart cruel intentions , this film you .	1

i watch this once year never get tired it . hepburn tracy great together usual . company setting appealing , makes me yearn pre-pc days when big companies bars , christmas parties drinking revelry , etc . it christmas movie out ordinary . my favorite scene when it raining tracy goes home hepburn . they all cozy fire fried chicken floating island , only walked upon wonderfully arrogant gig young . sometimes i just watch this scene alone ! i also love line near end movie where young says he thinking hepburn asks him what like . delight	1

this movie lives up it horrible reviews ! it not really bad enough called " so bad it good " not good enough considered good movie . yeah , it bad but it not cool or funny type bad . script based book though lots people claim book great if it anything like movie i probably won't read it ! story totally cliche unoriginal : earth ruins taken over aliens group humans must save themselves extinction , slavery etc , etc . dialogue weird , pace movie weird ending very predictable . combine bad story , lousy acting , bad costumes , low quality special effects bad camera work you this cheese-fest movie . travolta bad guy this movie it really easy hate him , perhaps little too easy ! he calls humans " rat brain " but i think word better suited him ! travolta really bloated face i don't think it costume or makeup . what ever happened getting shape role ? he average actor this character nothing bring out his good qualities . plus side there lot shooting explosions movie so if you're into you might like this movie . i thought it stinker not watch it again !	-1
woody allen great filmmaker who made some comedies also deep character studies ( annie hall , manhattan , hannah her sisters , etc . ) . however , there something said films like what up , tiger lily , play it again , sam sleeper -- films just plain funny . probably best these take money run which spoofs true crime documentaries time . allen plays virgil starkwell , hilariously inept career criminal whose life one misadventure after . using " testimony " people starkwell life cinema vierte style photography , allen peppers audience hilarious sight gag after sight gag . among my favorites : 1 . high school , starkwell joins marching band ... cello player . image allen running up street chair cello hand , stopping moment play few bars , then getting up running few more feet hysterically funny . 2 . starkwell invites his girlfriend ( played janet margolin " david lisa " ) dinner but doesn't money . he breaks into several parking meters . when he tips maitre'd , he dumps several dollars change into his hand all over floor . 3 . starkwell robs bank , but teller can't read note he hands him , thinking word " gun " " gub . " 4 . when entering prison , one guards frisks starkwell , inducing peals ticklish laughter . indeed , take money run seems lot more like film allen former colleague your show shows , mel brooks , than like one his later films . story just framework gag after gag -- most which unbelievably funny . allen some wonderful deep character studies later his career , but take money run hilarious comedy should stand among his best work	1
what it middle aged professors anyway ? [8-d ] i same kind thoughts reactions this professor , but they remained fantasies . it took me one day teaching , i discovered how vulnerable these young women . ( my race didnt matter either ) , they just feel so indebted ( guilt something ? ) us our passion teaching them . me its natural thing , them it gift them . definitely such thing mid-life trauma or crisis . i would wanted this girl movie too , because real crisis like this often breaks outside social contructs ; hence trauma or crisis . americans truely spoiled their myopic view what men want what beauty , it matters this particular situation . i must admit i struggling some my own inadequacies also , which heightened this age . funny how even achieving ones ' dreams cannot fully engage total personhood . we must careful not get sideswiped what we think " success " . achieving ones goal not time see " success " ( its journey not destination-remember saying ? )and then let your guard down . suggestion : human effort but not without humility through spiritual connection you see greater than yourself ! it become practice-not magic trick , but it helps me balance things . ps . men often avoid " attractive " ones because they hide their insecurities , but young girl who needs someone think she attractive ... older male tells her she ... well , it happens .... lot .	-1

what could your average slasher flick particularly amateur cast , held together wit , charm , charisma jamie lee curtis . familiar face leslie nielson ( one his last dramatic roles before his transition comedy ) doesn't hurt either . this canadian-made horror , its glazed cinematography used good effect , tells story childhood accident comes back haunt surviving group friends nearly 10 years later their senior prom . while film not altogether original ( many elements previous horror films all-to o-o bvious here ) , it nonetheless enjoyable slasher flick entertainment . decent performances make this nice effort	-1

i've owned laserdisc this 1981 performance many years . i've tranferred it dvd so i could view it conveniently dvd changer because i'd lost hope it would ever appear commercially dvd . production brilliant great " victorian " touches ( terms time period they seem come ) act ii ; mechanical " contraptions " wonderful . production fantastic , it should , yet seems rooted late 1800 . it also rich , sensual royal opera production . young domingo baltsa their best . regarding other dvds opera : much one vaguely admire opera de lyon " some tales hoffman " , striving different ( very stark ) destroys opera me . 1978 paris opera production ok if rather provincial looking ( very simple sets ) . 1970 komische oper berlin production actually quite good lively , but it sung german . even if musical performances royal opera production only ok it would winner , but performances excellent . anyone who thinks they even little interest french opera should buy this	1

this jazz-fan delight : tons jazz , featuring tenor saxophone some bebop thrown . most music nice mellow stuff interesting hear , even non-jazz buff like me . music interesting story made me purchase dvd , which i subsequently watched few couple times . story pretty laid-back , simple tale american alcoholic sax great playing france who reforms because french fan who cares him . dexter gordon unique voice makes helps him become interesting character hear real-life jazz great proves decent actor , too . francois cluzet plays admirer who goes out his way help his idol . gabrielle haker pleasant watch cluzet young daughter . she always seems pleasant smile her face . i don't why this film rated " " because there no sex , no nudity , little profanity except several " mf , " which must reason rating . nevertheless , it pretty tame movie . even though story bit slow would probably bore heck out most young people today , i found it entertaining definitely different . it just nice , gentle story , whether you fan jazz or not .	-1
after watching fabulous bonus features this dvd ( biography william ' wild bill ' wellman observations robert mitchum tab hunter , bio " track " author walter van tilburg clark , look actual mountain lions their habitat , more ) , i realized i held ' minority opinion ' film , itself , compared many reviewers you'll read , here ; i think it stagy , lacks sense dread palpable suspense novel , doesn't ' hold up ' well most director work . tale dysfunctional family it boiling point , impact nearly primordial panther , changing their lives , characters , exception always watchable robert mitchum , domineering middle son , all either boring , frustratingly indecisive , or downright unlikable . oldest son william hopper , best-known ' paul drake ' television " perry mason " , dreamer , who ' bonds ' environment , but lacks instinctive power defeat cat , never comes across more than wishy-washy ; bitter spinster sister teresa wright offers one-note portrayal soon becomes grating ; youngest son tab hunter so wimpy you quickly lose interest him ; philip tonge , loquacious alcoholic father , whose drinking problem , novel , tragic , here becomes stereotyped comic drunk , hidden bottles liquor providing ' comic relief ' ; diana lynn , hunter girl , tries hard , but never seems more than minor character proceedings ; even legendary beulah bondi , greedy , bible-spouting , mean-spirited mother , seems simply channel her ' bad mom ' portrayal " what if ? " sequence " it wonderful life " . worst all , ex-little rascal carl ' alfalfa ' switzer , encased phony-looking ' old age ' make-up ' pass ' 100-year-old ranch hand/medicine man , looks neither believable , or comfortable role . farm set looks patently artificial ( obviously sound stage ) , outdoor scenes , shot mount rainier , must take up slack ; sadly , despite creativity using high contrasts make colors achieve ' black white ' look , book greatest asset , constant , frightening ' unseen ' presence malevolent cat , me , never achieved , despite mitchum monologue he gradually succumbs helpless fear ; fact , hunter final confrontation cat handled so ' routinely ' you can't understand what all fuss ! film big letdown !	-1

titan ae really good scifi movie . it fantastic visuals , chases , good enough story keep you interested . voice acting also pretty good . unfortunately movie suffers what many movies , especially this genre , suffer . they don't commit adult or child-based audience , nor go after strictly scifi audience or more general audience . so what ends up happening you get just enough both , without fully focusing one target audience , kind sterile , but still good . if you looking mind blowing concepts something other than ' standard scifi fare ' this isn't where look . if you want good movie keeps you entertained kids watch too , this great flick .	-1
most reviews this film appear written males , so i thought i would add female point view discussion . i bought dvd my husband valentine day , he fan western genre , watched it him . it not exactly romantic valentine day fare . here few short observations : my opinion , film should rated " , " instead " pg , " because its violent scenes . there no good guys this film , only flawed characters . i found marlon brando character , amoral regulator , blood-chillingly evil . compared him , bumbling rustlers seem almost sympathetic characters . i very nearly found myself rooting " bad " guys . this not your typical , old-fashioned western . it more-interesting film more-believable characters .	-1

if you're looking schlocky horror movie lots excess gore , some gratuitous nudity , mad scientist , reanimated body carrying its head around it , then this movie you . re-animator one those films you hear horror fan , after watching it it very clear why . reanimator epitome tongue-in-cheek horror . without ever cracking joke , film exudes campiness bit sadistic humor . when herbert west arrives medical school answers medical student dan cain request roommate , fast paced story takes big leap . all characters bit out there . dr. hill , evil professor " thing " uptight dean daughter , who cain happens engaged , sets out steal research west worked . research resulted glowing green substance brings dead tissue back life . re-animator stays exciting entire time , story never lets up . final climactic showdown med students ( west cain ) re-animated headless dr. hill stuff horror legend . don't miss it .	-1
i really liked this film . it not groundbreaking movie any way , though . it bunch underdog kids who aren't interested football until coach comes changes their minds . throughout movie we see kids working out trying hard prepare match against other more talented ( unlikeable ) team . it pretty much same thing we've seen mighty ducks except now it football . it just typical family movie sends message children even if you're small think you don't any talent , you actually talent play football , hockey , basketball , whatever . one characters girl who doesn't know if she wants play football boys or cheerleader like all other girls . rick moranis once again plays shy , quiet character he so well other films such honey i shrunk kids . it hard believe he now country singer ( no , i'm not kidding ) . ed o'neil doesn't quite play jerk character you'd expect married children show . he not really nice guy either , though . i find it interesting team names giants ( good guys ) vs . cowboys ( bad guys ) because monday night football game this week those two teams facing each other ( giants winning )	1

i remember seeing my life when it came out ten years ago thinking it wonderful film . when i purchased it recently dvd film itself lost none its poignancy . plot film relatively few twists turns . beginning film bob jones ( played michael keaton ) diagnosed terminal cancer . jones wife , gail ( nicole kidman ) pregnant their first child , so bob decides start filming series videotapes shown son he knows he unlikely ever see . gail eventually also gets bob visit chinese healer ( hiang ngor ) , who apparently using mix traditional remedies psychology help bob . this point where film could gotten extremely corny , but director bruce joel rubin not overdo mysticism avoids taking easy way out bob make sudden dramatic recovery . healer essentially just vehicle move us into bob personal history conflicts his siblings brother extremely well . this superbly acted film . this film stars nichole kidman before she made nichole kidman films very versitile michael keaton , who coming off batman series . their strong performances buttressed supporting roles bradley whitford ( west wing ) , queen latifah ( chicago ) , michael constantine ( my big fat greek wedding ) , richard schiff ( west wing ) rebecca schull ( wings ) . it extremely deep cas t.t his emotional film , end day , someone cancer , so prepared crying end . however , instead two hours tension , film crafted so after particularly dramatic sequence you section includes some humor , mostly involving bob guidance his son . because end , when it comes , not totally unexpected , you don't finish film feeling drained ; instead , ultimate message behind plot one hope redemption . overall , film excellent if you like drama - if you looking popcorn film , this may not you . sadly , there very few extras dvd . however , if you want see well-acted , well-written , well-acted mostly serious film , you far worse than my life	-1

this series just tad too much blood my taste ... it verges horror , here there , which bugs me ; i even like super-violent action movies just fine , but brutally slaughtered recent corpse thing ( more ' personalized ' violence than killing bad guys ) not my style . this why i gave it 4 instead 5 stars . aside detail , i find this show totally addictive . brothers make ' buddy movie ' effect , whole supernatural framework creates sort non-religious yet definitely spiritual effect ( big mystery why these guys never ever seen praying show ; i actually known people who lifestyle similar what show depicts , central ) . not mention young men so passionate , powerful , strong , yet sensitive , darkly troubled past , sheer sexy it nearly intoxicating over long run many episodes . ;-) anyway -- show actual plot , it well filmed intelligently well worth watching . i recommend it	-1
woody allen plays himself , but transported russia time napoleonic invasion this delightfully side-splitting send-up both war peace begman pretentious , death-obsessed films . allen directs stars , co-star diane keaton his bizzare self-obsessed cousin/love interest excellent support cast includes harold gould ( sting , feather father ) wonderful georges ade t.t he bouyant soundtrack , based largely prokofiev lt . kije suite , real plus , on-location shots hungary stand fairly well russia . anyone who suffered through nightmarishly dull henry fonda version ' war peace ' ready this . even if you haven't seen it , you're probably ready dianne keaton marriage herring merchant or her assertion god exists , make woody his image , equally wears glasses , albeit " not those frames .

last starfighter nice little sci-fi action movie which revolutionary when it released due it use early version cgi-effects . 1984 special-effects quite new showed just what possible years come . movie itself fun simple sci-fi actioner which owes alot arcade shooters which popular during 80 . even main plotline film pretty much video game sent benevolent space-faring star league looking find few good starfighters save their federation danger zur kodan armada . lance guest plays alex rogan whose only pas t-t ime trailer-park where he lives his mother younger brother his girlfriend maggie gordon ( played 80 genre favorite catherine mary stewart ) constantly playing video game called last starfighter . alex expert skills beating game brings new wrinkle his hum-drum life which seems going nowhere . seeming con-man salesman name centauri ( played gusto energy robert preston ) comes out nowhere gives him offer opportunity out this world . rest film brings alex reluctance join star league starfighter pilot gunstar fighter . he thinks its all mistake he wasn't signing up some sort intergalactic war may just kill him . like most action movies alex epiphany what his role destiny must , some reluctance , finally takes challenge controls goes off fight zur kodan armada his lone gunstar his trusty navigator all-around lizardman mentor , grigg ( played equal parts seriousness fun dan o'herlihy ) . those like me who grew up during 80 enjoyed watching these simple but fun sci-fi movies last starfighter quite blast past which still delights entertains despite corny dialogue cheesy effects . cgi-effects gunstar kodan armada looks dated but i still can't take my eyes off screen whenever these early looking cg effects come . acting pretty standard b-movie quality everyone seeming fun premise giving it their all . there nothing write academy but end performances just enough make audience like characters . last starfighter quite underrated scifi action movie which should've better than it when it first came out . it since gained cult following video always welcome sight whenever it comes cable . movie may seem dated compared super advanced cgi-effects laden blockbusters we now but it still entertains people who grew up watching it kids who grown up since	-1

you like cop movies ? if you then you're luck . alien nation essentially cop movie ... aliens . fact it just cop movie aliens what makes this movie little groundbreaking . however like any other genre movies , this cop movie isn't perfect . it falls into some same trappings most cop movies . spite alien nation innovative science fiction genre , even if innovation itself played out nausea elsewhere . this isn't high cop drama like black rain or heat . it isn't necessarily low cop drama either like v.i. warshowski or rookie . cop drama part pretty much middle . so what makes it innovative ? well ... it aliens . one things make really good science fiction when aspects real life get represented fashion . films like aliens their viet nam war contrast , contact its spiritual belief contrast , their holocaust similarities all stand out above crowd because they compare their situations real issues . alien nation same . not buddy cop themes but themes racial hatred discrimination . instead some other ethnic minority you get alien refugees planet . you get all parallels bigotry modern society this film , they address it concise manner . said it still cop movie overall . oddly matched police officers learning accept each other , drug lord looking take over , lots gunplay cop jokes ... they all end up here . this aspect movie merely average . just like all other cop movies you seen over decades . cinematography , settings , script , style all fall victims cop movie theme they all nothing really write home when compared other police films . this doesn't mean script , cinematography other stuff i mentioned bad . it just doesn't stand out above crowd . appreciate alien nation what it : parallel society discrimination against people different than us . understand fact vehicle they used portray this , it appropriate one , clich�d cop plot . if you like cop movies sci-fi then you found winner here . rest you i won't say it overall great movie , but i say it pretty good one .	-1

comparisons 1937 classic inevitable . story-wise , there little difference except colonization remake . many frames carbon copies each other . this reviewer feels bamp ; format original added suspense . original cast clearly superior especially male leads ronald coleman , david niven . aubrey smith . also , douglas fairbanks jr. outshines james mason rupert hentzau , main bad guy . ( i wonder if stunt man performed high dive . ) nice gesture cameo role lewis stone , star 1922 silent version . it 1952 female leads who compare most favorably : deborah kerr comes very close equaling madeleine carroll lovely queen flavia , her strong (!) sense duty . jane greer probably surpasses mary astor 1937 role . both mary jane key plot . watch them closely ! blessedly , despite many frame similarities , remake not carbon copy 1937 fadeout , ronald coleman gallant wave farewell . its ' own merits , 1952 version very credible adventure story indeed . it only suffers comparison original classic it cannot possibly surpass	-1

i'm often shocked how far afield i seem drifted my fellow man ( or woman ) , but reviews netflix here tear this remarkable piece work shreds just baffling . but when i think it all context my own love appreciation this film how much it reminds me listening really raw , emotional improvisational jazz ( which even i right mood ) it occurs me this just acquired taste , like any expression creativity . all art subjective , i found this kind visual interpretation series fascinating moments stories me completely spellbound . i rented this ( which i ordered next day so i watch it over over again ) popped it late one night before bed , intending only watch few minutes but i could not bring myself stop watched entire thing . all i could say afterwards " wow " . this not conventional storytelling standard story arcs or any discernable traditional flow , that exactly why i love it ! see something really unique , spontaneous , rich , unpredictable almost voyeuristic so refreshing . i honestly didn't know ethan hawke directed this until credits rolling , judging reviews i've seen this film his books , he evokes either great loyalty recognition people or pushes buttons result scathing comments . interesting . i think it good thing . we enough cute fuzzy filmmakers out there . i love how contraints situation forced everyone more creative present because comes through loud clear . scenes kristofferson weld stunning . absolutely stunning . all actors fantastic . film random , beautiful , confusing , interesting poetic without preachy . i'd love see more films like this , but now i'll happy my dvd sharing it kindred spirits . beautiful work everyone involved . thank you	1
( i not read play nor seen it performed stage so i didn't miss features other reviewers mentioned . ) i found this thoroughly enjorable . rupert everett perfectly embodies paradoxical virtues oscar wilde ... self admitted scoundral who only speaks seriously tuesdays 1 3 . his total opposite gertrude ( blanchett ) , married her ideal husband , man she placed formidably high pedestal virtue . naturally , fall scoundral saves day . ( knowing what we wilde life we appreciate this theme even more . ) underneath his protestations superficiality he emerges real hero . that theme -- no one perfect it takes more courage love imperfect person than perfect one . but wilde doesn't bludgeon us over head message --- he delights us brilliant dialogue clever plot . if there no moral all , it would still delight watch . acting all very good . rupert everett , everyone mentioned , seems born play wilde . i disagree those who said there no chemistry him minnie driver character . i thought their scenes together most entertaining film . she genuinely funny well very beautiful . blanchett perfect her role pale , virtuous-to-boredom wife . i thought only weak link julianne moore , who seemed miscast villianess . perhaps i've seen her too many " realistic " american roles which she such depth humanity vulnerability i hard time adjusting this julianne . i thought her accent lacking she just didn't arch quality such part demanded . however she carried it off well enough not spoil enjoyment film . it definitely fun worth seeing	1

disappointing stephen king miniseries . some reason , lately i've rewatching some older stephen king miniseries i hadn't seen since they originally aired . maybe i thought they'd better without all commercials drag them . cream crop stand . dregs langoliers , worst special effects ever ... ed wood would proud . tommyknockers falls somewhere . basically it tells story how one lady ( marg helgenberger ) stumbles across mysterious little object woods , compelled unearth it . turns out its some sort alien craft power exert its " " people little maine town nearby . these people undergo gradual ( or not so gradual ) personality changes which allows them " suddenly " invent impossible machines , read each others minds , also gleefully kill anyone who seeks thwart them . that all well good . sounds like it could good , clean , gory fun . certainly , book it based . i know king himself not terribly fond book , mostly because he wrote it during height his drug alcohol additions ... but it contained some his most disturbing scenes too , believable , ultimately heartbreaking romance two leads . i always liked it myself . ( me , king nadir dark half . ) back " movie . " jimmy smits plays helgenberger boyfriend , formerly successful poet now awash alcoholism ... but trying climb out his hole . he immune power tommyknockers because steel plate his head , but goes ride much story because guilt he feels over his own behavior . eventually , things get bad enough he finally musters up courage take matters into his own hands ... rather serious consequences himself . but story told plodding manner . every compelling scene ( example , early smits reception where he drinking too much , gloriously over-the-top embarrassing moment ) there two clunkers ( cliff de young traci lords two postal employees undergoing some serious hanky-panky sorting room !! ) helgenberger smits fine , joanna cassidy local sheriff e.g. marshall kindly curmudgeon . but lengthy novel condensed so awkwardly , subplot deyoung lords given far , far too much time screen ( de young one worst actors ever get more than one role ) keep make even gamest performances worthwhile . i guess producers so tickled former porn star lords their set , they just couldn't help coming up more ridiculous things her . also , we forced see how far robert carradine ( so good " head nerd " revenge nerds all those years ago ) fallen ... he turns perfectly dreadful performance . special effects makeup quite cheesy . but many things could forgiven decent adaptation managed . but tommyknockers doomed start pitiful script , not helped uninspired direction . if you're big fan smits , cassidy or helgenberger , i guess you might want take gander . if you're fan stephen king or horror/sci-fi ... stay away !	-1
" cleopatra " got great deal noteriety when it production because romance developed elizabeth taylor richard burton . their romance got more publicity than this movie historical romance they reinacted . i guess soured me movie i never took opportunity watch it until this last weekend . i must say first half " cleopatra " quite impressive but largely due outstanding performance rex harrison julius ceasar . there added help seemingly limitless budget lot attention detail . everything settings costumes elaborate say least . addition , elizabeth taylor probably never quite so alluringly beautiful . after intermission , death julius ceasar brings mark anthony , played richard burton , leading male role . burton excellent actor but he no rex harrison ; least not " cleopatra " . part undoubtably due " tragic " character he plays comparison than " bigger-than-life " character ceasar . so it , but it bit overdone . mark anthony constantly drink his hand harder believe than richard burton constantly drink his hand . may part problem burton apparent failure mark anthony ; he may too good washed-up man . last half movie just seemed drag . it could easily cut hour length result better movie . i give it four stars based harrison talent , taylor looks 20th century fox extravagance .	-1
dead again slipped into theaters kenneth branagh while he emma thompson married working very well together . film mystery several levels : 1940s murder mystery , present day identity search , even whether reincarnation happens . branagh blended black white flashbacks modern day action seemlessly . plots twists superb , yet quiet . entire movie gives you time think what happening form your own conclusion what happen ; yet you find your conclusion wrong . although mysteries usually lose something after first viewing , when you find out how it ends , dead again actually gains . once you know how it ends , you want watch it again again look subtle clues missed first time through even try find mistakes , although i warn you , i seen it least 20 times still not found any mistakes	1

why this not success box office ? what marvelous , intelligent , thoughtful , character-driven , sweet , movie ! how great it see jennifer lopez , not cover magazine , just cutting through all nonsense some excellent , meat potatoes acting ! i'm only not giving movie 5 stars because i some problems very end movie -- i won't say what happens but i would preferred something bit more subtle . said , it still wonderful movie . they don't make many movies like this these days . rent or buy it -- it great stuff	-1

any film starts visual version " it dark stormy night " might otherwise regarded suspicion but not hands director james whale . it worth checking out ? absolutely this one whale masterpieces using humor , some creepy imagery great cast ( boris karloff , melvyn douglas , raymond massey , gloria stuart , charles laughton , ernest thesinger other notable stage vets ) create moody chiller humor . extras include thoughtful trivia filled commentary gloria stuart second commentary whale bigorapher film historian james curtis . curtis harrington provides detailed introduction how he became involved saving film , meeting whale , etc . video quality this portion so-so . transfer film looks solid although it could use more digital cleaning up ( like recently reissued editions " frankenstein " " dracula " ) . although film appears bit unsteady beginning , it improves . i personally thought contrast could improved bit well . audio sounds good but volume bit low probably could stand bit cleaning up get rid some hiss popping . follow up whale his star boris karloff " frankenstein " , this witty , cynical horror film well adapted writer ben levy . thought lost years ( original film out circulation least 44 years when william castle made his weak remake ) , director curtis harrington found copy film which this version drawn . film almost lost when universal sold rights columbia 1963 . luckily director curtis harrington ( who befriended director whale late life)while working universal asked negative pulled duplicated . otherwise film would lost firs reel this classic pretty bad shape . overall this pretty good reissue classic whale film out circulation too long . it classic right up there whale " waterloo bridge " , " bride frankenstein " , invisible man " " frankenstein " although closer tone " bride " " invisible " than his straight horror films .	1

so your wife dumped you , you carried grudge so deep so strong come up scheme frame her up murdering you sentenced life prison . well , some people would say this revenge sweet , but i don't think so . i think it too much too crazily cruel , because wife didn't really betray him , she didn't affair other man committed adultery . she just getting tired marriage fairly knew only through legal system she could dump her husband successfully . this very vicious screenplay extreme only purpose warn people soured marriage get divorced more reasonable friendly way , always leave some room yourself other .	-1

80 spawned one high school teen movie after , john hughes king genre . but somehow way among breakfast clubs pretty pinks , three o'clock high got overlooked . it quite rare when i actually meet someone who heard this comedy gem . i quite lot trouble even finding copy it dvd going purchase copy here amazon , but finally found it buy/sell/trade store hollywood . so anyway , while i am very happy finally this movie dvd widescreen first time , instead watching it my vcr recorded scratchy tape , i little dissapointed there no features whatsoever this disc ( movie reccomendations don't count , you get plenty those amazon ) . further proof not enough people know or care this movie . furthermore , casey siemaszko , star , heart soul this movie , failed develop lead actor since this movie never really got any recognition , ( he lot supporting roles late 80s such young guns , stand me back future ) which shame because he too funny this movie . movie good cast too , even though protagonist film who looks 15 years too old high school , he perfect school bully . not mention this movie best school yard fight you'll ever see . please , check this one out . john hughes isn't only one who could make good 80 highschool movies this certainly one best ones	1
( 3.5 /5 stars ) it amazing how many words phrases this film become normalized part vernacular . " awesome " one obvious example , it difficult imagine teenagers today conversing without use " like , " where it not used connote " similarity . " time its release , these rather novel . this film good soundtrack it pretty decent love story popular , middle class girl , who falls boy wrong side tracks . title role , deborah foreman quite irresistible . nicolas cage fine rough-hewn randy , though he never very believable favorite son his tough neighborhood . it embarrassing point laughter he interacts his homeboys during cruise through his neighborhood . aspect not ring true some dialogue . prime example this conversation among randy , julie , tommy stacie club hollywood , where they sit down immediately begin discussing their statuses degrees authenticity . not only it not convincing its content , transition it non-existent . gripes aside , this not bad film . however , i would not go so far say it great either . comedy , it isn't very funny . romance , their love seems based physical attributes rather than commonalities , such , not very compelling . nonetheless , elizabeth daily always delight , her role here makes this must fans . also , dvd transfer , 5.1 channel mix effort both widescreen full screen versions worth extra � star .	-1
this movie made me laughing until i cried . its really great movie . cast excellent job , especially bob saget . he awesome sooo funny	1
most those who lucky enough see this stunning srdjan dragojevic film select film festivals u.s. not forgotten its clarity , its anger , its power . movie passed up theatrical distribution , although it readily available vhs now dvd fox lorber . this dvd bust every thinkable way , although fox lorber obviously aiming very low . phrase " bare-bones " usually used describe discs given rudimentary , dismissive releases , lacking supplements more presumably marketable titles might warrant . this dvd contain trailer , but trailer , sadly , looks better than feature . " bare-bones " would fine , but watching this disc torture . it obviously quickie transfer vhs -- i could produced better amateur transfer -- loud hiss tainting soundtrack throughout , poor audio balance ( dialogue pulsing speakers artificial echo ) poor contrast , muddy , dark image , burnt-in subtitles , so forth . fox lorber long scourge art-film dvd market , their soulless neglect their titles never more apparent than this disc . new yorker wellspring ( formerly winstar ) guilty similar offenses	-1

i seen many historical war dramas far east ( mainly china ) most them not only historically inaccurate but strong bias toward enemy . yi soon shin , however , rare exception . not only drama very historically accurate but it also very comprehensive detailing meticulous battle planning admiral leads each victory but also political in-fighting chosun political factions ( second-guessing nature king ) which causes his eventual death . also , special effects great . battle scenes ( whether sea or land ) realisitic outstanding quality . only problem i find dvd not placed sufficient focus contribution ming china . then again , this not unexpected since this korean drama focusing great admiral . also , entire selection should 104 episodes . i don't know why it stops 101 . if you want more comprehensive knowledge subject , try samuel hawley imjin war ( which portrays yi soon shin more accurately quoting original sources ) . any who only intered fighting may also want check out stephen turnbull samurai invasion ( which more colorful maps detailed description battles japanese perspective ) . lastly , anyone who fan samurai warfare may want check out shogun : total war creative assembly ( now gold version ) .	1

' friday foster ' grier getting even closer ' cleopatra jones ' territory , but without fun style movie or its sequel . i slightly disappointed when i saw it because it didn't deliver typical kick ** madness you normally get pam grier movie ! storyline tame , forced political correctness only pesky whole stuff lacks violence sex , so prepare blaxploitation its mildest form ! here we pam grier , friday- magazine photographer , who given assignment covering airport arrival richest black man america . but friday gets more than she bargained this routine assignment turns into assassination attempt . because friday able get some shots would killers , her life danger . soon , everywhere she goes , people end up dead . friday investigations lead her corrupt government officials , renowned preacher eye more than bible , something called black widow . pam grier convincing lead , but not tough " coffy " or " foxy brown " ! this movie actually one best supporting casts any blaxploitation film , but fails hold up its end . if you want entertained somehow watch out performances genre greats like yaphet kotto plays grier detective buddy , julius harris her boss . plus there scatman crothers (' black belt jones ' ) , thalmus rasulala (' blacula ' ) , godfrey cambridge (' cotton comes harlem ' ) , paul benjamin (' across 110th street ' ) carl weathers (' rocky ' ) , well eartha kitt who hoot flamboyant fashion designer , isaac bartender ' love boat ' ( ted lange ) even inexplicably ' gilligan island thurston howell iii ( jim backus) ! this film some lighthearted tone comparison her other films . that not say there aren't plenty killings , but it never feels depressing , downbeat , or serious something like " coffy . " it nice change pace see grier laughing joking kotto many film scenes . action scenes good funny same time . one my personal favorites rooftop chase kotto weathers second fashion show . fashion line up just crazy because models showed no form expression going down runway while doing form vogue-dance sort scared me bit while maintaining zombie like expression across their face , you see it order understand it . i'm fan 70s blaxplotation because it reminds me my parents era fashion sense , gotta love them . i stated before " friday foster " may not spectacular film but it still welcome my movie collection .	-1
i heard it said norman maclean classic novella " river runs through it " finest piece american literature ever written . i don't understand how things like literature ranked such simple terms . i say , however , it one my personal favorites . spare , poetic spellbinding . perhaps one reasons i love this novella so because i grew up farm near rocky mountains , spent so much time when i younger fishing tracking through wood field . maclean tale speaks me my youth authentic familiar terms . i generally approach cinematic adaptations literature , particularly literature which i hold such high esteem , certain amount reluctance , even dread . who could possibly capture beautiful , simple craftmanship maclean profound prose celluloid ? evidently , robert redford . he it grace apparent ease . many maclean efficeintly magnificent words provided through narration . while i generally find device voiceover narration distasteful ( primarily because it so often used " coach " viewer ) , this case , viewer drawn into ( eased out ) macleans world macleans own prose , nothing could more appropriate or satisfying . also , cinematography nothing short spectacular , capturing magnificent , rugged expanse montana " big sky " wilderness one moment , golden intimacy afternoon river next . i dare say redford captured essence maclean abiding love his childhood wilderness this film , we , viewers , richer it . river runs through it close perfection i seen translating beloved work letters onto cinematic screen . it its flaws ? i'm sure it , there other reviews here point them out you if you care . my part , i wish only say this story love , crafted maclean love , now adapted screen redford care speaks love - love subject matter written words . macleans last words novella ( movie ) " i am haunted waters . " thanks his words , redfords faithful adaptation them , i too am haunted	1

certainly novel georges bernanos entitled journal d'un cure de campagne created its alarm its day it exposed some less spiritual more secular realities society , yet it deeply insightful still troubling examination young priest struggling live spiritual authenticity his difficult vocation diocesan priest strange cold town while slowly dying stomach cancer . fortunately bernanos portrays this priest gifted careful writer who maintains intimate diary . therefore this novel , old style liaisons dangerueses , presents its narrative guise discovered records now published . it therefore impossible film . yet bresson so admirably faithfully sincerely , great talent , technique wisdom . thankfully great criterion offers us wonderful reprint restored very recently which we may view again again this wonderful , subtle , moving film . my only choking point course subtitles which go invisible against white background appear so intrusively against black background young asthetic priest pre-vatican cassock , but then french most part spoken so slowly carefully we follow original practice , which always best any case . it also accompanied priest clearly chronicling his journal words we hear repeated , we watch him write across big screen , thus this film start graciously supplies its own subtitles original . one great advanatge this criterion edition brilliant commentary . once this helpful , unlike example ubiquitous mr. carpenter similar overdubbed commentaries , where speaker mumbles like someone who believes they know much actually parrot inanities which make you want reach forward cinema seat before you shyly demand their silence . here optional commentary said before brilliant , helpful , gracious , utterly informative thought provoking , including when nephew count speaks his fleeing foreign legion commentator draws parallel explicitly current rush war iraq grotesquely heretical hymn " onward , christian soldiers ! " every catholic should see this film remember life before second vatican council , time two wars , loneliness our parish priets their spiritual struggle quasi-hermits wilderness . it delight see old vestments , kissed embrodiered cross , hear latin blessing proper gestures . it interesting see villagers presuming our contemporary infamous evil priest regard little girls he prepares first holy communion . commentator again provides useful information regarding actor preparation this role . yet any commentary no matter how excellent , we neer take it last word . indeed , we may read young dying priest archetype death way life light coming technological wonders new way life . century he would died alone slowly like dog , portrayed here , offering up his suffering physical pain . then we see him crossing huge new train station lille struck wonder revelation if modern secular cathedral . surely this epiphany opens us jungian reading . it must least bring us reach this amazon access old copies bernanos associated commentaries cited critierion delightfully informative commentator . truly this film which merits place your dvd and/or theological library . more than five stars	1

big fan anime comedy ( intelligent , yet lame humor ) i eager see el hazard " magnificent world " . because high price set , i some hesitation ( because some poor reviews amazon ) . well , i say bad reviews wrong . this dvd series totally awesome ( although i admit it started bit slow ) . i promise more you keep watching , better it gets . plot highly intelligent ( involving dimensional time travel ) characters very interesting ( distinctive special powers ) . some say humor el hazard juvenile ( but i would argue no more juvenile then southpark ) , seriously what good comedy isn't juvenile ? some also say story sometimes too redundant ( because many episodes involve doomsday device ) , which i respond " we call original starwars trilogy redundant because they involve death star " ? no , ofcourse not . yes this dvd set lacks some extras , but i think pioneer great job . dvd menu presentation beautiful , box very elegant too . hopefully you get this set around 40 dollars ebay ( beware bootlegs ) . it very hard find good authentic set . sequel " alternative world " which i just ordered , individually should cost around 30 dollars if you shop smart . my fellow anime comedy fans , i also reccomend " niea under 7 " " his her circumstances " . animation = 5plot = 4music = 4characters = 5comedy = 4total = 4.4 star	1
someone well versed various kinds literature , someone who read ( enjoyed ) almost all tom clancy novels , professional videographer , i say , this great flick . those who upset adaptation , what you expect ? when taking 800 plus page book condensing it down two hour movie , some things going change . second third clancy movies- especially clear present danger - also adapted give harrison ford action spotlight . but now ford ageing , paramount ( who after all , business needing turn profit ) needed re-invent franchise . move make it not just new actor , but show it start jack ryan career cleverly . most all , it held true idea book , when we base our actions off our fears suspicions , our peace torn apart few depraved individuals . this movie falls into category action/thriller . such , not everything true life , but instead designed entertainment suspense . it delivers . something action category it remarkably intelligent script . it little slow beginning those who looking nothing more than explosions shootouts , but it worth it . it also better than average cinematography compared most action flicks . effects well not all cheesy , many action flicks taught us expec t.t he acting well-done , typically good performance affleck stellar performance freeman . soundtrack also fantastic , especially rendition national anthem football game . bottom line , if you're reader who expects movies scripts written like books , don't see this movie . if you accept literature movies entirely different formats entertainment then you'll probably enjoy this movie , it certainly worth ownin	1
everyone should see this movie . also , everyone should buy it so they show it their friends , so word keep spreading , hopefully finally , justice served	1

lavishly praised critics nominated several oscars , right stuff perfect movie those gung ho , flag waving patriotic gents who beatified us space program birth eventual domination skies . writer/director philip kaufman , working tom wolfe novel , certainly right stuff terms casting , visuals , editing capturing time periods 1947-1963 . rigorous training these seven astronauts also expertly displayed , quest chuck yaeger fastest man earth . exception donald moffat too cartoonish impersonation lyndon johnson , cast exemplary standout turns ed harris , scott glenn , fred ward , pamela reed annie deschanel particularly . sam shepard barbara hershey also dynamite their roles yeagar his wife . movie length frustrating , ending , which seems come out nowhere , but right stuff good moviemaking	1
i using this tape years , it one my favorites . it divided into 3 different sections ; approximately 38 minutes step aerobics , 10 minutes abs/back , 32 minutes hips , thighs , buns . all classes led keli roberts , renowned fitness instructor . step class fun , but challenge , especially if you're new step aerobics . however , each woman video doing modified version , regards height step platform , no step all , or without arm movements , or without light hand weights . keli cuing great , moves broken down where you enough chance learn them become comfortable them before next one taught . same time , there some moves which prove confusing may frustrate someone who new routine , such transitioning across step , repeating routine opposite side before crossing back over again . effect , doing this helps you alternately work each leg , but it might confusing first until you get into flow things . ab section great , 10 minutes just enough time . movements very slow controlled , so you work muscles hard . it probably one my favorite ab routines out all videos i own . lastly , there hips , thighs , buns section . you lot standing leg work ; squats , leg presses , etc . they very tough you may need work up some repetitions . then , there some floor work ; leg lifts both inner outer thighs . usually , i step abs class , or abs legs class . i don't know i'd energy all 3 classes one day . it easier break things up . but nevertheless it great workout	1
honestly beat street best breakin video out there period . this like orgin hip hop music , dancing grafitti this day . storyline alright not going go into details but it send out positive message everyone there even today . honestly just buy movie why read this review !!	1

i'm not sure how they could made 1900 house better . when participants break rules they point out how things would really 1900 . it ludicrous suggest producers could created more context show . so - create lavish social conditions ( more participants , social gatherings , etc . ) - would well beyond scope budget project . viewer response this show versus colonial house also revealing . 1900 house participants broke rules all time - they bought shampoo , they treated maid better than victorian family would , etc . more importantly , father children lives outside home modern era . essentially , these people it easy compared colonial house who mandated zero contact anything remotely modern . it seems critics colonial house political agenda . any all criticisms participants breaking rules this somehow ruining show mindless . living they past , whether it us colonial era or 1900 victorian london , would misery vast majority people living western world . people aren't robots . if you want show where all actors appear follow rules watch fictional drama . but then , all you'll watching professional actors playing part . you won't seeing people live , suffer even enjoy lifestyles past - which whole point making these programs first place . last word : 1900 house , like colonial house , great television adults children alike . it our loss more programs like this aren't produced	1
course , 20/20 hindsight always nice cases like this , but , i huge supporter this film when it still ' against country ' so ... i reviewed it back then ' ' publication , , course , we know , many people lost their jobs over such ' treasonous act ' ... ( fortunately , i not one them ... ) ... but time revealed ( almost ) all bush administration lied get-go lying ever since ... contrary one or two stragglers who still think bush won florida ... knock it off !!!!!!... when ' so-called ' recount , it never took into account all ' illegal ' butterfly ballots candidates names both sides ballot ( which againast florida state law ) , causing many vote pat buchanan accident ... ( no mention disinfranchised democrats who weren't allowed vote due republican strong-arming ... ) , sad fact , now , i would still tell anyone left america wicked ways this administration , just goes prove some , no matter how much truth placed before them , still ignore common sense follow path leads their own destruction ... next time , this country better not wait ' bell curve ' catch up those who already know ..	1

physical fitness not just quot ; young beautifulquot ; ann smith ably demonstrates her video audience . she performs each seven stretches enviable grace flexibility . i told my spouse , quot ; if old woman it , then so iquot ;; he thought would good name tape ! ann demonstrates each exercise twice - first time she provides voiceover describing what you're doing ; second time you same exact exercise ( same clip shown twice ) no verbal cuing . i would like her talk little more form you're doing exercises ; visual imagery helps me figure out what i'm supposed doing whether i'm doing it right or not . i also wish she would talk you through second time well , because when i'm twisting away screen or hanging down my head , i can't see what she doing , i either fall behind her or worry i . even though these very short stretch exercises meant each morning , it also works combine them all nice 20-minute stretch . it feels great	1

waiting godot dubbed " tragicomedy " there doesn't seem any other word better suited describe this play . random wandering personalities vladimir estragon , main characters , lend amusing air entire work . however , their inability accomplish anything or even grasp what really going around them inspires some sympathy ( irritation ) , though it may weaker or stronger depending how strange book strikes you . unless one goes into waiting godot expecting existentialism it somewhat confusing , may seem bit more pointless than it meant . knowing little bit beckett his beliefs probably make it more enjoyable , but it interesting well written enough stand its own . what i love most this book beckett ability make absurd seem so close reality . vladimir estragon most certainly not your average joe , but lot what they say seems familiar most time rather humorous . waiting gogot really what you make it , because while its core it just story two confused homeless men , it also meaningful slightly endearing tale . go looking meaning , knowing how beckett means get things across , i think this play end up reading much better than if one goes just cold . short read , worthwhile , i would say , least its originality humor	1

i'm familiar most information this movie but i suspect lot people , working middle class ( which i'm part so i know what i'm talking ) not . they too busy watching fox news listening talk radio . i hope enough people who disenchanted bush administration their shrinking personal budget would occasionally watch movie such this . it how media biased because it owned corporate america . how deregulation telecommunications act hurts our nation . they buying up small independent stations . corporate america republicans would love regulate internet because there too much information they prefer we didn't know . they try use some pseudo-intellectual reason censor internet euphemist language ( like they patriot act ) brainwash unquestioning citizens our country . please watch this family member or friend who open or ready re-think their right wing views .	1

macbeth comes japan , although it set feudal times sometimes feel classic noh play , kurosawa borrows freely shakespeare : there prophecies evil spirit ; there lady macbeth feeding fire her husband ambition madly trying wash blood off her hands ; , course , there birnam woods moving toward castle end . toshiro mifune macbeth , final scene he barraged countless arrows classic . isuzu yamada lady macbeth , she puts virtuoso performance frightening proportions . movie very atmospheric - foggy woods , braying horses , eerie musical score - only adds its intensity ; but it also poetic moving its own unique way . it brilliant piece filmmaking .

gift chilling tale set south written billy bob thornton , talented man also wrote sling blade . first off , it impossible anyone give this movie less than 3 stars . why ? because incredible cast . here , you'll find probably one best casts ever . it cate blanchett , hilary swank , greg kinnear , actor whom i can't remeber his name but who brilliant keannu reeves . keannu reeves ? good actor ? damn straight . he brilliant this movie deserved oscar nomination best supporting actor . i am not kidding . his performance remarquable ! movie widow , mother 3 , making her money psychic . but , she gets involved woman whose abusive boyfriend ready anything . this psychic scared mother only seems loved watched over one person . only one . you'll find one out your own . this movie packed suspense me edge my seat . so , watch this brilliant movie i definitely add my collection	1
seven samurai greatest film made perhaps world greatest film director . string films rashomon red beard represents almost unbroken run classic films ( all but one starring toshiro mifune ) , not least fact akira kurosawa able infuse humanism populism amongst chaos indifference wide variety settings . individuals could make difference indifferent society ( ikiru , red beard ) or work together common cause ( seven , sanjuro ) , while other films inhumanity class culture ( lower depths , stray dog , high low ) laid bare . yet other times , it could seen kurosawa soured idea society could change better films like bad sleep well record living , giving way chaos fortress blood yojimbo . but whether pessimistic or optimistic , kurosawa films seldom fail both entertain inform . seven samurai principle strength it manages both extraordinarily high level . film this length ( three hours 27 minutes ) there almost no wasted footage ; nothing here simply there pretty fill-in slow patch . everything purpose ; there nothing mysterious motivations bandits , conflicting attitudes villagers , quiet charisma kambei ( takashi shimura ) which binds samurai cause which there little gained besides meal possibly death . beginning there logical progression human action relation problem . viewer feeling film completeness other epic films strive but fail achieve . although times it may seem otherwise viewer weaned non-stop violence or cheap emotion , seven never dull polemic . humor abounds , conflicts villagers and/or samurai often accentuated elicit maximum ( but never melodramatic ) emotional effect . even during periods quiet contemplation , kurosawa won't let incongruities human existence escape unnocticed : kyuzo sits under tree reflecting flower he picked , instant later he rises kill two bandits just serenely . when they come , battle sequences given over realism , not style ; watching attack bandits ' hideout , we amazed unlike stylized wire-fu current films , we see men who don't time pose simply hacking away before they get hacked . final battle sequence , kurosawa turns up authenticity fever pitch . we become so involved fighting ourselves time na�ve , innocent katsushiro overcome bloodlust we too disappointed all bad guys already dead . unlike original criterion release , film split two discs rather than one , apparently accommodate slightly improved video transfer two additional audio tracks , one new 5.1 dolby surround sound , other new commentary track . michael jeck audio commentary holdover first release , me it preferable since like film it lean point -- doesn't drown out film track , so one enjoy film benefit jeck explaining cultural idiosyncrasies film technique . new commentary track split half-dozen film critics , one taking over particular section film other . this gimmick times disconcerting , while it may some interest hear variety opinions , fact they don't compete one means we don't learn anything much new . one might expect three-disc set there few supplements ( whether they worth $49.99 price tag may matter conjecture ) . most interesting me these " my life cinema " which kurosawa discusses evolution his art . outset interviewer tells him his tall stature not " typical " japanese ; discussion goes , apparently neither conformist japanese stereotype apply him . despite his reputation set , here we see often bemused , modest self-deprecating individual ; " foreigners treat us ( japanese filmmakers ) like vips ; japan we're treated like tramps " he jokes one point . two additional documentaries serviceable overview film ( " it wonderful create " series ) samurai film genre , " seven samurai : origins influences . " there also small booklet which contains few brief comments variety individuals , one greater interest provided mifune , who like some other great actors our time didn't take himself or his profession too seriously . we certainly get sense mifune proud part seven samurai , but fun doing it , matter . if film ever deserved special edition treatment , it seven samurai . i would preferred more thorough penetrating making-of documentary film this caliber , i suspect price may scare away all but most devoted film aficionados . still , if you it , you it .	1
after watching this movie one friday night i immediately watched it again . " i just see " my initial reaction . fantastic film sticks you weeks . initially rented local blockbuster before purchasing it via amazon , i watched it over 6 times before returning it back . i loved cat stevens soundtrack it makes me sad there no harold maude soundtrack all songs especially " tea tillerman " . you appreciate brilliant directing although it considered " creepy " it never truly unsettling , but rather it makes you examine how you add value life myself created ways maude-a-licous !	1

all hateful self-centered characters idiotic plot lines this movie , one i found most offensive one involving emilio estevez/andie macdowell . isn't stalking hilarious ? isn't kirby cutest obsessed stalker you've ever seen ? i bet stalking victims everywhere wish their stalker lovable little kirby . i also loved end when ally sheedy tells andrew mccarthy judd nelson she just wants them " all friends " . which they both reply classic cinema line , " ehhhh ... ok .

two my best friends living their last days when philadelphia made . one them went dr. whose office used opening scenes , receiving experimental drug precursor today more successful cocktails . i watched them struggle time when reagan wouldn't even say word aids public . bush wasn't much better . so film come out tried its best tackle most tragic disease our lifetime , one touched me personally , well , i am willing forgive couple shortcomings . it monumental film anyone struggling aids , those who helped support them , giving us all one first voices permeated psyche our country , beyond boundaries ny sf . now i just learned good 14 years after fact , one those best friends , tim pettifer , among guys waiting room " one foot banana peel other grave " which included here . his characteristic modesty , he never mentioned it might produced , it released after he died . i'm going buy it course , am filled nervous anticipation ( dread ) thought seeing him come back " life " . i've never stopped grieving this loss . my point work effort went into this film went far beyond hollywood acting such . it spoke truth , time , not talked intelligently , if all . one tim caregivers , i know fact there so much philadelphia spot . film bears witness excrutiating moment time , when most our nation total denial . sadly , not much changed	1

whenever people hear sofia coppola they think 2 things : her much-maligned performance godfather iii , her famous dad francis ford coppola , director godfather films apocalpyse now . latter particular fodder nepotism remarks , although it not if her dad made some stellar movies lately . " jack " anyone ? well this film her next film lost translation should tip scale her favor she quite perfect this kind material . 5 lisbon sisters live extremely sheltered lives thanks their over-protective parents , particular their mother . after one them commits suicide , boy starts liking one them prompting bring some friends meet rest . infatuation develops pretty soon they start getting into something when it over , they still don't know how make sense it . one things sometimes happen film like this order explain story , certain characters moments dropped or just never filmed . while i'm certainly not faulting film , we're never really invested enough into each girl who they . fact i couldn't actually name them until someone film actually . it not big knock but it one thing i noticed . performance-wise it pretty solid across board , including kirsten dunst agains t-t ype role james woods . usually very manic , he quite sedate here which quite perfect dad . there also almost unrecognizable kathleen turner very strict mother even quick scene danny devito giovanni ribisi narrator . dvd definately needs special edition even though what else could there add besides making-of , deleted scenes commentary ? than again lost translation seemed kinda sparse . commentary this disc anyone would've great , even francis would've great one kind critique/overview his daughter first film . i mean this guy godfather , surely he could've given professional review this ? it hard say which film better but this film quite good one regardless proof one really bad performance doesn't make everything else terrible	1
supercomputer takes over world , eh ? sounds like rather unbelievable plot , except this movie they make it believable . , if you believe they'd make computer first place controls all nuclear bombs u.s. , which i very hard time believing most people who make war machines would install some kind manual safety . this movie starts out optimistic which makes it bit dull start , but halfway through it becomes very intense . ending very chilling , makes me wish there couple hours . i give it 4 stars because it bit slow predictable start , but it builds builds until end scares pants right you	1
i love this little story relationship two sisters . performances heartfelt score haunting . it still gets me :	1
oscar winning documentary studies career robert strange mcnamara , savior ford motor company , architect viet nam war , patron saint golbalization economy , self-justifier par excellence , ( imho ) one greatest villains 20th century . ( ok , hes not level stalin or hitler or walter o'malley , but hes close ) . film manages remain even handed its subject , something i would never able , level it should appreciated . i think his fans come away seeing him tragically flawed hero , his detractors ( like me ) come away seeing him vile [ ... ] he . movie demands you think , alone it should seen any person interested americas role world .	1
most likely this review not very helpful anyone , but i wanted comment how beautifully this film . i am long time u2 fan seen rattle hum , but didn't get around purchasing dvd until late 2005 . fact music wonderful given , but cinematography just astounding . i love how you get see everything every point view . you get see what band sees around stage , including breathtaking sea fans . you get see what fans see -- spectacular lighting silhouettes . you get hear what guys think feel off-stage well . course you get passionate music . film beautiful watch it listen . i couldn't ask more	1
this not type movie you watch while distracted or doing something else . i went show see this movie not get it all , so i rented it see what i missing . show , it just seemed like lot shooting , guy trying deal his dramatic girlfriend , trigger happy brother , family man who fighting bad guy lifestyle , very confused brother who doesn't know whether he wants rockstar or gangster . four meet find out who killed their brother although other three realize this may heavier than they thought , there always one testosterone heavy guy who think he superman . mr. testosterone ringleader many fights , shoot-outs , all four unite justice . this movie proof how brother bond , regardless race , when loyalty comes into play . i'm definitely glad i gave it second chance . side note : soundtrack music point . classic music artists like temptations marvin gaye play background , which makes this modern day western even cooler . i wish scene angel character bathtub could've shown deleted scenes so i could see whether it looked believable , but i cracked up " bobby teases jack " scene . i wish would've left movie make bobby character more human ( hilarious ) . my only problem this movie mark wahlberg saying n-word . i don't care how much or how long his character supposed streets : there still certain barriers not crossed . other than , great movie	1
this actually very enjoyable film , kenneth mars turning very funny performance . donny marie osmond such wonderful musical talents , i only wish film incorporated more them singing . it lot like old elvis movies . it just fun watch ! i only wish this would released dvd ...	1
throne blood masterpiece one world greatest film makers height his powers . only kurosawa could take essence shakespearian stage drama incorporate it into medium film dynamic tour de force . yet same time he remains faithful elements noh ( stagy traditional japanese play-form which design movement minimalized ) . seeming contradiction , dynamism static-ness yet kurosawa masters both same medium . usual ; acting , writing , cinematography , sound , direction production all pitch perfect . this second shakespearian based film kurosawa , focus interplay fate , free fine thread human psyche uses weave two together . more simpler level it man living dying sword . short what goes around comes around . what comes around toshiro mifune he gets his just deserts scene straight arrow , perfect direction kurosawa leading quite pointed culminatin events ( pun intended ... see movie you'll understand ) . bonus features include excellent linear notes well superb commentary donald richie . few people more knowledgeable film japanese film then he . commentary almost interesting movie itself . usual criterion presents its film pristine condition . some may complain criterion too pricey but them you get best cinema offer . you cannot go wrong . one kurosawa masterpiece packs more poignancy , punch philosophy then 10 lesser films thus you get 10 times movie 5 times price , really quite deal if you look it way .	1
not exactly concert video , but not really documentary either . few concert videos i've seen ( including u2 " elevation " ) single edited concert , largely limited handful cameras angles . contrast , " rattle hum " shows series different concerts around us during their joshua tree tour incredible camera angles put you right stage . but it goes bit beyond shows some rehersals recording sessions some new songs , some backstage shots , few brief interviews , but not point where you would really call it " documentary . " edge really puts it best when he says ( film ) , " it music . " most film black white , which comes across very cool . exception color footage sun devil stadium , sudden contrast more than half-way through adds " coolness " factor . there quite few notable songs dvd such " exit , " " bad , " emotional " sunday bloody sunday " bw ; " or without you , " " running stand still , " " bullet blue sky " color ( just name few ! ) . also excellent parts bb king " when love comes town " gospel choir harlem " still haven't found what i'm looking . " my opinion , most versions dvd better than recorded versions or what included cd . ahhh , who am i kidding ... i think whole thing cool	1
highly recommended example how stage sequence complex scene . if you like black comedy , you should enjoy " confessions american girl " . rena ( jena malone ) embodiment old cartoon where guy sitting ground noose around his neck broken rope his hand ; captioned " some people can't anything right " . rena lives mobile home her somewhat " strange " family , suicide challenged , pregnant guy who doesn't want seen public her , blames it all unfair eight year absence her loving father , who prison murder . her dim idealic memories her father somewhat biased . highway its exit ramps metaphors her life her desire end her life . film not quite good " ghost world " but much same tone feel . alicia witt plays rena half-sister . because malone witt arguably most intelligent actresses hollywood , you immediately wonder wisdom casting them moronic trailer trash . but malone special talent playing this kind " slack-jawed " character witt standard sarcastic teen character works fine even this environment . their scenes together best ones film ; their reconciliation scene toward end especially good . brad renfro good job rena brother , o-lon jones ( remember waitress seinfeld " bubble boy " episode ) excellent small role clifton collins jr. great buddy , prison trustee , who quickly sizes up situation sets forces change motion . while " american girl " above average film , its main scene ( picnic prison which actually takes up majority film ) pushes it into cinema classic territory . this scene example way storytelling should , pacing absolutely inspired . it staged perfectly buddy orchestrates sequence revelations changes all four visiting family members . even if you hate subject this film it worth watching just see how wonderfully they manage this climatic scene . disasterous visit over , family leaves prison statement " it went better than it could " . then again , what i know ? i'm only child .	1
one best reasons , any rate . one hour pure uncut slapstick insanity directed mgm gonzo animator , tex avery . must any animation fan	1
i love this movie it gained somewhat cult standing amongst several my friends since we first saw it two years ago . story definitely interesting ( random people awake find themselves trapped endless series cubes , some which equipped lethal traps ) primarily what holds up movie because script acting only mediocre . because they such weak elements , script acting become comical if you try not take them too seriously . i think this best way watch this film , otherwise you may come away it thinking it purely awful . instance some dialouge includes lines like " you all sniffing glue all your lives ? " " i see inside people like f*ckin ' ray !. " funny , right ? not kind dialouge you take seriously believe . however , story very cool movie offer some frightening moments , but overall i would recommend this film comedy . maybe that just my twisted sense humo	1
no matter how preposterous or cliche film bare premise may sound , if larry cohen name attached it , you certain it interesting entertaining piece cinema . cohen scripts films always filled lots wild imagery ( both literal figurative ) , often complex themes , lots sophisticated satirical subtext . his 1982 opus : winged serpent no exception , despite whatever goofy-sounding title may seem imply . usual , writer/director cohen tongue-in-cheek film sidesteps usual horror cliches instead delivers fairly tight story , interesting characters , clever dialog , ton subtle yet witty social metaphor . yes , there also little nudity gore . titular quetzalcoatl , flying serpentine god ancient aztecs who summoned modern-day manhattan via bizarre sacrificial rituals performed contemporary aztec priest . since its arrival big apple borough , humongous beastie swooping down unsuspecting pedestrians , swimmers , sunbathers chowing down , but police initially skeptical eye-witness reports giant flying reptile but loss any other explanation . enter street thug opportunist jimmy quinn ( michael moriarty ) . inadvertently stumbled across q nest , quinn willing give information cops -- price . special fx : winged serpent , especially stop-motion animation serpent itself , admittedly cheesy . but fx aren't really point far cohen concerned ; they're just window dressing . instead , his usual satiric flair , cohen uses film take some playful pokes modern western lifestyle . example , : winged serpent draws several sardonic parallels ancient pagan religions modern christianity . notes one cop after learning details aztec sacrificial ritual : quot ; victim heart ritually removed presented god . luckily , all we today eat wafer drink wine -- ? civilized . quot ; several shots chrysler building , cohen makes deliberate visual comparisons modern architecture ancient aztec temples . acting film pretty good overall , cohen manages coax especially outstanding performance actor michael moriarty . role opposite conservative types he usually plays , moriarty hilarious yet believable sympathetic dim-witted , hapless hood who hopes sell his knowledge q whereabouts city authorities cool $ 1,000,000 . david carradine ( kung fu fame ) pretty good turn city detective charge case , richard roundtree -- cinema tv original shaft -- delightful carradine partner . cute candy clark , nominated oscar her performance 1973 american graffiti , also great job minor role moriarty live-in girlfriend . blue underground dvd release : winged serpent must-have cohen fans . it offers nearly pristine digital transfer film its original aspect ratio 1.85 : 1 ( 16x9 enhanced ) , audio options include original mono , excellent stereo remix , dolby 5.1 track , dts 6.1 track . bonus features include informative entertaining running commentary cohen his protege bill lustig , well teaser trailer , photo gallery , some dvd-rom-only goodies . short , : winged serpent may not cohen best flick , but it pretty good one won't disappoint fans writer/director or fans b-movie horror . blue underground dvd well worth price admission	1

successful describing what cuba all , this film also life . it made me think , not only this writer case , but great writings or other creative works made prison . there something prison force us grasp nature life . or perhaps it also said nothing kill truly liberal mind . movie , english spoken among cubans cuba , whereas suddenly they start speaking spanish without translation . i find it very annoying . it makes perfect sense if they spoke spanish cuban prison start speaking english after he left cuba . i live miami am surrounded thousands cubans , so i know cubans cuba not typically speak english conversations among themselves . i don't mind subtitles while scene cuba , i wish what what they . unfortunately this language mix-up reason why i cannot give 5 stars .	1
heroic tale individualistic morality no identifiable political overtones many suggest but philosophical one confronting threat wrong doing proper action . movie not romantic theme one against many nor moral crusade but clearly stresses impact one few or many . when put into difficult choices imperative ones conscience needs only moral guide ruling passion plays leading role this movie . fact marshall kane confronts murderer resolve keeping peace harmony town doubled later his quaker wife acting against her pacifistic philosophy thwarting murderous outlaw miller case point clear situation confronting evil individual matter despite common folk wisdom day shared apathetic town who remain isolationist despite clear present danger outlaw miller return wreak havoc not only marshall but possible return into anarchy lawlessness once ruled prior kane triumph first time around . movie poses few aspects governing life . 1 . one man make difference overall moral compass ? 2 . why people act fearfully when confronting wrong ? 3 . when it acceptable go against majority opinion society when society wrong ? 4 . need times quick decision making even when odds stacked against you . movie depicts these questions answers forcibly side justice righteousness . indeed this dvd collectors edition classic film , not ordinary western but boasts 2 audio restoration versions , trailers , commentary interviews housed paper ingrained slipcase . heroic tale bravery remains believable .	1

this what science fiction supposed , thought provoking . excellent imagery . superb plot . well developed . wonderful ending .	1
this movie affectionately received title " lysol movie " my house , because it eliminated 99.9% unnecessary garbage movies filled today . swearing low ( less than ten times whole movie , i think what i counted ) there absolutely no inappropriate jokes , clothing , or anything . this definitely breath fresh air ! almost every movie polluted lately , my christian family this movie so welcomed . story line ingenious . far fetched , sure , but so pirates everyone loves . ( i am no way comparing two movies , pirates completely different , but they both storylines based something real exaggerated ) it pretty historically correct ; benjamin franklin really write silence dogood letters , clock tower 100 dollar bill really say 2:22 ! nicholas cage fantastic job portraying ben , riley just hilarious . no matter how many times i've seen this movie , he always cracks me up . this best action movie made lately because everyone watch it . little kids don't leave certain parts ; sure , it not perfect , but that why i call it lysol movie	1
lot people say 1974 version this movie better , filled more action raw feel it . true . but i wasn't growing up then , hence cars , actors scenes not my generation so i like new one . besides above " elenor " car chase scene 40 minutes original only 20-odd minutes this one which good thing because today fickle audience not sit through 40 minutes run-around leave alone anything else . nicolas cage pretty convincing job " memphis " car thief who it thrill because allegedly cars beg stolen not gain or glory . nobel eh ! modern day robin hood . lovely angelina jolie miniscule role this movie -more eye candy than anything else- not actually contribute but she still lovely isn't she ? i told friend i am not " real chase movie watchers " well , thank god what i say . if i led such monotonous life i would surely die . besides that what ps2 - harebrained car chases last longer than 8 10 hours . verdict : overall i think movie struck decent balance remaking classic living moment . good movie watch over over again-ish . rating : 4 stars creditable performance true possible original without loosing any integrity .	1
yes this " worth it " . i took my younger brother three movies our teens , apocalypse now , deer hunter spinal tap . older sis i forget near death face he wore after first two(of course he'll never forget it ) but utter outrage his 14 year old zeppelin playing , doors 24/7-loving self displayed after tap ... ah i recall ever after . ( usually any girlfriend comes around ) . he took it all actual documentary , no mockumentary concept ken , while i laughed myself into aisles jokes i still love ... he incenced . " what hell kind band ? " ... he livid . okay you there but only thing funnier than this movie watching it someone who so rockraged they arching off walls . so seeing this lovely " special edition " off it went this july his present his 42nd birthday . " very damn funny " my greeting . it terrific present added stuff bring few more laughs . admittedly nothing tops stonehenge dance dwarves .. but it just all fun . more fun . if i could haul this show it first year teacher luncheon entertainment i could watch my brother routine all over again most staff i work just living " what this " land ... ah would supremely satisfying . send someone today	1

my watching this film resulted conversation friend beginning politics spiraling down future our world . premise film disturbing say least . i never true fan charleton heston who my opinion always overacted . however , edward . robinson seemed comfortable playing this character he many different roles he played . his performance truly heartfelt , bringing mind current debate " ending one own life dignity " . i shutter think this life it should though . but robinson character acted decision counterfeit courage ultimate hopelessness accompanied it such way you could very well empathize him . i found other actors somewhat bland . perhaps this acting point time , but some actors make most roles others cannot . story line unique , but script lacking . re-make today steven spielberg might worthwhile seeing . perhaps most striking element i took this film unshakeable chilling unsettling feeling this could very well our world if we not wake up	1
i must admitt this movie hard rate . i love evil witch belladonna who appears this movie i like her cousin annabelle(the pink whippet ) says more than 4 lines . thing takes this rating down would plot . who hasn't heard real ' christmas carol ' thousand times already ? it really just like all rest characters adgth . i'm big fan adgth(i webisite it too)but plot gets boring when you've heard it thousand times . i give this movie 5 stars out five characters 2 out five originallity . go which ever matters more	1

i've watched this movie dozens times since i child . i love it . i understand it doesn't follow book exactly , but they making movie , not filming book . actor who played mary wonderful . character colin annoyed me somewhat , but i don't love every character story adore it . i love romance ending , but i very sad dickon died . soundtrack incredible ; i read review where reader said she found herself humming soundtrack even though she hasn't seen movie quite some time . you're not only one ! it haunting say least . only discrepancy i found movie this : if movie flashback mary , then how could she remembered certain scenes , such archibald craven dreaming his wife when he alps , conversation mrs. medlock dickon mother ? never made sense me , even child . i explain myself she simply remembering time period movie simply including all parts story . last thing scared bee-jeebies out me child scene beginning when cat jumps mary . all all , i love this movie watch it dozens more times .	1

`a mighty wind ' funny , it actually really funny ... it just such disappointment when you come off brilliance `best show ' . so , `a mighty wind ' follows same mockumentary premise ( i just love these type comedies ) it stars same cast except instead eccentric dog owners we ex folk singers . so this famous record producer dies commemorate his life they decide get his three biggest acts reunite perform concert his honor . `best show ' mvp parker posey not highlight this time around , instead it eugene levy who plays mitch like constipated manic depressant . jennifer coolidge , while only like 2 minutes movie , me rolling floor especially when they all humming . great comedy , while not up par it predecessor , still makes quite impression	1

spanish-born actor javier bardem gives staggering performance cuban poet reinaldo arenas , which lucky since he almost every frame this film . fact , he only constant biopic sometimes feels disjointed bit long-winded , piecing together it various episodes arenas ' life sometimes sacrificing narrative flow process . same time , this powerfully moving film displays intensity post-revolution persecution experienced cubans more effectively than either carlos eire memoir , " waiting snow havana " , or hollywood confections such sydney pollack " havana " or richard lester " cuba " . director julian schnabel , artist himself who previously directed film celebrity graffiti artist jean michael basquiat , jumps back forth like abstract painter clarifying time periods employing captions . we first see arenas ' birth 1943 rural cuba followed glimpses his poverty-stricken childhood . story then moves forward 1958 just before castro rose power when arenas becomes revolutionary living eastern cuba . 1964 , both open gay intellectual , arenas ' writings made him anathema castro regime . next fifteen years , he shuttles back forth jail freedom , arenas ' story sheds much light difficult living member not just one but two minorities . highly visual terms , schnabel creates striking tableau life cuba shows how getting out cuba not easy decision natives make , arenas , like most cubans , makes it only begrudgingly first . imagine give up everything fleeing . there vividly filmed sequence all-night party abandoned convent houses homemade hot-air balloon ( shades jules verne ) which one them decides escape selfishly fatally . there also some powerful scenes show humiliating torture arenas experienced prison ending finally his escape ultimately his departure cuba mariel harbor exodus 1980 one castro " undesirables " . arenas then went into exile new york living his former lover , lazaro . sadly , soon after his arrival america , he became ill aids . american sequence short , allowing maximum time cuba ordeal makes up most film . charismatic bardem superb capturing emotional combustion his character life . there few guest appearances somewhat undermine story realism , nearly unrecognizable turn sean penn cuban peasant dual roles , johnny depp sadistic , closeted lieutenant transvestite named bon bon , who entertains prisoners el moro prison . use english versus spanish seems more director discretion than actual circumstances within scenes . but these forgivable indulgences since schnabel made valuable film telling tale cuban struggle hardship type we surprisingly don't see often film . 133 minutes , it seem bit overlong , but arenas packed full life his 47 years . most importantly , schnabel successfully paints picture depicting influences behind arenas ' writing : his difficult childhood , his conflicted feelings his mother , coming terms his sexuality , revolution cuba , pain outcast his own country . one might expect painter , schnabel uses images effectively words advance story . most simple quite beautiful , such early scene rainstorm turns into raging torrent water , later shot countless prison inmates dangling bars soap outside their jail cells , or flashes snow falling new york arenas his friend lie speeding convertible . nevertheless , because arenas , writer , dealt words , it impossible tell his story without embracing this component , bardem economical voiceovers attest aspect dramatically effective manner . strongly recommended spite relatively minor flaws . dvd also includes interesting french television interview real arenas 1983	1
this honestly one best films i've ever seen my entire life . actually it so good , i am compelled write review ....... something i've never before . i first saw this movie home cable . when i started watching it , i really didn't think much it ( almost expected it mediocre actually ) because i hadn't once heard anything good ( or bad ) . i figured movie profound i found out it should least created some sort stir among someone i knew ... i haven't gone through all reviews , so i don't know if this mentioned prior me mentioning it here , but what really struck chord me(and actually what movie teaches you general ) everything happens your life effects you . it affects how you look things future , it affects your confidence , it affects your attitude , etc . okay , maybe this course given but bigger meaning seeing this movie really opens your eyes seeing what always said really true !! especially when you see it front you like . seeing it your face really goes show how individual attitude towards events their live go either one way or . end , life you live go one way or too ;) basically , everything occurs us ... we control how we react therefore how it affects our future . event not control us ; rather we control how event affects us after it occurs . very quantum theory/kabbalahistic/spiritual i would say . i actually plan watching this movie time time ( " what bleep we know ) order keep this important point forefront my mind :)	1
given pornography multi-jillion-dollar-a-year business , it sort surprising it hasn't received cinematic treatment more often , but boogie nights provides it sort skewed , darkly comic treatment it almost certainly deserves , becomes certifiable classic process . following story eddie adams , simple-minded , almost impossibly well-endowed teenager suburban california who achieves porn stardom dirk diggler before turning 20 , boogie nights both time-tested star-is-born-and-almost-blows-it-all story loving tribute time place probably never replicated individuals who made it what it . paul thomas anderson directing excessive stylish you'd expect movie centered porno industry , anderson pulling out every trick book -- long tracking shots , underwater closeups , montages , movie-within-a-movie views , some moments approach stream-of-consciousness ( dirk vision his professional name literally exploding off neon sign prominent example ) . naturally , anderson also loads movie up period details , right down farah fawcett poster teenage dirk room , platform shoes , obligatory disco sequences . its visual flair aside , though , boogie nights also sort insanely quotable , watch-it-until-you've-memorized-it movie seemed come out droves nineties ( trainspotting , fargo , goodfellas , swingers , true romance , etc . etc . etc . ) but disturbingly short supply this decade . this movie simply seems everything you think going it , especially its murderer row cast -- burt reynolds ( jack horner ) , don cheadle ( buck swope ) , john . reilly ( reed rothchild ) , julianne moore ( amber waves ) , william . macy ( little bill ) , luis guzman ( maurice rodriguez ) , tom jane ( todd parker ) , philip baker hall ( floyd gondolli ) , philip seymour hoffman ( scotty jay ) , alfred molina ( rahad jackson ) all figure prominently -- even wahlberg ( dirk himself ) heather graham ( rollergirl ) roles perfectly suited their relative limitations actors . said , what really gives movie its resonance obvious sympathy which it treats its characters , who generally easy laugh but equally easy like . main characters almost entirely hopes , aspirations , attachments beyond rather closed world their profession--jack desire serious filmmaker ; dirk ridiculous pseudo-karate reed equally ridiculous poetry ; buck goal opening his own stereo store ; amber attempts get back touch her son , which she blatantly compensates mothering her co-stars -- helping us see them fleshed-out characters , not just plot devices story . since there isn't really plot speak , movie told series episodes , goodfellas-style , several extended pieces -- pool party jack house where eddie/dirk gets introduced whole crew ; new year eve party celebrating start ' 80's; fake drug deal gone bad rahad house -- serving turn narrative new directions . this last set piece -- when dirk , reed , todd head over rahad house sell him some baking soda disguised cocaine it quickly degenerates into laughably misguided robbery attempt -- deserves special mention , it easily one most fascinating single scenes recent film memory . it starts off almost surreal , skinny chinese guy walking around randomly lighting firecrackers rahad ( clad only underwear , bathrobe slippers ) discoursing semi-coherently he sings not-so-classic 80 songs mixtape . there it just gets progressively darker tenser , lighting , acting , direction all perfectly serving ratchet up feeling desperation horror todd kicks his ill-conceived robbery plot into motion things spin way out control . molina over-the-top performance , more than anything else , makes scene , he turns rahad into manic ball drug-fuelled energy , later , shotgun-toting avenging angel determined take his revenge . i wouldn't say molina turns best performance i've ever seen movie , but it it probably best performance i've seen someone who only got one scene whole movie . ' 80 , course , hangover joys previous decade , emergence video downgrades quality product , cocaine suddenly becomes addictive , dirk starts become too big his britches more ways than one . fittingly , disco era gives way tougher times eighties , movie takes darker turn , becoming grittier , more downcast lot more violent , but no less compelling . all unbridled energy creativity first half still present , just decidedly less sunny form . even when people getting beaten up shot left right , movie pedal-to-the-metal pacing makes it all but impossible look away . well , except maybe notorious money shot end , but then i one didn't care .	1
once upon time there some very interesting movies made . this during 1980s . some directors some interesting ideas showing how high school quirky moments educational sometimes but also give life lessons help down road . even teachers political viewpoints , not just parents . maybe not anymore . after all wouldn't politically correct any more talk class . i feel sorry students today , so many things not allowed i don't know how they learn anything life personality . well back this movie . it jon cryer best all his movies i seen . funny suspenseful some love thrown romantics . cryer stock broker , andrew morenski , finds himself run hitmen . he hides out nephew finds high school student , max hauser , good cover . cryer excellent rest supporting cast great well . any fan movies like quot ; ferris bueller day offquot ; quot ; breakfast clubquot ; probably love it	1

okay , script not most imaginative i've ever seen , but i like actors ( especially ben best man ) so i friendly this movie most part . i didn't even mind obvious holes plot , such ... why these characters not credit cards or cell phones ? or least , why don't they use them ? oh no , much more plausible ben strip dance gay bar $150 buy car drive nc . i didn't even mind fact whole " we're married my husband doctor . " charade so predictable . oh gee , he pretending doctor he tour bus bunch elderly people . d'ya think someone might heart attack " dr. holmes " might step up ? uh , they're pretending married oh ! surprise there best man maid honor ! d'ya think they're gonna get busted ? what killed it me ridiculous ending . it obviously supposed surprise ( it ) but there seemed no other reason it than pull fast one audience . i felt cheated . i spent entire movie getting emotionally involved relationship sarah ben , i really cared how they would handle things fiance sarah little boy all . i cheerfully became disengaged relationship ben bridget , i totally believed neither one them ready get married or right each other . film spent inordinate amount time showing me they're not right each other this wedding not meant happen . right up last moment , we think he breaking it off bridget . instead , what heck let just go ahead get married after all . huh ? he left sarah sitting out there waiting him hurricane !!! after making her promise she would still there when he got back . this man obviously doesn't clue what he wants life , i'm expected believe they lived happily ever after ? not only , but what it teach us taking this commitment seriously ? it teaches us if our instinct telling us " don't it ! " our genitals yearning someone else even mother nature seems working hard prevent this marriage , aw heck go ahead it anyway . it just marriage . it romantic ! you could get lucky live happily ever after!it my experience , when things aren't feeling just right you approach wedding , turn run . last thing you should close your eyes , grab your balls take leap	-1

many vietnam war movies date depicted american soldier vietnam either sadistic murderer , worse , or , best , ignorant robotic slave industrial-military complex . this film early war battle ia drang depicts american soldier simply ordinary person who family who just trying survive while surrounded north vietnamese infantry force four times larger . unlike previous films , you not see gis shooting civilians sport , raping vietnamese girls , cussing like sailors , fooling around prostitutes or just getting drunk . what you see well-trained americans fighting insurmountable odds while looking out their brothers arms . compared more pessimistic movies like " platoon " " full metal jacket " , " we soldiers " may come across right-wing patriotic propaganda . however , this movie ultimate aim show what actually occurred combat field soldier viewpoint rather than preach public pacifist political message vietnam war or war general . one my few complaints 1 ) level north vietnamese casualties appeared exaggerated while americans appeared minimized , despite 4 1 casuality ratio actually occurred during november 1965 battle , 2 ) climatic , but fictional , bayonet charge end reminded me too much real bad patriotic war film also starring mel gibson	1
i loved this movie . breathtaking scenery , simple yet enthralling story , wonderful acting all around . no drugs , no guns , no over-the-top violence . nice movie watch rainy day ....	1
one man life full ups downs pictured film , " throne blood " , directed akira kurosawa . this film japanese re-make version famous shakespearean play , macbeth . because this film japanese film , many details differ macbeth , although basic plot story same . all plot changes , character setting differences effective choices this film because it adds different taste original form story . most plot changes film due cultural differences make plot this film natural flowing , little twist end . some detailed plot adaptations director make included washizu ( playing role macbeth ) taking over cob-web castle , miki ( playing role lady macbeth ) pregnant washizu killed his own men towards end story . medieval japan , man taking over castle not necessarily mean he emperor japan , unlike macbeth aiming king start . therefore , washizu not kill emperor , but he kill others competing castle . however , conflicts washizu other competent similar macbeth because goal they both mind achieve power . this film , miki pregnancy not seem dramatical change plot story , but thought necessary this japanese film . reason this because couple wanted their own child inherit his throne after his death . this inheriting system similar one macbeth , but this director decided add this detail reveal great desires washizu . after all killing struggles take over castle , washizu not want any other person but his child who shares his blood inherit throne . climax this film comes when hundreds soldiers washizu side points their arrows him one one hits him . this plot adaptations made this film because soldiers wanted show sign surrender . giving washizu head represented surrender . this change made film more violent thus added twist unexpected ending . making changes , it very important plot flows it natural . this sort change needed because there no fun film or story completely same original form . main character , washizu very different characteristic macbeth . washizu brave , confident , demanding more selfish than shakespearean macbeth . shogun ( similar position thane when referring macbeth ) strong , determined brave take over castle . unlike macbeth , he demanding his wife tone his speech overall strong . director probably wanted express image brave man going through one straight road towards his goal , but ending tragic death . this maybe typical image shogun during medieval japan . one thing not expressed because this characterization washizu , gradual change washizu beginning end story . this important change express because macbeth , he growing become more aggressive greedy he overcomes obstacles become king . similarly , miki characterization different form lady macbeth too . lady macbeth pretty strong woman , telling her husband what . however , miki not like her because she under circumstance where she cannot , since washizu demanding person . but overall , two characters played japanese actors very well suited this version macbeth . " throne blood " set medieval japan , when shoguns each castle fought prove strongest castle warlords . this setting very suited fit story like macbeth into . both setting lords , emperor/king , warriors . this made it possible details expressed film . example one detail one three apparitions old lady , gave washizu . when old lady told him he victorious unless wood nears neighbor comes down washizu castle . since medieval castle japan constructed top fort used forests woods one protection security methods , this apparition realistic . director chose japan setting this film , probably because many things matched original setting . technically , it completely different setting but it good enough reproduce similar story which very impressive . if people who never seen or heard macbeth happens see " throne blood " not think this film reproductive shakespearean play . this how almost perfectly macbeth throne blood matches . changes made rather improve film . washizu macbeth , both who lived fast tragic life possess lifestyle people today still learn achieve . power films stories . " throne blood " always classical perfect example successful reproductive film .	1

federico fellini 1972 film not his best , when he 8 1/2 , la strada la dolce vita his credit . while many critics adore this film its absurdity plotless , dreamy structure , i found it boring phantasmagorical . it simply fellini version rome not rome , eternal city itself . risk sounding negative , i shall admit there some moments which it most expressive early 1970 rome - scenes which hippies american tourists invade city , long scene outdoor restaurant where everyone talking their heads off ( though saying some pretty vulgar things ) my favorite scene- underground archaelogical excavation which frescoes old roman patricians fade into oblivion . but mostly this film weak it bored me because there no plot . it starts off alright , movie works well when there no sudden fantasy sequences . fellini himself this movie , well gore vidal . fellini envisions himself young man studying rome his youth strict catholic school ( slide/projector shows ancient monuments like colliseum , apian way , trevi fountain vatican well offensive pornographic image woman behind ) later young man journeys rome itself takes residence large family crowded apartment slum . then young man sees talent show tasteless , vulgar long-winded . i found myself just unimpressed outraged audicences went far throw dead cat stage ! it bothered me there much attention prostitution , brothels or cheap , slutty women . cover film promiscuous woman start film . film rome italy , there hardly any allusion opera or any true classical theater . pope fashion show ludicrous blasphemous . only serious , hardcore fans fellini want own this dvd . it perfect follow-up his equally absurd sexually radical satyricon , loosely based old roman epic .	1

yes this " worth it " . i took my younger brother three movies our teens , apocalypse now , deer hunter spinal tap . older sis i forget near death face he wore after first two(of course he'll never forget it ) but utter outrage his 14 year old zeppelin playing , doors 24/7-loving self displayed after tap ... ah i recall ever after . ( usually any girlfriend comes around ) . he took it all actual documentary , no mockumentary concept ken , while i laughed myself into aisles jokes i still love ... he incenced . " what hell kind band ? " ... he livid . okay you there but only thing funnier than this movie watching it someone who so rockraged they arching off walls . so seeing this lovely " special edition " off it went this july his present his 42nd birthday . " very damn funny " my greeting . it terrific present added stuff bring few more laughs . admittedly nothing tops stonehenge dance dwarves .. but it just all fun . more fun . if i could haul this show it first year teacher luncheon entertainment i could watch my brother routine all over again most staff i work just living " what this " land ... ah would supremely satisfying . send someone today	1

before i review , i'd like clear something up : i am very latecomer seeing this movie . i introduced ghost shell franchise through new anime series airing adult swim , ghost shell : standalone complex . i absolutely love show , so i figured eventually i'd get around seeing movie , which i knew full well shares no connection show . they're both seperate interperetations comic series same name , ( which i not read , so i don't know which more accurate ) but tv series exponentially better than this movie almost every concievable way . there many things i don't like this movie , biggest poor pacing . plot movie actually surprisingly straightforward once you cut away all filler , but that biggest problem . there not really enough story last full-length feature , because it seems almost like it originally written intention 30 minute short . since they didn't budget load movie up action scenes ( there barely any , they aren't very impressive most part ) they slow story down drawn out conversations you won't understand more than 60% , camera shots last what feels like minutes where we're looking either nothing , or woman nipples . that not cinematic artistry , that either lazy or perverted . animation itself isn't even good , especially considering this theatrical release only 10 years ago . it choppy , there not really whole lot detail ( except when it comes women nipples ) . looking just animation , if i didn't know better , i'd thought this movie ova 1980 . only thing i really say i liked this movie it ghost shell . it probably kind like how i didn't see 1989 batman movie until years after i'd spoiled batman animated series , couldn't bring myself like it any reason other than it batman . everything tv series superior this movie : animation , stories , character developement , production values ... i could go entire page how much better tv series . short , if you're you're all interested gits franchise , yourself favor rent dvds tv show instead . you'll find lot love , but i can't say same movie . my dream someday alex proyas give us gits movie lives up what i would hope after watching standalone complex	-1
one classic disney movies i remembered alice adventures wonderland lewis carroll . reading this novel gave me same feelings i my childhood years watching movie . i could wrong but it seems me everything book exactly like movie . alice reading her sister book fell asleep under tree . then she woke up , saw rabbit clothes clock talking . she then followed rabbit into this hole . after she never ending tunnel , which lead her strange world . alice encounters many obstacles story showed how she dealt them . i thought book just like movie . i guess i reading novel made me better understanding . i mainly looking any symbolism some sort , but failed so . i also shocked what things characters doing book made it into disney movie . example caterpillar smoking hookah . i didn't know what hookah until last year . i really confused some parts novel . this book i thought great someone hasn't even heard alice wonderland . it very thin book but it like reading children book . i thought novel would different story than movie . scale 1 - 10 i would give it 7 . just because it interesting reminded me past .	1
if i could make one change this movie , it would near end when angel ( isaac hayes ) tells what happened each characters ... i would added brief cameo muriel ( played brilliantly rosie perez ) getting her just desserts ... i would show muriel , working nail salon , bitter look her face , slamming things around , rude customer barking orders her . other than , great movie !	1

like most people , i saw this first cable . same time , i saw sean penn directorial debut , " indian runner " . i great respect independent films , like , forever , " one false move " among best . carl franklin commended putting script ( billy bob tom epperson ) film concise fashion . i don't agree previous reviewers who thought it needed more ground . this indeed original . bill paxton , his first lead role , excellent , hasn't good since ( though i liked his smarmy performance " true lies " ) wonderful cynda williams won awards her performance fantasia/lila . film score legendary ... indeed , peter haycock derek holt wrote score used whole bunch cheesy films 90's; i don't really know if it original this one , but use music terry plumeri effective haunting . billy bob fine psychotic , most frightening performance all came michael beach pluto , never breaking sweat he slit throat . paxton really carries film , ms. williams ; you really want these people survive . life might like ; great exposition good evil , delivered fine fashion wonderful carl franklin .	1
paul newman response jack warden , warden massages mr. newman back tries assuage him telling him there other cases . ( pardon me , i always wanted use word assuage review ) . i live connecticut , my wife i drive thru westport regularly , our way trader joe . i know exactly where mr. newman lives , ( i'll never tell ) i always kid my wife , " i wonder what paul doing today ?

" he taps his fingers judge desk . classic moments . if i ever chance become actor , my pick acting coaches , one them would paul newman . i'm not sure how he it , but somehow , after watching him screen few moments , i forget he paul newman , believe he character he portraying . i guess that " magic " great acting . they make it look so effortless . now onto jack warden . he perhaps one most under-rated actors history . great performance great actor . back paul newman . next time you watch one his movies , watch pauses ... times when he not speaking . it entire package makes actor great . it phrasing , reaction , eye movements , pauses how long he holds them . ( sure director lot input too)- but just watch him . what you witnessing star action . i write this ( june 29 , 2006 ) paul newman 81 years old . he may little slower , little more wrinkled , but his acting just gets better age . ( watch empire falls ) . i truly hope he makes more movies . who knows , perhaps one day i run into him trader joe or mario place . true jackie gleason form , say him , " hubba , hubba , hubba . " , my friends , no act .	1

rashomon ( 1950 ; directed akira kurosawa starring toshiro mifune ) one those films truly hip seen , not many others ; rather like certain books -- road , satanic verses , one hundred years solitude , naked lunch -- it certain hip cache , one cineastes all seen discuss great detail . name-droppers know they need only mention name knowledgeable context viewed awe . truth , however , rashomon sort film everyone should see ; it true classic , league casablanca , citizen kane others . film examines truth , context rape murder 12th century japan , four different perspectives ; woodcutter who witnessed whole incident yet afraid report it , bandit who committed crime , murdered man ghost ( through medium ) rape victim ( murdered man wife ) . there few elements which remain constant each version story -- murdered man tied up forced watch bandit ravish his wife , he indeed die -- but how he died varies . it either swordfight bandit , his wife hand dagger , or suicide resulting his absolutely crushed his wife choosing leave bandit . she demand his death ? he look her scorn after crime ? she really raped or she yield consensually bandit ? honesty also explored detail , wife honesty most question , but also three men sheltering rainstorm ruined gate rashomon who relate story themselves . this one late toshiro mifune ( 1920-1997 ) first collaborations akira kurosawa , his criminally-insane tajomaru masterfully acted . so effective mifune acting you truly loathe tajomaru ; you're torn pity disgust wife ( masahiko kyo , also brilliant actress ) , there truly few really sympathetic characters among cast here . camera work exemplary , shows what kurosawa best known -- unusual perspectives some truly arresting shots , proving his eye detail sharp black white it would later colour ( cf . dersu uzala , kagemusha , ran , 3 latter-day kurosawa masterpieces ) . absolutely worth seeing , proof saying there three sides every story ( wit : mine , yours , what really happened) -- but also proving what really happened isn't even ever certain	1
amidst all adventure , i consider this sentimental favorite because it one fo first movies i remember seeing my future husband young girl . nothing like scary adventure movie holding hands movie theatre . it great movie . i think it best trilogy ... but i hear coming	1
i've seen ethan hawk best performance ever this movie . it great . wiona ryder other actors great too but it not even memorable movie . it predictable sipmle story made no sense least me . maybe i'm not right but my opinion , this movie not worth buy . not even worth rent . but gh movie itself not worth anything but it soundtrack issome channels may show it occasionally . it worth watch once tv ! way , i forgot mention this movie great cd soundtrack , really great . worth buy	-1
while i watching this movie i thought myself , " am i going die ? i gone horrible movie hell ? " you see i trapped theater . it like tortured some horrible nightmare but you can't leave cause actors pretending they act just because they're fat . crowd gives you feeling like when it grossly bright outside it sunday afternoon you're car you've sitting 6 hours you feel sweaty there'a football game playing am radio you want escape . conclusion , this movie turns me into melting snow . but i suppose there worse movies -- ( see my review gummo )	-1

premise : lisa reisert ( rachel mcadams ) travelling home last flight night ( red eye ) miami where she lives works hotel manager prestigeous hotel after attending funeral her late grandmother . jackson rippner ( cillian murphy ) mysterious charming stranger she meets airport who it turns out not so coincidentally taking same flight she . rippner reason travel strictly business . it so happens assassination planned secretary homeland security while he stays lisa hotel . rippner needs lisa call hotel arrange secretary stay different room . if she doesn't comply , he man waiting outside her fathers home kill him . thoughts : this one my few experiences wes craven ( director ) work who most known horrible genre teenage slasher films i despise . i dismissed this film theatres without giving second thought , when i finally saw it last night i knew next nothing what it . what i vaguely remembered previews , given craven reputation , i honestly expecting rippner supernatural character such vampire . hindsite , i think ' vampire plane ' woulda much better foundation film . call this film premise shaky kind it unfair . it unfair because core plot points could prove interesting thriller . problem this film how it executes those points . hotel manager ? secretary homeland security ? give me break ! make it deputy director fbi president united states we plotline warrants all this hullabaloo . concept this film potential , but how it staged just too ridiculous . we really believe secretary homeland security important such elaborate scheme assassinate him would put place . we really believe only way this assassination ( which involves missles i tell you ? i won't say anymore ) pulled off if manager hotel get secretary stay different room ? who these nameless caucaisions who want secretary killed ? why ? premise isn't only shaky , it totally gutless . it sickens me hollywood so afraid offending anyone neither antagonist nor their motives any way reflect real world people , situations or beliefs . it forces me recall debacle last adaptation great jack ryan thrillers tom clancy , sum all fears . film , instead militant muslim terrorists acquire nuclear warhead lost isreal ( which truly something fear ) , they decided go nazi . heaven forbid we offend all militant muslim terrorists world portraying them evil stain humankind they . i digress . my point simply red eye doesn't even go far . it no voice . it doesn't tell us anything , worse , it too spineless put face fear . there some good things film . first foremost cast . while rachel mcadams completely not believable manager prestigious miami hotel , part her character more sidenote it fault casting more than her acting anyway . cillian murphy very talented , he look allows him come off charming one moment creepy next . i still wish he woulda turned out vampire though . finally we legendary brian " better than anthony hopkins hannible lector " cox . he such great actor , but this film he relegated most menial roles . almost every scene he him answering phone , woken up phone , or picking up morning paper . film ok it first two acts , second act strongest part film where rachel cillian performances confined mostly their seats plane . it here tension builds , performances really hold scenes . then comes third act film just breaks down complete ludicrousness . story continues off plane gives up completely intellectual thriller . instead it goes action route follows just every cliche movie this type . verdict : red eye interesting idea could beened turned into something lot better under more able screenwriter director . actors performances best they keep this ship afloat . if you ignore ridiculous parts this film which far fetched your typical network tv thrillers , then you may find some enjoyment your first time through . it not horrible , but neither it really good	-1

i always find it irritating read analyses military movies obvious civilians who know nothing military , combat specifically marine corps . this one best movies john wayne made one , least , which he should won oscar . stryker character , played wayne , not " martinet " . he plays marine sergeant , combat veteran , way marine sergeant supposed . tough , but fair . he pushes his people , boots ( recruits ) , because he wants help them survive when they hit beach . if they don't survive they no good him no good mission . wayne excellent job portraying tha t.t he surviving flag raisers who movie marines gagnon hayes , navy corpsman bradley ( whose son wrote flags our fathers ) , not , one previewer noted , " three marines " . navy corpsmen proud navy corpsmen respected such marines whom they serve . also , characters not " soldiers " it really irritating when term used describe marines . men this story marines actors play marines , title earned . short , even though actual combat footage spliced into movie action , given time it made , it well . there some romantic lulls , but given period movie made , 40s 50s , this fairly typical . overali , this great movie , even if you civilian . it give fans duke something memorable watch . it may also give critics john wayne new view man solid actor	1

high noon ( 1952 ) one best western films ever made , but some critics see it parable events hollywood time , especially cold war , persecution un-american screenwriters ( retrospect justified ) , attitudes pacifism , etc . this may case , but really it story man who too proud run . it taut , tightly-scripted , minimalist film sharply focused tale solitary , stoic , honor-bound marshal/hero , past his prime already retired , who left desolate abandoned townspeople he faithfully protected many years . due townspeople cowardice , physical inability , self-interest , expediency , indecisiveness , he refused help every turn against revenge-seeking killer his gang . fearful but duty-bound , he eventually vanquishes enemy , thereby sparing town outlaws . embittered film end , he tosses his tin star into dirt if say town , " there , i saved you , but you didn't deserve it . " gary cooper epitome noble , courageous , self-sacrificing white man who carved america out wilderness . this way movie works much better parable way present day america ( townspeople ) turns its back its heroic white traditions ( gary cooper ) .	1

disney made its mark major studio 1937 its first full-length feature film , snow white seven dwarves . ironically , given this early success , snow white their only hit movie next 13 years . world war ii kicked hell out disney overseas markets . even movies today regarded classic disney - pinnochio , bambi , fantasia - lost money initial release . disney eked through diversifying into training films us government , south american films part fdr good neighbor policy , etc . - stuff made back its costs but not much more . 1948 , disney dire financial straits . they just enough money one more movie . walt disney realized he needed hit or his studio probably wouldn't survive , it would what they best : full-length animated feature film . walt said himself , " what we need movie girl trouble . audiences love . they loved snow white . " that what he wanted : movie like snow white , but even more so - more comedy , more drama , more magic , more music , more lovable characters . he chose basis his company hail mary pass arguably most famous fairy tale world : cinderella . disney didn't money , they earlier films , lavishly storyboard every scene . thus they hit upon wonderfully clever idea shooting entire movie live action , then animators used stills storyboards . photos used survive this day , many provided special edition " extra . " some cases these photos animator drawings over them , turning instance almost bare stage into hall cinderella family chateau . 1950 , cinderella released everything disney so desperately needed . even today , cinderella arguably best movie disney ever made . it just awfully hard argue any aspect this film . animation artwork product disney famous " nine old men " - time not yet old . cinderella pulls off , superbly , something not particularly easy : it integrates believable human characters funny cartoon animals makes it work . eric larson marc davis ' beautiful graceful cinderella ward kimball wonderful jaq gus-gus mice over-the-top lucifer cat , everything flows together so well it all seems perfectly natural . part walt disney plan out-snow white snow white cinderella involved its music . he very consciously wanted cinderella source hit songs . there hit songs disney films before ( " heigh ho " " whistle while you work " snow white , " when you wish upon star " pinnochio , etc . ) but they'd almost accidental . " oh , we hit song , well that nice . " cinderella , disney first time went tin pan alley ( 28th street new york city where professional songwriters could found ) . disney wanted his girl music very best craftsmen , guys who wrote hit songs living . cinderella soundtrack hit big ( #1 album 3/4 million units sold ) songs even today considered quintessential disney , most notably " dream wish your heart makes " movie opening scene , " work song " while animals help cinderella clean house simultaneously build her ball gown , " bibbidi-bobbidi-boo " ( nominated academy award best movie song year ) fairy godmother transformation scene . their best movie , disney apparently spared no expense producing dvd . not only picture quality digitally restored , but audio also cleaned up new 5.1 surround sound mix . totally gone background hiss associated so many old movies . ( cinderella distinction " noisiest movie ever restored " according its audio crew . ) original mono soundtrack also spruced provided option purists . word movie aspect ratio ( i.e. how wide picture compared its height ) . dvd cover says cinderella presented its " original full-screen aspect ratio ( 1.33 : 1 ) " . this untrue . virtually all sound films until 1953 , including cinderella , 1.37 : 1 . since tv screen 1.33 : 1 , you don't lose lot when original " formatted fit your television . " i just wish they hadn't lied it . cinderella ends breakneck pace : we go straight her foot sliding into glass slipper wedding happily ever after , bing , bang , boom . walt disney believed " audiences like happy ending , but they don't like happy ending goes too long . " hey , who am i argue ? well , maybe i'll argue . dvd extra addresses scenes originally planned movie but not actually used . one these would occurred after fitting glass slipper before wedding : cinderella taken grand duke castle her normal everyday clothes ; first time prince charming sees her since ball she not wearing lovely gown , she wearing her scullery maid outfit . cinderella frightened , how he react when he realizes she not fine lady but poor servant girl ? course he doesn't care how she dressed , he loves her anyway . i ** see ** scene my mind , it would worked beautifully . this one way which almost perfect movie could even tiny bit better	1

movie starts off very slowly , childhood episodes ashton kutcher character . it least 1/2 hour before we see adult kutcher , although he appear very beginning brief scene . premise good , it some good momentum middle , which why i gave it two stars . shifting situations his life lives his friends interesting well , but overall story line very weak , ending dreadful not supported most rest story . also , movie too many tongue-in-cheek references kutcher real life circumstances -- such reference " tighty-whities . " they distract story , make movie more vanity vehicle -- which too bad -- if you not kutcher convert just looking movie , skip this one	-1

logan run belongs class old school science fiction films which popular early mid-1970 , prior beginning star wars franchise . these films not rely non-stop action or dazzling special effects , but rather thoughtful , intelligent stories , intriguing " what if ? " scenarios , astute social commentary . they included sci fi classics such soylent green , omega man , andromeda strain , westworld , others . while shopping mall setting some special effects logan run pretty cheesy , it still interesting film its themes may even more relevant today botox era than they 70 . i heard they doing remake would like think it improve original . unfortunately , given recent history hollywood , it more likely they drain every last bit intelligence out story , replace it more explosions , perhaps smith .	1

15 minutes horrifying gritty peek into injustice american legal system also news media . wow , two digs one film , how you resist ? emil slovak , czech national ( played karel rodan ) , his friend oleg razgul , russian national ( played oleg taktarov ) , who met prague , decide travel america , land opportunity . emil wants hunt down his old crime partner , who took all money robbery he jailed , but oleg infatuated american cinema wants filmmaker . immediately upon arriving , oleg steals video camera store they off confront emil old partner get their money back . but while oleg films event , emil discovers his portion money already spent , he kills his friend friend wife . unfortunately , there someone else watching murder . daphne handlova staying her friends , fled apartment after witnessing murders . illegal alien herself , she not want police or killers find her , but leaves her purse behind apartment where emil discovers who she . apartment burned cover bodies , " bohemian barbeque " says oleg , which calls not only successful homicide detective eddie flemming ( robert de niro ) , but fire marshal jordy warsaw ( edward burns ) scene . emil oleg get away , but while emil obsesses finding daphne , oleg obsesses filming their " trip america " , killings all . he believes he making greatest movie ever . they begin watch new york hot exploitive news show called " top story " , anchored shady newsman/reporter robert hawkins ( played expertly kelsey grammer ) . these three men , flemming , warsaw , hawkins , become irresistible targets emil oleg , two eastern-european psychopaths believing controlling taunting these famous men give them recognition they desire . i don't want give away too much plot , but suffice say there brutal murder scene where flemming showcases just how tough cop he , hawkins reveal himself slimiest snake media industry , emil learn enough know insanity set him free even if he caugh t.t here action beginning end this movie , tight somewhat confusing plot times , some great acting both stars supporting cast ( including great character played david alan grier ) . there seediness wretchedness hopelessness , ending makes film come together quite nicely . if you ready little brutal cop action your life , give 15 minutes try . enjoy !	1
john travolta role vincent vega " pulp fiction " would launch not only major comeback his movie career - but would also start streak money-making well-received movies he would star . one first movies streak would follow-up " pulp fiction " would " get shorty " . " get shorty " , travolta stars chili palmer - collector miami loan-shark who aspires get into movie business . this role seemed tailor-made travolta . it brings solid cast carry out storyline - they succeed doing so . while " get shorty " entertain you still good movie , ultimately i still find some weaknesses movie whole . john travolta career ultimately defined characters he portrayed . one thing probably hurt john travolta movie career he sometimes put into some real " lemon " type roles . this seen throughout 1980s . prime example this travolta playing " rolling stone " magazine reporter adam lawrence 1985 " perfect " - bad movie bad match role travolta . same time , better travolta matches up character - better movie . travolta performances " saturday night fever "' ss tony manero " grease "' danny zucco prime examples how well travolta matched up character . it completely fair add " get shorty "' chili palmer list characters travolta matches up very well . fact , this might one his best roles . story " get shorty " follows : chili palmer miami loan shark collector who big fan movies . when his " boss " dies , chili arch-enemy ray " bones " barboni ( played brilliantly dennis farina ) becomes his new boss . ray sends chili las vegas collect debt . while collecting debt , chili learns person who owes money - low-budget movie producer harry zimm ( played gene hackman ) . when chili heads los angeles meets up harry , he becomes intrigued getting into movie business . harry in-debt , chili convinces harry take him producer film doing . however life isn't going easy . harry also dealing some loan-shark characters los angeles - most notably one named bo catlett ( played delroy lindo ) . it turns out bo wants movies well . chili soon team-up actress karen flores ( played rene russo ) who worked harry . chili karen job going convince karen ex-husband - big time movie star martin weir harry movie . ultimately , loan-sharking dynamics ray , bo , chili ultimately going come into play everyone going want either collect their debts and/or get fair share harry movie . one thing makes travolta character chili palmer stand out going flawless smooth delivery his dialogue . this always travolta staple going back his vinny barbarino ( " welcome back kotter " ) tony manero days . this especially evident each time when chili confronts someone he says " look me " . however there many one-liners chili palmer deliver - help build his character throughout movie . one my favorite parts when harry introduces bo chili his " associate " . when bo questions chili who he really , chili replies very smooth manner : " it what he said , i'm his associate " . addition dialogue , chili palmer going some great scene presence . this best seen each time chili " appears " someone room . there three other significant performances stand-out this movie . gene hackman very nice job playing low-budget filmmaker harry zimm . hackman might one most busy versatile actors business . he lot movies - but also very adaptable any-type role . delroy lindo portrayal l.a. mobster bo catlett terrific . like travolta , he flawless portraying someone who very " smooth " character . finally , dennis farina portrayal miami mobster ray " bones " barboni also outstanding . farina plays very similar-type character jimmy serrano " midnight run " . he going lot quick one-liners really going highlight movie . also worth noting " sopranos " star james gandolfini plays " bear " - collector bo catlet t.t here also three uncredited performances : bette midler plays girlfriend harry zimm , penny marshall cameo end movie director , david groh ( famous " rhoda " ) going play martin weir agen t.t here two problems this movie . while i find storyline entertaining , i find it extremely confusing keep up specific " details " story - namely who who who what . perhaps this traces back original elmore leonard novel which this book based . i usually prefer my films " simpler " level - i think would helped this story . other problem i found ending weak . while i think this movie very good job not " dragging out " ending , i ultimately found ending bit anti-climatic . it ultimate let-down movie despite confusing " details " plot , provide entertaining edge . overall , i think when we look back john travolta career someday - chili palmer going one his best remembered ones . despite some weak points , this still one movie i'd recommend	1

this movie hilarious !!! okay , it may not oscar material exploding computer graphics , touching dialogue , or emotional nostalgia , but it everything great comedy should ... well-developed ( though bit steriotypical ) characters , social sattire ( case wal mart ) , fast , funny script extremely comedic antics throughout . though humor bit crude times , it very clever , quick , witty . minor slapstick stunts awesome , though this movie it plot not overly original , many scenes ideas displayed . i suppose if you nit-pick this movie appart judge every aspect then you may not enjoy it much i . however , this movie not made judged , it made entertain ; it , side-splittingly-well , i might add ! this movie awesome ... far funniest movie fall 2006 ! i highly recommend it !!	1

big fan roeg , bowie , sci-fi general , i intrigued enough purchase new criterion edition blind buy ( also aided my decision some positive reviews friends whose opinion i trust ) . overall , i think it great decision , if bit pricey . david bowie stars thomas jerome newton , who we first see stumbling around disoriented earth . he technical genius privately arranges meet one oliver farnsworth - scientific breakthrough lofty business plan mind . farnsworth quickly becomes his company manager begins amassing wealth thomas , who wants become rich reasons known only him . scientist , nathan bryce , also commissioned part research development - this time space project . around same time thomas meets young naive girl , mary lou , who helps save his life cares him ( eventually becomes his lover , despite thomas wife ) . while all this going , rival corporation noticed newton success keen bring his empire technology down . course , film like this , none matters all . that because thomas [ i]presumably[/i ] alien who come earth order save his small desert planet his family , who appear only survivors after two successive nuclear wars wrecked havoc planet atmosphere . i say " presumably " because , despite obvious ( scene his eyes , i say no more ) subtle ( his constant need water , his reactions moving fast speed ) visual performance/dialogue clues , film ends rather ambiguously this crucial point . my mind , possible layer newton not alien all rather fascinating . however , if taken surface only , nicolas roeg concocted visually sonically impressive sci-fi classic , fine appropriate misanthropic moody performance david bowie . roeg takes his time develop story around loose framework novel but uses number interesting visuals abstract imagery/metaphor order convey his major themes - loneliness vices man , ruthlessness corporate commercial world , way we would potentially react such visitor ( malice ) . other major theme , course , sexuality power sex destroy ; bryce considered problem because his taste very young women , newton fateful encounter mary lou , however control he may appear first , ends up doing same she introduces him joys follies human sexuality also alcohol ( which screws his system causes hallucinations - much like real life us humans , eh ? ) . film not without flaws . there number bizarre dialogue exchanges , especially newton mary lou , nothing enhance plot or development either character . one particularly fascinating but pretentious sex scene , using gun lot firing blanks sexual allegory , goes forever utterly pointless without context stage film . strange disturbing visual cues abound some particularly effective , but frequent use naked bodies writhing around some kind oatmeal throughout film silly . not nearly enough time spent reasons motivations how exactly newton intends save his planet . still , straightforward linear film would far less compelling not what roeg intended make anyway . it said writer accompanying interview roeg let spirit book guide his choices , large extent true ; he remain faithful [ i]spirit[/i ] narrative not deviate central plot . his distinct visual sense astonishing behold those unfamiliar his work . however , grade film dips slightly because flaws outlined above regard pacing , structure , story . despite all , i'm glad i bought it look forward seeing it again commentary order absorb all details i missed first time . excellent but difficult challenging piece science fiction visionary director - it amazing think " star wars " only year away ....	1

en la puta vida very well made , polished , intelligent film uruguay begins what seems comedy develops into provocative drama - much way events life mimic such changes . director co-writer beatriz flores silva knows her way around tough subject matter able bring out sterling performances very fine cast . elisa ( very beautiful talented marianna santangelo ) hairdresser two children , born different fathers , who lives her mother while trying convince her latest paramour garcia ( augusto mazzarelli ) leave his wife marry her . she dreams her own salon rich district montevideo stop nothing achieve her goal . when her life falls apart she desperate make enough money open her salon , she invited into world fast money ( prostitution ) her best friend lulu ( andrea fantoni ) , enters tutelage madame dona jacqueline ( terrific cameo graciela esuder ! ) . her new role elisa encounters handsome but wily placido ( played silvestre ) who invites her bed barcelona , spain promises she make so much money she not only able send money back her children , but also more than enough open her salon fanciest part her native montevideo . elisa lulu join other prostitutes this promise wealth fly barcelona - unexpected white slavery . there she works her corner but presence gang brazilian transvestites controlled mob . she arrested policeman-with-heart marcelo ( very handsome gifted actor jose ' aka josep ' linuesa ) when her ' man ' placido reveals himself what he ( greedy , heartless pimp ) , elisa works marcelo uncover mob violence streets gain return her beloved montevideo . how story ends left pleasure viewer . apparently this story based some degree fact : 1980s present many latin american women promised wealth joining prostitution business spain only become victims white slavery . director silva able make this rather terrifying reality into story , though sensual , never bad taste : story more important portraying sex-for-sale scenes . mariana santangelo very fine actress this film just right vehicle put her ranks international stardom . photography both uruguay spain beautiful , musical score exceedingly well written evocative , end result film opens door uruguayan films taken seriously . highly recommended	1
all quiet western front finally gotten dvd it deserves . after languishing years stopgap dvd release difficult hear terrible picture quality , this classic anti-war film restored library congress digitally remastered . results fantastic . note : this review refers new universal cinema classics release ( black case close-up lew ayres ) , not some older releases ( bluish monochrome case german helmet ) which amazon seen fit post this review . picture : huge improvement . previous release dull , low-resolution , sometimes blurry , reproduced lots lots distracting scratches dirt old reels . now picture crisp , very sharp , clean it ever . sound : huge improvement . 1930-vintage sound effects still rather clunky dialogue hard understand once or twice , but overall restoration phenomenal improvement . very good . there no special features speak , although dvd include later , probably 1940s-era trailer introduction turner classic movies ' resident film historian robert osborne . restoration sound image big selling points , here . only negative thing i say pretty trivial -- there no chapter menu . this only minor concern , though , no way detracts quality dvd or film itself . if you've waiting good release all quiet western front or never seen it , this dvd now time . highly recommended	1

film days heaven isn't just three migrant workers lonely farmer . there lot deeper meanings involved film . director paid special attention everything film . camera didn't just capture birds nothing . there lot transcendentalist anti-transcendentalist views . majority film made transcendentalist views . example , entire film shot outside showing how beautiful nature . including birds run free field humans . it also always shot dusk or dawn , showing off beautiful sunset . transcendentalist idealistic . therefore , linda transcendentalist . she always loved playing fields always something look forward . linda seemed see good people saw things nature people wouldn't even think . example , when abby , bill , linda escaping river away authorities she saw many beautiful places way related each one something she knew , like shadows rock where people dancing . film also many anti-transcendentalist views . one thing when locus came over took farm . this anti-transcendentalist because nature not work workers or farmers favor . there really no way controlling locus they made farmer go crazy . he already upset seeing abby bill , but decided he going kill bill over it . thing belief good evil . farmer good , but turns evil wanting kill bill after seeing him abby together . example this when bill good man then all sudden he kills man one day steel factory . he then chance start over farm become good , but ends up killing farmer self defense , becoming evil again . bill abby both show signs individuality . they both show this which they both selfish . abby decides marry farmer because once he dies she inherit his fortune she , bill , linda live happily ever after . farmer suppose die few months , but ended up not dying all murdered bill . this could god venting towards bill . it very selfish wrong use farmer his money god got back him not farmer die like he suppose . there many ways person could interpret days heaven . person could think god camera that why some things shot circles all nature . or person could just think it coincidence director not mean anything it . whichever way person decides interpret film , person find film meaningful .	1

i went into my viewing ' departed ' more than bit cynicism . seen film ' departed ' based upon - hong kong thriller ' infernal affairs ' - i prepared take snobbish view original far superior . adding my skepticism neat little line i read press effect hollywood just bestowed upon martin scorsese its best picture prize what , most opinions , approximately mr. scorsese sixth-best film . [ instance , ' departed ' could second-coming ' godfather ' no way could it surpass brilliance scorsese ' goodfellas . ' i hope there more than few voters now kicking themselves casting their votes ' dances wolves ' - film hasn't aged well all , especially given costner post-wolves car wreck career vs . scorsese decades-long brilliance . ] anyway , surprise , surprise : ' departed ' brilliant its own merits . it borrows - but not copy exactly - alan mak felix chong original conception . three things make ' departed ' succeed : 1 . scorsese uncompromising vision - ' infernal affairs ' featured some some pulled punches : fateful fall building ends bloodless , almost artful landing car roof ; ending seems crafted sequel mind ( , indeed , ' infernal affairs ' spawned profitable trilogy ) . no such pullback scorsese : same fateful fall results shocking splatter blood ; film brutal denouement - which ends quite differently original - lays waste any possibility sequel . 2 . william monahan brilliant adaptation - his script mashes up mak/chong ' affairs ' tale elements ' brothers bulger . ' result hand-in-glove fit its boston setting . , native bostonian , i found most accents spot-on , led locals mark wahlberg matt damon . 3 . damon/dicaprio/wahlberg triumvirate - these three guys outstanding . damon continues choose great roles perform brilliantly them . he key film , sell covert version himself both his police superiors movie audience . he goes full-out , southie-bred bostonian here . it awesome portrayal . those who think that not acting , compare him here vs . takes jason bourne tom ripley . this guy force . dicaprio his equal here , but surprise here wahlberg . his role simply didn't exist ' affairs . ' it relatively small part , but wahlberg completely steals every single second he screen . he deserved oscar nomination .	1

man movie camera ( dziga vertov , 1929)the opening moments newly-restored edition dziga vertov most famous film , man movie camera , explain silent film contains no cards because vertov less interested making traditional movie than creating visual language . thus , those who go into this looking traditional movie aren't going get much out it ; there no plot , no characters , no story , not much anything , really . idea behind vertov vision ( ) document daily life contemporary russia , ( ) use nothing but images convey ambient emotions . respect , film smashing success ; if you allow it simply wash over you , it wonderful piece work . perhaps even more interesting than vertov attempt create visual language movie sense what popularly called " meta " today ; documentary itself framed images movie theater where people attending screening , you guessed it , man movie camera . if nothing else , these scenes alone -- unheard time -- would cement vertov place one film pioneers . its importance greater scheme cinema would hard overstate ; vertov little self-aware documentary direct influence hundreds , if not thousands , movies followed ( most importantly triumph des willens , which changed not only face filmmaking , but face entire marketing industry well ) . eighty years later , man movie camera much power impress it when it released -- long you're willing take it its own terms . ***	1
throughout last couple weeks , my class studying much ado aboutnothing . shakespear amazing writer my opinion . he able write so little , yetget his entire , deep point across . play called much ado nothing becausethroughout entire play there fighting crying decieving .. what ? nothing . i beleive i learned lot it . not only shakespeares sytle ofwriting , but love too . answer question whats shakespeares purpose forwriting , i think carefully . but i beleive his point writing show thereal meaning love . throughout entire play , there people loving each other andnot knowing it , loving each other but not knowing each other .. it just hugemess . claudio hero " love first site " but claudio beleived what he thought hesaw hero doing roof , which proves he didnt know her well he should tolove her . so i think shakespeare makes you wonder if their love true or not . thisstory many values it one could learn . i , personally learned something veryimportant which i not seen before- how easily people mistake love lust . anexample this would when claudio hero met . they no idea who each otherwere , not even something simple their names , yet they " love " . i not seehow you possibly love someone first site . called lust . i alsolearned something very important which i not seen before- how stupid people actwhen they love . example people acting weird stupid when they inlove would benedict beatrice . first , they hated each other . play starts outwith them cruel , rude , sarcastic one reader knows there issomething them . then , when they both deceived told they love oneanother , they start prancing around like fairies . although this funny , it very weirdand confusing same time their emotions towards each other just changeautomatically . example would claudio hero second wedding . afterall this love talk , when their love put out into public , they start deny it saythey just friends . love makes them act so weird , but they end up deciding betogether which i believe good . this play not extremely hard understand , yethas meaningful story . it written old english so probably most difficultthing understand it . i would recommend it someone who could use goodlaugh because all comic relief it . there loads sarcasm its written aninteresting way . after all , it shakespeare . i would not , however , recommend this bookto someone who expecting deep , poetic , tragic story because they simply notgoing get it . this story isn't complex nor it deep . it all , really , just much ado aboutnothing . i enjoyed book , one ; because i could understand what going onthroughout whole thing , two ; because writing funny it kept meentertained . so , id really recommend it anyone	1

this 1954 film directed billy wilder featuring audrey hepburn , humphrey bogart , william holden , good . sabrina fairchild ( played hepburn ) , daughter chauffeur , first dreamy , energetic teenager who swoons over playboy son ( holden ) wealthy family employs her father . she father live over garage . sabrina sent paris learn fine cooking , comes back sophisticated , mature-appearing young woman . playboy falls love her , rest story involves complications hijinx resulting , gradual replacement him sabrina love interest his older , more responsible brother ( bogart ) who captain-of-the-family-industries , larrabee empire . " surprise " ending , bogart joins hepburn ocean liner he manipulated her into taking back paris . sad ending quickly becomes happy ending . i didn't find it interesting some other hepburn films , especially roman holiday , funny face , breakfast tiffany . like all her well-known films this period , sabrina wonderful reflection politics era , particularly evolution " american century , " where european cities gradually replaced new york center civilization . this one still romanticizes paris , presents it center love , self-discovery , real values . ( paris takes severe hit funny face , then totally replaced nyc breakfast . ) really interesting thing me , though , how wealthy portrayed . while there certain amount personal ridicule aimed family scion - elderly mr. larrabee - younger larrabee sons - playboy captain industry - treated sympathetically . they exhibit loyalty their happy servants , kindness their office employees , , deep down , two brothers love each other unselfishly . end , family empire expanded through marriage , captain industry admits love into his life . happy ending everyone . visage capitalism , shored up witch hunt , gets extreme makeover american century chuggs forward . hollywood doing its job this movie . i didn't find this very good role bogart ( originally carey grant signed up part ) , he seemed stiff unreal throughout movie . his shift emotions towards sabrina didn't seem very convincing , though his captain-of-industry type better . but there lot humorous scenes involving plastic , alcohol , glass , well little mockeries business world french cooking classes . i'm sure some people would find some themes , like symbolism moon , inspiring . it all quite enjoyable .	1
i recently rented watched _hollywoodland_ , starring diane lane , ben affleck , bob hoskins , adrian brody , recommend it anyone who kid during 1950s , kid who watched tv _adventures superman_ , starring actor george reeves . i still get knot my throat when i hear music series , hear those opening words : " -- superman , disguised mild-mannered reporter , clark kent . " george reeves death shocked children across nation , but mr. reeves might committed suicide unfathomable . man steel killed himself . we difficult time grasping concept . he died auto accident , or even murdered , we might grasped better impermanence life , his life . but george reeves might put gun his head taken his life surreal . actor icon superman one-and-the-same us . how could he want die ? most all , how could he abandon us way he ? some these questions addressed movie , film stands out my mind memorable because not only props costumes , vintage cars sets but diane lane performance too . she steals film toni mannix . i visually took sets , i wondered myself why i always thought 1950s " ugly days " regarding fashion trends american history . furniture seemed boring me then -- even now . i would never want buy any it , except collectible : but cars , cars fantastic . hollywoodland stylish nostalgic film takes you back late 1950s , when dollar vast fortune bought you bag abba zabba candy bars , atomic fireballs , bazooka bubble gum , slew comic books , fast track into zone , lots trading power . if you remember days , you enjoy movie . very recommended .	1

first off , i'll admit i bought this movie because my favorite actor plays villain , but that not why i keep watching it . inspectors amazing job pulling together all sorts differing elements make it so much more than just mystery or action flick . there real depth realism two leads shown actually personal lives . there also bit comedy offset crime scenes despicable actions bad guys . movie isn't very graphically violent . it hasn't rated , but i would say since language isn't gratuitous movie doesn't front row seat effects mail bombs human anatomy , i'd let 15 year old watch it me . it outstanding movie great re-viewing potential	1
aside " breakfast tiffany " " my fair lady , " audrey hepburn didn't get any better than this . hepburn plays ariane chavasse , parisian student cello who becomes enamoured rich , older american , frank flanagan , played gary cooper . flanagan seems like unlikely character return her love , however , he long history womanizing playboy . he even confesses ariane his belief couples " should always behave though they planes " his motto : " he loves runs away , lives love day . " you very easily predict how two going end up , but it happens , film ends , unpredictable , dramatic extremely moving fashion should leave most viewers misty-eyed . maurice chevalier excellent arianne father . some criticized gary cooper " too old , " i think film would absolutely perfect if he few years younger . ( why title my review says " almost perfect . " ) but cooper still excellent choice role . he looked good his age stage presence , time , unrivalled . ( since when tall , handsome , suave , rich men problems attracting younger women ? )	1

( i slept married woman denmark too , but she told me beforehand . ) whit stilman films rely heavily dialogue , dialogue highly interesting stimulating , well funny . he kind american eric rohmer , except much more humor . stilman knows spain well he spent lot time there . ( his wife spain . ) i seen this film three times , each repeat viewing i notice something new . example , one point film , fred picks up some papers off ted desk office asks , " what all these red dots your work ? " it only third viewing i noticed , earlier film , while two cousins conversing their apartment , ted motivational tapes playing background instruct listener mark his work red dot every time he picks it up , encourage him complete work first time . this film would my top ten list favorite movies all time . ( it so good it might even appear my top one list . )	1

i enjoyed this . it moved bit slowly places , i'm intrigued audrey tautou films tend all follow same quirky narrative format ... but it enjoyable . exception her last flick mr. hanks , she seems bit type cast into daisy-like waif who simpers could either turn world herself or blow it wide open -- you never know . story bit hard follow , which probably wasn't helped language barrier translation . usual , i noticed several places where subtitle not match what said all , which shaded things bit differently . it pretty film though , interesting cinematography . war scenes different than you tend see american films . they gross this , but drama around reaction characters experiencing whatever gross thing more than gross things itself . hollywood tends focus yuck its own character . interesting story , though . i loved her vague ocdness	1

yellowbeard pirate film monty python feel . good film	1
this film should up there your need watch list . it brilliantly casted wonderfully scripted story blind love . when luis ( bandaras ) meets his mail-order-bride julia ( jolie ) he stunned her beauty . she nothing like he expected , yet he marries her immediatly . luis perfect gentleman , makes julia next move even harder . once she gained luis ' trust she leaves him , taking him every cent . luis then , help p.i. , decides he find her , kill her . problem he still loves her . but she love him ? this film shows dark side love , side allows you love someone you don't even know , but feel , someone you connect , someone makes you whole . jolie bandaras spot ( especially their clothes off ... hot hot hot ) they work wonders this script . i watched this film over over still can't get enough it . unrated version this film offers steamier much more explicet love scene movement lots nudity ( no full frontal bandaras shots though , you'll settle quite few butt shots ) it includes few other sex scenes , less explicet , cut movie entirly . either way you'll pleasently pleased . unrated version doesn't add anything new plot or flow film so pursue only if you're dire need near-porn-like nude scene ... otherwise , theatrical version just fine ( you still see quite bit nudity ) ... great acting , great story , great bodies ... what i say but great movie	1

this classic movie 1958 , tati plays his usual character mr. hulot . he lives old , rundown part town , while his sister , married manager plastics factory , shiny futuristic house suburbs , lot goofy gadgets . ( course , what presumed future 50s wasn't always what it turned out , sort retrofuturism fun ) . movie very little dialogue , silent-movie like musical score , number gags involving hulot utterly confused modern gadgets her sister house ( fair , few those gags laugh-out-loud funny ) . actually , what i found even more fascinating than retrofuturism mon oncle , watching it now , look old part town where hulot lives ( we see france 20s 30s , still existing 1958 , but soon razed down , it seldom shown color film ) . if tati wanted say old france more humane than new , ugly , futuristic france shown movie , well , he my vote	1

i'm huge george eliot fan . better just get out way show my bias outset . other hand , could made me like it less since film so much live up . fortunately , this bbc mini-series managed it most excellently . characters their lives engrossing film runs long enough ( 210 minutes ) things allowed happen natural pace .... hollywood movies , characters often seem artificial when they change it more fulfill scriptwriter needs than their own . daniel deronda , characters change gradually realistically , plus drama gripping engaging . highly recommended !!	1
something fishy certainly going if average review this movie 4 stars . this truely worst adaptation novel ever made . costner should tried crimes against cinematography . this movie far beyond awful	-1
i not yet read originating novel , but i just finished watching this movie second time . i renting it . now i'm going buy it - one very few , i almost never buy movies . i must say i found much more it second time . first time not only physical emotional whippings disturb me but , just much , o willing apparent debasement her masters ' disregard her feelings - they only seemed care her obedience . this anti-turnon me . sex scenes not really convincing , nor whippings . i realized i , audience , not asked accept much pain or much pleasure either . male characters much more flat than female ones , particularly o , if they really didn't count . there something this most beautiful woman portrayal which left me thinking it wasn't all simple . bottom line , it abundantly clear this far , far more than sm movie , nor it bondage , submission domination , or any other kind sexual perversion or obsession . some phrases stuck out me , although i'm not sure i'm quoting exactly accurately . narrator said o loved everything everyone came her because it came her request her lover . she said o knew if she lasted end all would given her . o apparent peace mind everything happened her simply didn't gybe debasement/submissive/sexual perversion sort story . she definitely not come across sick . she , times , deeply terrified or ashamed any normal woman would circumstances yet continued freely accept demands obedience those who loved her those who didn't . i puzzled how easily she accepted rene no longer her lover , continued exactly same thing sir stefan . all this indicated something much deeper than anything relatively superficial perversion , infatuation , o-o going . it made far too deep impression first time i saw movie , even without understanding it . it made me think it , reviewer mentioned , hitting some archetypes , something deep human spirit . i began think whole story extended metaphor demands rewards love . when we love , we willingly go through hell sake love -- not just sake lover . love relationship places heavy demands obedience us . it whips us debases us -- love its intimacy always find our weaknesses , their exposure makes us feel naked , beaten debased . but love always allows us freedom opt out , o lovers masters . something deep within us always knows , if we succumb abasement we may feel , accept beating our feelings take , love , real human love , marks us forever o marked , enbles us love loved fully deeply , gives us peace -- indeed , it grants us everything . o shows us how wonderful it become if we not overly defensive our selves service love . movie itself not look dated you would think 1974 movie -- actually , not all . color little unsaturated compared kind color we today , this contributes fantasy clearly spun . i happen enjoy naked women lot , there lot them this movie , fully frontal , more than glimpse , naked unashamed . there few scenes fully clothed very long . i thought all beautiful women , self-possessed , graceful , fully feminine sensual without affected . two brief closeup shots " female genitalia " , one reviewer put it , ( although he apparently didn't even notice them ) , exquisitely - just close enough , just long enough , just modest enough , just open enough . there visual potpourri modern day ( 1974 ) , turn-of-the-century wealth romanticism , even some medieval castles costumes . only thing bothered me even temporarily sir stefan overly-coiffed hairdo , but it didn't take long get past it . it legitimate part his character . best comment all came my wife when movie over . i hasten add there absolutely no submissive or dominative tendencies her all . she said , " wierd . wow . that one very sexy movie "	1

like everyone who read book , i didn't care movie much , but it still its merits . unfortunately music bombastic , overbearing , this vangelis heavy beat though girls racing down beach chariots fire , totally anachronistic . sinead cusack ghastly cotton boys ' mother , what kind american accent she supposed using ? it like nothing earth didn't seem synched up her lip movements . little boy who played thomas , stud who played stephen , tara fitzgerald topax all excellent . what happened tara fitzgerald , only few years ago she would playing rose , she ingenue every british movie imported into us theaters . sad way time flutters today hot young thing now playing tomorrow stepmother ! her hair looked like hair old hag walter scott novel-one who lives cave . i thoroughly approve romola garai cassandra mortmain . i thought she perfect part . rose byrne not gorgeous i hoped , rose , her huge cheeks beady little eyes . she looked ghastly gained 20 years when mrs. cotton cut off her makeup artists should painted over distracting blemish her face grew worse throughout movie . however she perfectly piquant exotic pink crinoline dress black shoes red feather her hair she wote when bringing her family dinner cottons . cassandra blue dress she wore nightclub also lovely . henry thomas marc blucas also underwhelming . blucas used so good looking riley finn tv version buffy vampire slayer . here he looked pasty unfit . henry thomas doing all his acting his eyes . he seemed leading cassandra during their dance " you night music . " it mesmerizing , but i once thought he love her , afterwards he said he kissed her just because she so funny amusing sweet . right . finally i'm two minds bill nighy . he always same every picture , but i think his manic , worn-out quietude fitting james mortmain . you could believe he writer , even though not james joyce-style writer he get dodie smith book	1
movie : **** dvd transfer : **** extras : *** this ultra low-budget film released poverty row monogram pictures much better than studio standard fare , thanks artistry fine cast few capable technicians . script philip yordan typical biographical whitewash job bears only passing resemblance true story 1930 gangster john dillinger ; yet it works just fine piece noir crime drama , sturdy dialogue interesting characters . his first starring role , lawrence tierney acquits himself well dillinger ; lovely anne jeffreys ( although anachronistic her 1940 fashions hairstyle ) turns fine performance his treacherous moll . but real acting honors shared four actors who comprise tierney original gang : former silent star edmund lowe ; veteran character player eduardo ciannelli ; craggy-faced marc lawrence ; always reliable elisha cook , jr. each these men given brief but ample opportunity shine , each one makes most his turn spotlight . also note musical score dimitri tiomkin , moody black white cinematography jackson rose . warner brothers dvd release this film offers unexpectedly fine picture audio quality . it must kept mind keep production costs down , " dillinger " includes many snippets stock footage other films , this generic footage filmed different times varying film grains , hodge-podge technical styles . presented here , it all blends fairly seemlessly , only few really rough spots standing out . dvd includes serviceable audio commentary john milius , director 1973 " dillinger " ; his sometimes meandering remarks intercut old excerpts interview screenwriter yordan . original theatrical trailer also included ... see if you don't agree " time " magazine quote trailer end ( " dillinger reached unmatched heights daredevil ruthlessness !

perhaps first social injustice movies hollywood began turning out late forties , crossfire one few my opinion which still hold up . that because social message , against hate general anti-semitism particular , doesn't become too preachy get way story . unlike gentleman agreement ( anti-semitism ) , boomerang ( legal class injustice ) , pinky ( racial prejudice ) others , crossfire tells taut story first , this case murder , features some first-rate acting , especially robert ryan . murder mystery straightforward there little doubt who killer . we know man named samuels ( sam levene ) beaten death . we know suspect , corporal arthur mitchell ( george cooper ) one four recently discharged soldiers who met him bar . we know one four big , edgy guy , sergeant montgomery ( robert ryan ) , who laughs too much likes verbally poke people he thinks weak . body discovered , evidence points mitchell killer police captain finlay ( robert young ) goes work . one mitchell buddies , sergeant peter keeley ( robert mitchum ) doesn't think mitchell could killer . cautious way he starts working finlay establish alibi mitchell , then concentrate montgomery . one biggest issues what could montgomery motivation . it turns out montgomery doesn't like civilians , doesn't like " hillbillies , " hates jews . he bigot . when montgomery complains " those kinds guys " , finlay asks , " what kind guys ? " " you know kind . " montgomery says . " played it safe during war , keepin ' themselves civvies , nice apartments , swell dames ... you know kind . " " i'm not sure i . " " some ' em named samuels , some ' em funnier names . " it isn't long before we realize montgomery psychopath who hates just anyone who different . keeley help , finlay finally able lay clever trap montgomery . young fine job cop . he seen probably too much . he tired . he decent man who relies his training . " i've this job too long , " he tells keeley . " i go it only way i know how . i collect all facts possible ... most them useless . " mitchum , laconic but alert , makes nice partner finlay . he ready stand buddy he thinks incapable killing , he really doesn't like montgomery . robert ryan makes you feel uncomfortable moment you see him . there something too friendly him , something too hidden , something too ready explode . you're not surprised when he suddenly beats samuels death his fists . difference part keeley part montgomery , i think , difference role lead reputation movie star role lead reputation movie actor . i think it only when mitchum took unsympathetic roles night hunter cape fear many critics realized he first-rate film actor , not just star . time , ryan already actor reputation , but major stardom eluded him . smaller part , gloria grahame excellent dance hall hostess who might give mitchell alibi . her cat eyes pouty lips , grahame always distinctive . she paul kelly man who may or may not her husband bring uneasy almost surreal quality their scenes . crossfire solid looking noir . dvd presentation very good .	1

let me say immediately this movie requires some upfront investment : patience , attention , sympathy . it not easy sit four hours view " news " that sixty years old . but once you get past initial impediments , what you get clear window into events themselves clear windows into human motivations their consequences . ophuls examines one city , examines how collaborators resistance fighters played lethal chess . he interviews probes . what emerges after four hours weird sensation you actually present interviews -- you camera -- that highest praise anyone give documentary . incidentally , one bonus watching this you get vivid context many other french movies take place during this dramatic period history , e.g. , " hiroshima mon amour " " le dernier metro .	1

i don't know how familiar i say i am krzystof kieslowski . i've seen 2/3 " decalogue " his ten-hour masterpiece now i've seen first film his three colors trilogy " blue . " i think anyone who sees film kieslowski hard time disputing he one great directors . he not credited one great directors , but he credited great director . hopefully , years come , his brilliance become acknowledged . " blue " strange film ... it doesn't follow typical rules storytelling . it plot , but images it uses play big part telling story plot . then there music . rarely music important film it " blue . " juliette binoche ( who won french oscar best actress this role ) plays julie , young woman whose husband young daughter killed car accident . julie car , but made it out alive . once she heals up , she finds herself badgered friends composers her husband last composition ( her husband famous composer ) . movie turning point comes when julie calls old friend she knows love her . after they their thing , she moves into anonymous little apartment building hopes escaping everyone she knows . she fears hurt again decides no friends , no acquaintances , no family . then , kieslowski-like turn events , she meets her husband pregnant mistress . there lot movies people losing loved ones trying deal it . kieslowski hands , however , this formula seems fresh new . there no denying kieslowski his co-writer krzystof piesiewicz understood human condition humans general . none scenes film feel artificial or unneeded . kieslowski doesn't waste time filling screen pointless scenes , but it shaved down essentials . i said , this film very different . unique would sum it up quite good . while i'd lying if i said i understood significance this , there something he movie i quite fond . certain scenes , while julie talking usually , loud music begin playing screen fade black . after few moments , we fade back into exactly where we . while i haven't seen other films trilogy quite yet , i'm looking forward them . any fan foreign cinema should see this film ... if you haven't yet discovered kieslowski , you need . grade :	1

i saw this movie when i 25 years old , same age michael o'keefe , very good young actor . i agree reviewer his range emotions ... anger , love , compassion , superbly expressed . i think he should won best supporting oscar time , but instead academy gave it timothy hutton ordinary people ( fabulous young actor ) . robert duvall , course , brilliant always . i seen movie several times , each time it reminds me two struggles duvall : dominance over everyone around him , struggle masculinity father son ( duvall o'keefe ) . this struggle interesting study father who very proud but yet threatened , manly sensitiveness , athletic ability , spunk his own son . first indication this when they playing basketball together . o'keefe typical vigorous 17-year-old ( almost 18 ) , expertly dribbling shooting duvall into increased anger frustation . i think very quick whack duvall gave o'keefe butt o'keefe slightly bending over , very skillfully dribbling ball away duvall , first indication he his father .. boss . you don't embarrass boss beating him . i even thinking , because duvall such jerk -- please michael , let your father win ! next , terrible scene performed so well -- when duvall , furious o'keefe not relent giving him two point extension , stadiscally bobs ball o'keefe head , humiliating him calling him his favorite girl . o'keefe retaliates yelling " this girl whipped your ass good , colonel ! " . i thought duvall would start physically fighting his son smart , but retort so smart , it left duvall silent paralyzed . those two chemistry , truly great together . watch it , performances move you much story typical but challenged , military family	1

dead next door fine addition zombie genre . if you place this terms acting film quality , it would fall somewhere night dawn dead , but leaning more towards night . apparently this film shot , written , produced then 18-year-old bookwalter , which itself worthy viewing . plot needs almost no explaining : zombies walk amongst us , their legions growing . this film , however , we get organized zombie squads work out d.c. patrol nearby neighboring states . like omega man , it implied science cause could cure undead problem . storyline itself both irreverent cynical , full stupid people doing stupid things . one best parts when group protesters sporting let dead walk signs gets attacked very creatures they trying protect . there even zombie cults zombie sacrifices . gore-mongers won't disappointed either : special effects , although coming close but not quite equaling such maestros romero or fulci , still capable dropping open jaw . dvd extras very formidable : interviews , deleted scenes , alternate takes , photo galleries behind scenes footage , name but some included treasure trove here . shot suburban ohio , this true independent film deserves respected merit .	1

what interests me truffaut godard very simple story its ability convey nihilism main characters . i believe it deserves least much attention any evolutionary film making leaps went into film making . story simple enough : michel poiccard ( jean paul belmondo ) petty thief whom within first five minutes his appearance screen cops his tail because he stolen car . not particularly bright , he shots patrolman who pulls him over leaves scene crime rife incriminating evidence . rest film , some eighty odd minutes consists michel chasing down money owed him earlier petty crimes ; trying keep one step ahead police know what they know his whereabouts ; hanging out trying sleep patricia francini ( jean seaberg ) , american student sorbonne sometime writer herald-tribune -- one gets impression reason she him it artistically inspired slumming novel she working . it patricia who ultimately betray michel when her future paris threatened possibility loss her visa passport she willingly leads police him . while they still partners we given interesting look paris underworld . world petty thievery criminals margins society who primary subject breathless group godard good position expostulate upon . become totally obsessed cinema while he student sorbonne , ostensibly studying ethnology , he cut his families finances when they found out ostensibly meant not all he subsist through petty theft . film -- working often biography michel -- shows world inactivity . we see him sleeping , trying put together money owed him , comparing clothes other petty thieves trying keep patricia amused hopefully bed . he absolutely no short term goals his one ambition , going italy little more than pipe dream totally unrealistic . michel lives world totally sensory sensual . there nothing his character suggests he could go beyond this , or he wishes . even worse than his sloth , fact he total moral bankrupt : his code conduct so totally self-interested egocentric frightening . word , it degenerate . patricia michel counterpoint film though she comes different class background long term goals presumably not parasitic -- journalist novelist -- she just morally repugnant he . although bright , intelligent well educated she totally self-absorbed . dwight macdonald points out bedroom scene patricia michel " ... it becomes evident , through many small touches dialogue expression , each lover so bound childish ego unable make contact other , they emotionally impotent . " patricia self-centeredness seen her reading faulkner michel insisting its beauty ( he not speak english ) her constant changing facial expressions mirror her insistence michel acknowledge beauty renoir reproduction hangs her wall . neither trying connect other any but most superficial level . they simply using each other . it may not evil , but it certainly amoral . two amoral characters would not all threatening , but pauline kael points out , what makes film so disturbing just how little characters give damn anything . " this new race lives moment because all they care . " group people michel representative marginal no stake society , not accept tenets loyalty or even code conduct going beyond meeting satiating immediate wants . patricia just dangerous different reasons though . although she vision future herself " she so free she no sense responsibility guilt .... codes love loyalty ... depend stronger emotions than her idle attachment this lover .... " people like this represent danger society goes beyond their numbers because damage they totally out proportion their numbers . what finally makes breathless so unique amongst underworld films its differences gangster films preceded it . michel almost polar opposite rico bandello . where rico chaste , michel fornicator . where rico obsessed power making it , michel could care less long there cars steal fun . they both ultimately brought down their big egos stupidity though .	1

description this dvd led me expect movie like " musa " or " warriors heaven earth " -- i'd even happy movie comparable " crouching tiger " -- this movie isn't up standards any these movies though . more farce than anything close " adventure " -the scenery wasted lame plot drags makes movie seem twice long it really . perhaps if my own expectations lower -- i wouldn't so harsh this movie -- but compared " musa " or " warriors heaven earth " -- it defintely sub standard . different strokes -- they say -- perhaps you'll enjoy this movie -- i didn't!	-1

plot details : this opinion reveals major details movie plot . dario argento opera viewed some sort comeback effort after his 1985 film phenomena ( a.k.a. creepers ) garnered lukewarm reviews failed register lot his fans . lot fans really looked forward opera since it got back his giallo ( italian thrillers where most movie shown killers point-of-view showing his usually gloved hands ) roots lacked some ridiculous elements his insect thriller phenomena . while opera nowhere close suspiria ( 1977)or deep red ( 1975 ) terms greatness , i felt it improvement over his last giallo , 1982 tenebre . opera deals beautiful young opera singer who starring extremely avant-garde production macbeth . she ends up stalked obsessed fan who ties her pole , puts pins under her eyes ( so she'll gouge out her eyes if she tries shut them ) , tapes her mouth shut murders people right front her some very graphic bloody ways . movie some respects lot common phantom opera . expected dario argento film , opera absolutely breathtaking visually . his camera moves fluidly movie features some insane angles shots . actual opera macbeth movie equally visually captivating . dario mentioned he always wanted his own movie version macbeth , but wasn't able one reason or , so opera gave chance sort some fun it . killings movie also very graphic bloody , punctuated some really bad heavy metal music . first murder particular very gruesome shot knife shoved through man neck into his mouth . i also very impressed scene where woman killed while looking through peep hole : killer shoots her through head through hole , bullet continues out back her skull , striking phone that behind her . dario one few directors who take extreme violence turn it into something dark beauty . where movie really lacking some acting . i noticed actors act great one scene , only appear they're sleepwalking through next . this especially apparent young woman playing lead . ending also very poor seemed out place . after watching documentary making film recent anchor bay re-release , filmmakers even admit ending didn't turn out way they intending it . if movie ended 10 minutes earlier , it would turned good movie into great one . opera probably go down last decent film dario argento made . he went make some terrible films like trauma , stendhal syndrome atrocious remake phantom opera . i haven't seen his latest film entitled sleepless , but i've heard it return his deep red roots . whether it any good question , but i really like think dario least one more great film him . one only hope !	1

' santa claus movie ' huge childhood favorite mine . there not many christmas movies out there tell such original story how santa claus came . it not only mesmorizingly creative fairy tale leaves you feeling like warm chocolate chip cookie just taken out oven christmas eve but it leaves all religous aspects christmas out so everyone enjoy it , wich way holiday truly deserves . my baby brother 11 years old although he trying very hard ( his age ) hold magic he asking alot questions this year . so christmas eve i read him verginia o'hanlons famous " yes verginia there santa claus " letter , afterwards we watched ' polar exspress ' finished night off this classic when it all over first thing he run out kitchen , grab some left over christmas eve cookies we made earlier night couple carrots , poured tall glass milk wrote note santa said following " hello santa ! even though my friends school don't believe you don't you worry because i still . here some cookies milk you carrots your reindeer . i love you santa clause " . if only one more year i could help him believe , well then " mission acomplished " i definitely thank makers this little holiday classic assisting me my magic capturing endeavor .	1
after framed his own psychiatrist into believing he responsible string murders , man named aaron boone leaves his human life behind sets off search legendary underground city midian , reputed home monsters called nightbreed . exact line reasoning behind this course action , many interesting paths it could taken , isn't fully explored , leads into only but not-insignificant flaw " nightbreed " : it fantastic movie , many ways " lord rings " or " star wars " horror movies , but it way too short . clocking little over hundred minutes , it should gone least 40-45 minutes longer my mind , could easily gone over ; there so many angles characters , too much movie feels somewhat scrunched together . now , i no idea if it actually meant longer or if this what clive barker originally envisioned , but personally i think it needed more screen time . my dream scenario would find out more material actually filmed see version extended 60-70 minutes come out , but fact remains what here , dvd still great movie , despite awkward feeling certain parts movie seem flow far too quickly . upon arrival midian , boone ( pursued both his girlfriend lori , who wants save him , his psychiatrist dekker , who seeks nightbreed his own purposes ) received breed their prophecied messiah cabal , who finally free them human persecution they've encountered over ages due their monstrous appearances frightful powers . nightbreed presented more creatures than demons , such film falls under banner i great affection , where ' monsters ' good guys humanity aggressor . although " nightbreed " there lot grey black white ; some human characters very sympathetic some nightbreed apparantly considerably more ill-natured than others , perhaps even responsible hatred their entire race prone through history . creature concepts effects grand production design truly magnificent - fact " nightbreed " received no consideration movie establishment big award bodies demonstrates just how reticent academy other bodies give nominations any horror movie , no matter how brilliantly . there seems slight thaw big players dislike horror last few years , so who knows , maybe future movies this nature eligible . explosive finale seemed leave door wide open sequels , but nothing ever come them either movies or books beyond nightbreed comic series ran couple years ( one point brought rawhead rex into mix ) , which seemed present breed much nastier less sympathetic than movie . film sequel may never come , but remains list movies i'd just love see suddenly rear up out blue someday . some cool trivia barker fans : not only craig sheffer ( lead actor " hellraiser : inferno " ) play boone , three performers who portrayed cennobites first two " hellraiser " movies present here well : simon bamford ( ' butterball ' cennobite ) , nicholas vince ( chatterer ) doug bradley ( pinhead himself ) . spite too little time reach its maximum potential , still essential horror movie , very original truly epic scope	1
idea counterfactual , course . no surprise . but such ideas allowed , this one full possibilities , both comic dramatic . none those possibilities explored this film . instead , this garden-variety teen flick . it pushes all teen buttons . caveman morphs into california hip teen less than two minutes , that end caveman such . three boys rock dancing , ride roller coaster , rock dancing , play arcade games , rock dancing , roller coaster , rock dancing , arcade games , roller coaster , rock dancing , etc . ad nauseum . top it off , caveman pacifist who wouldn't hurt flea , not even defend himself . yeah , right . social commentary , psychological insights could evoked clever development this idea ! truly comic situations caveman could gotten into ! it time someone made grownup movie starting this idea . people who made this film clearly didn't know what this splendid idea . or , use word they would likely understand , they clueless .	-1

mahatma gandhi indians call him indeed mahatma(a great soul)(but i rarely saw usage word mahatma western world , which i guess they don't like use ) . his life message-message love , peace , acceptance , tolerance , finally it tells us you should fight out love something not because hatred towards others . he fought independence people because he loved it not hated britishers . strictly , only handful number people led such accomplished complete life . he died only after seeing nation india free . movie , it very touching definitely inspires us . what i like quote his , read out end where he says " some point every evil looks invincible , but end they always lose . it happens always , always , always " . remember hitler , course british empire . present times when there more more injustice(under cover good ) , this should truly help those faintly lit souls standing hope society filled justice , love , peace	1
i've never laughed and/or smiled so much my life . my face literally hurt after watching this movie . films darren stein ( director ) made his childhood friends way more ambitious than anything my friends or i made child . we pretty much stuck straight horror , whilst darren company tackled such heady themes holocaust , child abuse , nuclear war . my favorite part : little girl screaming " no , mommy , no ! " monotone while her mother " beats " her ( little girl barely suppressed laughter audible throughout ) . other parts worthy mention include concentration camp " execution " scene ( shot suburban living room ) " bank robbery " scene ( also shot what appears same living room ) . what makes film really special , however , watching young darren exhibit signs truly manipulative , megalomaniacal film director . it sweet , also little bit scary . this film must all artists , writers , filmmakers , musicians who knew what they wanted early age .	1
i don't know why most reviewers seem hate this movie ! but i guess it because it not typical vampire movie or typical horror movie actually more mystery suspense movie but i actually thought it good movie i enjoyed whole things aren't what they appear plotline i thought ending seemed very original . seems like it would very original back then also now ! not all actors great but bela lugosi lionel barrymore great i highly recommend this movie fans vampire horror movies who also like mystery suspense	1

night fog only 30 minutes long but it manages move one deeply time its conclusion reached . i must share reader this , without qualification , superlative documentary holocaust . narration full judgment condemnation -- which entirely appropriate light its subject matter . footage both color black white . most what one sees auschwitz other concentration camps ( kz ) shot vilianous nazis themselves . meticulous books they kept revealed half-way through ; names dead crossed out red pencil . although i must say i am quite familiar holocaust , many clips night fog previously unknown me . indeed , decapitation device piled heads alongside it shock . side note , while watching this , i could not help but think fact movie like this could not made france today because it society plagued anti-semitism . that tragedy resnais work beyond impressive . we need thousand documentaries this quality . this historical artifact it absolutely worth your purchase . fact , i may go watch it second time .	1

when i first purchased this film vhs some years ago , it because actor tatsuya nakadai . i not all familiar works late director mikio naruse . since viewing " when woman ascends stairs " i only seen one other film this late director , film " late chrysanthemums , " which i also vhs too . i am looking forward purchasing both these films dvd some time . this film particular when it released dvd . my review refers vhs version . when i first viewed this film , i thought it decent , but not particularly great . not seen film number years ; i recently watched it again ; really liked it lot . strange how time sometimes allow us see things differently . i find many films i once liked not appealing anymore , while others seem pull me . this film one grows appreciate . or maybe it mood one ? anyway , i believe this very good film . much better than i initially thought . films main protagonist keiko yashiro ( hideko takamine ) excellent film . film centers around life keiko ; also known mama . her daily life recounted films narrative bar woman ginza bar district , who struggling maintain some sort dignity her life . she widow , fast approaching thirty-years age . daughter , brother she trying help keep out jail , nephew who needs money operation , her life financially difficult . this slow paced film , patience required . but film well worth watch purchase . meanwhile , keiko must deal patrons bar . bar frequented businessmen other clients who want more than just drinks served them : her body one . despite all hardships keiko going through , we see she emerges strong personality , refuses defeated . she inner strength which carries her forward . this film reminded me quite bit late great director kenji mizoguchi films . only here you find woman who strong , not relying men , per se . films narrative follows plight woman bar which frequented men who see her object . yet her pride not allow her debase herself , even if it means financial advancement . one bar characters junko inchihashi ( reiko dan ) she gives very good supporting role film . then there character kenichi komatsu , ( tatsuya nakadai ) who portrays managing bartender film . but heart film we keiko , her desire change her lot life . although keiko not hate her job , she not entirely enjoy it either . director naruse shows viewer this male dominated society , roles women limited life one vicious cycle disappointment : yet keiko carries she tries rise above lifes challenges . keiko , life more than just ascending stairs bar where she works . life difficult , but there always tomorrow . this film highly recommended	1

army vet , i say characters this movie just crazy varied you're likely find any military unit . falling somewhere dirty dozen jacobs ladder , this sleeper not everyone . it pace slow . it full surreal moments . but such life combat zone -- i saw some very surreal things desert storm . i'll admit writers took it little too far couple times , but most their risks worked , these accomplished actors pull it off somehow . overall movie stands out one great commentaries war . if you're not too much literalist , i'd highly recommend this movie .	1

not much written nowadays john hodiak , who plays ned trent this 1946 george sidney musical , but he wonderful presence hollywood cinema 1940s , all his pictures worth look . he seems strangely modern , natural his appeal , some cocky good looks charm our own john travolta . harvey girls one his rare ventures into musical comedy , moviegoers often recall him tougher parts : playing opposite tallulah bankhead hitchcock lifeboat , you know you'd balls steel carry off assignment , or zipping through mexico lucille ball jules dassin noir road trip adventure two smart people . judy garland he noticeably gentler than he usually gets screen ; you almost feel effort involved . he seems more like angela lansbury sort guy , hard , attracted glitter , out good time . then something clicks he garland really start click picture picks right up . dvd features abysmal " march dogies , " piece which so many things wrong it , you see why freed cut it out , but it fascinating its own right it great they saved it . song bad , singing isn't very good , choreography pretty basic , it seems they tried save it adding more more elements number , you almost expect see if not kitchen sink , then village pump , added mix . i suppose they also trying accommodate hodiak limitations dancer . he no ray bolger ( no john travolta ) . but his magnetism carries all before it , like buffalo stampede . hodiak misfortune prominently featured some era most notorious failures , like song russia marriage private affair , but way this proved his salvation he not cursed overfamiliarity which he disregard someone we've seen zillion times , no matter how worthy , like clark gable or gary cooper . he always fresh exhibits new facets his screen personality . he died 1955 , still stranger , after well-publicized marriage fellow thespian ( anne baxter , whom he starred low-key charmer sunday dinner soldier )	1

sean connery made this movie after his bond franchise died . this came out few years after " diamonds forever " . connery ' 83 " never say never again " but that not considered true bond movie . but , i degress , we're talking zardoz . i give movie five stars . it one those mid-1970s science fiction movies cheezy effects , cheezy dialog , fun watch if you've few shots whiskey ice . four years later " star wars " came out . how much movies changed short time . connery part group killers turned farmers who must till earth put food mouth zardoz , flying head goes place place collecting grain feed immortal humans vortex . connery plays " zed " , mutant ( they don't really say what sort mutant he ) who used rape murder his hearts content until forced become farmer . when zardoz comes grain collection zed buried under grain inside grain slips into vortex . vortex area where immortals live . it not easy figure out . i've watched this movie three or four times it shows vortex , simple english village , protected shield . how shield maintained ? we don't know . you look around vortex compound nothing there looks like technology advanced past 1820 . there some plastic things growing plants . they look out place plastic bean bag chairs middle castle . zed job easy . he must figure out way bring down invisible walls vortex so his band marauders take vengence inhabitants . killers must revenge forced become farmers . some ways i look this movie analog what going modern europe . present inhabitants europe bored life . they believe nothing . they nothing . so , they invite muslims full knowledge aim group transform europe something alien european . zardoz quite like . zed brought most everybody knows he death them . this something new modern people ; we invite very people who wish wreck society we helped build . anyway , zed destroys vortex mainframe computer . this part crystal computer " suck " zed into it . acting effects this part movie seem like velveta all over place ; it all just so cheezy . producers movie enlarges photo diamond connery just holds up his hands " falls " into crystal . perhaps i should less judgemental modern computer graphics . now , until final conflict crystal computer there lots stupid things person see . you'll see raiders riding horses shooting guns unlimited supply ammo ; first job raiders reduce population humans before farming could start . you'll see thin nude british actresses throwing themselves everybody any thing . ( connery go through divorce this time ? i see why . ) note , women not " bond " girls . so nudity not sexy . you'll see flying head zardoz who collects food . how he forces collection food not explained . how this head rock flies also not explained . anti-gravity ? we don't know not told . i give movie five stars i simply don't know why ? it entertaining . also , over six foot tall connery looks like near ape when standing 5'7 " thin-as-reeds british actors . i don't think any women weigh more than 110 pounds , 140 men . it great snap shot how thin british people used immediate post wwii era . john lennon peer this group . they all so thin ( or we now all so fat ) . oh heck get movie . it not bad discount . you'll enjoy it . there isn't any politics piss you off . there somewhat good story . it mindless fun entertainment . i enjoy it . trust me . if you get this movie you'll watch it once or twice year . it fun . if you figure out walls vortex make sure post answer this web site . 5 stars . it good mindless fun .	1

hal hartley never fails entertain , never fails engage my mind emotions parallel level . simple men no exception . seemingly simple plot - two brothers search their missing dad - provides so much room character growth i wish there entire series films centered around them . hard-edged view world : " there no such thing adventure . there no such thing romance . there only trouble desire " ( actually fritz lang movie 1920 ) there plenty going both prove disprove hartley ambivalent theories . simple men also formally introduces us absolutely delicious elena l�wensohn . one coolest hottest scenes all cinema we get watch her bizarre 50 beatnik-style dance sonic youth " kool thing . " then joined two lost soul brothers it turns into unlikely production number . many dismiss this film , hartley unwatchable or trivial miss point . what amazing hartley he takes seemingly trivial elevates it level art , once seen , reflects our lives every level brilliance inane . simple men pure cinematic delight . hooray hartley	1
oscar-winning director leo mccarey delivers heartwarming touching film only very few weak spots . although film neither revolves around christmas , nor even includes it until near end , it become perennial holiday must-see . even more than half-century later , audiences still enjoy bing crosby father o'malley ( same role he plays not-nearly-so-good bells st. mary ) , laid-back but innovative young priest out rescue failing parish tough new york neighborhood . there other impressive performances but finest barry fitzgerald ( quiet man , how green my valley)as crotchety but good-hearted old irish priest . bing must deal wayward youth , runaway young lady , financial problems . most all , he must deal entrenched ways fitzgerald some his congregants . it gentle , innocent , touching story . although songs might seem bit corny today , they still enjoyable bing honeyed voice always worth listening . this film good addition most any film library , not just your holiday films .	1
i compelled write this review after i read two reviews written salvadorean perspective claiming this movie essentially complete fiction . although , i haven't seen this movie several years i remember it griping shocking account events largely forgotten ( or even noticed back then ) average americans . i wonder if two salvadorean reviewers ever met or talked boyle , journalist whose experience movie based , or if they ever same places boyle during time . moreover , one key events depicted movie actually happen : december 2 , 1980 four american nuns who there giving aid relief poor people country brutally raped murdered group el salvador national guardsmen . like anything we view or read , stone movies should seen critical eye . course his movie not " ultimate truth " what happened 80 el salvador it should not viewed way . instead , it should viewed what it : one man perspective ( boyle ) what he witnessed while he there . how person perspective or account deepen our understanding history ? what questions it raise ? whose interests perspective ( or other perspectives ) serve ? whether this movie " accurate " depiction not important fact this movie get us thinking talking important issues surrounding justice , freedom , equality role our government overtly covertly plays international conflicts where those values stake	1
unlike mr. baker santa clarita , california who rated this item 2 , i think this film deserves much more than jake learn true meaning christmas ; one just pay close attention by-pass all commercialism involved . yes , he start out self-seeking free-wheeling but all changes he learns his hard lessons way . one thing , it starts him getting what he deserves ; punishment some jocks leaving him out desert so hard lessons start here . point , true meaning christmas gets shown him various ways , just wearing santa outfit his hardships spawn some lessons : he willingly sacrifices race winnings good cause ( even though money rightfully his ) , failed marriage gets repaired , crooked " elf " gets reformed life crime , plus one see porsche all forgotten tender moment little esteban hospital who pines his family-no one convince me jake not affected ; he it shows . finally when lesson fully espoused , it remarkable how climax coupled various holiday customs traditions ( christmas , hanukah kwanza ) enmeshed local parade plus group carolers almost overcome running sleigh . then , time limit which determines if he'll receive porsche approaches , he no hurry , but spends few seconds girlfriend watching his family celebrate table through window ; hence , sense family fizzles through . when all said , hailed porsche cast into total oblivion . all he then wants family ride sleigh . his lessons come hard , but he learns . again , one get past all commercialism really get meat this film , this film should get all accolades respected place all time-honored christmas films past . i love jonathan taylor thomas ; he good actor very handsome . but this not reason my customer review . unlike what other people may think or how they may view it , this one best christmas films teach what christmas really all	1
takuya loves satsuki satsuki loves takuya-at least until she finds out what takuya really loves dominated abused her . moonlight whispers lies somewhere piano teacher secretary thoughtful look how relationship based domination develop two people , but it presented manner unlike two films i just mentioned . all three share wide eyed fascination subject , but where secretary approaches it humor piano teacher horror , moonlight whispers out tell genuine love story . it helps two characters high school students who appear almost entirely innocent subject love beginning film . blurb box says watching moonlight whispers like watching very kinky episode " dawson creek " . it right , only i'd hasten add film better written acted than sitcom . not i ever watched show . ever . i first saw this film new york sm film festival ( i there films , not sm , thank you ) despite containing very little what we generally think sm , it audience favorite . it worth your attention	1

fervent desire often overlaps into soft-porn territory cinematic language carnal images aughties , extent old-fashioned romantic some us yearns timeless gems such " philadelphia story , " " casablanca , " " charade " " indiscreet . " these films , among others , remind us courtship necessity modern times . this reviewer nary word against adult nudity film -- , when it handled artistically sans embarrassment many european films . however , more offensive than today shock stock inane romantic comedies early 21st century made directors/auteurs who believe casting attractive actors precludes translating their fertile imaginations plausible , well-plotted scripts . while admittedly not perfect film , stanley donen " indiscreet " ( 1958 ) , starring cary grant ingrid bergman , realistically captures first blush courtship two middle-aged adults -- one prudent other deceptive -- charts their reluctant romance . sure , camera loves grant bergman , but it their fine acting combined clever dialogue sculpts " indiscreet " into classic . too many scenes count " indiscreet , " philip adams ( grant ) anna kalman ( bergman ) stare longingly into each other eyes searing intensity surpasses mere consummation love affair . example , breakfast nook scene anna london apartment , philip allows his meal grow cold while watching anna prepare hers stove . ( " it servants ' day off " her seductive phone invite earlier morning . ) his dining chair , he practically burns hole through his paramour apron . one bergman best lines spoken table : " stop . good manners spoil good food , " she quips . once seated , she too finds it nearly impossible eat because her suitor drinking her gaze . more than once they sip their tea , pause stare each other , then resume sipping . where subtle expressions courtship -- furtive glances , tender kisses sexual innuendos -- mature man mature woman ? unfolding screen " indiscreet , " certain . how memorable nighttime tableaux detailing first date vulnerable london-based stage actress arrogant american diplomat ! after overindulging champagne private club where anna brother-in-law , alfred , member , they arrive too late attend ballet performance romeo juliet decide give anna tickets two teens . here where grant delivers one most understated lines movie : " i know how story ends -- bad . " ( comment , not simply reference shakespearean drama , could meant social statement conservative adults ' opposition young love 1950s america -- i.e. waltz vs . rock ' roll . ) rather than evening end failed note , anna philip return club more libation laughter topped off late-night stroll past london monuments , while anna chauffeur few her fans trail them . final scene anna philip first night courtship exemplifies how erotic fire handled subtly " indiscreet . " ( course , there enough sexual tension violins alone . ) pair share banter nightcap before disappearing into anna apartment shutting door . when camera zooms out shot closed door , visual effect erotic impact more telling than " not disturb " sign hanging doorknob outside honeymoon suite . stark contrast , many " " -rated flicks today nothing but prurient lessons heavy-handed debauchery . gone ethereal gazes , graceful kisses balletic gestures yesteryear . unlike light dalliance observed " indiscreet , " even today so called " pg-13 " flicks opt overt , gratuitous scenes lingerie shedding naughty/scatological word lashing no transcendent significance . even bertolucci films " last tango paris " " sheltering sky " treat scenes nudity sex moving sculptures paintings , reserve curse words existential statements . while i not seek metaphysical meaning " indiscreet " other films like ilk , i expect great romance gorgeous film score . who knows ? bard himself might approve -- absence ill-fated lovers notwithstanding	1

this film course now somewhat obscure considering all since time film life christ . jeffery hunter most handsome christ you ever see screen . apostles all clean cut . movie features very colorful clothing catch eye . great musical score miklos roza , which particular favorite classical music fans request radio even today ! gospel rather compressed ministry christ particular . however , not say it ineffective . sermon mount scene actually encapsulated all comprehensive review christian philosophical points boiled down one mass meeting . movie not adherent bible events contains lot fiction , especially respect activity aristocracy romans . it tries tell several stories , such barabbas , roman officer , mary mother christ , john baptist definitely most beautiful salome you ever see dance screen . taking cross , whipping , death , all handled very delicately . not too much blood or grief . jeffery hunter seen after easter rising shown symbolically end very well apostles gathered beach his shadow overwhelms them he tells them depart preach gospel they leave 2 2 . really effective scene movie so entrenched 50s culture . seen this movie child sixties seeing it again now this century , i think it should not too criticized our 20/20 perception now . back then it after all different time culture , one not exist today should viewed perhaps nostalgic way , worth viewing , but don't depend it filling you biblical truth .	1
i bought most friday 13th dvds around halloween time discount . course i couldn't find this one , even thought it wal-mart long time before . my opinion , this one wasn't very good all . compared all rest i greatly disappointed . it just so fake , not realistic all . very cheesy . those who wish complete set , this one part it . this one so awful far other ones . so fake it shameful , bad script , it jumped shark !!!! jason -yes that my real name !!!	-1
i saw this movie maybe five years ago . i found myself thinking back it oddest times without apparent reason . it happened again me today , i decided look amazon see if there any insightful reviews offering opinions why this movie still compels me . i surprised discover praise this movie hard find wmd iraq . fact , if you rewrote bad reviews keeping all their points intact , but changed conclusions read , " this why i liked it " , you'd right track finding film strengths . i say right track because what film ultimately gives life something greater than its many parts . it yields haunting compelling image loss , dissolution , madness , glimpses redemption only highlight how far past saving these characters . i think this movie , i remember emotions , mood it , way smell your childhood bring long forgotten memories back	1

just enjoyed quiet brilliance yasujiro ozu " tokyo monogatari ( tokyo story ) " first time last week , i immediately drawn ozu film released criterion collection last year , 1951 " bakushu ( early summer ) " . both movies part his classic noriko trilogy which uses many same actors playing characters same names but different roles . consequently , great setsuko hara portrays young woman named noriko both movies , but this time , she liberated daughter ( rather than forlorn daughter-in-law ) also focal point story ( rather than aged parents " tokyo story " ) . musical chairs continue chishu ryu playing his real age noriko strong-willed brother koichi ( rather than resigned grandfather ) haruko sugimura playing older neighbor tomi , mother noriko prospective fiancee ( versus conniving daughter shige ) . chieko higashiyama still plays grandmother , but her name not tomi but shige , her husband shukishi portrayed ichiro sugai . it only confusing if you looking some kind plot continuity films , but ozu primarily interested reinforcing similar themes evolving family unit post-wwii japan . this time , he it more comic , sometimes even ribald fashion , while it doesn't resonate quite deeply " tokyo story " , " early summer " full ozu shrewd observations insights make it emotionally affecting , especially story takes surprise turn toward end . story here centers mamiya family , who trying find suitable husband 28-year old single daughter noriko . typical japanese culture , several generations live together under one roof , frequent subject conversation noriko lack husband . however , she member new postwar breed japanese women . she dresses almost exclusively western clothes holds down administrative position office heart tokyo . spirit , noriko bears strong resemblance elizabeth bennett jane austen " pride prejudice " , point raised film historian donald richie his informative commentary . she loves go dinner her girlfriends . four friends , two married two unmarried . particularly amusing scene , four spirited debate pros cons married life versus single life . noriko happy her life it doesn't seem too concerned changing it anytime soon . nonetheless , family attempts fix noriko up successful , 40-year old business associate her boss . although polite matchmaking effort , she becomes more interested her neighbor , old classmate now widowed left alone small daughter his mother . noriko prefers her potential husband old friend they slip into their new romantic relationship more easily than two complete strangers . bigger problem , though , she makes her decision without consulting her family that where familial conflict arises . hara continues revelation me , beautiful , charismatic actress who radiates goodness sense cunning mischief entrancing . supporting performances excellent sugimura again standout surprising turn mother grateful noriko her decision marry her son kenkichi . kuniko miyake bigger , more dimensional role here than " tokyo story " , playing yet again brother wife fumiko . she hara particularly lovely scene beach end film , two pretty funny scene where they hide their clandestine cake slices somnambulant child . chikage awashima portrays noriko best friend aya feisty charm , goading noriko see man she passed up , impersonating country bumpkin preview noriko new married life trading innuendo-heavy barbs noriko politically incorrect boss . this latter interchange surprisingly adult 1951 , they even joke noriko may lesbian waiting so long get married . children play more prominent roles here , ozu really plays up their bratty insubordination they hurl inappropriate epithets when they don't get their way , though their running away home catalyst noriko become attracted kenkichi . yuuharu atsuta provides beautiful cinematography , which gratefully captured fairly pristine print film , though i believe ozu one most responsible simple yet powerful scene compositions . his now familiar low-to-the ground camera angles used consistently film replicate perspective someone sitting tatami mat . lighter more loosely structured than " tokyo story " , " early summer " essential viewing ozu aficionados anyone interested post-wwii japanese society . richie thorough commentary , dvd package also includes 47-minute documentary , " ozu films behind scenes " , which includes table discussion ozu longtime cameraman takashi kawamata , his sound editing assistant kojiro suematsu producer shizuo yamanouchi who produced six ozu films	1

make no mistake ; " chato land " sprawling , unforgiving environment offers little water no reward . blistering , sprawling landscape rock sagebrush , however , but backdrop this story shows man his most ugly moments . charles bronson stars pardon chato , half apache indian who enjoying drink saloon when he antagonized arrogant sheriff . chato goes against sheriff wishes leave because his heritage , lets his actions speak themselves , leaving mouthy lawman dead floorboards . posse soon rounded up variety area men , many them farmers ranchers . they embark trip find chato avenge death town , well feed some their own continual hatred towards indians general . greed , hate perseverance battle logic , pride tolerance group soon start battling each other over what they think right wrong when it comes avenging death lawman . great western film 1971 , chato land offers solid stoic storyline wrought irony well themes loyalty revenge . charles bronson aside , superb supporting cast experienced well . victor french ( later " little house " " highway heaven " stardom ) graces screen one posse members , jack palance james whitmore tow , its well rounded cast never lacks quality acting despite somewhat linear storyline . palance plays part quincy whitmore , war veteran who understands , sometimes even respects apache actions more than most . his arch-nemesis jubal hooker ( played simon oakland ) who " fever " wanting see apache man hang , even if it costs them lives which could end up coming down last man . jubal excellently played oakland man who consumed his own destiny vengeance . loyalties loved lost , large part movie very emotional power prestige we experience dismay men they deal battles rage within their very own camp , minds . bronson portraying cunning , intelligent yes even ruthless apache warrior , chato land western filled buzzards drinking blood , dark side man , notion if you go battle someone their own back yard , you better think twice who best odds , regardless how many men you bring you . scenic landscape shots taken night well during scorching hot days excellent , sound quality this dvd my opinion very good if not perfect . if you want western gets dirty but portrays deep story within , see " chato land "	1
very good , but first part , it left me questioning their sources how accurate their stories indian civiizations before white man came . how they know so much able reconstruct their towns computer graphics . it made me wonder if i fed bologne or not . i questioning myself through out whole thing . how they know so much how they know exactly what happened what things looked like ? how they know so much ?? i mean this hundreds years before white man came . i think documentary very good well worth watch . i just could not get over first part , how they know so much indians ancient history how they lived what their ancient towns looked like . it just seemed little overly speculative all . next big question how could this complete documentary american indians without talking destruction inca empire peru . talking more indian tribes south america ?	1

this 1935 version treasure island all hallmarks cinema classic yet somehow not terribly engaging . only aspect i identify stopped me enjoying it fullest casting jackie cooper jim hawkins . his performance stiff quite two-dimensional . later life guy himself admitted he really wasn't very good child actor . wallace beery however so incredibly effective his role long john silver he redeems film makes it worth watching . picture sound quality this release superb we all come expect warner home video releases films this age	1
this movie combination baseball love story rings true . i not like schmaltz all , but costner kelly preston true connection . story very much filmed within modern moral code , yet eventual reality " you don't know what you ' til you lose it " beautifully portrayed both actors . baseball segments exceptionally well . costner beyond realistic major league pitcher . very underrated movie , maybe evidenced its extensive play pay networks now , 7 years after it theater run . sountrack doesn't hurt either .	1

one first great ealing comedies , clear indication their comedies would carry social political weight well . this picture run-down section london discovers horde burried treasure when bomb left over ww ii explodes accidentally , residents pimlico , london , learn they actually part burgandy , deeded king 1400s . this means they separate country right heart london , they decide act like separate country . thus they conclude laws england don't apply anymore - but likewise england cuts them off , pimlico under siege . craziness situation leapfrogs , passports now required , services cut , people throwing food over barbed-wire fence help them survive . it great satire government sovereignty . it also interesting look post-war london , its burned-out buildings still plentiful ration books still use ( england felt very much short end stick after war , last allied countries under wartime restrictions shortages ) . script terrific ( typical ealing productions ) , stanley holloway wonderful leader pimlico . definitely worth watch	1

alan arkin ( like george lazenby james bond franchise ) only got it once , but his interpretation inspector clouseau , he pulls it off memorably . one things makes this movie so good arkin clouseau organic movie so movie clips decent pace . sometimes peter sellers , everything came stop so we could watch him trip twitch put his foot into buckets unsuccessfully try out costumes ... until it felt like movie ran ten twenty minutes too long . peter sellers could very funny , but sometimes gag could tedious . ' revenge pink panther ' my favorite sellers entries because it felt like editor employed . -- thing makes arkin clouseau so much fun he actually seems little smarter than sellers clouseau . what makes sellers funny he both stupid supremely arrogant . we don't necessarily like him , but he funny . arkin , you actually end up liking guy . there sympathetic core him this partly due fact he isn't all stupid . he moments personal insight ( like when he rips up his autographed sean connery picture because he doesn't deserve it ) it makes clouseau interesting . -- arkin smart here . he doesn't try peter sellers . this isn't imitation . it may not even interpretation . what arkin work funny smart script , wonderful locales team ( like lazenby bond ) who bent over backwards bring out clouseau movie doesn't original clouseau . what it amounts funny ( times , hilarious ) movie shines pink panter franchise . this movie isn't just curiousity . it terrific comedy that worth look	1

wow this movie eye opener . after watching it i believe almost any conspiracy theory , because they all sound more reasonable than truth government atomic testing programs . back then people told mny forms radiation bounce harmlessly off human skin ! hosts kid tv shows talked bomb shelter preparedness ! no wonder everyone went nuts 60 . it backlash against all " atomic war " talk . children regularily reminded classs a-bomb could hit any time . hmm explains alot boomers . you probably already know this movie collection propaganda films shown america calm fears public over nuclear war . it brilliantly edited . hope makers long prolific career . some it very funny when you look back attitudes time . there great part where nixon appears variety show nikita kruschev , nikita makes dick look pretty shabby they attempt one up each other aamerican national tv . when you lack people skills even hard line communist premiere then you know you're trouble . ah dick , you should learned . most important message i got this film gov't needs watched very closely ensure its honesty . there too many agendas floating around washington don't public best interest mind . don't accept anything spoon fed you because it probably load crap . except irradiated food , i'm sure gov't wouldn't let happen if it wasn't safe . not !	1

finding nemo probably one best movies ever produced pixar walt disney . it hit theaters , also hit dvd release . this two-disc set features same movie original theatrical release , plus lots extra features . there extra scenes deleted scenes , but these mainly sketches hence not included part regular movie . movie itself worth buying this set ; its bright flashy cool visuals special effects make it attractive kids . soundtrack considerably different traditional classical fair found disney motion length pictures . this movie soundtrack laid back different , but paces well action . voice-overs great , comedy unique hilarious . vegetarian sharks ! fish without memory ! disney takes family entertainment new heights this great movie , i highly recommend it	1
this adaptation fairy tale " little red riding hood " not children.it got couple good transformations , not best i've seen but good nonetheless . i'd imagine kids would find this scary it not bad adults either . i doubt this film would made these days 80 able get away much more , unless great terry gilliam helm . i loved set designs , all little creatures way wolves used all very well done.as i said , not something i would show my 8 year old daughter fear it causing her nightmares but would definitely recommend this teens adults . good horror film those who don't need axe-wielding murderers able enjoy more fantasy right	1

why should one buy this series ? what missing episodes ? they going added later , or this it ? i cannot believe this . would you buy bicycle missing wheel ? or keyboard without keys ? i'd like amazon explain its customers what it plans ..	-1
i saw this sometime back 2001 , i believe . friend mine bought it vhs dollar some bargain bin somewhere . huge fan heavy music rock over past 20+ years , this movie opened my eyes whole new scene like nothing ever before . course i fan nirvana , aic soundgarden early mid 90 , but this film exposes you origins all . little independant research , you then find all sorts gems bands albums you might truly enjoy . mudhoney , supersuckers murder city devils three my favorite bands i first sought them out direct result watching " hype " then doing my own investigating there . it won't steer you wrong . what up new cover though ? used black white stage diving scene red letters .	1
this series sold missing episodes , like many others here unbox . they think their customers so dumb ? would you buy dvd series missing dvd ? what sense this make ? what disappointment this service ..	-1
this certainly one best atlantis shows date . one common ground .	1
this one most beautiful delectably edited movies i've ever seen . actors know their roles wholeheartedly . my guess they classically-trained theatre actors . chunhyang one korea 5 stories told oral tradition , originally adults . pansori , if you've ever taken class or tried it , very difficult . requires power diaphragm vocal range . once , there 7 us class , all together , power our voices could not top sole instructor . im kwon-taek smart incorporate pansori . those you who dont know , there no chunhyang tale without pansori , so it absolutely necessary this movie . " chunhyang-ga " balladeer jo sang-hyeon , also known national intangible asset #5 . my dvd said it japanese . someone should fired not fact-checking . also , it nothing like raise red lantern or zhang yimou . but westerners need write make it relative their prior movie experience . chunhyang beautiful story poetry honor meditation . it love fidelity .	1

i've seen one other film federico fellini ( it 8 1/2 ) i saw half " la dolce vita . " i know what his films like , so when i watched " la strada " i surprised what i saw . this film completely unlike aforementioned films , therefore , probably fellini most accessible film . it movie shades much earlier american film called " broken blossoms " but sound new storyline , fellini made poignant , cute , sad little film . i didn't even realize how much i liked this film until it over . fellini wife giulietta masina plays gelsomina , young girl who bought her family zampano ( anthony quinn ) , strongman . he travels around country her , all while brutally mean her , they eventually end up traveling circus where gelsomina meets fool ( richard basehart ) , much nicer , tender man who advises her leave zampano . what perfect name this character ; fool . his decisions foolish end , his fate fool . ending film truly fantastic , very well acted moment . " la strada " seems take direct inspiration several things . storyline inspired " broken blossoms " character gelsomina seems inspired tramp , character created charlie chaplin . she half-wit , not very pretty , seems hate zampano . yet everytime she given opportunity escape , she declines . this movie made during heyday italian neo-realism fellini went against convention casting two american actors film ( both actors dubbed soundtrack english , available this dvd . i recommend you watch italian film though , because dubbed fellini film ruins magic ) . probably most inspired casting decision film masina . i'm not very fond when director work their wives , because wife usually movie solely because she wife ( see guy ritchie remake " swept away " proof ) . i can't imagine actress portraying gelsomina . she brings just right amount sadness , innocence , playfulness character . even if you're not fond fellini ( although , if you're reading this , you probably ) i recommend you see this film it completely different mood feel it than his other films . even if you don't particularly want see movie , you think it seeing little piece history ( this film first win best foreign language film academy awards ) . criterion collection superb , flawless transfer dvd . grade :	1
someone just today told me i should see this film . what disappointment see these warnings poor quality dvds produced fox lorber . oh well	-1
great movie . date best version out there . 2 disc ! it great watching it commentary fans . this just awesome . colour widescreem format surperb . many special features including commentaries , interviews , trailers etc . scramble city episode which special feature , which i looking forward fell below expectations due fact you could only watch it commentary . only four toy commercials . there easter eggs both discs ( old diaclone toy commercials ) . overall great addition my dvd collection fully recommended	1
reviewer who cannot stand steven spielbergs'over sentimentalized trashing history ; his inability tell story without shoving it your face ; i loved this movie . beginning end it moving well told . slice history needs telling . incredible performances , especially john malkovich . it treats japanese respect yet not any way diminish their brutality ww2 . inspiring film ! only other film spielberg ever come close this one schindlers list . must film see	1
i just watched " mommie dearest " first time tonight . most critics fans " mommie dearest " acknowledge , film portrays such pitiful story abuse , such over-dramatic ( but entirely true-to-life ) performance faye dunaway , it both hilarious depressing . i'm 30 didn't know much joan crawford outside endless chatter film " classic camp . " seems me crawford probably bi-polar or some other unexplained mental disorder . i think she quite aware some insanity she lived caused movie industry she dedicated . she knew industry poisoned any good thing she endeavored , whether it successful marriage , happy family , or even giving charity . her life running commercial directed hollywood , not unlike tabloid-driven , image-obsessed hollywood we today . despite often-times hilarious image her her sibling victimization film , christina abuse disappointment her mother real painful some point her life . christina crawford completely justified turning her mother image its head her book movie . yes , movie outrageous but it also empowering . after all , what powerless their pitiful past except laugh . mocking unexplained , unjustified pain you experienced past , renders it powerless harm your future . this legacy " mommie dearest " whatever joan crawford really	1
leaving aside painful horrific real life incident taints movie moment , lets just look movie it . first off , i love horror movies , some my faveorites even include ones considered " bad " tons movie critics , like first 4 ' friday 13th ' movies . i love most nightmare elm street movies , first 2 halloween movies , tons others , inlcuding , yes , victor salva own ' jeepers creepers ' , whcih i think best horror movie come out last 5 years . but clownhouse just laughable annoying terribly acted . bickering among 3 brothers driving me nuts one . characters so many amazingly stupid things cliches horror movies , they them often , more so than even dumbest horror movies . peple here already noted very cheesy music takes away whatever creepiness there . movie just plain boring . killings all dull lifeless . there just didnt seem any reason this movie exist , i mean its barely 80 minutes long ! incredibly short any movie , even horror movie , which usually around 90 minutes-plus or minus few . movie very lazy explaining who killers , we get very little info them , why they mental patients , one-what they ? i mean what their method killing or why they dangerous . now they loose , what they want ? money ? they just wanna kill ? isn't it strange they don't talk all ? some people actually compared this greatest horror movie them all , john carpenter halloween , now thats truley scary thought . movie also incredibly predictable took incredibly long time finally kids realize killer clowns house gonna kill them , even when action finally starts , its all too unbeleivable silly beleive . unfortuneatley , i rather disturbing sinister thought why this " horror " movie , which almost doesnt even feel like real horror movie me , anyway , might made . apparently , victor salva , director molesting young child star film , nathan forrest winters , years since he age 7 , they previously worked victor salva first film , short film , some years earlier . perhaps this whole movie making enterprise endeavered just so victor could even more close proximity boy so he could molest him even more . perhaps why victor made film . its ironic this movie evil clowns , because clown someone usually makes kids happy , kid actually line why clowns fake shouldnt trusted . its all so weird , like victor trying get himself caught ? there so much incriminating visuals dialogue this film just doesnt belong horror movie , but well brings mind kiddie porn . apparently victor also friend kids family years . this movie almost like victor bragging his molestation boy , using his camera storytelling skills shove everyone faces his relationship boy . \ there some strange back story film never really explained alludes mental illness , boy may suicidal tried off himself cutting his hand or perhaps wrist . its said he " scars " there . also boy may committed , just like escaped killer clowns ? salva drawing parallel there ? why child wet bed such advanced age , whats his problem anyway ? its never said , but perhaps salva hinting hes gay , who knows . its interesting killers dont just escape out jail , they excape mental facility perhaps they really just sick individuals , just like boy ? victor salva trying say he boy actor film both share something others may say sick but they belong together ? they say child molestors search out young boys who they think homosexual , who one them . clowns drawn boy , yet its also always boy who see them , almost like hes looking them like they both drawn each other . i dont know why this film made , so if my theories rub some here wrong way , i am sorry , i just cant figure out why someone who would show talent later horror movies like jeepers creepers , would make such pointless awful strange horror movie , if not his own perverted pleasure . definitely miss this flick , dont fooled all surprisingly positive reviews here . this movie sucks	-1

corky introvert who not relate very well people , so he learns express himself through use if his alter ego , fats dummy . turns out people love fats , association , corky . certainly corky must realize people understand fats corky same , right ? perhaps not , corky relies increasingly more fats say what he himself could easily , if only he confidence so . fats brings corky fame fortune , but we all know money cannot buy happiness . turns out corky fame just solution his childhood romance , peggy ann snow , whose wanderlust not satisfied husband duke rooted , staid life . loser-turned-celeb corky what it takes sweep once popular peggy off her feet take her away it all ? anthony hopkins gives chilling performance corky / fats , burgess meredith shines , always , corky agent , ben greene . ann-margret some very good moment peggy , though ultimately her performance uneven . very good film	1

i skeptical this film expected disappointed , but contrary , i pleasantly surprised . essential thing remember this maurice pialat * vision * van gogh , not documentary . taken spirit , there much here vincent fans enjoy . those unfamiliar van gogh life work likely lost ( probably bored ) , but those who familiar vincent his oeuvre appreciate research pialat put into this film artistic choices he made . i also encourage viewers who may felt they missed something first time watch it second time , because there many small things best noticed second time round . one detail i particularly appreciated replication van gogh actual room auberge ravoux auvers-sur-oise this film ( not case " lust life " or " vincent theo " ) ; those who visited auberge moved their experience -- like myself -- feel surge recognition first time humble little room appears onscreen . course there some major inaccuracies/speculations pialat uses fuel drama . most obvious central love affair film ( marguerite gachet ) , which pialat invention most implausible number reasons . but it serves its purpose context film . i not get impression ( one reviewer below ) affair presented motive suicide--it not . suicide affair both result larger malaise . jacques dutronc simply extraordinary vincent , his acting filled subtlety . he doesn't stoop histrionics or scenery-chewing ... he doesn't need . every gesture , every facial expression , every look his eyes says something character . no wonder he won cesar role . this neither vincent " lust life " ( kirk douglas ' tormented soul searching love understanding ) nor vincent " vincent theo " ( tim roth mad-as-a-hatter egoist ) . this vincent quiet cup coffee before he goes work morning escapes dr. gachet house enjoy solitary lunch wheatfields ( latter one my favorite moments film -- simple but lyrical ) . there no sign " mad artist " van gogh mythology . suicide comes much surprise film it must real life . we don't see it coming . apparently there region 2 dvd available uk deleted scenes bonus materials . i wish it available region 1 dvd us !	1

this one my two top favorite movies all time . it still time innocence movies when things alluded rather than shown . kids go away spring vacation ft . lauderdale kick up their heels . back then kicking up their heels consisted drinking lot pretty much all . it great movie i highly recommend it . connie francis introduced this movie she sings title song her most beautiful velvet voice	1
amazingly , 3 8 reviewers ( myself included ) related tilghman .... which says more hollywood than descendants this great man . there so much material his life base movies it simply hasn't some reason . i found this movie wonderful if only let world know tilghman even existed .. his death important event so i'm glad it portrayed . acting well general casting great . wiley lynn character first seems over top but if you familiar man you realize this very accurate portrayal . lynne eventually brought down hail lead but not after taking down beloved man . i some problems accuracy film though ... if you've ever chandler , oklahoma you won't see huge mountains distance , tilghman never rode his horse chandler cromwell .. he loved his car . i love sam elliot ( he great job ) but he just not 70+ year old man . i wish older children ( his frist marriage ) shown funeral multiple memorial services he given could mentioned . other than i highly recommend this film	1
truly one most off wall movies ever . john cusack girlfriend dumps him . this would pretty hard most people except he literally thousands pictures up her . everything this movie extreme . cusack sicko best friend amazingly funny watch , sure see him snort snow wonderul scene . cusack girlfriend new preppy boyfriend who head ski team . cusack decides defeat him . there way too much talk there no way i could give anythign away one funniest movies ever . i mean you chinese guy who learned english listening howard cosell forces cusack race cars everyday while announcing race his car , insane paper boy who wants his $2 , you never see van halen same way again . cause everybody wants some , baby how bout you ? obviously it goes without saying this movie needs special edition .	1

i don't know why anyone gives this film less than five star rating top it praise budd boetichher westerns . though boeticher films great , i find pre-boetciher-scott westerns best there more traditional less talky grim than boeticher westerns . ten wanted men no exception ; it fast paced , well-plotted plenty intense action keep your eyes peeled . definately one scott best . sometimes i find scott-boeticher westerns , there too much talking walking around some pretentious talk drag film down	1
my humble opinion , woody allen best movie director that currently out there practicing trade . he says more , amuses more , creates more relatively " shoestring " budget than any other director today . his popularity apparently rather limited point his movies usually don't even get shown my town . allen films get praised lot people " know " but , come oscar time , only award handed out his productions goes best supporting actress . well , each his own but i'll recommend every movie he ever involved ( lone exception " what new pussycat ? " ) ; even ones i haven't seen yet . last night i got my first look " purple rose cairo " i ended up rating it " 4 star " mainly because i thought it moved rather awkwardly times ( woody allen standards ) . concept certainly original ; actor movie steps out screen into real life ( seems they're watching us closely we're watching them ) . i started seeing all sorts possibilities , i admit , i disappointed some them didn't emerge . what emerge excellent study fantasy vs . reality . setting film midst depression which brilliant idea because it gave readily understood backdrop gloom doom . anyone would love escape such existance . our main character , played mia farrow , finds her escape movie theatre . strange events unfold , she finds herself ultimately choose fantasy reality we , audience , find ourselves rooting one choice or other . ( even exasperated screen characters cheering sides well ) . end she makes her choice live consequences ... or she ? i saw this movie tcm night they celebrating van johnson . i presumed " late " mr. johnson would somehow shown one his old sceen roles . however , there he fairly small part looking well doing credible job . i learned , robert osborne introduction film , it still little early call van johnson " late " . much cast competent good top kudos ms. farrow . ending movie strong i almost tempted give it " 5 star " rating but i remembered i significantly more impressed some other woody allen movies i've seen lately .	1
i found this movie very funny . everyone knows it isn't goal really important , it journey there what very funny this movie . it changes " nerd " taking chances stealing van finally standing up his father i found most vindicating . it also changes guys girlfriend he getting tape how thier relationship changed too . what very funny physics student making calculation speed car so they get across washed out bringe . i recommend unrated version this movie anyone good laugh movie .	1

i whole heartedly disagree amazon editorial . first it says this film unintentionally funny . it isn't . then it says one two heroines film gets killed her husband . she doesn't . if amazon insists trying write witty synopsis its films , i would suggest staff writer first view film . this film tradition valley dolls spite misleading ' professional ' reviews it crowd pleaser . material originates steamy bestseller , big budget top notch production - all like dolls . you see money screen beautiful locations amazing wardrobe jewels all gorgeously photographed . film like book juicy soap opera should enjoyed such . acting very good all especially marie-france pisier who throughout entire film never loses viewer understanding her motives even when end film she completely lost herself . five stars amazon , you don't agree , just accurate	1
why this my favorite movie ? because it simply presents life , all its joys , griefs , paradoxes mysteries . what puts this movie class itself spirit hope runs through movie , especially main character , ingmar , whose indomitable spirit shines face change tragedy . yet movie never drifts into sentimentality . end , it movie mystery love . central theme ingmar " life dog . " like dog shot into space soviet without regard its safe return earth , ingmar , like most us , seems " shot into life " alone . movie series vignettes combine what seems haphazard manner , but reflects , my mind , most meaningful transcendant moments our lives , moments simply cannot categorized . these moments funny , sad , tragic , hopeful , above all , poignant . scene where ingmar boxes his tomboy friend , ending embrace , defies words its sublimity . scene which ingmar mother breaks down , absolutely heartbreaking . wistful scenes ingmar " marriage " neighbor girl , his brother description intercourse neighborhood children , remind you revelations youth . but there insights into adulthood well , happy-go-lucky uncle , his happy but impish bride , contrast prim glum foster parents , perverted modern artist , man who perpetually fixing his roof . end , you'll celebrating sweden , ingmar ( get it ? ) johanson triumphs over floyd patterson . hurrah sweden ! hurrah humanity !	1

i've never watched any shows regularly fx until this year , when i happened catch double episode it always sunny philadelphia , 3 episodes into season 2 . i don't remember when i've laughed so hard past few years . this show hysterical ! charlie day , what i say ? i dare say he funniest character television . case point , episode : hundred dollar baby . gang walking home evening ( charlie , mac , dennis dee ) when apparent meth head tries mug them . charlie mac dennis all run away , knocking down dee fend herself ( intentionally or non-intentionally ? you decide . ) . dee gets mugged decides she going take some kind " box-er-cizing " thing learn how defend herself , but her dad frank , played danny devito , pipes up says if she wants learn defend herself she should learn him , he former boxer ( " frankie fast hands " ) . she agrees . meantime , dennis mac convince charlie become underground street fighter after attending one realizing " all you really need able take worse beating than other guy . " mac asks dennis " you know who take beating ? " they both instantly turn each other say " charlie . " what great charlie he usually up anything long there money or excitement it , this no exception . back dee - gym she approached woman who offers her some assistance form so-called " performance enhancing supplements . " dee now popping pills , which charlie sees while accidentally catching her ( she doesn't know he saw her ) , now charlie popping her pills . i refuse spoil rest , but rest assured this one funniest things you see this year , rest series no exception . i yet see un-funny character this show , but charlie steals show almost every time . charlie day comedy gold	1
first all , i highly recommend review below , guy named " sideburns . " i think he captures factual basis spirit this film . i understand how some who " australia-philes " might want see purely aussie product , this not . it not " smash palace " or many other fine aussie films genre . what this film , described one word : weird . that good thing . genius eric roberts used ( may still again ) , his ability seemingly lose himself his roles , so while lacking any self-consciousness how he comes across . see this film then see other excellent ( weird ) films , including " pope greenwich village " " runaway train , " see career arc pretty amazing . he seemed get into serious films major talent around him , then able carry-off demanding roles ( albeit , some similar , sure ) , energy command . okay , onto this film . first all , let honest , this not deep film . it not meant . it almost like indie verson farrely brothers film , least their early ones , where they don't mind taking risks also fun . there also nice romantic subtext they ( " kingpin " - believe it or not , " me , myself irene " ) where , ridiculous way , they reflect what good majority people who either searching love , or just searching something themselves , they find it reflected or - case main characters farrely films , definitely " coca cola kid , " abbetted others . i'm not saying woody harrelson or jim carrey could've coca cola kid , but what they all common , specific roles they played these films , make one wonder if anyone would or could find anything remotely interesting them romantic way . they so completely un-indearing , it seems almost cartoonish - then one just thinks many people we all know , it not unbelieavable . music film alone just fantastic . coca cola jingle robert character commissions incredible , it punctuated this aboriginal guy who playing his device - guy roberts finds outside coca cola local offices , promptly drafts into service . it just really funny see kid mind work - marketing wheels a'spinnin ' he devises employs his strategies . everyone both sides equally mocked , makes really fine , mostly non-judgemental film ( rare these days , eh ? ) . there other nice touches soundtrack andalso , i'd remiss , not mention nuts , if i avoided very nice scene greta scaatchi where she freshening up ... well , go see film ! it quirky , it revealing , lot fun . it also great job discussing culture clashes , where , when everyone harmless , you see how progress comes out some dissension , yet still wonder if we're losing little something translation . if that vague , so film some ways , i think precisely what director going . it doesn't all fit perfectly . lot doesn't , makes it kind seem real	1
i liked first two spy kids movies pretty well . first one well acting great . second one , maybe bit less than first but still entertaining . this movie , however , incredibly lame absolutely boring . my brother went see it my mom theaters , some reason they came back saying it soooo good . when it came out dvd i watched it my brother . only twenty minutes into it i wishing i could leave . all " amazing " 3-d , computer animated sequences giving me terriblel headaches i no reason whatsoever watch this drivel . previous reviewer said , spy kids series lost its charm after second installment . this movie they trying go out bang , but fell miles short finish line . acting seemed stale unemotional . humor lame not even funny . whole things seemed like weird dream director thought might make decent movie . overall , it seems me this just one mega test even worse flop " adventures sharkboy lavagirl " . i no appreciation this director any more unless he gives us something good fast , i probably won't watching anymore his films any time soon	-1
although not fan kenneth brannaugh , i willing give his hamlet fair viewing . since this my favorite play , i hoping film would better than his last two mediocre endeavors into shakespeare plays ; unfortunately , it worse ! beginning performances : jack lemmon wonderful actor , but here , he embarrassment , many other actors assembled , including julie christie ( whom i usually adore ) . casting all over map which makes uneven performances unsatisfying scenes . brannaugh own delivery text rushed usually unconvincing , despite vehemence which he delivers every over-ennunciated syllable , which sounds manic , bordering farce . bad direction over-indulgent acting ! it might interesting see what brannaugh would good direction , instead his own . i could go my problems staging other production values but damage this brilliant work every level not worth going depth . good news zefferelli hamlet , actor i don't normally like -- mel gibson -- spot perfect . actor excellently cast , production values direction serve text , rather than competing it , brannaugh version . zefferelli knows his shakespeare his films , my opinion represent definitive versions ( watch his romeo juliet taming shrew ) , too bad us he didn't more . too bad , also , no one contemporary seems capable . instead we get recent unwatchable junk " hip-cool " sensibilities . argh ! it not surprising no one rush produce dvd this tragedy film	-1

ok , i saw this movie years ago when it first came out i rented it vhs dvd few times , still don't own it yet . this good friday 13th movie , but best thing this movie way they brought jason back file . you tommy jarvis now around 18-19 years old losing his hair , he escapes mental institution his side kick ( arnold horshack ? ) anyway , he goes cemetary rainy night dig up jason face his past once all . but after opening coffin seeing jason dead body he goes crazy ( obviously not taking his meds ) pulls metal pole cemetary fence starts stabbing jason while dead man still coffin . after calming down he throws jason mask down grave gives jason few choice words . all sudden lightening strikes pole while it stuck jason body . rest they say history . jason comes back life goes work . these movies so subjective , i loved it one best , last " real " friday 13th movie . but i would rent it see what you think before you buy it . i own parts 2-5 all good films , part ii probably best . i need part one , part six then my collection complete , nothing after part six important . part 8 funny watch , but not worth buying , but ending really good though	1

wow some people take children movies too seriously . i own harriet spy i still love it same since it came out i think it nick classic . if you think it its shame new generation kids grow up without movies like this . harriet spy few things it seem like its not children but if you pay attention watch it end it also teaches you appreciate what you plenty other good morals . movie description bit simple complicated same time its 11 yr old wants writer but her spying her writing actually its more like shes exploring writing everything she sees . you cant just read reviews movie you see it cause some reviews dont this great movie any justice . acting great story line very original thought provoking . if your parent you would like know if this good movie your kids well im tellin you it . i 8 when it came out it made me look some things differently . this great movie you shouldn't let your kids miss this this definitely teach children appreciate good friends more important good parents . i'm sorry if this review doesn't help or give good movie description but this very underrated movie leave good impression kids not bad one	1
i think this movie goes right heart philosophical question what art artists supposed : they merely present facts/ideas/personalities/images no comment , no moralizing , no personal ulterior motives ( leaving all those things viewer ) , or they need state clearly moral purpose certain direction ( which viewer then accept or reject) ? martin sheen kit , garbageman working south dakota ; he becomes friends 15-year-old holly ( sissy spacek ) . when her father tells sheen he doesn't want him near his daughter again , sheen kills him . two run off together , living while woods like two " innocents " some primitive society . but then they're discovered three men sheen kills them , too . they now head montana , sheen committing more murders way . he empty inside , nothing fazes him ; he imagines he like james dean - misunderstood , alienated . but he doesn't clue what he should alienated against , far misunderstood , he never once gives least hint there anything there understand . we finish watching movie feeling empty sheen . i also felt little angry malick attempt con me into thinking there more sheen vapid character than there really : he truly just non-entity who kills half score innocent people . so back my first paragraph . malick obviously works perspective first half my question posed ( view became obsession , i think , artists , writers , film-makers , etc . beginning late 1960s ); i tend toward believing second half . suum cuique	1

watching this movie , it hard remember sean bean actor not vicious criminal . this extremely uncomfortable movie see , but it awesome	1
this item supposedly titled " ufos : first encounters . " it , however , episode reincarnation . it incorrectly labeled . not purchase unless you looking episode reincarnation	-1
i never saw marvel comics book so i knew absolutely nothing this character frank castle . i rented movie because i just love john travolta . thomas jane quite studly tough man here , but completely believable . he broods so handsomely throughout rest film . his character tormented deaths his family he out seek " punishment " not revenge he calls it . travolta fun sneering villian you tell he really enjoyed his role . he not out-right bad villian , but becomes so after death one his twin sons . yeah ladies , check out handsome actor playing his twin sons . plus , he got one beautiful but vindictive wife gorgeous laura harring . it shame her character not better developed more than stand around sexy outfits . it would fun see her more actively involved hunting down castle . overall , i enjoyed film great action film	1
they keep changing dates !!!! if anyone reads this who any word those concerned releasing this movie you tell them get ball . i am english literature major it common knowledge this one better versions hamlet , accurate text encapsulating many implied implications language play . it even recommended many professors students shakespeare . it needs dvd or it lost , chagrin all shakespeare fans students .	1

contentwise , i won't toss darts or roses . this genre stuff . you either like it or you don't . my beef technical quality . it execrable . ( 1 ) it not widescreen ( cinemascope ) , which it ought biblical spectacular . there simply no excuse cranking out full-screen treatment dvd issued year 2000 . ( 2 ) so-called " digital remastering " must kitchen-table grade , because shapes fuzzy , colors oversaturated , visuals mushy . this dvd should withdrawn market new widescreen version substituted . i get better quality my vhs this movie than dvd i purchased . lousy lousy lousy , i said .	-1

accessible story all elements great american novel somehow transformed into perverse , worst worst abc afterschool specials . if you not read book , you would unable follow what happening . some worst directing editing i seen long time . original evil dead , all its flaws , better put together film than this one . this movie flat-out painful watch . you get no justifications whatsoever why characters behave they . it all seems so random . read book . if you see this movie rental store , just move , please , nothing see here	-1
this cinema movie film best good cinema event occurrence all time ever	1
i give this movie 5 stars sheer awfulness . notorious ed wood quot ; plan 9 outer spacequot ; may indeed worst movie ever made , but quot ; navy vs . night monstersquot ; good dark horse contender particular dishonor . imagine your uncle joe bob just retired navy , no directing or producing experience other than short documentary sock-washing other military hygiene issues , never seen science fiction or horror movie other than few minutes quot ; blobquot ; half one roger corman lesser works , suddenly found himself recruited direct feature-length flick , star mamie van doren or whatever other large-breasted bimbo could lured prospect some quick bucks . so he hires your cousin jim duane , not exactly known terribly successful or competent himself , writing special effects , ... need i go ? this movie hilariously , soaringly pewww-trid ! you'll scream ! you'll cry ! keep telling yourself : it only movie ... it only movie ..	1
giving you brief rundown where i stand , i thought part 1 pretty good ; part 2 some interesting things it ; i didn't much like part 3 ; part 4 started pick up pace again ; part 5 surprisingly good ; i think part 6 arguably best ; i didn't like part 7 . this 8th chapter little better than part 7 , but not saying much . story begins jason brought back life help electricity . ( this reuses technique part 6 , but it doesn't bring back same impact . ) jason claims his 1st 2 victims then makes his way boat full teenagers heading towards new york . here , story starts lose credibility . least part 6 made sense when he headed back crystal lake : " jason return area that familiar him . no matter what you call it , it still camp crystal lake him . " ( so , this 8th chapter , why jason go out his way board ship heading new york ? ) i know some people thought it interesting see jason aboard ship , it added something see jason potential victims trapped ship . i admit this valid defense movie , but my question : " why jason go out his way board this ship first place ? " moving , one jason possible victims fairly well developed character ( rennie ) who tragic past water , hallucinations jason . alright , i admit this one interesting thing . rennie uncle charles not exactly nicest person . ( but unlike dr. cruise part 7 , least charles some redeeming features . times , his concern rennie seems genuine ; when sean father killed , charles takes moment offer bit sympathy ; times , he concerned over safety others . ) interesting character sean ( son captain ) . he wants please his father , but feels he unable become captain his father . however , becoming captain his father wants him may only way save least few people ship . alright . redeeming feature . moving , there typical high body count , but 5 people manage escape new york city . unfortunately , they run into 2 thugs who rob them run off rennie . ( redeeming moment charles least he shows discretion trying rescue rennie . ) naturally , it isn't long before jason arrives new york city . problem i this movie : " why jason go out his way hunt down these 5 people whole city ? " least previous movies made sense . early part 2 we learn jason take revenge anyone who enters his territory again . parts 2 , 3 , 4 , 6 , even 7 , least jason staying his own domain attacking anyone who happened there . sure , part 6 , jason attack some people away camp grounds , but least he his way back area familiar him . moving , there one other element i admit somewhat redeeming . we all know jason brutal killer , but one scene he portrayed almost heroic when he unwittingly saves rennie two thugs kidnapped her trying rape her . ( interesting twist i admit . ) i'll admit it comical when 2 last 5 people screamed help because they chased murderer , waitress could only say : " welcome new york . " course , typical friday 13th fashion , 2 people manage survive massacre come out alive . i'll admit this isn't worst friday 13th . ( honor shared parts 3 7 . ) i'll conclude saying this 8th chapter some redeeming moments , you may find it interesting twist . but you willing swallow some things aren't consistent rest series . if you're willing this , then you probably enjoy it more than i .	-1
this film should received more attention than it . scandinavia produced flood coming-of-age films during late 80s 90s , this far edgiest most intriguing . jan quot ;d evoquot ; kornstad -- outsider real life well -- stunning job mysterious clearly disturbed frank , who befriends otto during long , hot boring summer during late 60s . film wonderfully portrays downside scandinavian social-democratic idyll . if you enjoyed monika fagerholm novel , wonderful women sea , you'll also enjoy this film	1

i rented this movie because i really adore two lead actors . however , although they best they , there no saving this banal , movie week-esque movie . there couple nice moments , most notably when d'onofrio character talks his father his love football . other than , story seems cobbled together many other " uplifting " movies . times , you not only guess what happen next , but guess what exact line . football hero becomes self-pitying after accident leaves him blind ( unable satisfy his cheap girlfriend sack -- which she exposes tell-all book ) . his tutor school shows up , himself wheelchair , pops this crazy idea enter whitewater rafting race . even though he professes it all together all rah-rah , he still feels his own sadness his dreams dentist dashed drunk driver . but first -- you knew it ! -- they learn trust each other . this involves whacky stunts . two drive race , adventures , learning themselves each other , suprising locals can-do spirit . each scene seems end two sharing warm laugh fuzzy sunset . each person they run into nutty . even though i said i liked this , lines scene where olee talks his dad seem practically directly " breakfast club " where jock talks emotionally his dad . only commitment hines d'onofrio keep this one getting no stars all . so recap : person who cocky beloved his physical prowess loses it feels sorry himself ? check . person one last chance hear chanting crowd relive glory ? check . person who down same road self-pity redemption comes save him ? check . two men bond road endure colorful locals ? yup . student becomes teacher ? yes . locals try keep them down ? check . other dreamers lend hand ? drunk driving ? boy stunted emotionally father ? bathroom humor ? improbable competition set up prove worth outsiders , won stirring music cheers ? all those who've touched quest who we've met way show up end ? suprise ending supposed warm your heart teach you what really important ? yes , yes , yes	-1
american watching translation , it sometimes difficult determine film-maker intent . ever since " crouching tiger , hidden dragon , " we west re-evaluate martial arts cinema--it not always revenge . sometimes , it seems pretty inexplicable . you know -- different culture , different philosophy , etc . ( that what i'm told , anyway . since i don't speak chinese , i couldn't exactly say what gets lost translation . ) regardless culture or genre , big question always : you like movie ? well , yes , i liked it . i don't know if i get all it , but i liked it . action sequences special effects soundly executed without taking over film . actors enjoyable watch , i actually got jokes ( there many ) . end movie , i felt like i'd watched story , not just fluff . there theme hidden plot behind all those flying people swords . you gotta like .	1

... see just how bad it . unlike it predecessor heavy metal 2k one single 90 minute story arch talking place far future , using both hand drawn animation very bad cgi , bad even 2000 . basic plot miner named tyler ( michael ironsides ) stumbles across green glowing crystal literal key fountain youth . only draw back moment he touches it tyler goes completely bonkers starts killing lot people . " key " draws tyler settlement called eden , full people who haves traces life giving compound them , giving them healthy good looking looks , tyler probtly kills half population kidnaps rest , lone survivor raid julie ( julie strian ) begins blind quest revenge . everything could bad any given movie bad hm2k , dialog terrible , both written performed , camera work terrible , there no back story speak , tere loop holes even baby see , not even connection first firm loc-nar , which key suppose shard , except it green . also there not special features this dvd !!!!! i don't mind violence or nudity , fact i want see more western animation , but this movie just forgettable any other movie julie strian stars .	-1

my three rather " hip " sons ( 13 , 12 10 ) i watched glenn miller story together last week , somewhat my surprise ( theirs , i think ! ) , they loved it . brought back nice memories seeing it first time myself age . course , you jimmy stewart , june allyson harry morgan , special appearances likes louis armstrong , gene krupa frances langford . great family entertainment soundtrack good it gets . those looking true history channel-type documentary should know film takes artistic license liberties telling " story . " keeping mind this " hollywood " film , it quite enjoyable highly recommended	1
one level , this absurdist comic masterpiece other it scathing political satire parable . here you bunch firemen who one hand hopelessly stupid , incompetent corrupt , other hand they insufferably pompous , self-important , frauds --- film shows just how completely they muck up something so simple village dance , retirement party , lottery beauty paegeant , while completely failing their official capacity firemen same night . forman obvious target czech communist party late 1960s ; film immediately banned when soviet-led warsaw pact armies invaded czechoslovakia 1968 crush atempted " communism human face " reforms alexander dubcek while world stood watched , just it when hitler tanks rolled some 30 years earlier . result forman fled us where he continued illustrious filmmaking career . what interesting forman shot film location , tiny remote czech town using actual czech firemen villagers --- this lends unmistakably authentic quality whole film . dvd version colored , but original black white . there excellent special feature interview forman speaking his experience making film afterwards , well brief feature his cinematographer who oversaw colorization digital transfer original film . if you aware history behind film , you'll see it tragedy . if you not , it probably come off almost woody allen-ish comedy errors . either way very enjoyable 73 minutes	1
i enjoyed this movie , because plot slightly off kilter cast great . acting this movie superb , although it varied book , it still good itself . i recommend it people who like something different	1

i love this movie just i remember liking book child . guinness wonderful , everyone . rather than just appear know echo guinness wrote screenplay i would like say it brilliant subtle bawdy turns i no idea he so gifted . also rather than just seem erudite i would like say prokofiev background good idea gone wrong . it exciting while , but it got old . there more suite than snippet they eternally played . ( my erudition ) suite derived score movie . i liked human element best . i not care ( i'd seen movie before almost didn't buy it this reason ) marble through floor or fate last wall painted . i liked dialogue characterizations . it wonderful movie i highly recommend it everyone . ending not novel ( someone pointed out , i'd course forgotten ) , just knowing made me dislike it . i don't know why discovery should effect me . i accepted ending begin . finally , , when i military i knew gulley jimson . he dabbled art knew no bounds . however , he no talent , selfish beyond belief ( gulley ? ) child abuser ( mean variety , not sexual ) , his own daughter . so much him . guinness much more colorful ( like movie ) loveable . self-willed little grouch , but loveable .	1

live smokin filmed new york city , 1971 . what you see richard pryor very unpolished act . you clearly see pryor delivery professional timing still developmental stage . add he strung out cocaine when he performance . he told his audience he liked cocaine audience knew it . most people who seen this video not like it too much , but they failed see value what pryor able accomplish what others tried . i give very , very high accolades lenny bruce , he one best . he went down same road pryor , but he couldn't make it stick like pryor ( also not many people saw or heard bruce material ) . pryor really able talk his misgivings his troubled childhood . he ability cover subjects very taboo time , sexuality racism . racism itself tough subject cover . pryor showed world your face style what going black community how it related white community . live smokin , although not funny ground breaking event . here pryor laid groundwork what future stand-up comedy . film very dark primitive , but pryor his cocaine induced state , still managed talk his subject matter way you looking more . when you watch it you may not like comedy too much , but you watch it end . film more documentay pryor talking state affairs all different communities , black , white , hispanic or whatever . live smokin historic fact what it , peek into future subject matter stand-up comedy . he opened door so many performers all races . his ability make us laugh reality social truth uncanny . when you watch this film , don't look slap-happy drop dead laughs you get later pryor films . you see this film what it , historic comedic event time it made . you must see it whole complete coverage sign time ( 1971 ) glaring glimpse into future comedy . all modern comedians , george carlin included switch pryor type subject matter , or you wouldn't make it comedian . pryor set stage future , if your routine not include sex or racisim you would not make business . only other comedian not switch , again lenny bruce . big difference you see how pryor delivered his jokes . you must see " concert " , " live sunset strip " or " here now " see pryor full bloom . even those films you could see pryor still could ventured even more taboo subjects . look live smokin time piece . throughout his career pryor always maintained his subject matter , he always stayed black always told white audiences what happening black community , whites wanted listen . live smokin pieced together production looks like home movie , which what it , home movie pulled vaults made into video . this video showed true darkness pryor life we should applaud him sharing it us . pryor made great strides since live smokin , but this film only beginning , look what come . thing watchers didn't like this film did't see slew no-name characters prior used deliver his punchlines . these characters part evolution hip-hop culture or way black streets america . pryor always made sure portrayed black reality . live smokin he reveals whites , black world gambling , prostitution , poverty sex ( even homosexuality ) , dealing whites , police , hispanics , pushers drug users . like or even love this movie ( older people time ) you know what going background this film , what happening streets black white america . how whites viewed blacks or even how everybody viewed everybody . no one comedy history able make us laugh ourselves , social reality truth like richard pryor .	1

although identifying phrase " film noir " yet used few decades , jean renoir " la bete humaine " could arguably considered one genre blueprints . fact , aside over-melodramatic music score , this naturalistic 1938 thriller looks feels very contemporary . jean gabin quite effective brooding train engineer plagued " blackouts " which he commits acts uncontrollable violence , usually precipitated moments passion ( freudians field day all point-of-view camerawork showing gabin chugging his big , powerful locomotive through long dark tunnels ) . beautiful simone simon sets mold all future femme fatales earthy , sophia loren-type sexuality not usually found movies 1930 . fact , it would 30 years or so before american crime films like " cold blood " " bonnie clyde " would adapt similar blend adult language , sexuality unflinching violence ( 1938 , hollywood too busy pumping out shirley temple movies ) . moody cinematography general existential malaise certainly doesn't make this " feel good " popcorn movie , but fans classic noir fascinated . ( note : this film remade 1954 " human desire " )	1

if you like action flicks absolutely no intelligence this movie appeal your deepest hearts , but those you who prefer plot something makes least little sense .... skip it . sports camera crew sets out find most daring extreme sports heroes so it film action movie alps . they recruit couple crazy snow-boarders , helicopter pilots willing outrun avalanches then they toss pretty dainty olympic skier good measure some eye candy . entire film consists frilly skier competing fearless snow boarders attention film time . they get thrown out helicopters high altitude without any oxygen wearing barely any clothes but they never freeze ... funny how happens movies ! real amazing feat how they ski downhill front major avalanche still talk one ... you ever heard how loud avalanche ? thank goodness those sub-atomic hearing aids !! eventually european terrorists enter picture few automatic weapons ( something encourage those slow moving avalanches ) . well you know how it goes . action great if you like skiing some stunts literally unbelievable but other than i wouldn't recommend this film anyone half brain because you just frustrated all impossibilities missed reasons people die . i only watched it because i forced into it couch potato remote .	-1

while " easy money " may appear simple comedy , it really confronts us many problems our human condition . monty ( dangerfield ) shown child photographer who good his job . we soon learn he several vices . ( smoking , drinking , some illegal drugs , gambling , some lustful desires ) but he everyman . most us least 1 vice . some extent , we all monty . soon afterwards , his mother law offers $ 10,000,000 . monty if he shake off all his vices . ( lose weight top . ) monty friends confront us well . they great telling monty why he should go through it . they also really great telling monty he should not drink , smoke , overeat , etc . but they continue it themselves , times front poor monty . again , some extent , we all monty friends . make matters more difficult , monty rival heir clyde ( jeff jones ) wants money himself , so he looks ways tempt monty into his former vices . ( large extent , clyde represents presence devil . ) clyde not force , but he certainly tempt . quite convincingly , monty tense feelings start get better him , movie stops funny . notably sad scene where monty loses his job . ( record , i am guessing boxing scene taken out 2 reasons . ( . ) uncut form , there nothing indicate monty fallen asleep . ( . ) way , boxing scene breaks consistency film . monty losing his job most appropriately followed his crying front tv . ) moving , comedy reenters when clyde offers monty great job . but little monty know clyde going make one final attempt defeat monty . ( like devil , clyde can't just pull something out sky ... monty some extent consent accepting job ... patterns monty person somehow involved . ) yet moment devil , clyde confronts monty friends their hypocrisy : " if you're really monty friends , you'll stop making it so hard him ... you want monty money don't you ? " well scene , tensions explode monty house , we see desire money destroy our lives undoubtedly their problems , but really weren't so bad begin . side note : check paul letter timothy bible : " love money root all evil " (' timothy ' 6:10 ) . without ruining ending , monty comes through magnanimously . trip coney island , he invites forgives his friends ( who could more helpful him ) , someone who accidentally wounded him , even clyde who tried tempt him throughout . but devil ( clyde ) get one small but significant consolation prize he laughs darkly . this true life too . usually when we think we beat devil , he manages get small consolation prize . ( remember end " devil daniel webster ? " ) low class comedy ? not your life ! " easy money " confronts us our weaknesses , well our hypocrisies . it also shows us how desire money hurt us ; it shows how devil works ; it shows beauty forgiveness .	1

after seeing overhyped " american gothic " , i must say i came away disappointed . what you here movie constructed mold original " texas chainsaw massacre " where you some unsuspecting people coming up crazed homicidal family . unfortunately , family really comes off looking goofy silly more than dangerous deadly . i would certainly rather come upon ma pa family than leatherface his family if you know what i mean . " american gothic " decent job painting crazy family portrait sure , but ma , pa company just not exactly strike fear viewer heart ... they just not formidable far their prowess horror movie villains . kills not too bad , but certainly not anything write home . acting okay production values not too bad movie this nature . i just not like way ma pa family came across viewer ... they come across more weird than horrifying , more eccentric than anything else not exactly dangerous . don't get me wrong ... obviously , they killed some people , but i not convinced manner which this or family disposition brutal killers . also , i felt ending rather weak very predictable . i guess they just not make them like they used anymore . short , way i look " american gothic " if original " texas chainsaw massacre " five stars horror movie , then this movie , comparatively speaking , certainly worth no more than one star ... it what it folks !	-1

if you willing overlook fact video times poor sound often uneven ( otherwise , i'd given it 4 stars ) , then you great treat . sheer energy enthusiasm both cast audience unmatched , mis en scene unique time forever gone , new york city end 70 shift into 80 . kline terrific routledge great : these two make show ( watch routledge dramatics end act 1 ; kline brilliant his " pirate king " song , his antics act ii during " paradox " " away , away " scene classic ) . rose major general . ronstadt commendable ( any pop singer who tries their hand operattic singing my respect - well , maybe not michael bolton ... ) . even smith bearable ( bit cheesy , but what you gonna - least he doesn't seem take himself all seriously either ) . although some liked movie version better , least this production its entirety ( movie stupidly leaves out end act 1 finale after " oh happy day " , second versus " policeman lot " " sighing softly " ) . it also resurrects " major general " reprieve lyrics end act ii originally used gilbert new york premiere , which typically don't get included , but actually tie up show perfectly . added bonus use " matter patter " song ruddigore slightly changed lyrics ( kline last verse one breath ! ) . so , take it what it : great performance intermittently marred sub-standard video/audio production ..	1
this according leonard maltin movie guide . i'm little confused this very definite statement john huston " asphalt jumgle , " film very similar its basic heist-gone-wrong story , appeared four years earlier ( 1950 1954 ) . there trilogy these type films made through mid-fifties ; you add kubrick " killing " ( 1956 ) this genre film . each films , relatively small group men scheme pull-off perfect heist , initially succeed , but something or someone inevitably intervenes spoil entire endeavor . it would difficult judge which these three films best its kind , but what truly unique jules dassin " rififi " entire heist sequence complete silence , truly audacious approach filmmaking . three films discussed here share many common traits . directors either co-wrote or wrote screenplays which adaptations novels . there film noir quality three , especially " rififi . " each populated unsavory characters leaving viewer no one whom really identify . all three films photographed black white , dassin only foreign language one , french english subtitles . people who love movies but refuse tackle subtitles need get over it . days when poorly subtitles distracted viewer concentration long gone . persons responsible subtitling put much care making them imminently readable . once you've watched few foreign films , you hardly even notice it now . overall aversion watching foreign films puzzling . limiting yourself only american films , you're missing some greatest films ever made . this criterion collection film one those great films . all cc films , this transfer dvd flawless picture sound . dassin made films all over place . italy , usa france . he blacklisted during mccarthy commie witch hunt , fleeing france where he then made " rififi " which he received best director prize cannes film festival . today heist films , such " ocean 11 12 , " pale comparison these three films . thieves good guys , cops bad , they most part , succeed .

this one most captivating love stories i've ever seen film . it starts young woman ( katya , played vera alentova ) reporting her worker dormitory friends she flunked two points exam get into university . it ends most incredible sweetness life . it like french film russian company ( which what it ) . moscow we see not believe tears believe love , it not moscow politics , although some people call one " comrade . " this woman point view film ( " chick flick " ) transcends any genre cage . it begins slowly , almost painfully dull way remind viewer all cliches russia , unstylish dress , worker paradise isn't , sharp contrast moscow peasants who live outside city . katya works factory . she works drill press . she obviously underemployed . lyudmila ( irina muravyova ) works bakery . she probably gainfully employed time place . they friends , twentysomethings who make man , but not man sticks . they pretend university post docs or something close they impress some people they house-sit beautiful moscow apartmen t.t his how their adult life begins sense . lyudmila falls love athlete ; katya becomes infatuated television cameraman . one thing leads before we know it they forty . neither relationship worked out . athlete becomes alcoholic , cameraman , sway his mother , believes katya beneath him ( once he finds out she works factory ) . how wrong he , course . but no more plot . i won't spoil it . plot important . characterizations important . story like russian novel it spans lots time , but once you engaged you find two half hours fly you , perhaps like me , say end " what great movie ! " my hat off director vladimir menshov valentin chernykh who wrote script cast . i've mentioned vera alentova irina muravyova , but aleksey batlov who played gosha also excellent . i don't want say anymore . just watch film . it one best i've ever seen	1

camille claudel sculptor time when women discouraged art - especially most muscular arts , sculpture . such her genius , though , she accepted rodin student . he supported her career , both his assitant artist her own right . some people say her skill outstripped even his . why , then , her work so little known today ? certainly not because it appeal faded time . it still all power move viewer it ever . reason probably there so very little her work , even less extant today . her career lasted only few her adult years . illness mind drove her people venues supported her , drove her destroy much her own work . end , illness left her unable even care herself . she hospitalized 1913 , died 1943 without regaining her sanity , her freedom , or her career . this lovely movie documents her life up 1913 . it shows her early promise , her rise success , her collapse into incapacity . basic historical facts , best my knowledge , sound , but may stretched few places . her relationship rodin shown , but may not given emphasis it warranted . her removal hospital insane shown , too , but may not peaceable affair displayed here . no matter . claudel artist deserves attention , claudel woman leaves us asking what wonders illness stole her history . //wiredweir	1
though based famous character phil silver famous oldie tv show , new " sergeant bilko " less homage show than it classic steve martin his 1970 days . though this bilko ( again shifty tireless grafter , evil face non-coms everywhere ) very much opportunist silvers ' character ( he runs base casino ) , shy risk silvers ( unit mobilization orders desert storm mysteriously disappeared ) manages get caught his own dealings silvers ( bilko botches fixing army boxing match , unwittingly tricking each boxer think he one who supposed take fall ) screwball zaniness very much out steve martin snl days . script bilko unit charged testing brand new army weapon - " hovertank " soon cancelled because , among other things , it simply doesn't work . hovertank end spell doom his own cozy position doesn't seem bother bilko , mostly because he lives day-to-day . things change when officer charged evaluating hovertank turns out fearsome major thorn ( phil hartman ) . years earlier , bilko unwittingly made enemy thorn accidentally implicating him one his bitched schemes . now major , thorne isn't simply content enough eliminate hovertank , but must now axe bilko well . they say desperate times reveal man , bilko now revealed spineless weasel his troops come love . martin plays bilko like character one his old snl skits . it sort fun watch guy work material we haven't seen since his more sedate days playing less zany funnymen ( " la story " , " roxanne " ) more mature dramatic roles ( " spanish prisoner " , " grand canyon " update " silas marner " ) . it light breezy you'll probably forget most gags , script under-uses most supporting cast ( especially now late-great phil hartman bilko evil nemesis ) , but it still fun	1

" big combo " thoroughly characteristic classic film noir , which remarkable it latecomer classic film noir movement , released 1955 . cinematographer john alton may film noir most expressionistic photographer , " big combo " exploits his precision low-key lighting penchant shooting through fog their greatest advantage . philip yordan wrote " crusading cop " story directly screen , great noir tradition , included no real good guys or victims among his characters . police lieutenant leonard diamond ( cornel wilde ) trying 6 months find something incriminate infamous elusive mr. brown ( richard conte ) , financial arm his city crime syndicate , come up emptyhanded . one evening mr. brown mistress , susan lowell ( jean wallace ) , attempts suicide her desperation escape life she made herself , diamond takes advantage opportunity arrest her pressure her information . she tells him nothing , but her delirium , she repeats name " alicia " . convinced alicia might important clue cracking mr. brown , diamond rounds up questions everyone associated brown , including man himself , inciting bloody war his own brown conflicting obsessions . mr. brown articulates film perspective when he mockingly calls diamond " righteous man " . " big combo " one film noir most obvious examples sexualization violence . we see standards changing production code relaxing this film . explicit torture scenes undisguised sexuality very different techniques than " gun crazy " , noir sex violence masterpiece , employed 6 years earlier . " big combo " very good film whose sensational aspects augment its edginess without explicit enough overwhelm its themes . but it made me realize , if classic film noir movement lasted much longer than it , increasingly loose standards what could shown movies would produced films tawdry gory instead introverted subversive . they , course , but film noir passed point , if it hadn't , graphic overstatement would it . image entertainment dvd , released 2000 , no bonus features or subtitles	1

i've writing downbeat reviews lately , so i decided write one one five funniest movies ever . just answer obvious question , others monty python meaning life , south park : bigger , longer , uncut , seven year itch bank dick . reason this one so good because howard hawk direction , super sharp wilder-brackett script , gary cooper innate comic timing ( sadly under used his career ) , barbara stanwyck second best comic role her career ( lady eve role die ) boatload wily character actors . premise stems eight professors spending several years writing encyclopedia help willed grant them all living under same roof nyc mansion . one day garbageman ( allen jenkins ) enters their sheltered circle some eye-opening questions prof . potts ( cooper ) realizes his three weeks compiling slang obsolete . he decides he must leave his austere surroundings learn language street . this decision met much apprehension his seven older associates . he braves street all day recruiting wide array slang-savvy consultants . he winds up night club featuring gene krupa sugarpuss o'shea ( stanwyck ) . i think my favorite part movie when potts goes backstage recruit sugarpuss she tries give him brush . well , pretty soon we've got wild mix sex academics gangsters . it sweet without syrupy , it deals mores without sanctimonious . this neat trick very rarely achieved makes this always funny movie better than rest . also , me , it funniest ending ever . boogie	1
i'm nostalgic person this nostalgic movie . great recreation late 60s/early 70s era . i distinctly remember road trips my family avocado green station wagon scenic destinations smokey mountains . we've rented many cabins stayed occupied hours simple activities , long before sophisticated entertainment crept . this movie unfolds dynamic time when age discovery/peace movement challenged conservative lifestyles . pearl ( diane lane ) looking something more than " good mother " role she trapped . like so many women who marry young bear children , she wife mother what seems like life time ( married 17 ) , fulfilling needs her husband children . lure fantasy excitement too much overcome she drawn free wheeling , happy go lucky character played viggo mortensen . lucky her she could experience some things she completely missed out , still keep her family together . i like way movie ends because pearl returns her husband better appreciate life her husband better appreciate what pearl sacrificed raise their family . many story lines weaved into movie . this my top 10 list	1

dear quentin , how things going , man ? i heard new film uma . sounds great . you see my newest film " lucky numbers " ? i play russ richards , local celebrity weatherman harrisburg , pennsylvania . russ adoring fans , his own table omelet denny , snowmobile dealership . due uncommonly warm weather , his dealership go under , crumbling his entire financial empire . out desperation , he pays visit gig ( tim roth ) , owner local strip club . gig suggests russ his `friend ' crystal ( lisa kudrow ) rig state lottery . crystal works same station pulls numbers out lottery . crystal all idea . she also dating dick simmons ( ed o'neil ) , station manager he neglecting her . her share winnings help her break free . everything , course , gets complicated . funny , huh ? it it moments . quentin , you know i like work people i know . it makes me feel comfortable . acting hard , man . i need comfort help me create my characters . nora ephron directed film . she i worked together " michael " , which pretty successful , so i hoping lightning would strike twice . i really enjoyed reading screenplay . basically it combines elements dark comedy farce . people act weird , some people die , people mean one . but they also act really silly . i haven't lot farce but i laughed when i read screenplay . my track record comedy spotty , but if someone $20 million decent script , i'm game . lisa i great together . she plays someone very different her well-known persona `friends ' . crystal very different phoebe . crystal edge , determination makes her very interesting . crystal few moments also make her seem real , very important factor farce . if character doesn't least tiny grounding reality , farce doesn't work . lisa gets this makes it work . i get it , too , made it work during scene denny ... scene snow mobile dealership ... scene television studio when they reveal someone killed ... ... well , i know i made it work somewhere . i'm no film historian , but it works . supporting characters top notch . michael moore plays crystal dimwitted cousin . he very funny . tim roth good , but doesn't lot laughs . but that ok . he primarily dramatic actor anyway . actors should play their strengths . michael rappaport plays local thug . he all over place . hell , most supporting cast all over place . that ok , because this farce , right ? i know reviewers pick up fact everyone film greedy , unlikable they really don't like each other . there isn't really anyone care . that ok . these characters based real people . they don't need likable . they need funny . they funny . aren't they ? sometimes ? yes . they some funny moments . nora great director . she good hand comedy , especially farce . every farce i ever seen too many laughs . you're laughing when joke happens . you can't keep track it all . thankfully , nora slowed everything down ... quite ... ... bit . her pacing glacial . but i like . i ability laugh jokes . quentin , i'm just not sure . i've string dogs lately . i'm not good actor . i'm movie star . i am persona draws people into movies . they shouldn't expect my performance subtle or even well-modulated . if i'm playing local celebrity weatherman , i'm going play it all smarminess i . i'm going mug grin every character recognizes me . i'm going wear local fame my sleeve when things start go wrong , i'm going shake , rub my head , run around circles , really frustrated . i play characters . but lately , people haven't coming films .

what motivates murderer , even serial killer become one ? ask such question preposterous because it no answer . least it what film advocates end . this contradiction fbi profiling technique , but only superficially . fact profiling technique only looks defines killing pattern , eventually psychological pattern serial killer , not cause his or her killer . so question legitimate , yet film comes conclusion it impossible answer . yet it proposes difference normal person who eventually kill killer : former experience remorse , whereas latter won't . but this very short approach once contradicted film itself recording killer who says serial killer who grow old , who evade justice survive haunted his murders . but it said such way we don't know if he experiences remorse or regret it or simply regret it this or way instead could better . he feel pleasure or fear or horror or disgust ? this film hence seen contrast two other films deal serial killers , `the silence lambs ' `seven ' . even so , there probably no answer initial question , least no simple answer all kinds murders murderers . why profiling technique might limited pertinence . it may good police technique but it probably not good explain foresee moment when way how man or woman becomes criminal . dr jacques coulardeau , universit� paris dauphine , universit� paris i panth�on sorbonne	1
i love how this movie portrays striking coal miners their wives innocent angels while scabs called " gun thugs " who just open fire innocently peaceful protesters machine guns . film-maker spends 99% film strikers doesn't try too hard get opinions scabs mining company workers . after all , scabs people who work miners not want themselves . work anyway . mining company this film not only gave its employees wages but also housed all them too . course wages housing conditions lousy but housing employees not employer job ! any sane person ( or anyone who seen major strike person ) finds it hard believe scabs sole instigators during strikes strikers pure victims . scabs just trying go work support their families too but violently harassed strikers who same work but choose not . if work good enough scabs , then why isn't it good enough strikers ? strikers also use more than just words taunt scabs . they use sticks , clubs occasionally guns or knives hurt scabs whom they believe taking their jobs away them . this film , when scabs defend themselves right go into work without getting hurt or killed ho t-t empered strikers , it scabs who always portrayed " gun thugs " " evil " while strikers always seen saint-like , perfectly behaved unjustly discriminated against . why else police officers scene most major strikes ? protect strikers ? hell no . they there protect scabs who trying go into work but subjected constant harassment strikers . this film even token black striker , who happens get all white striker folks . but guess who uses " n-word " this movie toward black person ? you guessed it ... evil scab . i wonder if this film would shown strikers ' reaction black scab if there one . probably not . bottom line : if you pro-union believe scabs scum earth strikers no wrong , then " harlan county , u.s.a. " movie you .	-1

this german film directed hermine huntgeburth like comic spin grifters but added sexual component . when one 3 petty criminals who wallet snatch using blind man ploy injured chase , replacement chosen someone who tried steal them failed . his punishment stripped two gay male members team , which prefigures sexual triangle eventuates when both father his daughter attracted new member . we know when we told group rule no exchange body fluids it said broken . huntgeburth gets comic mileage out who aggressor each relationship stolen moments intimacy they fear discovered third party . most refreshing touch how father ( gotz george ) established mean his gay partner , yet he becomes foolish when faced attentions younger man , if he cannot believe it possible , shakespearian appearance george emphasises him classically defined pathetic figure . george actually resembles brunette heavy-set ralph fiennes . daughter probably least interesting role , but felix eitner boy demonstrates bisexual trend modern sexuality , free sexual preference european men , question sex duplicitious behaviour . when eitner pet snake disposed cruelly , huntgeburth sets up expectation his own fate , snake metaphor . accordian music niki reiser sets tone it melancholy suggestion exotic mischief , thankfully huntgeburth treatment lacks concluding cruelty stephen frears title	1

i didn't care this version all . i thought there no chemistry two leads , there should least some smoldering repressed emotions . story so abbreviated so seem just conventional , brief story thwarted love -- character development , especially jane , missing action . no heartbreak , no horror , no sense jane virtue , tough interior self-reliance , which helped her overcome so many life obstacles . not even much atmospheric scenery . this mr. rochester , played usually-excellent ciaran hines , utterly forgettable , weak , miscast . he doesnt handsome , but he powerful , passionate , sexy , seething . after all , he keeps mad wife locked attic he tries keep secret while almost commiting bigamy . instead , try timothy dalton version which excellent though now little low-budget looking , or 2007 even sexier faster-paced version toby stevens ruth wilson , which outstanding best yet . it moves right , yet it keeps all story essentials .	-1

frankly , i didn't expect this docu-drama good it . alec baldwin not favorite i doubted what he might portraying justice robert jackson . nevertheless , jackson far perfect himself , both personally professionally , so maybe it fit casting . 60 years , no one else courage take this important story , so give mr. baldwin his due , both leading actor co-executive producer . staging , costumes , cinematography outstanding this made-for-tv production . views bombed-out city nuremberg seem genuine beginning end . reconstruction palace justice extremely well . old car buff , i enjoyed seeing vehicles 1940 50 so well maintained . big social gatherings lavish well-staged . summary , this big-budget production . rating this movie i might given it 5 stars except portrayal british prosecutors . this understated quite bit . sir david maxwell-fife , not judge jackson , one who unmasked hermann goering psychopathic monster he truly . moreover , fellow-britisher , sir hartley showcross , given credit most moving summation , not jackson . no one cast play showcross part which unfortunate given outstanding british actors available . weakness how soviets depicted . comrades rudenko , nikitchenko , others contributed lot what happened nuremberg real trial , despite constant kibbitzing moscow . this only true international tribunal war crimes all four prosecuting countries , u . ., great britain , france , ussr played their roles . casting movie , one inevitably compares 1961 landmark movie , " judgment nuremberg . " film spencer tracy , maxmillian schell ( who won best actor oscar year ) , burt lancaster , richard widmark , montgomery clift , marlene dietrich , judy garland , several others note . these even included william shatner his first big-screen performance . no way 2000 production compare 1961 film depth characterization sheer poetry screenplay abby mann . yet , because commanding presence spencer tracy american lead judge , haywood , role lifetime maxmillian schell , other performances overlooked . my view , burt lancaster eloquent chief german judge , ernst janning . several his lines movie still haunt me , especially : " we deaf ? dumb ? blind ? " then , rejoinder spencer tracy end : " but herr janning , it came first time you sentenced man death you knew innocent . " finally , marlene dietrich remarkable her limited role . who forget scene her sitting alone dark letting phone ring , judge haywood calling say goodbye ? nevertheless , there some important performances newer movie must acknowledged . brian cox absolutely first-rate hermann goering . one minute he jovial family man ; next , psychopathic killer founder gestapo . i no longer see mr. cox just exceptional narrator world war ii documentaries . others point out , cox literally steals show " nuremberg . " moreover , german actor herbert knaup , who portrays albert speer , memorable job , goering counterweight nazi defendants . speer seems sincerely repentant his part war crimes this saves his life . his final statement court worth watching re-watching , he warns mankind next major war could destroy globe itself . christopher plummer fine david maxwell-fife , but screenwriter only gave him one big scene . where he described nazi mass execution ukraine -- spine chilling moment sure . reality , maxwell-fife star prosecution team , said above , he deserves far more credit than he got this movie . it true , critics point out , hanging condemned men not proceed , one , two , three , shown this film . rather , some men took 20 minutes or more , die . also , i agree other reviewers who found fault love affair depicted jackson his secretary . we could dispensed favor some other more weighty things , including defense two nazi naval officers . it , movie runs 3 hours so not great deal time could spent subject . but defense made capt . kranzbuehler , saved lives admirals raeder doenitz . moreover , kranzbuehler set precedents international law his defense . comparing " nuremberg " other tv miniseries third reich , i'd say it notch below " hitler : rise evil " ( 2003 ) , starring robert carlyle " inside third reich " ( 1982 ) , rutger hauer , john gielgud , derek jakobi . i see " nuremberg " par , though , " bunker " ( 1981 ) , starring anthony hopkins . i would highly recommend newer movie , " nuremberg , " despite its flaws . i got it loan friend plan buy dvd later my collection . " nuremberg " not measure up " judgment nuremberg , " but few films ever . newer film tells much different story may take literary license way . these points notwithstanding , it makes contribution our understanding third reich , world foulest tyranny . we must try understand it , lest we repeat it .	1
one last biblical epics , this bomb its initial release , deservedly so . movie doesnt know whether it de mille or italian realism , most sequences ( adam eve , tower babel ) either laughable or langorous ( george scott ava gardner abraham sarah ) . yet stuck middle fine half hour sequence story noah , director john huston casting himself one strong sequence movie : replete right mix humor awe . half hour isnt enough recommend buying or renting dvd , but if you catch it tv some day , its worth half hour your life .	-1

1960 era terrifically beautiful actresses , ranging ursula andress starlets hammer film productions . among highest order cinematic goddesses young jane fonda , whose performance title role " barbarella " remains extremely erotic--today more explicit sexuality notwithstanding . film slight storyline concerns futuristic " astro-navigatrix " trying track down mad scientist prevent him using horrific weapon he invented . hot his trail our heroine encounters all manner intergalactic beings who their best separate her her unusually frail space-girl costumes ; blind angel , sadistic " leather men , " children w/carnivorous dolls , tyrannical lesbian queen all eager entice barbarella into their various fun games . finally , when space-girl catch up her quarry ( crazed scientist wonderfully named duran duran ) he too wants work out his fantasies her ; he subjects her his " excessive machine " -- pleasant torture device supposedly kills inducing lethal number orgasms ! fortunately , barbarella [ ... ] capabilities outlast machine , causing it collapse broken fuses . so it goes until less-than-inevitable , but happy , finale . all all this film fantastic episodes brilliant , inspired . barbarella narrow escape flesh-eating dolls well her many encounters lesbian tyrant ( played hilt anita pallenberg ) truly imaginative sequences . other highlights include film initial scene -- barbarella doing strip-tease zero-gravity chamber ; her down-and-dirty defeat duran duran nasty machine . essence there very few dull moments entire film . director roger vadim -- jane fonda husband time -- height his considerable powers . mistress fonda herself glorious ; such unlikely role , her extreme beauty blended harmoniously essential innocence way made her cinematic descendant marilyn monroe ! any actress any time there no higher praise than comparison marilyn ; jane fonda case , such comparison actually deserved . my highest ratings .	1

there interesting story beethoven concerning his intense concentration sheer immersion music while midst composing . young man knocked his door deliver message , important message patron wanting commission his work . maestro answered door , delivery boy taken aback , beethoven appeared frazzled , dark rings under his eyes mad expression . boy asked wait , he would only few moments . well , young man waited waited , hearing most beautiful music he ever encountered . over two hours transpired when maestro finally came back door . " herr beethoven , i waiting over two hours deliver this most urgent message ! " composer appeared genuinely confused , " you must mistaken , i only away few moments ! " he then snatched message out boy hands slammed door . my mind , this fine example pure genius work . immortal beloved ( 1994 ) upon its theatrical release panned professional critics over top ; gary oldman overacted director ( bernard rose ) use too many clich�s tell speculative story secret lover beethoven . early nineties time where it fashionable negative critical just everything ... fashionable cynicism . viewed dvd first time since seeing film ( over 12 years ago ) theatre , there no doubt these " professional critics " way off mark . this excellent film manages capture beginnings romantic age music . beethoven right cusp classical romantic movements ... tragedy heroism which mark sensibilities romantic movement stands well represented this moving film . gary oldman one gifted actor portrayed mad genius realism intensity it so well deserves . beethoven music all alone without knowing anything composer continue move audiences ' until end time , however , tragic fact maestro stone deaf while composing majority his music , particularly , ode joy , absolutely astonishing ! it known he actually sawed legs off grand piano , bringing it floor order " feel " vibrations clearer . isabella rossellini countess absolutely superb stunning her eyes convey so much emotion when her character talks her love , maestro . there some beautiful scenes old vienna film , well , this would greatest sound track all time . this wonderful film , love story more than likely greatest romantic history : ludwig von beethoven .	1

i seen many historical war dramas far east ( mainly china ) most them not only historically inaccurate but strong bias toward enemy . yi soon shin , however , rare exception . not only drama very historically accurate but it also very comprehensive detailing meticulous battle planning admiral leads each victory but also political in-fighting chosun political factions ( second-guessing nature king ) which causes his eventual death . also , special effects great . battle scenes ( whether sea or land ) realisitic outstanding quality . only problem i find dvd not placed sufficient focus contribution ming china . then again , this not unexpected since this korean drama focusing great admiral . also , entire selection should 104 episodes . i don't know why it stops 101 . if you want more comprehensive knowledge subject , try samuel hawley imjin war ( which portrays yi soon shin more accurately quoting original sources ) . any who only intered fighting may also want check out stephen turnbull samurai invasion ( which more colorful maps detailed description battles japanese perspective ) . lastly , anyone who fan samurai warfare may want check out shogun : total war creative assembly ( now gold version ) .	1

band awesome . no doubt it , but that just it . they band . robbie robertson ( spelling correct ) somehow fooled other band members into letting him songwriting credit ( robertson got them particiapte , against their better wishes , " last waltz " concert accompanying film ) . take look band drummer levon helm book , " this wheel fire , " he explains robertson someone band management talked group into giving robertson sole ( or majority ) songwriting credit , so they all could supposedly benefit financially . robertson got rich , while others didn't . it shame , since helm , keyboardist richard manuel ( rip ) bassist rick danko ( rip ) all better voices than robbie . there also great photo helm book helm showing robertson how play something robertson stratocaster . great picture . it shows it group effort , but robertson " last waltz " film erronneously claim robertson leader chief talent . " last waltz " concert filmed martin scorsese , robbie buddy . if robertson truly lone genius band , don't you think his solo work would much better ? also , words arkansas-born levon helm himself , " you really think guy canada ( robertson ) wrote ' night they drove old dixie down ' all himself ?

i first saw this film college cinema class . after we watched it , long discussion ensued , led largely feminist-minded females class , number scenes where brando shirtless vs . number times maria schneider ( mercifully brandon kept his haines all times ) . we talked how this " male-eyed " film , how schneider character never fully developed , etc ., etc . almost 20 years later , i realize there no way class 20-somethings could appreciated what we seeing , thus true greatness film eluded young , high-minded college students more interested maria nipples than brando angst . not once any us talk shattering scene where brando confronts his dead wife . if there anything last tango paris i took me , it , amazing acting therein . i really don't care schneider boobs , which honestly aren't all great anyhow . what makes this film great me structure old(er ) , beaten down cynical man going through grief , who bumps into young , fresh woman who doesn't really know who she or why she wants what she wants . schneider said bertolucci kept her dark during much filming . one hopes it evoke this pure , almost wide-eyed performance her not out any disrespect or cruelty , although schneider late said she'd never work him again . her performance here effortless . more importantly , there chemistry her brando works . it may seem strange talk chemistry movie where male lead rapes bullies female lead , but it there . watch scene bathroom , where he shaving , marvel spontaneous-sounding dialogue feeling real relationship there . brando perfect his role . story unfolds slowly ( they'd never make film this kind pacing today ) , brando becomes least somewhat more sympathetic ( complex ) it goes . this isn't brute brando but rather complex , deeply wounded brando who brings out brute him only keep world bay . after his catharsis he shows side himself , probably more typical side , schneider she just can't cope--it hard me tell , even after repeated viewings , if it because she getting married someone else ( how happy she'll remains serious doubt me ) , because she afraid three-dimensional brando who really seems now want her more than casual sex , or what . some ways ending arbitrary , but it still struck me more plausible organic than similar sudden endings night porter marriage maria braun . throughout , bertolucci shoots most interior scenes schneider brando sunset . bathed orange , they stillness yet intensity other scenes lack . it seems orange color bertolucci set aside deep revelations realizations . film distrubing , but somehow also cathartic . feeling wanting say " --- world " one many us relate , something brando himself many times his career . print scratched soundtrack somewhat tinny . there numerous times where dirt or fuzz gate seen top or bottom edge frame whole scenes . this film cries out full-blown restoration . dvd contains nothing else but trailer , strange trailer it . you'd think dvd movie this famous would feature commentaries , documentaries , where-they-are-now type featurettes , etc . this classic short-changed . but * * many people today see last tango paris classic ? this somehthing i wondered i read reviews online after seeing dvd . heralded masterpiece turning point cinema when it released , it now clear it anything but . rather than continue personal films sometimes disturbed psyche questioned soul moviegoer , hollywood then other filmmakers turned empty spectacle 70s waned , trading boobs lightsabers . last tango hailed 1972 beginning new cinema , but it also end it . few exceptions ( unbearable lightness comes quickest mind ) this sort film would never made again , last tango become some ways anachronistic . just reading online reviews , most them probably written people their 20s whom terminator 2 ancient movie , it becomes clear we don't really understand this sort picture anymore , made uncomfortable it . there no simple line action . there no " plot . " there long stretches no dialogue , or least where characters don't tell you dialogue what they doing . television movies merged style , technique subject matter , last tango other films period become more like museum relics than living , breathing cinema . perhaps that one reason why we haven't seen restoration . unless criterion gets its hands this film , i don't much hopes . too bad , because last tango represents whole type filmmaking that largely unknown today , even film " students , " if it known it becoming more curiosity than , i said , living , breathing cinema . all more reason rent this , then , witness whole approach movie-making no longer exists -- certainly not usa .	1

koreans honor their greatest military hero this epic drama which takes place late 1500s . career tactics this admiral still studied u.s. naval academy , doubtless those other nations . screenplay based couple novels , so there some fiction , but life yi soon shin well documented , so there plenty fact supporting story . if you not familiar korean drama , it good keep mind this not hollywood product , but they very well special effects such considering non-hollywood budgets involved , it easy see past all enjoy tale told . it long series , but presents epic power , depth dimension well worth watching it unfold through each every episode . it would great also see kbs make other dramas available viewing through amazon , such " seoul 1945 " .	1

brilliance this film , more than anything else , its energetic , frenzied story adaptation . sailors-on-leave movies past , but few this level exuberance . result , film upbeat but not always perfect ( it slows down pace last 25 minutes , re-hash plot kelly ' art ballet ' totally unnecessary ) . but there unforgettable moments well : shots old brooklyn navy yard which bookend film ; ravishing opening number/music video " new york , new york ; " couples reunions rooftop empire state building act 2 ; ongoing suspense maintained crawling timestrip which always reminds viewer remaining time left . plot-wise , it circus : kelly meeting , than losing sight , poster girl vera-ellen perfect springboard day-long cab chase which unites frank sinatra rambunctious betty garrett , stopping en route bring jules munshin together ann miller ( who performs electrifying , leg-displaying , tap number film best song , " prehistoric man " ) . time sextet sung " town " roof lobby empire state building , 60 minutes passed film lighter than air pace comes grinding halt . point , it doesn't matter . you might well sit back rest ride . get dvd dream old new york .	1

last reviewer interpretation book involves narrow understanding profit motive " greed " no understanding property rights .

i think if charles bukowski , dylan thomas , fellini collaborated piece writing , it possible they would come up this screenplay . this movie exciting because it soooo different anything i've ever seen . deliciously non-linear . substance abuse aspect little overdone but that destiny quot ; artist moviesquot ; . i loved hearing dialog , kristofferson acting best i've ever seen him . anything so daring so unconventional naturally upset some people ( like other reviewers here ) , but if you ask me only validates work . if ever i go new york city , hotel chelsea top my list places visit . my favorite lines crazy guy elevator , who after claiming conversation dylan thomas said ghosts naturally reside places like chelsea because people listen them there . dvd extras contain couple quirky interviews , one director ethan hawke other robert sean leonard who plays deeply troubled folksinger film	1

those you interested seeing delicate sensitive portrayal s/m relationship , i would highly suggest japanese film , " moonlight whispers " over " maitresse . " film gentle coming-of-age film male sub/fem dom theme , while " maitresse " somewhat confused film ex-con who stumbles into dungeon ( highly unlikely ) vanilla relationship dominitrix . ex-con cannot deal " her career " eventually threatens her quit , etc . ( some point , you get idea director himself really doesn't understand where domina coming . ) what started out interesting film provacative opening soon falls apart halfway through . writer/director seems lose narrative thread film things degenerate ex-con wanting buy dominitrix out her protection ( or pimp , want better word ) . then , we watch ex-con -- totally unrelated gratuitous foray -- goes slaughterhouse , where real horse shown killed onscreen , strung up stabbed drained blood it kicks helplessly ( this image upset you weeks , believe me ! [ i feel like it my duty warn you ! ]) . film gets even worse there finally ends up ridiculous car accident two main characters laughing like idiots . totally stupid ( like writer/director suddenly ran out ideas ) . believe me , i really wanted like this movie . i ignored negative reviews , because there so few " real " films this subject . but i sorely disappointed depressed it . if you need see this film , rent it . it definitely " one view " film best ; it film leave you angry ( because horse scene ) vaguely disgusted -- generally bummed out . too bad . " moonlight whispers " much better , respectful treatment s/m , film real characters nuance -- one seeks explore real psychological ( sexual orientation ) questions , while also beautiful film watch . film deserves seen -- wider audience !	-1

one most controversial movies ever made , this early 1970s ' masterpiece cemented reputations jack nicholson mike nichols , proved art garfunkel act , gave candice bergen her big break , turned ann-margret into serious actress . initially , " carnal knowledge " greeted mixed reactions , but over time considered groundbreaking its frank portrayal sexual relationships two womanizing friends over nearly 30 year period . film starts off college , where two friends name jonathan ( nicholson ) sandy ( garfunkel ) roommates who dote sex nothing else . when sandy meets susan ( bergen ) mixer , he immediately smitten her , jonathan , who takes her under his own wing . few years go we see sandy become involved jennifer ( carol kane ) . finally , jonathan falls love beautiful , , yes , busty bobbie ( ann-margret , who deservedly got oscar nomination her role ) . their relationship becomes rougher years go , culminating one nicholson greatest fits rage ever , matched ann emotional breakdown she begs him marry her . film seems very crowded , but plot unfolds so smoothly , you never get sense " gosh , i wanna shut this off because i don't understand it " , since every storyline it grabs you never lets go . performances this film perfect . nicholson gives one his best performances ever jonathan , while ann-margret gives what may well her single greatest performance her career . it great see these two perform together , nicholson my favorite actor ann my favorite actress . two play off each other so well they make film watchable their chemistry alone . garfunkel perfect choice play sandy . everyone may know him one half simon garfunkel , but watching him play part , he embodies it so well you can't imagine anyone playing role . though she leaves movie pretty early , candice bergen superb portrayal susan , carol kane great jennifer . rita moreno not appear until last scene , but she really make most her screen time . " carnal knowledge " cinematic masterpiece belongs any dvd collectio . not hesitate purchasing this movie . it must	1

there far too few movies made just fun these days . down periscope proof you don't need fancy special effects or giant budget make fun movie . my teenagers loved it , setting it up same shelf zoolander super-troopers . kelsey grammer wonderful job seems relish his role , playing it controlled fun hallmark movie . known his unorthodox activities he drawn ire admiral graham ( bruce dern who appears lot fun his role well ) ends up worst crew dredged up worst sub ( old rusty diesel boat ) found worst assignment - go up against entire modern navy . fortunately grammer up task underhanded tactics brilliant maneuvers he performs bring laugh almost everyone . crew consists stereotypes , flatulant cook , grizzled old veteran , spoiled son admiral , basketball star , spit-and-polish xo , but actors manage bring them off charm , especially electrician who grammer notes " absorbed lot voltage " . addition big laughs , there little scenes bring smile , such during first dive when panicked crewman heads aft " see if other rooms still tilted " ultimately it feel-good movie . it doesn't highlight any great moral conflicts , but its great diversion settle down enjoy rainy day one few movies you probably get your teenagers sit you watch ! special note , san franciscans immediately notice backdrop used " mothball fleet " suisun bay docked sub shots " stingray " uss pampanito , sub open tours pier 39 - you even see other piers end .	1

it unsettling find something you've treasured , now seen or met again , leaves you feeling little flat . you change worse ... you become jaded ... less open feeling emotion ? or perhaps what you liked so much then simply isn't wonder you thought it . young girl ( jenny agutter ) , 14 , her brother ( billed lucien john , who actually nicolas roeg son , luc ) 7 , driven far into australian outback their father picnic . we've seen family ... children school , mother preparing food while she smokes looks distracted , daughter swimming pool their expensive apartment building , father businessman who stares out window her . picnic , mother stayed home . father preoccupied car . he stops daughter lays out food while her brother runs among rocks . shot rings out bullet hits rocks boy . father firing . daughter runs her brother scoops him up hide . he shoots them several more times , then demands they come back so they return home . after pause father pours gasoline car , ignites it shoots himself . children stranded middle scrub desert only what little food they carry . they start walking . they eventually find some muddy water fruit , but morning water disappeared fruit all eaten birds . they meet 16-year-old aboriginal boy ( david gulpilil ) who doing walkabout , months ' long initiation manhood where he must survive , or not survive , himself . heart story how he helps them survive , how he looks after them , how sexual feelings arise , how girl shaped her conventional attitudes unaware boy except someone who take them back civilization , how boy shaped his tribal rituals no other way express himself . climax boy feelings his attempt express them poignant sad . film , however , punctuated beginning end occasionally throughout shots civilized life which appear make civilization less appealing than primitive direct life boy brings girl her brother . butchering bring meat supermarket really any different than butchering kangaroo or lizard ? doesn't treatment aborigines children compare unfavorably resourcefulness cheerfulness boy ? isn't killing food better than using high-powered rifles kill animals sport ? movie oblique enough so these " civilized " moments don't overpower basic story , but they still there . viewing film now , they seemed unnecessary intrusions into what remains very strong affecting story two young people utterly unable communicate because their own conventions . movie beautifully photographed . two sequences stand out me . one , after days desert scrub , three find themselves walking through forest eucalyptus trees , palms green scrub . little brother trotting young man telling him long involved story boy ladder . not word understood but they both enjoy experience . other sequence abandoned , ruined farm house . young man painted himself dancing what appears ritual declaration girl . he can't express himself any other way she only show she frightened . he dances until he exhausted . morning she her brother find him resolution quite sad . this balance wonderful movie , me , hasn't aged well i thought it would . particular , john barry film score seems now far too lush intrusive . concentrate story two young people , however , you won't disappointed . it film well worth . criterion dvd picture looks just fine . there audio commentary , which i didn't listen , roeg agutter .	1
i rented this movie watched it last night--hadn't seen it close thirty years since i little girl -- nearly freaked deja-vous experience hearing quot ; you remind man/what man ? /the man power/what power ? / power whoo-dooquot ; . my older sister knowingly said , quot ; yes , tutorgal , this where comes . quot ; i used chant chant kid ! so much memory lane ; now down business quot ; bachelor bobby soxer . quot ; movie bit slow start , pretty static direction , up until point when high school student shirley temple sees ladykiller artist cary grant high school assembly delivering lecture . pow ! she sees him knight shining armor off corral him . she doesn't know course big sis judge myrna loy just him her courtroom formed low opinion his reputed womanizing . shirley even finds way gain access unknowing cary apartment , where he then unjustly gets slammed jailbait charge . hey , where this going ? well , myrna her assistant da beau rudy vallee decide only way shirley get over cary him date her probably bore her his adult ways . course , nothing works out like anyone planned , least all smug myrna . i wrote above , movie really picks up after 15-20 minutes then becomes quite hilarious , rudy vallee particularly good eccentric wasp , sort thing he so well . cary appears genuinely enjoying himself , shirley certainly grown real cutie . myrna okay , but nothing spectacular this time around . make date watch quot ; bachelor bobby soxerquot ; see whoo-doo first hand	1

it both . it also loads fun ! western fans , comedy fans martial arts fans alike unite high praise this wacky , feel good romp set old west . jackie chan owen wilson display playful chemistry them that perfect zany plot action packed pratfalls two wind up . thin story chan playing woefully incompetent disobediant chinese imperial palace guard demanding he help bring back emperor daughter , princess pei-pei ( lucy liu ) whose run off america . short course , chan meets bumbling gang bandits led always hyper relaxed owen wilson . before long , two engaging bar brawls visting ladies evening local cathouse . meanwhile , princess pei-pei ended up human bondage - enslaved former imperial palace guard who big , diabolical plans her . don't expect anything more than fun , fantastic action sequences slick comedic set-ups this movie grow you . it not typical western , nor it typical martial arts eastern . it great hybrid both i definitely see why sequel followed .	1
much science this influential oldie-but-goodie very naive ; there goofy decisions serve only move plot ; we're left wonder why chief scientist thought this walking vegetable so intelligent superior . but fas t-t alking almost improvisatory style so popular decade earlier successfully mixes beginnings more campy 50s sensibility became template sci-fi movies . male lead unusually solid , decisive , likable ; female lead brightens things considerably her glowing humor . action mostly not very impressive , but characters well enough developed keep things interesting . definitely above average its type	1

bride white hair 2 followed quickly upon success original movie , taking up tragic story cho yi-hang ( leslie cheung ) his forbidden love lien ni-chang ( brigitte lin ) . betraying his sacred pledge he would never doubt his beloved , cho unleashed monster . ni-chang fury over cho betrayal drives her completely mad , transforming her into white-haired witch who lives only destroy every living member eight clans , especially wu tang clan which cho belongs . cho , he retreated mount shin fung , guarding over mystical flower whose bloom ( it only blooms once every twenty years ) cleanse restore woman he still loves . ten years passed since deadly night ni-chang went mad almost single-handedly destroyed wu tang clan . only two members clan survive : cho , who stood guard mount shin fung under blizzard conditions all these years , cho nephew kit ( sunny chan ) . kit impending marriage lyre ( joey maan ) , opportunity further bloodline exists - so it ni-chang crashes party , kidnaps young bride , takes her back her own private castle full man-hating , deadly women . there , lyre indoctrinated witch " see man , kill man " philosophy programmed kill kit her own hands . eight clans send their best warriors try kill witch rescue lyre , but they all almost defenseless against ni-chang , who uses her deadly hair most effective weapon ( sounds weird , i know , but it works really well ) . it soon becomes clear only person who might able defeat white witch cho yi-hang , this sets stage most unforgettable reunion two former lovers . this sequel more direct , action-oriented film than original bride white hair , reason i actually found it more enjoyable surface . still , though , it lacks depth beauty original , largely because two lovers not meet again face face until final scene - although meeting well worth wait . most certainly , if you've seen enjoyed original , you'll want experience this sequel	1
tombstone , so far , best most accurate depiction tombstone later life wyatt earp life times era . there few inaccuracies plot , but not enough keep viewer getting whole picture . cast well chosen , fit each role like glove . since both movies , wyatt earp kevin cosner tombstone , came out same year , tombstone slight edge over it competitor . both movies , though , displayed particular situations historic , other not . over all .... 5 stars . i watch it over over again	1
i love trouble lightweight romantic comedy helium-filled proportions . it effectively vehicle everyone favourite movie darling early 1990s , julia roberts , some fun look lovely while getting one up dastardly male lead played nick nolte . nolte plays peter brackett , veteran newspaper columnist respected chicago chronicle . ever ladies man , brackett little wrong eyes bevy woman he attracts , his loyal readers , even his grumpy editor . he manages fly seat his pants deadlines looming get his stories filed time , every time ( even if it mean plagiarising himself ! ) . just released novel , brackett hit book tour circuit , life looking good this charming , yet slightly sleazy bachelor . this course until journalistic competition , form lovely sabrina peterson ( julia roberts ) , comes her quick wit , sharpened pencil , keen nose story , obligatory short skirt . end , this film runs out steam ludicrous contrived ending probably 30 minutes too late arriving . actual train crash plot becomes secondary romantic battle two leads , which rarely sparks into anything other than light-hearted banter some clich�d one-liners . there plenty awfully large plot holes story , some wide enough fit julia roberts ' smile through sideways , you probably find yourself laughing out loud some contrived scenarios . if it effort recapture some past glories screwball comedies late 1930s , it failed miserably .	-1
`awakenings ' truly one most heartbreaking heartwarming films i've ever experience see . starring two brilliant actors , robin williams robert de niro , `awakenings ' gives us tragic true story open our minds ours hearts full two-hour running time . story doctor sayer ( williams ) he tries cure some 15 patients his ward sure strike many chord . this film hailed critics loved oscar so why not everyone else . film opens young boy named leonard . leonard getting very sick , so sick he can't move his hands . it heartbreaking watch him try hide his sickness , placing his schoolbook under his desk so teacher won't find out his disability ( seeing how messy his handwriting become ) . fast-forward year 1969 when doctor sayer hired new neurologist chronic clinic . upon arriving beginning his work he sees these patients suffering disease makes them immobile unable speak , may not incurable other staff believe . linking all patients post-encephalitis he decides administer one patient , leonard ( de niro ) l-dopa , drug used parkinson patients , effort reverse his crippling disorder . miraculously medicine works leonard able move again first time thirty years . remaining patients given drug there air false hope , hope all better . time passes leonard falls love first time paula ( penelope ann miller ) , young woman who visits her father who suffered stroke . two them form bond touching watch . time though also brings bad news . medicine doesn't seem work passed certain point leonard condition worsening . he suffers uncontrollable ticks mood swings it apparent what they deemed miracle may indeed opposite . this film shows us value life , lives we all take granted . listening leonard speak how wonderful it alive truly inspiring , watching man nothing but life live get robbed chance heartbreaking say least . leonard learns he also teaches , helping sayer , man who repressed reclusive , break out his shell understand life only life if you live it . second half this film take out your heart tear it shreds , fact de niro so wonderful this film doesn't help tearjerker department . falling love leonard only make final frames worse , but it unavoidable . film brilliantly , each frame adding layers films message importance . there one scene particular really touched me . first time leonard outside since awakening we see him walking down steps it shows close up view his feet , he walks down we see young child walkig up her mother it clear connection . subtle yet so touching . one greatest films i've ever scene !	1

when i think cary grant , i think suave , immaculate , debonair actor who defined cool his own era well our own . monkey business , delightfully funny screwball comedy 1952 , shows us very different side cary grant . blessed major talent likes grant , ginger rogers , marilyn monroe , lovably huffy character actor charles coburn , monkey business delivers good old-fashioned comedy start finish . grant plays barnaby fulton , chemist working develop age-retarding formula . ginger rogers edwina , his more than understanding wife ; she handles his absent-minded episodes grace style , putting his interests before her own every time . fulton boss mr. oxley ( coburn ) very anxious solution found , he already past retirement age , but some piece puzzle just not fall into place - not , , until one fulton lab monkeys escapes her cage , mixes her own formula , then stashes it water cooler . when fulton tries out his latest concoction , washed down cup water , he soon reverts back teenager mentality , running around like wild man even entertaining lois laurel ( monroe ) , mr. oxley secretary , afternoon . eventually , effects wear off he returns his normal self , but both he his wife conduct several more experiments ( both accidentally well purposely ) movie progresses , each them regressing farther farther back toward childhood each time . naturally , all these goings-on , big , zany ending store everyone involved . best part this movie childlike antics cary grant ginger rogers they carry some time like couple eight-year-olds . marilyn monroe stunning her character never fails produce laughs . lois , who begun coming work early each morning because her boss isn't satisfied her punctuation , not hired her secretarial skills , but , mr. oxley says , anyone type . marilyn gets fair share screen time this early film hers , but there no question cary grant ginger rogers thoroughly steal show their comedic antics . end , monkey business shows youth state mind , best expressed barnaby line , " you're old only when you forget you're young .	1

i've seen phrase " slice life " used many times describe this movie , which makes me wonder - whose life this slice ? certainly not mine , not most people . anniversary party slice lives group people who extremely vain , self-absorbed , jaded rich beyond most people wildest fits imagination . worse , there isn't much hint filmmakers aware most people , or least most people who fun around , don't act way these characters . good films made hollywood - " mulholland drive " it kind dream world , both sense it hazy ambiguous sense one its characters dreams bigger part it ; " state main , " self-absorption many characters offered our amusement . " anniversary party " presented if most viewers sympathetic characters , but i can't imagine them elicting much sympathy anyone who isn't also bored rich prick . if this truly " slice life " hollywood set , it no wonder so many films produced hollywood so cynical shallow .	-1

i just purchased 2 disc , special edition this movie , here my problem(s ): first off , i don't speak italian , so my only options watch film english dub , or italian dub english subtitles , but here problem ; english dub out sync film , sometimes only slightly so , but other times very noticeable distracting ( i.e. during loud sound effects , such chair knocked over , or someone knocking loudly door ) . so my other option italian bud english subs , but here problem this , english subs missing during scene where peggy reading diary ( 30+ minutes into movie ) . now , i noticed missing subs during first part film , but these where usually during background conversations , or occasionally line would missing someone speech , but could usually figured out , these where only slightly annoying , but missing subs diary entry inexcusable ( also missing other subs well ) this important bit info plot story . also , when you set up audio option , main menu , there no problem , but i found if you use audio button your dvd remote , italian option gives you french soundtrack french gives you italian one . it nothing serious , but it annoyance all same . so , anyone else notice these problems , or i just end up bum disc	1

i just watched second half guarding tess tbs . it now 11:30 pm , i am writing this review when i should bed 1 half hour ago . nicolas cade old woman movie both turned great performances . story lightly funny first , but didn't really go anywhere . relationship fbi agent ex-first lady strange , though movie tried give their intimacy explanation , it still weird . climax came end , very entertaining , it broke long line fairly boring plot . there much meaning movie ; it tried successfully bring emotions smart first lady widow who dearly wants attention life . i touched movie . thank you . i should go bed now	1
guarding tess wouldn't so much fun if it weren't presence unflappable shirley maclaine former first lady who gets nicolas cage her secret service bodyguard . cage equally effective his role . he hates his assignment he maclaine don't get well all . but when president himself ( voiced director hugh wilson ) insists their pairing , what cage ? other than expected pivotal kidnap plot , there not whole lot goes , but film surprisingly shows what it must like surrender your privacy due your notoriety maclaine attempts find such private moments poignant . solid supporting cast makes it work too , although edward albert character maclaine son rushed over too much bring any significance role . all all , pleasant enjoyable movie	1

it truly pity western died off . they rare far these days . few years back tom selleck sam elliot made few together separate . they all worth seeing . this one tom playing cable , confederate soldier who left war early because he knows it over south lost . it just hasn't declared yet . his family friends thought him dead , reunion seems bit shaky . his wife played suzy amis , tough nails no nonsense frontier woman knows guns well her fathers gunsmithing business . eventually she works things out her husband cable it good thing he her back him since she great gun . even though cable believes war over he finds sympathizers trying enlist his aid confederate cause but he shuns them . when he accused murdering retired union officer he must track down real murderer bring him justice . production values excellent acting , directing , sets , music all top drawer . good dvd quality but no extras . if you enjoy westerns you should find it very entertaining . if you like it sure see " crossfire trail " " conagher "	1

siri amster- olszewski august 24 , 2006 emma , jane austen , one most enjoyable books i read recently . i chose read emma because , read loved pride prejudice same author , i wanted explore her other books well . characters austen stories both intriguing comical her description era which they take place creates clear view society those times i enchanted emma because austen beautifully blends together simple story girl documentation societal behaviors time . it provides insights into life social customs lady living late 18th early 19th centuries . one book principle topics marriage . main character , emma , approves matchmaking marriage , through her , reader gets view into different motives marriage . some people , marriage simply way advance social status ; others , marriage love . emma time , marriages matched according social status . one could not marry below their status . marrying too far above one status could end up disastrously . book tells story emma woodhouse who pretty , wealthy , poised , clever young woman . her mother died when she too young remember or miss her raised mainly her governess , miss taylor . miss taylor behaved like best friend rather than governess due her mild temper love emma . therefore , emma grew up without any firm rules or structure . this freedom caused her think quite highly herself her opinions . it her excessive self-confidence led her often make mistakes creating misfortunes others embarrassment herself . jane austen , style her writing , creates some well-defined character while including other character left more open reader interpretations . example , while emma faults very apparent , i found her innocence charming it created sympathy her character . other examples characters like emma jain fairfax , harriet smith , mr. elton . contrast character mr. knightly , family friend set stone . within first few pages book he established moral role model story . mr. woodhouse , mr. weston , mrs. weston ( former miss taylor ) , frank churchill , miss bates all other characters give off particular feeling , feeling austen intended . these characters all good bad qualities , all which left up interpretation reader . novel written third person , however detached narrator often sees through emma point view . effect not so neutral bystander . i highly recommend emma anyone who enjoys light-hearted , witty book captivates enchants . while reading this book you find yourself captivated pages one jane austen masterpieces .	1

dino made number westerns , everything comic western pardners jerry lewis , whodunit western , five card stud robert mitchum , playing alcoholic lawman rio bravo . but martin field day playing villain rough night jericho , hard-bitten , violent movie . martin plays jason flood , ex-lawman who taken over town jericho . george peppard john mcintire plays former lawmen well , who contracted provide stage jean simmons , who flood trying force into going into business him . flood also ex simmons , which makes him even more determined not let peppard mcintyre help her out . things get increasingly violent until final showdown , where blood flows freely . everyone good this film , fro mthe three leads mcintire , who always superb , particularly westerns , well great slim pickens one flood henchmen . rough night jericho overlooked , but it very entertaining	1

i just received my 2nd copy this video , my vcr ate first one . it great video , parts it little cheesy but it well worth money . there 3 sets 12 reps per exercise , you work shoulders first , starting muscle building exercise , overhead press , then you go front raises , rear delt raises , lateral raises which cory calls toning shaping exercises . she repeats this pattern all muscle groups . then it biceps , first 3 sets normal bicep curls palms out , then 1 arm concentration curls , then hammer curls . you repeat concentration curls 2 more times , but last exercise " tri-set " instead hammer curls , you normal bicep curls bicep curls where you turn you arm top . after biceps she work forearms , forearm curls , wrist curls , reverse wrist curls . i usually skip these insert few chest back exercises which not included this workout . lastly , it triceps , you lying tricep extensions first , then french press , kickbacks last exercise lying close grip bench press which really works your triceps . there also brief warmup cooldown . this workout half hour very thorough muscle groups represented . it move fast pace , reps little fast , which i end up pausing tape often rest or finish set . but really only negative this video . i think cory pleasant instructor , she encouraging , motivating inspiring . i plan using this video twice week addition my other workouts , i am anxious see results . this tape i am sure i get them	1
this one best films i've seen date cast great . i recommend this film everyone because it great story family whose getting united states .	1
story gets bit complicated because it deals little bit law issues . real problem most us get kind frightened when we face something unusual our daily lives . i watch movie end twice order understand well how bad guys going punished . i wonder what lawyers , fbi agents mafia members would think when watching this movie . most us don't know much legal issues but still interested thrillers , this movie shows rather believable very fun plot . good guy , mitch mcdeere , wins over evil not only because he smart but also because big deal good luck . mitch so lucky story strains credibility . example , mitch wife gets know all sudden gene hackman character ( who important documents copy ) not going dive mitched though so she saves days showing up distract him . well , good luck tends favor people drive real life . same time movie shows legal procedures made-up real life lawyer john grisham . movie also realistic way bad guys punished . real life white-collar criminals hardly ever go jail , even less killed good guys ; everybody knows this . what not everybody knows these crooks still face problems . movie shows sort legal money problems they get involved into . finally , suspense well organized . moreover piano instrumental music goes really well those scenes . yes , this very compelling movie recommend watching . beware this movie deals some degree conservative vs liberal cultural war . bad guys southern conservatives who want rule other people lives according their own hypocrite standards . meanwhile good guys liberals ne . i wondered how writer john grisham could portray his own southern fellows negative ways . all i guess jg realized what would accepted entertainment industry wrote according it . anyways , this just movie it what it supposed : entertain	1
ikiru opening , i started real doubts film . i heard this kurosawa best , film built up just enough come crashing down . luckily , didn't happen . narrator film reminded me criswell narrations plan 9 outer space . film seemed say too much show too little . then narrator continued during extremely long take our hero mr. watanabe work , something clicked . long duration shot narrator continued breakdown man less wholesome characteristics gave impression he breaking down our lives , narration coming back our own minds , we powerless silence i t.t hat floored me , rest film , i remained awe-stricken this humble yet miserable man . takashi shimura gives one greatest performances i've seen since raging bull . here guy whose really pissed off world , but he smart enough know he only himself blame mediocrity his life dealt . horror his face when he learns his cancer remain me long time . there points which film seems drag , but never without purpose . when he dies , finally given meaning his existence , his coworkers family members recount final days pity , confusion , finally admiration . scene lags , which makes us much more insulted their ignorance	1

this documentary gives brief introduction al-jazeera , which , if you didn't know already , main arab language newschannel . it source which won great deal respect arab world it willingness go where other , stated-owned controlled arab networks won't tread . this sense it more than mere arab cnn it stands out more general landscape arab media . filmmakers here interview al-jazeera personel , well some american journalists , american official which liases al-jazeera centcom , american central command present irak war ( which happens 30 miles al jazeera headquarters ) . it covers timeline just before war , just after bush anounced main millitary operations over . striving neutral , documentary allows you see how al-jazeera see themselves how they conceive their mission world . they very disappointed united states , but adhere strongly its values . also interesting how " arab side " gives them very different perspective western media spite fact they clearly espouse its values , like when they angered pentagon protests their showed images us prisoners , when western media routinely show iraki pows . unexpected insight documentary affords you it lets you see just how incompetent millitary media management . american liaison doesn't speak word arabic spite assigned his goverment most important arab news source , if weren't enough , he barely articulate english clearly doesn't know anything local context history . instance bungled media operations when centcom tells journalists deck cards most wanted iraki officials , but doesn't foresight some give journalists , irritating very people they trying win over . all all it compelling watch which gives you good look into producers news west arab worlds . it gets four stars rather than five because it sometimes amateurish handling flow , which makes it times bit unfocused	1
this movie wonderful follow up first ... anne same charming spirit cast just wonderful they first time . i highly recommend this movie anyone	1
i always find it irritating read analyses military movies obvious civilians who know nothing military , combat specifically marine corps . this one best movies john wayne made one , least , which he should won oscar . stryker character , played wayne , not " martinet " . he plays marine sergeant , combat veteran , way marine sergeant supposed . tough , but fair . he pushes his people , boots ( recruits ) , because he wants help them survive when they hit beach . if they don't survive they no good him no good mission . wayne excellent job portraying tha t.t he surviving flag raisers who movie marines gagnon hayes , navy corpsman bradley ( whose son wrote flags our fathers ) , not , one previewer noted , " three marines " . navy corpsmen proud navy corpsmen respected such marines whom they serve . also , characters not " soldiers " it really irritating when term used describe marines . men this story marines actors play marines , title earned . short , even though actual combat footage spliced into movie action , given time it made , it well . there some romantic lulls , but given period movie made , 40s 50s , this fairly typical . overali , this great movie , even if you civilian . it give fans duke something memorable watch . it may also give critics john wayne new view man solid actor	1
***** i liked this film lot . it entertaining , suspenseful , made me think . it staying me i'm continuing think it . " simple plan " asks question , " what if you found $4.4 million gym bag woods ... would you keep it ... what if you thought there reasonably good chance you'd never get caught ... no one would ever know ? " this what happens central characters . dvd cover advertises , " sometimes good people evil things . " once they make their decision , plan their plan , movie illustrates how consequences happen completely unanticipated . bill paxton plays main character wonderful typical " good " middle-class accountant small rural town . bridget fonda excellent job his wife , who very idealistic moralistic until she realizes scenario not hypothetical --- fact , she decide what , she makes decisions different what i would expected . billy bob thornton predictably great , course , playing rural man ( main character brother ) who never chance town he lives just wants truly life , his own way , what right ; he handicapped , however , his intelligence , his eccentricity , his background . i felt lot sympathy his character , since i'm person more like his brother , it fascinating see how he lived thought ... movie progressed , his middle-class brother gained empathy difficult life he led , too . i didn't think any pacing slow , other reviewers said . i thought starkness pacing fit beautifully movie it gave me chance process what going . one moral decision led , each them made me think " would i ? " " could i ? " it made me see how seductive certain crimes certain circumstances any one us . this quality , very suspenseful , provocative film . i think it would equally enjoyable men women but definitely not children all , themes very heavy mature . there no special features or subtitles . i generally like subtitles , but they not necessary this film hearing people , everyone speaks very clearly . i cannot imagine how anyone would dislike this movie . there some violence , but none it gratuitous . i generally really dislike violence movies , but it worth it experience i took away after watching it . *****	1
this one most boring movies i ever seen . i knew very beginning movie there no way i going able stay awake through whole thing . i right ; i fell asleep fifteen minutes into it . recently , i offered chance watch it again . i thought , " ok , i didn't see whole thing , it might gotten better , so i'll give it chance . " ... bad mistake . this little tale horse race across vast desert nothing hold my interest very long . hidalgo name horse . so what ? that boring this movie . so why 1-star markup ? cause main character played viggo mortensen , aragorn fame smash movie series lord rings- i like viggo . i not , however , like this movie . it kind fitting it should set desert- cause that exactly where this movie should buried , never bore wave audiences again . if you find yourself overworked need nice long nap , watch hidalgo ; you'll out no time	1
don't read this if you haven't seen movie ! it took me more than dozen views start figuring out how everything connected . what bugs ? what stickey stuff his mainfraim ? how his breakdowns paranoia connected his work , what quite white place he ends up ? all weird stuff chaos slipping seams , chaos which he thinks he fighting against ... first . max thread connection great infinite divine , which human beings not wired see . he see it though , glimpses first , then whole thing . it almost kills him . it classic iccarus story , except max survives finds happiness end . i disagree end ' cop out ' or incongruous -- it cumulation every frame film ... it point ! he looks leaves blowing trees , * doesn't * see pattern , can't see pattern , doesn't want see pattern -- , very first time , he smiles . why isn't it perfect ? i would like see more actual math . concepts there , but details aren't . not big deal . " beautiful mind " put lot effort into putting real math into plot , i like . also , some details didn't connect . example , ' name god ' ( 216-letters long ) , 216-digit number his computer spits out before dying , wouldn't necessarily connected . system they explained indicated different numbers integers would represent single letter hebrew . like 42 would letter , 2 would different letter . so , number digits wouldn't really equal number letters ... darren kind painted himself into corner there . he wisely chose not make punch line movie complex number theory proof , i didn't even notice ( much less become annoyed ) this detail until viewing #15 . up until then , every time i saw it something different would finally make sense . thus , five stars . i'm inclined give five stars any movie makes me think longer than credits roll , so this one should get many many more .	1
i found this movie unpredictable , even after reading plot back box . acting good believable . some scenes designed " shock " ; execution these scenes frighteningly effective . i watched this 13 " low resolution screen pair small multimedia speakers low volume , but scene 39 minutes nearly stopped my heart . if i seen this theater , i may not here tell you it . seriously ... if you even think you may heart condition , you would well advised loved-one screen this movie you first . my only criticism , mentioned reviewer , not enough information " them " their motivations wrap my imagination around . most young people safely watch this movie minimal parental input , assuming they old enough know boogie-man doesn't really exist . refreshingly , there no sex , although main actor actress who barely acquainted , spend 2 nights together , one separate rooms , one same bed fully clothed	1

i counted ~ 15 factual errors ( aka lies ) during michael moore opening speech . * i stopped shortly after . i'm not going waste my time such obviously factually-wrong fiction . how stupid mr. moore think we ? i * there * watching election unfold , what he reported not what happened . * example : he said fox news pressured nbc , cbs , abc , cnn change their minds , give florida gore , then bush . what load lies . fox news no power over other nets . nbc , cbs , abc , cnn operate independently , reached their decisions independently , without influence fox . * furthermore , other nets not call bush ( moore falsely claimed ) . they labeled florida " undecided " , left it way several days . * also , moore claimed recount showed gore won florida . false . bipartisan committee counted votes few months later , not only bush win , but recount * increased * his lead few hundred several thousand , because conservative communities western florida . ( many other non-biased groups found same result . ) this video reminds me his columbine documentary , where men ties kept changing colors middle their speeches ( it called creative editing ) . moore no ethics . propagandist . far i'm concerned , he no better than kkk member . same mental disorder illogic .	-1
hilarious cube vision movie . mike epps one funniest guys planet cube serious personna make classic goofy guy/straight guy combination . get some popcorn , take few deep breaths , cause you laugh . its gas !!	1
this one greatest musicals all time . songs all became well-loved hits , known music lovers all ages , even today . frank sinatra , shirley maclaine , louis jourdain maurice chevalier got together create magical light love story , fabulous singing some good dance . " i love paris " ballet one classic dances screen , surpassed my opinion only astaire-rogers top hat , final ballet american paris , john travolta saturday night fever patrick swayze dirty dancing . story line wear bit thin , somewhat silly ending cafe ( movies made time sometimes suffered this failing ) , but overall , this still classic . why , oh why , it not dvd ????	1
loser far one my favorite movies . i remember there only 3 other people theater when i saw it , though . i definitly not get attention it deserves . it cute story small town boy who moves big city , he falls independent girl way . movie rather predictible most teen movies , but it really funny cute look college life nyc	1
this one my favourite musicals ( seven brides seven brothers ) . great good natured movie which followed hugely successful broadway show same name . cole porter amusing songs set background stage musical based around shakespeare taming shrew . background ex husband wife ( fred lilli - played kathryn grayson howard keel ) who reliving their own version katherine petruchio they figure out their own failed marriagethis not difficult film watch emotionally , you imagine cole porter not oprah wingrey . however it enormoulsy good natured , i love porter clever lyrics howard keel grayson extremely good their roles , neat supporting cast . there few stretches some songs - i mean how earth could they really imagine ' wunderbar ' would great song shakespearian play set italy ? still it fits it fun watch just how they manage it - teh two gangsters singing , ' brush up your shakespeare ' rhyming heinous coriolanus ! there really no extras this all - if you hoped interview or deleted scenes then forget it , it movie , few picture scenes bit information them , nothing you would want buy this dvd especially . one best musicals , lots fun good watch	1
this film hysterical . it plethora quotable lines great movie watch rainy sunday afternoon . alan alda plays sociopathic borderline dictator dean bannanna republic med school . guttenberg doesnt ... ruin movie . all all , if you like real genius spies like us , this movie keep you floor laughing	1
i love this movie . it came out couple years after i personally some what same experiences . i baby when i 15 my boyfriend i split up short time then got back together we still together 20 years later ( married 17 ) so unlike what ' rochelle o'gorman ' says ( who gave editorial review this movie ) teenage couples staying together sometimes reality . i think it good moral story shows it possible make it stay together even when you get together baby young .	1
thank god this essentially preserved movie version stage hit one my all time favorite broadway actresses gwen verdon . she just lights up screen . bob fosse dances spectacular music ross adler just classic . they just don't make them like this anymore . sheer heaven hell-with devil played incomparable ray walston . if you love musicals , you must add this your collection !	1
i really liked this film . before michael moore became liberal celebrity , he completely obscure magazine writer filmmaker . this film major underground hit time , it still excellent today . you really feel people who lose their jobs , you're infuriated callous indifference roger smith management general motors . i really liked segment where flint tries reinvent itself tourist mecca midwest . it consisted horribly misguided attempt opening up hilton downtown flint , opening up theme park called auto world . it justs smacks desperation stupidity ; it make you laugh grimace same time . instead giving these people really good jobs again , they come up this idiotic scheme , which ended up disaster ( both hilton auto world closed within year ) . moore recent years become " political celebrity " , politics become quite cottage industry america . it not just moore doing it ; right wingers like hannity coulter doing it too . they all got books ; some them got films ; some them radio shows . lot them aren't really interested changing anything , it might interfere their livelihoods . i don't know if moore like or not . but this still potent , darkly funny film real class warfare , dismantling working class america .	1
i think you see this movie second time fully appreciate it . there alot subtlties i didn't pick up until i watched it again years later . all acting fantastic . standout performance actor who played " salesman " hotel . weird-a-rama !!! movie ends up completely freaky surreal , ya got warped mind fully grasp surrealness coen brothers . strange-a-rama .........	1
this film unbelievably good . i dvr'd it free speech tv , i watched parts it again again . every turn you blown away revelations this film , if you , like me , never thought much who controls mainstream media . first time i watched it i kept stop tape just cringe , letting import facts sink . talking heads people you may never encountered , but whom you unlikely forget . write their names down . check into their books . even if you don't buy film look list people it get their books . particularly incisive inquiries into most recent presidential elections . you there , i there , but lewis shows us ugly underside media can't afford let us see . this scary , take-to-the-streets stuff . finally , pappas deserves more well-known documentarian . if you put off michael moore whininess slightly embarassing approach , you may find new friend robert kane pappas .	1
quot ; sourcequot ; excellent documentry ' beat generation ' . it so good i saw it twice theaters . documentry wealth new material long familiar classic footage . my personal favorite writer jack kerouac came out beat generation it fantastic see him learn more him . documentry always explores other key figures like : ginsberg , burroghs , cassidy among others . three actors recite famous works kerouac , ginsberg burroghs . johnny depp dennis hopper fair jobs working material kerouac burroghs but chuck workman slaughters ginsberg poem quot ; howlquot ; . only fault this documentry previous it end . check quot ; sourcequot ; out	1
i just recently purchased dvd after owning vhs tape years use research paper i wrote musicals ' commentary nature childhood children literature . although it not super high-tech dvd , it performance itself , true magic resides . i've always loved this show now i it dvd , i enjoy it even longer	1
i wasnt even born yet when this film came out but it great . great sense good actors(jim brown , burt reynolds fernando lamas ) , good performance , good sountrack once more action-western , what could better ?...... not until last year 2003 i know victor newman(young restless ) fernando lamas right hand man film !!!! what shock !!	1
" raiders lost ark " thrill . i mean suspense just brilliant story packed surprises . this movie not like all . you don't get excitement you " raiders " . what more it scary , i mean almost disturbing . ceremonial scene creepy , candles freaky it looks like this could really happening somewhere dark place . movie deals truly disturbing adult themes such evil , drug addiction , witchcraft , child abuse , torture . " raiders " you knew it just story . however , scare " doom " not so much " jumpy " like " raiders " , it uneasy feeling sticks you soon you enter horrible hell hole . intorduction chinese kid brings lot fun but woman irassible , dr jones not convincing possessed evil indiana . idea children working slaves definitely not funny one . roller coaster rides however really add tone movie , they cool , but few scenes downright fake . example , scene where ceiling spikes comes down so false : it looks like it ' only two meters soon it close them , spielberg lifts it up again give time woman . example , crocodile scene obviously shot different locations because when taken profile it looks like indiana his goons standing little bridge over creek . guru character not interesting one , image this film gives indians more political one rather than mysterious one , i don't like this image . but ,... beginning movie one best action thriller beginnings all time just uhe first aprt up point where trio arrive india , movie deserves watched .	1

update : whv currently ( finally ! ) preparing special edition dvd this title , but there no word yet which version - heavily truncated r-rated us version , longer , but still incomplete , uk theatrical version , or russell recently surfaced ( amazing ) full length cut . there also no information whether or not whv plans release this correct aspect ratio 2.35 : 1 , or if they going crop it 16x9 call " widescreen . " i tried update this review number times changes haven't appeared - i don't know why . i am guessing amazon takes issue contact url warner i trying post here . go message boards ' devils ' imdb.com url . ' devils ' outstanding film arguably represents very finest work both ken russell oliver reed . unfortunately , it currently dvd limbo . warner vhs grainy , heavily cut very poorly cropped abomination times incomprehensible gives no indication tremendous achievement represented film art direction cinematography . recently completely uncut print this masterpiece surfaced excellent condition . warner executives attended screening . so why there no dvd works ? here story , best i able find out : first all , there no way hell uncut version ' devils ' could get rating mpaa . i seen some " lost " footage , , believe me ; it could never , ever happen - even though this stuff allowed air bbc tv part their " forbidden weekend " film series . so why not release it nc17 ? evidently warner home video not release anything stronger than . ( they not this policy back when they selling " uncut international version " ' dressed kill ' vhs years years - complete crotch shots , throat slashings explicit verbal references trimmed theatrical release us . ) it also seems they won't sublicense their titles - which would allow somebody like criterion handle release . my understanding they only consider outright sale - which i imagine prohibitively expensive . other film i fear suffer these policies nicholas roeg donald cammell ' performance ' - which i also believe might cut , but may easier time getting passed if re-submitted . ( i know it subject studio interference . ) if you care , warner home video moved past consumer outcry - although case cropped versus letterboxed special edition ' willie wonka chocolate factory . ' ' devils , ' virtually no chance getting into blockbuster ( even its rated incarnation ) , likely much tougher sell . if you just can't wait until hell freezes over , there reasonably priced bootleg dvd available - far more complete than this tape , better looking ( not pristine longshot , but big improvement ) , partially letterboxed , some excellent supplementary materials ( bbc ' hell earth ' documentary , containing most censored footage ) . obviously not ideal way see this movie , but it leaves this tape dust .

last few times we've seen words " directed wes craven " anything , it hasn't really anything write home . scream trilogy debacle cursed , it seemed like craven lost his edge . man who brought us terrifying , exploitation films like last house left hills eyes , classic nightmare elm street , may not go throat like he used , but red eye close return form director we'll get while . hottie rachel mcadams stars hotel manager catching red eye flight back home , soon enough she turns tables psychopath ( cillian murphy , more menacing eerie looking than batman begins if you believe ) looking assassinate her father ( brian cox ) . there really nothing we haven't seen before red eye , but under craven guiding hand tension suspense superbly crafted . mcadams murphy quite good well , film short but sweet , clocking under hour half . all all , there may well hope yet craven future films , anyone looking some great suspense should definitely check this out	1

" jobair says " personally i prefer europe " . after chatting like newfound friends , jobair gives back condor pistol . condor doesn't shoot jobair , instead he lets jobair give lift station . dumb scenes like this prevent this otherwise great action thriller making five .	1

released 1949-this movie stars toshiro mifune one his earliest roles tokyo cop murakami , who gun stolen which leads his relentless drive recover weapon-which used crime spree . we actually see very little yusa-the man who winds up gun -- i'm not totally convinced use name not coincidental considering japan occupied yu-s-a time . perhaps mifunes attempt retrieve missing gun restore his honor symbolic japans attempt restore it honor after war . then again-i may reading into this it may not any such thing -- however kurosawa himself-in regard problems american spca this movie stated " i never any other moment experienced stronger sense regret over japan losing war " regerdless , other films such " madadayo " " rhapsody august " -kurosawa touched conflict atomic bomb-and not implying he anti-american -- i thnk it possibility yusa could symbolic meaning . theory aside , this excellent movie-which preserved quite well considering it age conditions when it filmed -- when neither mifune or kurosawa major stars japan still recovering war . while mifune my favorite actor--i'm so used him playing samurai -- this role took little getting used -- but his performance quite good-as one would expect ! basically , this story revolves around murakami ( mifune ) who mentored sato ( takashi shimura ) their pursuit missing gun yusa ( isao kimura ) . if nothing else-this film fascinating it historical presentation post war japanany mifune/kurosawa fans should enjoy this movie ! while quite different-a more recent movie same basic premise which very good " missing gun	1

truly incredible work . great concept . director vincenzo natali difinitely one most brilliant directors out there . film intelligent , allegorical , boasts unbelievable perfect ending ( i.e. final shot lone survivor departing cube , aided beautiful piece music ) . incredibly atmospheric intense , unlike most movies these days , it leaves many questions unanswered . my knees felt like jelly when film over , i left staring screen long after credits finished rolling . film one best soundtracks i've ever heard , composer i know nothing ( mark korven ) . there should cd soundtrack ! brilliant , intense film . certainly not everybody , but one thing certain : no matter your disposition film , there no denying you never forget it once you've seen it . one best films ever made my opinion , deserves so much more than it recieves .	1
24-hour party people mocumentary lowest rung ( if best show not enough ) tries many times funny but mostly poor taste . british scene 1980 influential height 2nd brit wave , michael winterbottom could exposed goings-on much better way . my main issue this film it attempts funny hip-britster fashion falls flat constantly since issues occurring very serious . dialogue difficult follow especially since most it meaningless anyway , film never really follows it premise much it should : rise factory . i really enjoy joy division segments , though , even if exploiting ian curtis death slightly poor taste . unless you're fan brit explosion post-punk era , extreme fan , i could not recommend this film . it not even greatly educational music lovers times very difficult get into .	1

my watching this film resulted conversation friend beginning politics spiraling down future our world . premise film disturbing say least . i never true fan charleton heston who my opinion always overacted . however , edward . robinson seemed comfortable playing this character he many different roles he played . his performance truly heartfelt , bringing mind current debate " ending one own life dignity " . i shutter think this life it should though . but robinson character acted decision counterfeit courage ultimate hopelessness accompanied it such way you could very well empathize him . i found other actors somewhat bland . perhaps this acting point time , but some actors make most roles others cannot . story line unique , but script lacking . re-make today steven spielberg might worthwhile seeing . perhaps most striking element i took this film unshakeable chilling unsettling feeling this could very well our world if we not wake up	1

if this movie ever going chance , it needed 4 or 5 hours long , or never attempted first place . some books adapt well edited condensed screenplay - possession just can't dealt way . what you result story entirely . there just wasn't time enough , i guess , develop characters , or even include half them . only character true book left almost intact sir george . rest stripped their layers everything made them fascinating , we left painful stereotypes , case roland michell , character who seems wandered wrong set during filming . my best advice if you've read book , skip movie , but if you saw movie , you should yourself favor get book	1

this documentary absolutely bone-chilling , really providing powerful honest look into how war waged modern era , demonstrating how american public lied given propaganda modern wars , opposed just giving them unbiased truthful information coverage , giving viewer idea how war become more more imperialism neo-colonialism over time . it also fascinating note original words president eisenhower great farewell address actually " military-industrial-congressional complex , " but he changed it so he wouldn't alienate congress , whom he'd gotten pretty well during his two terms . it also surprise hear such stinging indictment military buildup such strong warning exercise military power justly coming someone who 5-star general , career officer , republican boot . sadly , we haven't heeded his wise parting words us , same way we haven't paid heed president washington farewell address , which he similarly warned us against getting involved foreign entanglements not abusing our military strength or nation great ability good instead evil . i've always thought eisenhower lousy president ( though great general ) , one my all-time least-favorite presidents , but my opinion him raised bit after hearing his farewell address finding out his feelings dangerous road military warfare taking after wwii , well how he against dropping a-bomb japan . however , this film seem bit uneven , compelling indisputable evidence it presents . though it claims trace evolution modern warfare bloated military buildup since wwii ( it shocking how much u.s. spends defence comparison all other nato nations even enemies like china iran ) , how government media successfully used propaganda manipulate public opinion pro-war not question or protest these actions , lot focus seems current iraq war , some time given over vietnam well . awful lot conflicts glossed over or not even delved into , such korea , bosnia , kosova , afghanistan , lebanon , laos , columbia , guatemala , chile . historical perspective film theme conclusion would even stronger more compelling there equal focus these other conflicts instead just brushing them aside favor two most people already heard lot . extras include audio commentary col . lawrence wilkerson director eugene jarecki , trailer , previews other documentaries put out same company , extra scenes , television appearances made mr. jarecki , question answer sessions he held various groups he spoke , extended featurettes telling us more some characters we me t.t his film hardly accused anti-military , since many people interviewed either served or currently serving military . i'm strong pacifist conscientious objector myself , i'm not anti-military either . like people interviewed , i agree we need strong prepared military those times when conflict inevitable , there wars which i absolutely feel morally justified , such wwii civil war , wars it would immoral not fought . military should stay all-volunteer , equal opportunity , so people poor working-class ( many them minorities ) won't so hugely represented favor white people higher socioeconomic brackets , people who historically able get out serving because their family money connections . young people like william solomon who voluntarily go should know ahead time what they're getting into , if they're deployed , know just what they're supposed fighting , instead misled outright lied government . this documentary , spite its unevenness , should required viewing every concerned citizen out there ; maybe then we'll see some change military-industrial-congressional complex	1

this film battle ia drang valley 1965 vietnam . it begins 1954 when french patrol attacked defeated surprise ambush . prophecy future ? one scene wounded french soldier killed . [ this truth or drama ? ] then 1964 we see children car singing tune based " sambre et meuse " , which dates napoleonic wars . next we see training camp where helicopters used ground battles . [ wasn't this adaption civilian model ? ] one scene shows officer wives discussing local conditions laundromat . [ defective washing machines camp symbol failure ? ] one scene recalls custer last battle . custer not know size enemy ; he assumed 2,500 not three times many . later we hear intelligence officer admit they not know size enemy forces . ominous ? mechanized cavalry lands their helicopters , soldiers start shooting . some soldiers run after lone enemy ambushed . battle erupts fierce fighting . two helicopters bring needed ammunition . back states telegrams arrive bad news families . they delivered impersonally ? battle continues rising casualties both sides . air support arrives drop napalm . some lands too far enemy . they expect attack dawn . but tide turned , enemy faces defeat withdraws . end battle shows load journalists arriving take pictures question colonel . after seventh cavalry withdrawn vietnamese reclaim their land . colonel returns his family his land . 1964 general douglas macarthur advised lbj against getting into land war asia . could this film created warning against war middle east ? it subtle anti-war message ? it seems different his earlier film based revolutionary war .	1
robert redford dustin hoffman deliver oscar worthy performances , while jason robards won oscar best supporting actor this moviewhich ( my opinion ) one best " political " films ever made . i'm not even sure if it nominated best picture , but i say ... this movie better than " rocky " ok . movie won four academy awards ; one i mentioned above , best adapted screenplay , best art direction , best sound . it also rated pg , which strange because they use word f**k least 8 times this movie nowadays , two uses get you slapped rating . but movie opens we witness four men breaking into watergate building , which we all know setting democratic national headquarters . police show up catch men act setting up survelliance/bugging place story shows upbob woodward ( redford ) desk . woodward reporter washington post who reports story then begins see oddities it . why would men break into democratic national headquarters ? who sent them ? etc . eventually joining act helping him carl bernstein ( hoffman ) who begin thorough investigation scandal begins turrn up names very high up government eventually even president united states , richard nixon . bernstein woodward worked their a$$es off get this story , through apparent death threats when people wouldn't talk them , they got it all right . robards plays their boss , ben bradlee deserved his oscar . performance really good , although his face almost entirely hidden shadow hal holbrook mysterious deep throat . deep throat one woodward informants who apparently worked high up government seemed know everything watergate cover-up . except he refused just give up information , only hints could never directly quoted or even referred . woodward , this day not given up identity deep throat or even gave vaguest idea who he might've . anyway , movie reporters trying unravel cover-up , this movie incredibly entertaining exciting . it never boring , it never dull ; both hoffman redford play their parts extraordinarily well , which causes us like movie even more . it strange too , movie doesn't end nixon resigning ; but instead ends nixon taking his 2nd oath office . we're given remainder details they're typed up typewriter . i though ending abrupt , but perfect . grade :	1

absolute power not among clint eastwood greatest films , but it much better than usually given credit . dark thriller , directed professionally bleakly only eastwood it , absolute power centers around luther whitney , professional burglar ( eastwood himself , one his best performances last decade ) , who finds himself classic wrong place , wrong time situation - while robbing luxurious mansion , he accidentally witnesses sexual assault murder , subsequent cover-up , involves president united states white house staff . scene very beginning movie probably strongest one it , eastwood making brilliant use cinematography , music ( especially lack ) his trademark heavy contrasted lighting , almost no dialogue all , it remarkably effective scene overshadows much rest film . still , film turns into more standard conspiracy-thriller , it holds its own quite well , mainly due william goldman wonderful script ( his always , this genius who wrote ' princess bride ' , ' marathon man ' , ' misery ' ' butch cassidy sundance kid ' , among others ) most all thanks absolutely fantastic all-star cast ; other than clint himself , who ideal charming , ruthless but honest criminal , fantastic performances also given gene hackman president ed harris detective case . rest excellent cast includes laura linney (' primal fear ' ) luther daughter ; fantastic judy davis (' naked lunch ' , ' barton fink ' ) president sneaky assistant ; scott glenn (' buffalo soldiers ' ) ; dennis haysbert (' far heaven ' ) ; e.g. marshall (' tora ! tora ! tora!'); penny johnson (' 24 ' ) ; richard jenkins (' six feet under ' ) . usually case clint eastwood films , all actors seem hand-picked him directly , rather than participated audition , because each character seems designed specifically actor portraying them . because cast brilliant directing dialogue , absolute power entirely gripping watch , even if story times less than entirely convincing just little fragmented . absolute power tries make its mark three levels - thriller level only one where it completely succeeds , it manages constantly exciting , gripping enticing . it works slightly less well human level , because inter-character relationships rather poorly developed . laura linney character particular underdeveloped , so father-daughter relationship element hardly carries any weight story , neither her relationship ed harris character . there no interaction eastwood character hackman , only relationships worth mentioning ones eastwood harris , which strictly superficial based mutual respect , one hackman marshall , who plays old billionaire who funded hackman rise presidency . third level which film works political commentary ; there it achieves partial success , story often seems contrived ( although , one might note , not contrived we may imagine ) . still , it give you general idea how absolute power corrupts , kind horrors intricate systems democracy might hide ; but it not taken too literally . strongest elements story mystery , clint eastwood character , clearly strongest film ; such it solid enticing thriller lots atmosphere wonderful acting , keep you glued your seat	1

hirohito always something puzzle me . teenager 1980s , i would see this man news wonder why earth he still emperor japan . during his reign , japanese forces committed untold atrocities against chinese all manner other asian peoples , japanese planes attacked pearl harbor treacherous sneak attack , japanese soldiers killed many brave american soldiers , japan forced sign terms unconditional surrender . it made no sense me hirohito still emperor japan , man who never forced pay any real price all war criminal . even japanese people continued revere him , seemingly holding no grudges over destruction american forces bombs brought japanese homeland 1945 . this biography video sheds light hirohito his japan , but it fails deliver its promises . outset , jack perkins tells me this video reexamine hirohito role attack pearl harbor seemingly argue he played larger role than history myth tell us ; frankly , there no explication this issue found here . if nothing else , this documentary shows hirohito exceedingly weak ineffective emperor , man lacking backbone stand up his advisors military leaders japan . he obviously good learner , though , his advisors supposedly taught him young age passive ruler . 1930s , military leaders saw depression dangers reunified china their chance pursue their own aggressive goals . without hirohito knowledge , they attacked manchuria , then attacked chinese heartland ( torturing massacring up two hundred thousand people infamous rape nanking ) . hirohito opposed such actions , we told , horrified atrocities committed his name . he too passive , however , anything stop army aggression . certainly , fact military assassinated six prime ministers during 1930s would make one reticent speak out against them , but emperor supposed lead his country . hirohito , though , backed down his anti-military wishes time time again , eventually acquiescing altogether everything happened : japan abandonment league nations , its militaristic aggression , course attack pearl harbor . it most ironic military played up hirohito supposed divine nature made him rallying cry its own aggressions . this video explains why hirohito stayed throne ( now officially figurehead ) after world war ii . macarthur , well planners washington , thought he would serve stabilizing force chaotic days following war . rather than castigated collaborator , japanese people continued their support emperor , which amazes me . he became symbol japan ' new middle class eventually good ambassador . he never expressed regret japanese atrocities during war , he never paid any price his role events - which he , if nothing else , complicit . these facts never truly forgotten west , however , some world leaders criticized attending hirohito funeral 1989 . this would excellent video it not introductory promise shed new light hirohito role attack pearl harbor ; all we told this point he seemingly nodded acquiescence plan , showing no uneasiness decision . other than this , all we get old tired excuses : he felt powerless stop plans , he feared possibility coup against him . he angry japan attacked before declaring war , though ; , we told , only thing pearl harbor made him angry . this documentary shows hirohito very fortunate man . he spineless leader who not dare command his military rein themselves his wishes ; he witnessed destruction his country allied bombs ; he never faced charges war crimes or lost his throne over carnage carried out his name . despite all this , he retained his seat emperor , enjoyed great popularity among his people , lived easy life 44 years after war . this biographical presentation fine job describing hirohito life , but it leaves many questions - including some it poses beginning - unanswered	1
... just like hollywood just like music industry which , i guess , point . john travolta , playing his character get shorty ( , lesser degree , like his character pulp fiction swordfish ) mr. cool . this time he trying make it big music biz . he discovers new talent ( artist christina milian ) works his way through assortment characters more types cliches than real characters . brand name cast yet no one makes any more than dent personality radar . dialogue seems forced , funnier script than screen most scenes feel posed sterile . most actors appeared bored many celebrities outside their media personae . aside few interesting moments , only one speech toward end made cedric entertainer redeemed film . it like big commercial ( which , i suppose , any hollywood film ) . certain musicians get shameless plugs ( steven tyler aerosmith , included film ) , various movies get shameless plugs ( including , not so disguised fashion , get shorty ) , certain hollywood landmarks ( e.g. mann chinese theater ) plopped into film like tourist video even l.a. lakers staples center get plug . it attempt play irony making film making film or , this case , making musician . so we watch travolta mr. cool navigating landscape music industry give christina milian her sudden instantaneous rise top charts . ending so horribly cheesy i felt if i watching american idol . watchable , but barely . player covered this terrain so much better .	1

surprisingly `hidalgo ' released ' 04 didn't live up studio expectations terms either financial earnings , or audience appeal . only now , two years after its release this fantastic action/adventure film finding dvd adoring audience it so richly deserves . i initially confused this movies unexpected lack acceptance public , however after pondering complexities this failure some time i come following conclusion . it all aragorn fault . yes , that correct , it aragorn fault . here reasons why i believe this true . `hidalgo ' viggo mortensen first film following his co-starring role massive unbelievably successful three film production `the lord rings . ' his long matted hair , scruffy beard moustache those distant , piercing eyes forever imprinted into collective unconscious every moviegoer . shock seeing viggo frank . hopkins , american cowboy funny hat bandana , much shorter cropped hair , clean shaven riding little spotted mustang simply too much ' faithful ' handle . viggo fan base simply wasn't ready give up image king middle-earth yet . unable accept new look , people stayed away theaters thus turning disney expected big drawing card into major strategic error . put it plan simple , `hidalgo ' came out too soon . if you're finally willing move beyond aragorn persona see fast moving , well acted , beautifully shot film inspiring story tell i invite you give `hidalgo ' viewing . viggo perfect half indian , half white man who rides little pinto never gives up omar sharif delivers his best performance since `lawrence arabia ' . he alert , witty absolutely delightful sometimes harsh , sometimes whimsical sheikh riyadh who likes sit his tent read tales american wild west . it obvious he really enjoyed playing this part . also excellent performances zuleikha robinson jazira , adoni maropis sakr whole cast exotic , fascinating characters participating torturous 3,000 mile desert horse race across " ocean fire " . highly recommended	1

update : whv currently ( finally ! ) preparing special edition dvd this title , but there no word yet which version - heavily truncated r-rated us version , longer , but still incomplete , uk theatrical version , or russell recently surfaced ( amazing ) full length cut . there also no information whether or not whv plans release this correct aspect ratio 2.35 : 1 , or if they going crop it 16x9 call " widescreen . " i tried update this review number times changes haven't appeared - i don't know why . i am guessing amazon takes issue contact url warner i trying post here . go message boards ' devils ' imdb.com url . ' devils ' outstanding film arguably represents very finest work both ken russell oliver reed . unfortunately , it currently dvd limbo . warner vhs grainy , heavily cut very poorly cropped abomination times incomprehensible gives no indication tremendous achievement represented film art direction cinematography . recently completely uncut print this masterpiece surfaced excellent condition . warner executives attended screening . so why there no dvd works ? here story , best i able find out : first all , there no way hell uncut version ' devils ' could get rating mpaa . i seen some " lost " footage , , believe me ; it could never , ever happen - even though this stuff allowed air bbc tv part their " forbidden weekend " film series . so why not release it nc17 ? evidently warner home video not release anything stronger than . ( they not this policy back when they selling " uncut international version " ' dressed kill ' vhs years years - complete crotch shots , throat slashings explicit verbal references trimmed theatrical release us . ) it also seems they won't sublicense their titles - which would allow somebody like criterion handle release . my understanding they only consider outright sale - which i imagine prohibitively expensive . other film i fear suffer these policies nicholas roeg donald cammell ' performance ' - which i also believe might cut , but may easier time getting passed if re-submitted . ( i know it subject studio interference . ) if you care , warner home video moved past consumer outcry - although case cropped versus letterboxed special edition ' willie wonka chocolate factory . ' ' devils , ' virtually no chance getting into blockbuster ( even its rated incarnation ) , likely much tougher sell . if you just can't wait until hell freezes over , there reasonably priced bootleg dvd available - far more complete than this tape , better looking ( not pristine longshot , but big improvement ) , partially letterboxed , some excellent supplementary materials ( bbc ' hell earth ' documentary , containing most censored footage ) . obviously not ideal way see this movie , but it leaves this tape dust .

i pleasure this movie . i just graduated highschool . i didn't really know anything . not kent state , not movie making . my eyes opened both . one realize , this docu-drama , not documentary . liberties taken present story . i wasn't kent so i can't say what , if any , liberties taken . however , i tell you looking photos kent state campus gadsden state junior college , two campuses similar . since kent state officials would not let them film there , i think they excellent job recreating campus . also remember , no one ever convicted or even charged anything happened day . no one really knows what happened . this movie based piecing together all eyewitness accounts . scenes which i took part during final bloody confrontation . i tell you what , emotions ran high during filming those scences . we may not kent 10 years earlier , but it sure feel like it . it truly experience lifetime . however , we all walked away alive , unlike those 4 young souls who cut down seemingly random . this movie depicts time our history we should never forget .... never let happen again .	1

my first glimpse errol morris ' work ( thin blue line ) undergraduate history seminar examining role ( subsequent fallacy ) human memory historical discourse . while " thin blue line " examined singular texas murder , morris ' " fog war " larger footprint since it probes extremely sharp cognizant 80+ year old mcnamara his position united states war policy over thirty year span . world war ii vietnam obviously provide lot ground cover documentary , but " larger footprint " morris ' film rests controversial nature mcnamara public mind versus historical record . short , mcnamara bears some responsibility ( perhaps lingering guilt ) his recommendations wwii bombing vietnam policy . vietnam war not his action alone , however ; he part national security apparatus submitting recommendations only man who could act : president united states . accordingly , mcnamara bears partial responsibility but he well aware popular desire his complete contrition . yet , he now bears sole burden these group actions because he face vietnam policy two presidents he one few presidential advisors still alive kennedy/johnson era ( well wwii bombing decisions ) . mcnamara certainly aware his position well fact certain portions american public want criminal confession man . " public pitfall " mind , mcnamara explanations answers morris ' questions appear scheming duplicitous , but those answers simply place decisions policy their proper historical framework . one point film , morris ' essentially asks mcnamara who responsible vietnam decisions mcnamara quickly replies , " president " . audience ( or least , i ) wanted mcnamara answer , " it my decision " - such - may view president response cop-out . however , mcnamara absolutely correct ; decision action rested commander-in-chief his name never robert strange mcnamara . audience perspective , it nothing short compelling watch man justify unpopular actions while dodging undue burden responsibility respecting ( i.e. , not damning ) two presidents he served loved . personally , i relished personal insights morris captured ( or mcnamara permitted himself show ? ) . these poignant glimpses ranged mcnamara tearful story surveying arlington national cemetery kennedy eventual burial plot fleeting family health references confronting mcnamara family during secretary defense years . my favorite insight into mcnamara soul comes during retelling young quaker who set himself fire below mcnamara office mere moments after handing his baby daughter pleading bystander . while story well known , mcnamara pays respect widow subsequent explanation appears kept tabs daughter . i am still not sure what make insight dozens others , but those personal glimpses underlying force film . terms filmmaking , some reviews blasted morris ' technique off camera unmiked , his use glass soundtrack , or his reliance public domain stock footage planes , bombing , or protests . many respects , they right : either you love morris ' methods or they grate you . editing cuts choppy , but it unclear how much dramatic effect or if original interviews went back forth over same material . if you enjoy bombastic michael moore-type figure guiding audience through series contrived events peppered sarcastic puerile rhetoric , then " fog war " may not documentary you worth local rental . other hand , if you enjoyed morris ' earlier " thin blue line " or barbara kopple " harlan county , usa " " american dream " , then you want buy this dvd theatrical release , deleted scenes , mcnamara own rules .	1
this movie gave us brat pack , staple certain 80s cultural set . term brat pack derived article writen journalist out one night most men starring st. elmo fire boozy night partying . since then gals movie well few others who weren't movie ( anthony michael hall , example ) suffered bit ripple effect . here we see all them their prime their peak heart throb success every teenage girl bedroom wall . out all dramedies john hughes movies , this one i liked least . maybe it fact all characters so vain self centered . maybe it fact it all so idealized seeing all them trying adjust their lives after graduating college . it trying next generation " graduate " movie , i didn't relate when my time came . maybe it fact i let down many people didn't network friends similar situations , isolation i felt during first year adjusting outside world left nest academia . i guess i just little more bitter . plus , my life surrounded work little else , i didn't all dramas going they . kind sad , one scene where rob lowe goes back his old frat house they tell him they need someone like him couch their team . it proves you really can't go home again there some clinging past . not mention embarrassing one gal who managed hold onto her virginity so long one attempts releive her it rob lowe finds those enormous granny panties . this caputed more time fashion music than it mindset . it not bad story , but vain self centered antics main characters left me cold .	1

enjoyed lost translation , i thought i might like this one , which seems some sort cult reputation -- why i can't fathom . entire plot self-serving , shallow , unrealistic . i guess it supposed depict horror repressive religious values , while i don't condone those , film lacks clear characters or any motivation . lot people buttoned up parents who don't get it , it doesn't mean they kill themselves -- because they grounded !? since writer-director gerw up hollywood , she may not aware you can't keep your kid home school without very good reason -- social workers what not come after you . so entire premise false . romanticizing mass suicide bunch soft focus young blondes it -- after which they supposedly ascend erotic eternity imaginations their boyish peers -- could actually encourage act . it not caring , not real , not responsible . but i guess wouldn't bother rich , overfunded daughter hollywood genius out make name herself .	-1
i am neither fan nor detractor john wayne , but it true many his movies i trouble finishing -- they just don't capture my interest very well . this movie exception . i find myself watching this one repeatedly . i understand marine corps some misgivings their story told b-movie studio ( republic ) , but i think this film brings studio great credit . wayne nominated best actor this film , restrospect , i think he should won ( jose ferrer won year ) . this movie quite satisfactory subplots , more than passable acting , some nice crisp , intelligent dialog places , some characterizations evoke interest sympathy audience . scene where stryker ( wayne ) visits apartment woman he meets bar particularly edifying . this surprisingly good movie , it wearing well over years . i hate nitpick , but there error or two these pages concerning historical accuracy this film -- which also surprisingly good ; it clear film makers careful they could . landing craft tarawa film lvts ( landing vehicle , tracked ) , this correct first wave . planners assault knew these would important surmount reef , but their numbers limited , so ensuing waves used lcvps which could not cross reef , these troops who slaughtered while wading . also , movie correctly portrays marines training this assault stationed new zealand . furthermore , actual ascent suribachi indeed relatively easy after five or so tortuous days preparation -- but most carnage lay ahead ; battle just getting warmed up . 15% usmc combat fatalities 1776 through gulf war ( 1991 ) occured iwo jima . this movie succeeds very nicely tell important war story without unnecessary violence , some touching love relationships without lewdness . ex-marine , pretty serious student pacific war , i like this movie	1

bite this movie comes its near-perfect insight into what high school , overachievers , bored teachers , society , competitive people , politics , marriages mired ennui all . it smart , it incredibly funny , it gets most out very good cast . election , set 1990 school outside omaha , tells story frightening human dynamo , senior who wishes cap off her near-perfect career high school elected student counsel presidency . played reese witherspoon , tracy flick ( whose last name spelled several times movie all capital letters --- " flick " --- looks suggestively like word ) sees office next logical step her sociopathic upward climb toward full scholarship georgetown . tracy single-mindedness borders mental illness , ruthlessness powered vicious drive times seems genuinely scary behold . this uber-overachiever top honor roll years , headed number extracurricular clubs , editor school yearbook ... you name it . she also destroyed life reputation teacher who grew carelessly fond her , before election she does-in , here played matthew broderick . broderick social sciences teacher , mr. mcallister , senses destructive force tracy let loose post-high school society might become , he makes it his mission sabotage her bid become class president . first mcallister convinces school dopey star athlete , played chris klein , oppose tracy election , later mcallister crosses line uses his position head election committee make certain tracy loses . meltdowns occur several key characters election times played off funny but more than once makers this movie courageous enough let them disturbing , particularly scene where tracy , believing outcome election not her favor , breaks down emotionally , revealing insecure , needy figure beneath her extroverted exterior . election comedy its smartest . writing polished , delivery these stunningly perfect lines flawless , humor mixes cerebral parody times fun version crudity . it one best dark comedies all time	1

many say books always far better then movies . i agree this . i read whole entire series ; anne green gables rilla ingleside . i devoured every single one , enjoyed all characters sad when i finished reading them . but i say movie very , very good ! megan follows superb job portraying anne , jonathan crombie so good gilbert . every single actor beautiful job made their personalities come alive . i heard myself say , " they shouldnt made movie book , they ruined everything doing so . " but when i watch anne green gables , i say this differen t.t hey only brought more story different way . anne avonlea continuation story , i loved one just much . i say though , anne green gables continuing story disapointed me very much . they changed plot , characters still what you loved but joy you usually felt when you watched first two isn't felt when you watch this one . it so different book it made me mad . part i like it though , when anne gilbert get married , its bittersweet yet lovely part movie . end when anne finally finds gilbert , its beautiful moment too . so my opinion this : buy anne green gables , anne avonlea , story told beautiful way . but only rent anne green gables continuing story , don't buy it	1

it stars reese witherspoon kiefer sutherland , number other notable actors pitching their notable talents such : dan hedaya , brooke shields , brittany murphy , oh , you can't forget brief , but sincere performance bokeem woodbine . movie ! it uses story structure little red riding hood changes wolf into real man this movie who just so happens also rapist , murderer pedophile . you tell story now become quite adult it telling not kids rating would let you know . title my review ! yes , this artsploitation movie meaning it actually artistic goals it obviously some dirtier ones well , but what makes most film compelling performance reese witherspoon who makes films highs lows poignant even when they're outlandishly warped humorous dark way . there times when film fails its attempts going too much , other times it hits hard accurately . this not perfect , or consistent film , but it entertaining very askewed way . when this film supposed released united states company made it balked putting it theatres thinking it wouldn't find audience , which may true because its outlandishness , however , it wasn't given chance . it very short one or two week run one theatre rushed video . even roger ebert chicago sun-times surprised corporate decision since he felt witherspoon performance this film one breakout performances year . well , you can't keep good woman down she broke through movie continues good work , but i don't she'll able top this movie because roles she taking now based her star power mainstream vehicles . she supporting kids now i don't think she latitude , or time accept these roles far more marginal appeal risky , but i'm glad she made this film strange way i'm glad film didn't make money box office so i could purchase it $5 best buy surprised how good it . if you easily offended person good taste film , don't watch movie , if you're mainstream person seeking out reese films , don't watch it . if you're casual film watcher looking feel good film , don't watch it . if you're person who likes dark humor doesn't mind movie takes big chances its action and/or you like see every single movie movie star see if they always so ... streamlined , than this film you	1

godfather trilogy needs no introduction . godfather , released 1972 based mario puzo novel ( one time bestselling novel all time ) , considered many greatest film all time . it directed co-written young francis ford coppola , who absolutely outstanding job . gordon willis ' unflinching beautiful cinematography superb , while nino rota sweeping score unforgettable . cast magnificent . marlon brando , his signature role wheezy-voiced don vito corleone , marvelous , al pacino his youngest son , michael corleone . michael vowed never get involved family business , but attempted murder his father forces him take action . james caan also excellent ho t-t empered sonny corleone . one most debated questions amongst movie buffs which better - godfather part i or godfather : part ii ? though many say godfather superior , just many argue godfather : part ii best . either way , it equally impressive film that even more epic than its predecessor . 3/5 film follows michael corleone rule don 1958 ; other 2/5 follow young vito corleone ( robert de niro ) arrival new york city early-1900s his uprising mob boss . de niro excellent ; he won best supporting actor oscar his role . pacino performance extraodinary , highlight his career . cinematography , script directing flawless ever , nino rota score even more grandiose than before . godfather : part iii one most controversial films ever made . normal film , it very good ; however , godfather film , it quite weak . film begins 1979 , where aging michael corleone finally ceased his involvement mob enjoying reputation philanthropist . victor mancini ( andy garcia ) , illegitimate son michael deceased brother sonny , comes michael seeking job , soon after mob war ensues , pulling michael back world mafia . film lacks power feeling first two films ; it just doesn't feel like godfather movie . it made money because francis ford coppola zoetrope studios going bankrupt ; it not made because it needed made . film biggest flaws sofia coppola michael daughter ; director , she quite talented , but actress , she not so talented , woefully miscast . i would recommend seeing film if only quell your curiosity , because it truly fantastic ending . godfather godfather : part iii 1-disc sets ; godfather : part ii 2-disc set . each film remastered beautiful anamorphic widescreen excellent dolby digital 5.1 surround sound . they packaged gorgeous , dark thin packaging , each features full-length commentary director coppola . exclusive this set disc bonus material running over three hours , including deleted scenes ( footage tv versions ) , alternate scenes , behind-the-scenes footage , corleone family tree . bonus disc knock socks off godfather fans . if you haven't seen these films - you no clue what you're missing . i would recommend you drop what you're doing go out purchase this set right now . first two films probably best ever made , third good well . reasonably low price this set sells , it offer you can't refuse	1

it hard know where begin this one . movie immaculately filmed one greatest directors all time , given just most perfect presentation i've ever seen dvd . i guess i'll start print : it magnificent , beautiful , golden colors , sharp focus , barely speck dust film . one would expect kurosawa film , composition feast eyes , beautiful formal balances coming most mundane elements shot . ( george lucas very influenced kurosawa many ways , but this sort beautiful , balanced composition one thing he never mastered . ) then there score . most people might not immediately think score when discussing kurosawa film , but i struck here how powerful distinctive it , while same time it never gets way film . then there sets : simple , yet used maximum effect . this not big budget film hollywood standards ( though it most expensive japanese film up time ) , but it feels far more epic than any recent , very expensive star wars " prequels , " which just goes show it takes more make epic than just money . kurosawa reportedly only used something like 200 horsemen , yet you'll think you're seeing far more . then there cast . tatsuya nakadai , lord ichimonji , manages perfectly portray man going man who both frightening his stubbornness sympathetic his pathos same time . not easy job , especially under ton makeup made him look far older than he . three sons , played akira terao , jinpachi nezu especially daisuke ryu ( insightful loyal saburo ) distinctive well-developed . androgynous peter ( first name billed only ) kyoami memorable his flamboyant , almost drag-queen gyrations taunting aging , increasingly senile warlord insights into his predicament . yet standout performance , one i always remember , stunning mieko harada lady kaede . while ran supposedly loose retelling king lear , kaede more lady macbeth than anything else . she two very memorable scenes both involve severed heads . while screenplay riffs lear , it also makes some notable changes . three daughters replaced three sons . this " lear " goes mad not because daughter love but because , apparently , weight wars fought past . young lord very odds image we see beginning film , man wishing make peace his demons . we discover through backstory he killed , kidnapped waged much violence bring together his kingdom , yet now he just wants peace goodwill . i thinking adage what goes around comes around , wondered if hidetora himself ever came this realization . it what he thinking he emerged burning castle after tremendous battle , dazed , wordless ? scene , shot without ambient sound but haunting score ( composed toru takemitsu ) , must go down one greatest moments film , example how cinema used way no other art form . bonus features both bountiful meaningful . first there full-length commentary film scholar stephen prince , though i confess i've not yet listened it . director sidney lumet gives brief appreciation kurosawa ran . he likens film late beethoven quartets or seventh symphony . such comparisons often come off glib or meaningless , but this actually struck chord me . i indeed think comparison ran energies seventh apt , introspection reminds me late quartets , particularly op . 132 . second disc , we a.k. , 75 minute documentary kurosawa life . ( case you've seen recent pbs documentary kurosawa , this one different . ) then comes half hour film making ran , which shows what grueling shoot it must , going every day base mount fuji often working there even night . finally there 35-minute video piece exploring costumes ran , well new video interview tatsuya nakadai ( lord hidetora ) . there also color booklet interviews kurosawa composer takemitsu . short , there enough supplementary materials here keep any fan movie or director happy weeks . many criterion releases defined what dvds , but this title just takes cake . what more could one ask , short summoning kurosawa beyond talk film ? even if you own ran one its other video versions , they all vastly inferior this release . if you've never seen film , or any work akira kurosawa , this probably best place you could start . highly highly recommended	1

" vendetta " interesting movie won't allow you remain indifferent . love or hate it , i'm pretty sure you opinion this polemic film , based comic written alan moore , adapted big screen wachowski brothers , directed james mcteigue . story begins england , but not england we know . mcteigue england eerily similar country orwell tells us " 1984 " . there dictator , chancellor adam sutler ( john hurt ) , chosen free elections , but afterwards decided become absolute ruler , exerting power without any kind restriction . citizens nothing , they relinquished their right participate decide , merely sheep told what what think . their freedom curtailed , but they feel safe . however someone prepared shake their certitude , make them realize things not what they seem . person ( hugo weaving ) , man willing risk everything order turn meek sheep into citizens , wreak havoc enemies destroyed his life long time ago . evey ( natalie portman ) , young woman rescues sutler minions , privileged spectator v plans , first person become fervent follower . path , though , not easy , evey new strenght forged fires prison . this highly controversial movie delves upon difficult subjects , example whether end validates means , power words . all same , " vendetta " makes you think , great actors , original cinematography hectic pace . my point view , this film simply must see . belen alca	1
i went into this dvd low expectations wound up really enjoying it . maybe " enjoy " isn't right word , it intense , it political ( i usually am opposite side hollywood politics)and it jumps around subplot subplot . fact , i dozed off 10 minutes got entirely lost rewind fill blanks . but i found it very plausible . what good movie should do- give plausible thesis play it out . it succeeds here . it makes us think laws unintended consequence . sure , it makes gov't big oil look inherently evil characaturizes them , but usually makes good starting point , since most large organizations usually succumb fear and/or greed anyway . i once heard history professor say " it isn't struggle good vs evil , it always struggle good vs good .... both sides always think they right god their side " ..... watch it , you come out other side thinking .	1

15 minutes horrifying gritty peek into injustice american legal system also news media . wow , two digs one film , how you resist ? emil slovak , czech national ( played karel rodan ) , his friend oleg razgul , russian national ( played oleg taktarov ) , who met prague , decide travel america , land opportunity . emil wants hunt down his old crime partner , who took all money robbery he jailed , but oleg infatuated american cinema wants filmmaker . immediately upon arriving , oleg steals video camera store they off confront emil old partner get their money back . but while oleg films event , emil discovers his portion money already spent , he kills his friend friend wife . unfortunately , there someone else watching murder . daphne handlova staying her friends , fled apartment after witnessing murders . illegal alien herself , she not want police or killers find her , but leaves her purse behind apartment where emil discovers who she . apartment burned cover bodies , " bohemian barbeque " says oleg , which calls not only successful homicide detective eddie flemming ( robert de niro ) , but fire marshal jordy warsaw ( edward burns ) scene . emil oleg get away , but while emil obsesses finding daphne , oleg obsesses filming their " trip america " , killings all . he believes he making greatest movie ever . they begin watch new york hot exploitive news show called " top story " , anchored shady newsman/reporter robert hawkins ( played expertly kelsey grammer ) . these three men , flemming , warsaw , hawkins , become irresistible targets emil oleg , two eastern-european psychopaths believing controlling taunting these famous men give them recognition they desire . i don't want give away too much plot , but suffice say there brutal murder scene where flemming showcases just how tough cop he , hawkins reveal himself slimiest snake media industry , emil learn enough know insanity set him free even if he caugh t.t here action beginning end this movie , tight somewhat confusing plot times , some great acting both stars supporting cast ( including great character played david alan grier ) . there seediness wretchedness hopelessness , ending makes film come together quite nicely . if you ready little brutal cop action your life , give 15 minutes try . enjoy !	1

{ spoilers }: " if i let you go ... you think you could fly ? " this what i think special quote when i watched theatrical trailer my dvd " good son " it very interesting opposite turn macaulay culkin career " home alone " movies this where he plays murderer named henry . this really worth watching if you've never seen it if you like thrillers . mark evans { elijah wood } goes live his aunt uncle his cousin henry after his mother dies his father goes away business trip . when mark first meets henry , they great friends . their friendship goes too far when henry soon becomes evil mark only one who sees truth his cousin after he kills dog crossbow henry wants mark fun his own way when henry throws his dummy mr. highway onto crowded highway causes pileup , while henry tries kill his sister several times . later , mark keeps trying convince henry mother susan { wendy crewson } henry murderous she doesn't believe him , so mark left confront henry before anything worse happen . i usually don't watch thrillers , but this cool . i thought it worth seeing see macaulay culkin psychotic acting it worth 4 half stars because it starts out little slow , but when henry friendly behavior changes , it worth all rest it worth .	1

movie itself ok , especially freddie bartholomew ' acting . but spencer tracy gave horrible performance . i sure hope he didn't win any awards this . he doesn't even come close portugese accent , or any other kind accent matter . spencer tracy take portugeese accent talk broken english . like they used portray indian old westerns . it comes off more some sort mentally deficient person speaking broken english , such ' manuel no like you . wish you not here ' . it got worst accent history film making . then there lack realism . half time there no one steering ship . real life , someone would helm 24 hours day . this ship , no one steers night . when ship racing back port end movie , distant shots it pounding through heavy 10 foot sea . but when they close actors , deck isn't moving all . they just stand there if ship floating pond . end movie , when spencer tracy character cut half below waist . he not even pain . he survives water least 5 minutes nothing but torso head . this what really spoiled movie . only saving grace freddie batrholomew portrayal harvey	1
i admit this movie slow strange . hence minus 1 star . but me , this just me , i able pay attention because gary oldman , who my all time #1 favorite actor . he such chameleon , seeing how he usually graces screen bad guy some way , shape , or form ( or just eccentric or crazy lol ) , he just brilliantly funny this . it interesting b/c gary character ' rosencrantz ' ( not guildenstern lol ) ' slow ' fella but he imaginative inventive , but philosophical once he gets grasp what you're talking . then top it all off , you're thrust into hamlet , but perspective . so you gotta get into shakespearian linguo , which i haven't fully since 12th grade , 6 years ago . fortunately , ros guild hardly talk such strange manner or thickly other regular hamlet characters . it just worded strangely b/c it like they're poets . chemistry roth oldman wonderful , extra interviews dreyfus , oldman , roth , stoppard himself . then they also photo gallery . that it , but me it enough hear oldman talk 58 minutes ! :) ( they're interviewed separately . ) dvd i got came 2 discs , i suppose this only release dvd so far so they all 2 disc ? quality very good . :) if you're big fan gary , i highly recommend this flick . very amusing , interesting , good shakespearian fun :	1

i picked up book yardsale without knowing much it , absolutely loved it ! it so smart , funny , heartbreaking , without ever sappy . so , naturally , i curious movie too . i figured because ephron written screenplay too , not much could go wrong . while story line followed book more or less , movie turned out terrible . i could not more disappointed !! first all , jack nicholson completely miscast , because he essentially plays himself ( usual ) , not * interesting * guy mark supposed . he opposite charming , funny , tender , lovable , i.e. somebody character wife ( rachel ) would fall so deeply love trust so completely . you suspect all he cad ; therefore , rachel utter shock his betrayal doesn't make sense . besides , he too old role ! meryl streep annoyingly twitchy , but much better her role rachel . still , she can't carry movie alone , her love scenes nicholson flat ; there no spark there . i wonder how happy ephron movie adaptation her novel , whether she really write all scenes . wedding scene , where rachel doubts marying mark spends what feels like 5 hours room alone agonizing , while wedding guests wait , out place , not mention boring , not mention heavy handed . total dud	1
i really impressed this film i must congratulate hollywood presenting soviet war machine such realistic way . direction fine , actors well chosen , script very good harrison ford acting top quality . i think this film superior older ones like " hunt red october " or " crimson tide " whose story rather flat predictable . key advantage film intense psychological charging crew attempts cool damaged reactor marvellous portrait traditional russian self-sacrifice	1
it difficult review this film without spoilers , but i'll give it try . first all i think previous marketing campaign damaged film . public went theaters expecting see ghoulish bloody picture . well ... that not case . this mean it poorly or boring film ? not all . it good ( if not exceptional ) thriller . good acting , good cinematography interesting plot . you may really enjoy it , if you not expect what marketing promising . well now , storyline occurs small village surrounded dark menacing wood . villagers some strange taboos example red color . not even flowers this color allowed grow . one no one allowed enter woods ; they strictly off-limits due agreement elders village outside creatures : each community should stick their own boundaries . moment film starts this agreement endangered villagers scared what may happen them . this point good suspense story evolves keeping viewer wondering what all . acting one high points film . bryce dallas howard ivy blind girl gives very convincing performance . mimicking blind person convincingly not easy task she complies cum laudae . adrien brody retarded youngster great . william hurt sigourney weaver give solid acting pieces . director . night shyamalan conducts film sure hand , even if it not same height " sixth sense " ( his best film far ) . final word : good thriller if you seat see it without prejudice . reviewed max yofre .	1
okay , script not most imaginative i've ever seen , but i like actors ( especially ben best man ) so i friendly this movie most part . i didn't even mind obvious holes plot , such ... why these characters not credit cards or cell phones ? or least , why don't they use them ? oh no , much more plausible ben strip dance gay bar $150 buy car drive nc . i didn't even mind fact whole " we're married my husband doctor . " charade so predictable . oh gee , he pretending doctor he tour bus bunch elderly people . d'ya think someone might heart attack " dr. holmes " might step up ? uh , they're pretending married oh ! surprise there best man maid honor ! d'ya think they're gonna get busted ? what killed it me ridiculous ending . it obviously supposed surprise ( it ) but there seemed no other reason it than pull fast one audience . i felt cheated . i spent entire movie getting emotionally involved relationship sarah ben , i really cared how they would handle things fiance sarah little boy all . i cheerfully became disengaged relationship ben bridget , i totally believed neither one them ready get married or right each other . film spent inordinate amount time showing me they're not right each other this wedding not meant happen . right up last moment , we think he breaking it off bridget . instead , what heck let just go ahead get married after all . huh ? he left sarah sitting out there waiting him hurricane !!! after making her promise she would still there when he got back . this man obviously doesn't clue what he wants life , i'm expected believe they lived happily ever after ? not only , but what it teach us taking this commitment seriously ? it teaches us if our instinct telling us " don't it ! " our genitals yearning someone else even mother nature seems working hard prevent this marriage , aw heck go ahead it anyway . it just marriage . it romantic ! you could get lucky live happily ever after!it my experience , when things aren't feeling just right you approach wedding , turn run . last thing you should close your eyes , grab your balls take leap	-1
" logan run " great nostalgic 1970s science fiction . 70s great era sci-fi , where future viewed optimism , awe wonder , unlike digital-age , cookie-cutter sci-fi we get today , offers nothing but gloom doom . i just little kid when " logan run " first released , but i remember blown away it premise -- futuristic society young people living inside futuristic domed-city , where you're not allowed live past age 30 . there really no where runners ( those who refuse end their lives 30 voluntarily ) go elude sandmen ( city police ) , outside domed-city post-apocalyptic , laid ruins earth outside-somewhere near old city washington . .. michael york plays logan 5 , one sandmen who turns out more heart than city would probably prefer . richard jordan ( francis 7 ) his fellow sandman/friend who fiercely loyal city status quo , begins doubts logan loyalty this status quo after he finds logan hanging around nursery . reason all this you'll find out when you watch movie . i actually wish they shown more domed-city than they . it really cool-looking structure , fascinating sci-fi concept . but you see exterior aerial visual-effects shots city movie opening , then few glimpses afterward , but after opening shots , movie quickly gets story surrounding characters , lot scenes take place sets scenes location . like redressed shopping malls , because indoor malls new 70 , people still fascinated these indoor shopping arenas , so it made sense redress one these new malls represent interior futuristic city . but miniatures built exterior aerial shots domed-city really cool look . some people , probably younger people who grew up this cgi age , ridicule film city looking fake like model . yeah , if you squint , you makes out few imperfections , but so what ? minatures look spectacular their time . but all dated aspects this film what makes it all more interesting . imperfection more interesting than perfection anyway . but " logan run " one last sci-fi epics . those stand-alone films like grand mgm stamp them . everything today so cookie-cutter bland , production companies you've never heard putting out direc t-t o-dvd caliber movies faster than bic corporation putting out pens . it just not same anymore . but definately purchase " logan run " dvd . it even better viewing it widescreen , it shown theaters	1

i think it kind poetic i ended up getting film adaption ray bradbury " fahrenheit 451 " . it because i couldn't find book anywhere ! i don't know how good it adaption , but i found film thought provoking , well directed clever . film set world where books banned burnt . nothing read , except numbers top bottles pills sedatives people this age often take . books contradicting ideas , book burning " firemen " claim . they make people unhappy sometimes , they change people . authors raised high world literature , if they more than people around them . happier society , where everyone equal , books must destroyed , they say . montag fireman , talented one due promotion . he wife , he large television set wall ( though most people this world two ) , he considers himself pretty happy guy . young woman approaches him monorail home , seen him around so long trip home she felt she should say hello . she asks his job , wonders if he ever read any books he burnt . it gets him thinking , he ends up reading copy david copperfield charles dickens due torched . like firemen say , it changes his life , suddenly this happy society seems little more sinister than before ... i think it film flows really well , couple nice directorial quirks , british 1960s feel it sets , landscapes colour schemes , which i always like . it kind strange it english film , since ray bradbury , author book american . ah well . there lot ideas toyed here , nature memory , knowledge , oral traditions , control . lot think . definitely worth look sci-fi fans , i think	1

this film truly epic experience , type film one doesn't see too much anymore these days . based autobiographical novel stefanie zweig , it concerns redlich family , one lucky few families leave nazi germany before it too late . walter , father , saw writing wall left kenya 1937 , sending his wife jettel daughter regina six months later , 1938 . normally one doesn't think refugees nazis escaping anyplace africa , particularly not kenya , although there actually fairly substantial jewish community nairobi time wwii broke out , other refugees , such redlichs , living more isolated less-developed areas nation . jettel bit jewish german princess beginning film , very hard time adjusting life kenya . she believes living farm rongai temporary , so unaware reality waiting her she brought her fine china bought evening gown instead something more practical like refrigerator before she left home . her character proves most interesting , one who goes through most development , becoming very different person end film . walter , contrast , sea change attitude opposite direction , wants return germany after war instead staying kenya , which become like home his family saved their lives . they also deal their troubled marriage ; they'd apparently begun some problems before they left germany , but their marriage really put test kenya , particularly while walter away british army four years jettel left tend farm . young regina also fascinating character ; so young , she adjusts quickly life kenya , although , like her parents , doesn't ever really fully come think it home . she number different cultures deal -- german culture she left behind one she connection via her parents , native kenyan culture swahili language , british culture colonial school she attends . ( though most this film shows us kenya through eyes people living far away so-called civilisation , this still time when most africa under colonial rule , much different africa than it today . ) her relationship owuor , native who acts servant her family , incredibly moving touching , one finest aspects this film . unlike her mother , she never any hesitation or resistance befriending natives . she doesn't care their skin dark hers light ; they're just other children she fun who like her , same way she instantly takes owuor , seeing him kind man who warmly welcomes her kenya . surface this historical film , but true themes nature home , alienation , self-discovery , finding oneself , loss , how sometimes least likely place become refuge come feel almost like home over time . what meaning word home , refugee or immigrant ever really completely feel home foreign land , these people ever really feel home anywhere again , whether they remain kenya , return germany , or start new life entirely new place ? it also nice change pace see wwii-era film set africa , see how war affected native peoples , dominating british colonialists , refugees like redlichs . soundtrack also incredibly gorgeous , natural scenery . there also wealth bonus features . audio commentary top-notch , revealing such interesting facts how walter voice actually popular actor herbert knaup but two undubbed scenes ( one which conducted entirely english ) , because it felt merab ninidze , true actor , too strong georgian accent , silas kereti , who plays regina friend jogona young adult , initially very hesitant performing one tribal ceremonies film because it tribe , he thought taking part would mean he becoming member this other tribe . other extras deleted scenes ( optional commentary ); making-of featurette ; interviews merab ninidze , juliane k�hler ( jettel ) , matthias habich ( walter s�sskind , character who immigrated kenya before redlichs ) , sidide onyulu ( owuor ) , caroline link ( director ) , peter herrmann ( producer ) , stefanie zweig ; score selections ; storyboard comparison locust scene ; trailers ; photo montage commentary . almost two half hours long ( three hours long originally ) , this truly epic picture , real emotional powerhouse . all characters developed so well acted so masterfully one grows feel though one actually knows them , gone this powerful life-changing journey them . it also not " just wwii movie , " since setting themes so very different usual ones . far just movie , this one makes viewer think feel instead just entertaining or delivering lot high-tech special effects . it shame more films hollywood aren't masterfully crafted this wonderful highly-recommended german film	1
this , unabashedly , my favorite pirate movie until " pirates carribean " series released . graham chapman so over top title character , rest cast ( save cheech chong ) pretty much who who british comedy scene early eighties . john cleese wonderful pew , peter boyle mr. moon funny well . i heartily recommend this anyone looking quick , brainless laugh	1
i loved this movie watch it whenever it tv . i refuse buy copy because somehow makes it less special than just happening it while channel surfing . i not particularly like dustin hoffman - he great actor but he just never quite it me . but i love him tootsie . actually , i differentiate tootsie michael dorsey . michael dorsey hoffman okay ; toosie he superlative . i make distinction because this only cross-dressing film where i totally buy into reality character . role tootsie part lifetime -and hoffman outstanding it . he us laughing , crying , cheering , even producing outrage . we sympathize his rejection jessica lange ( she not lesbian ) wait anxiously bill murray " you [ ... ] " response tootsie almost rape her plummy co-star soap opera . every actor this film perfect - cameos sydney pollack ( director ) michael dorsey agent terri garr confused desperate actress/girlfriend bill murray slightly spacy roommate . there dabney coleman charles durning jessica lange . best all - dustin hoffman tootsie , maybe even more than he michael dorsey .	1
this movie lot better than i thought it would . ending big surprise ! just see it yourself , you'll see why . not best military movie ever made , but definitely worth seeing . it also bit confusing , but i enjoyed it , so you	1

book amazing ; this movie adaptation quite poor . although actress who plays o quite beautiful , there some fairly erotic scenes , this movie deeply flawed , i can't recommend it . plotline gets totally garbled , especially toward end , point where it runs entirely contrary book intention several key philosophical psychological points . second , actor who plays stephen absolutely one worst casting choices i've ever seen ; doesn't fit role one bit . so please , read book . if you've already read book love it , it probably worth your while eventually see this film , but expect disappointed .	1

this classic flick every way ! it some not so great acting , little cheesyness here there , but all all it several scary moments . funniest thing me , tho , opening , zombie attacks then chases barbara moving pretty quickly , then when it shows him arrive house later , he slowly turns look other zombies , then he starts swaying moving really slowly stiffly ! it like he probably thought , " oh yea , i'm zombie , i guess i better stiffen up ! " try notice next time you watch this classic . i bet when this came out 1968 , it considered horrible shocking !	1

first i want make it very clear , while film it frightening moments this not horror movie any means if that what your looking then you should look elsewhere . said , storywise , plotwise actingwise , this hands down best supernatural film you ever see . placed capable hands writer/directer . night shayamalan who proved he force reckond well very capable hands actors bruce willis , toni colleti haley joel osment who well deserved oscar nod this film rises above it predesesors it reaches much more emotions than fear . it reaches your heart you watch this child deal his ' gift ' sorts well dr. crowe ( willis ) he deals distance him his wife . ending shocking they come deffinatly earns itself recognition shyamalans best script ( unbreakable good , village its points but signs complete mess ) i say i always found bruce impressive actor , but i felt he far too undertapped ... this performance prooves he more just na action star needs taken much more seriously ... i would liked him take home oscar nod this . film revolves around cole ( osment ) his ability see dead people . crowe ( willis ) child psyciatris who trying help cole come terms his gifts . it truly touching crowe helps cole find ways make ghost go away . this great film gives new perspective old idea ... other words this one started them all , this reinvention ghost story because major success this film we other gems like ' ring ' ' what lies beneath ' ..	1

it cliche , but most people who saw this movie just didn't get it . movie focuses ( further ) adventures buckaroo banzai , scientist , neurosurgeon , rocker , protector world . he his collection memorable characters around him , hard-rocking scientists adventurers known hong kong cavaliers . action dialogue characters camped up , eveyone good time harkening back serials old modern flavor . pay close attention , or you'll miss some fun movie ( example , droning background mental hospital lithium no longer available credit ) . no apparent reason , john litgow goes into cheesy italian accent free assocation word " home , " finishing beach boys quote : " i feel so broke up , i want go home . " jeff goldblum asks why there watermelon attached big , scary-looking machine . he promised he'll told later but course never . we're left smile wonder . course there classic lines such , " no matter where you go , there you , " perfect tommy coming defense mr. wizard top scientist . you never know when line coming . while performing neurosurgery , banzai says " no , don't tug . you never know what it might attached . " ellen barkin several fine moments perfect female lead . me , social message ( if there one ) came my son , who watched it me said " it really cool smart . " scientist also rock star action hero . banzai or one his adventurers all any kid could ever hope , movie just plain escapist fun people who get it . only sad part sequels prequels never materialized	1
i really don't know where begin . this film nearly perfect you get . every facet great filmmaking flawlessly displayed absolute perfection michelangelo antonioni , l'avventura . this one greatest motion pictures ever made . l'avventura all relationships . relationships main characters also territory they inhabit . needless say , topography plays important role this film thus becomes outside character itself . when viewing first time , pay special attention deliberate pacing film . it very bold lyrical its approach . motion pictures aren't made like this anymore you'll pleasantly surprised there very little intrusion or manipulation director . antonioni really lets this film breathe naturally ; nothing hurried or out place . this really perfect film . i won't talk anymore this landmark motion picture ; it would sacreligious ruin great experience you	1
one best movies i seen !!! subject itself forces you look your own limitations anything out your ' normal ' boundaries . after watching this movie , you better insight how limited most us how this causes lot more harm than we think it . terms film quality , it also one best i seen . actors tremendous , characters so accurately portrayed you actually feel pain each one them . course , ludovic innocence rendered beautifully , but changes mother goes through very emotionally charged ( maybe because i am mother myself ??? ) . she seems first most understanding all when it comes her son differences , then goes through confusion stage , then tries really hard understand him . but when her family whole life setting ( house , husband job , social life ) goes havoc , she closes down emotionally her own son which extremely painful watch . after one final emotionally violent confrontation ludovic , she realizes she loosing him finally sees him way it should : her beautiful child , nothing more , nothing less . it also filmed very colorful manner ( especially during ludovic escapes into dreamland ) , which accentuate notion ludovic innocence . neighborhood setting seems bit caricature american suburbia ( green front lawns , barbecue parties ) european flavor ( adults dancing neighborhood parties ) . any case , movie seems make clear statement intolerance seems most prominent middle-class white surburban populations , which many could find this bit stereotype . any case , i highly recommend this movie anyone who wants something more out movie than what presented mainstream movies .	1
i'm not going try get all characters names right yi yi . there lot characters , extended family various lovers children . taiwan modern , impressive city , place rarely seen american television or film . i might looking manhattan rather than taipei . computer engineer family , wife spiritual emptiness , teen daughter involved her first serious sexual activity , grandmother life support , eight-year old son teased exhaustion little girls , they live high-rise condominium over raised superhighway . then there ner-do-well brother-in-law , so superstitious he marries his pregnant wife only chinese lucky day . his old girlfriend shows up wedding raise hell . she returns babies chinese confirmation more same . fight breaks out , kicking little men screechy women . our engineer walked away young love , while wife monks , he renews relationship business trip tokyo . he love . so she , but , i can't tell you what happens without giving away this poignant part plot . engineer daughter rather unusual fling well . i've left out ton information this film close three hours long , but watch beautiful cinematography edward yang , his brilliant pacing . one thinks it real life .	1

" imagine " warm beautiful celebration john lennon life told his own words words those who loved him supported his mission . his idealism prominent , but so his charismatic personality comedic interchange media . john lennon art expands way beyond his poetic lyrics melodies we find him much more complex man than we may realized before . here he expresses his romantic side sketches we find displayed walls while he yoko luxuriate their newlywed bliss . later they shown way almost portrays more innocent side soul love ( gazing into each other eyes kissing all you truly see ) or love goes back beginning time . it if they remove outer trappings life put each other souls . john then shown embracing his role father balances his responsibilities all while maintaining fascinating powerful presence . john lennon beautiful heart reveals itself most poignantly moment where he explains his lyrics homeless man haunting blue eyes then asks : " you hungry ? " you could feel his concern those around him moments where he connects so deeply souls still searching their purpose . there also beautiful moment where john yoko build little cabin/playhouse out island . they row across walk into house . then camera pulls away , silence scene says more than any narration ever could . fan mania captured very effectively during footage his early days beatles , but true beauty appreciation his music seems evolve quiet sessions recording studio . footage this dvd seems more unique than most also shows concert roof combative conversations media who seemed truly not understand his dream . he spoke hearts those who tired chaos wanted peace world moving towards more kosmocentric awareness . what strikes me most beautiful aspect this deluxe edition uniqueness presentation how well story woven together create warm memory so alive john lennon presence , his music his life purpose .

film opens , we told this last decade cold war . there shot rather unimpressive explosion american library young spaniard throwing rock through window small ibm office . it seems odd note which begin romantic comedy , delivered un-scored , still-shots quickly falls background where , course , it subtly colors almost every other incident film . ted boynton , american sales rep chicago , working assignment barcelona , spain . his cousin , fred , naval lieutenant sent carry out advance work public relations before arrival 6th fleet , just arrived looking place stay . it uneasy arrangement ; they disputing caviling since childhood . continue so throughout film . they ruminators long memories who share very few opinions . when they meet marta monserrat , " cool trade fare girls , " there no statement , no thought , no act without commentary . so film largely composed scenes which ted fred philosophize love , beauty , business cultural differences they court-in tandem-marta monserrat . all this transpires fascinating , pretty little vignettes whose comedy gradually mounts mounts mounts until sinister spin background events overtake foregoing romantic sweep . how remarkable it we should pass -- only very few minutes -- comedy tragedy comedy , so grace majestic drama cloud momentarily passing before sun . great sweet beauty this film , however , marriage such engaging dialogue , such earnest deadpan deliveries shot such eerie clarity -- one reminiscent interiors dutch genre painting : clean , homely , homiletic . it kind professorial remove : there story followed commentary , then more story followed commentary . still shot followed people shot which followed still shot so ; but they coupled such fashion shot characters only real animation , only real action , only real drive-giving conversation otherwise missing dynamic . this rare feat modern american film . ordinarily , romantic comedies depend upon mishaps , mistakes misunderstandings , exaggerated out all proportion , all their narrative beats most their laughter . barcelona , however , physical climb fall drama entirely real , if not ordinary . dilation expansion fact reserved wit banter , voice-over commentaries emotionally savory resolve . all all , barcelona both beautiful funny . it manages turn suite classically static images-bronzed , burnished , melancholy-upon fast-driving dialogue endowed modest but enhancing artificiality painting , novel or -- better yet -- infinitely refined film	1

this one worst movies i've ever wasted my time watching ! don't dispose precious cent this movie unless you gigantic drew barrymore fan you merely viewing movie raw sex scenes constant , random nudity . storyline could worked , yet movie pathetically low budget , acting horrid movie falls desperately flat . it impossible like this movie unless you obsessively love drew barrymore you want watch her her lowest point . it so bad i come here vent it online . director obviously film school drop-out who offered actors free cocaine produces low budget porn .	-1
now obviously new rap music great american voices they put make it bad possible . but then again , movie certainly no gem it original language version , sure . whole movie above average action sequences , but story unbearable . not story itself , but execution it worst possible . it goes sickening moments almost little kid parts jet teh girl . just freaking horrible . so dvd full screened , music stupid , voice dubbing almost bad " jet li collection " movies , but you get few good points one or two good laughs , decent finale .	1

you either love movie or you don't . if you're vod lover , special edition 2-disk release worth every cent . film beautifully restored its " color de luxe " panavision widescreen glory . ( my vhs tape barge making its way staten island landfill i type this ) . second disk includes karioke renderings songs several documentaries featurettes ( all listed above ) . my favorite these " jacqueline susann valley dolls , " which generous film clips depicting chain-smoking failed-actress-cum-bestselling-author speaking herself coming across , more than anything , highly committed indefatigable professional writer ( who used different color typing paper each her six drafts manuscript ) . it easy see how this no-nonsense , get-it-done schlockmeister got under skin procratinating perfectionist celebrity syncophant truman capote . ( i surprised see no mention their long-standing public rivalry anywhere among dvd extras . ) missed opportunity among all extras commentary track disk one . it great barbara parkins ( although her memories seem grown rather dim over years ) . one would liked hear patty duke ( or even leigh grant ) well , though we only guess why fox wasn't able make happen . but commentary could greatly enriched if fox nixed use gossip columnist ted cassablanca ( who stole his nom de plume gay character novel ) engaged truly informed movie critic or film historian co-comment ms parkins . casablanca badgers parkins " dish " other actresses , sharon tate murder , judy garland walking out helen lawson role ; when he not badgering , he cooing her perfume or comparing notes her which actors film they each found " do-able . " ( parkins just closed her eyes during her love scenes thought singer cat stevens england . ) both parkins casablanca surprisingly ignorant basic facts film . i found myself frequently shouting tv screen , " watch disk two--it all explained there ! " among things i still don't understand : why so many people dimiss or discount hayward performance merman-inspired helen lawson ? hayward comes solidly out " women picture " tradition seems perfectly cast . her singing voice , supplied veteran big-band singer margaret whiting ( that mrs. jack wrangler you , ted casablanca ) , perfect match ( raw years backstage smoking ) . but , only explanation i come up ms garland fans so much wanted see her singing role they shun hayward performance out perverse loyalty garland . ( garland died two years after release vod , perhaps adding degree fierceness her fans ' loyalty . ) special edition dvd overemphasizes camp cult elements movie ( " bouncing ball " karioke rendering lawson " i'll plant my own tree " really red wig ends up cartoon toilet final sustained note song ) . such thing make fun viewing once . but movie , movie delicious treat lasts forever	1
perhaps first social injustice movies hollywood began turning out late forties , crossfire one few my opinion which still hold up . that because social message , against hate general anti-semitism particular , doesn't become too preachy get way story . unlike gentleman agreement ( anti-semitism ) , boomerang ( legal class injustice ) , pinky ( racial prejudice ) others , crossfire tells taut story first , this case murder , features some first-rate acting , especially robert ryan . murder mystery straightforward there little doubt who killer . we know man named samuels ( sam levene ) beaten death . we know suspect , corporal arthur mitchell ( george cooper ) one four recently discharged soldiers who met him bar . we know one four big , edgy guy , sergeant montgomery ( robert ryan ) , who laughs too much likes verbally poke people he thinks weak . body discovered , evidence points mitchell killer police captain finlay ( robert young ) goes work . one mitchell buddies , sergeant peter keeley ( robert mitchum ) doesn't think mitchell could killer . cautious way he starts working finlay establish alibi mitchell , then concentrate montgomery . one biggest issues what could montgomery motivation . it turns out montgomery doesn't like civilians , doesn't like " hillbillies , " hates jews . he bigot . when montgomery complains " those kinds guys " , finlay asks , " what kind guys ? " " you know kind . " montgomery says . " played it safe during war , keepin ' themselves civvies , nice apartments , swell dames ... you know kind . " " i'm not sure i . " " some ' em named samuels , some ' em funnier names . " it isn't long before we realize montgomery psychopath who hates just anyone who different . keeley help , finlay finally able lay clever trap montgomery . young fine job cop . he seen probably too much . he tired . he decent man who relies his training . " i've this job too long , " he tells keeley . " i go it only way i know how . i collect all facts possible ... most them useless . " mitchum , laconic but alert , makes nice partner finlay . he ready stand buddy he thinks incapable killing , he really doesn't like montgomery . robert ryan makes you feel uncomfortable moment you see him . there something too friendly him , something too hidden , something too ready explode . you're not surprised when he suddenly beats samuels death his fists . difference part keeley part montgomery , i think , difference role lead reputation movie star role lead reputation movie actor . i think it only when mitchum took unsympathetic roles night hunter cape fear many critics realized he first-rate film actor , not just star . time , ryan already actor reputation , but major stardom eluded him . smaller part , gloria grahame excellent dance hall hostess who might give mitchell alibi . her cat eyes pouty lips , grahame always distinctive . she paul kelly man who may or may not her husband bring uneasy almost surreal quality their scenes . crossfire solid looking noir . dvd presentation very good .	1

there bad movies , then there bad movies . " universal soldier : return " cosmically bad movie , movie so poor every aspect its execution one would look " manos : hands fate " comparison . first " universal soldier " film moderately entertaining shoot ' em up flick starring action stars jean-claude van damme " rocky " refugee dolph lundgren essentially accomplished what it set out : people perished violent ways , stuff exploded , van damme lundgren beat each other into bloody pulps end film . even presence charming ally walker van damme female sidekick greatly helped film . movie garnered enough attention fans merit release special edition dvd some time back . it unfortunately also garnered enough attention fans merit this unredeemable piece trash sequel . second , one hopes final , installment franchise should never become franchise achieves such heights utter banality stupidity i sat open-mouthed awe watching it . i think i safely say i am less person sat through this atrocity . expect spend few days coma after credits roll . van damme returns luc , reanimated soldier who triumphed over forces government sponsored evil first film . this outing he now works dr. dylan cotner ( xander berkeley ) , scientist who reconstituted universal soldier program help his supercomputer s.e.t.h. luc , his female sidekick maggie ( kiana tom ) , helps design run training missions new batch super soldiers . film opens what filmmakers hope pulse-pounding jaunt up river , jaunt filled explosions , stunts , gunfire , briefest glimpse tom incredibly fit form . mission grinds halt we learn several important things : kiana tom incredibly hot but can't act her way out paper bag , luc daughter named hillary ( karis paige bryant ) who you just know get into trouble some point , only soldiers we must pay attention romeo ( bill goldberg ) one played michael jai white . frankly , turning off film immediately after glimpsing tom amazing physique probably good thing . everything follows dull , predictable , so full plot holes defy description . " universal soldier : return " feels like eighty minutes dental surgery rather than action film . sure enough , cotner computer goes fritz unleashes killing power universal soldiers . resulting conflagration s.e.t.h. implants its consciousness michael jai white , luc his loved ones flee compound , military swoops contain problem . extraordinarily untalented actress named heidi schanz also pops nosy reporter called erin who interested exposing government latest shenanigans . predictably , van damme schanz team up track down ... er ... well , track down something defeat supercomputer . i think they need some code shut system down , but meantime film takes them all over place so wisecracking romeo follow them around while absorbing all abuse luc hand out . even throwing few scenes set adult only club can't make this turkey fly . it dull , folks , painfully so . time film grinds its inevitable showdown luc s.e.t.h. back shattered compound -- injured hillary life balancing precariously background serve motivation overwhelmed luc ( geez , what surprise there ! ) -- i knew i just wasted far too much my life this car wreck . how bad it , you ask ? read ... plot holes this film innumerable , uncountable grains sand beach or acne teenager face . example , luc explains erin he once universal soldier just like romeo but cotner " cured " him restoring him life ; he no longer needs injections or ice or any other devices used soldiers . what heck we doing marveling this amazing supercomputer when cotner just performed miracle biblical implications ? he brought someone back dead ! how exactly he accomplish this feat ? we don't find out van damme , who simply smirks his way through few lines dialogue simply boggle mind their monumentally idiotic implications . i could go , but let discuss performances instead -- or lack thereof . i should say i adore kiana tom ; she drop dead gorgeous babe body could stop earth rotation , but watching her stumble through dialogue like your appendix taken out through your mouth . problem lumbering bill goldberg , whose " funny " lines anything but . more i think heidi schanz , less i think her . you wonder film where jean-claude van damme best thespian cast . you might think movie this foolhardy shouldn't contain any bonus features dvd . you would wrong . trailers this film , " return , " " double team , " " desert heat , " " knock off , " " maximum risk , " " nowhere run " showcase dubious career jean-claude van damme . making feature , van damme career retrospective ( ha ! ) , michael jai white feature , talent bios round out disc . my advice those viewers thinking renting " universal soldier : return " ? run , my friends , run far , far away don't look back .	-1

+++++this movie based story " adventure golden pince-nez " ( 1904 ) sir arthur conan doyle ( 1859 1930 ) . this movie , dr. watson absent so sherlock holmes ' ( jeremy brett ) smarter brother mycroft ( charles gray ) helps this mystery . this movie concerned death invalid professor ( frank finlay ) assistant , man no enemies few vices . there three essential clues what happened :( 1 ) dying assistant last words professor maid ( who found him ) " professor , it she .

this film , surface , seems like complete mess . it completely plotless , feels almost european its pacing ( honestly ) . i'm thinking myself , this intentional ? thomas chong really auteur , or he just really stoned out his mind when he directed this ? film itself actually really funny , it best chong directed films . scene beginning film ( cheech chong syphening gasoline ) hilarious ( remember , this made 1980 gas crisis still everyone mind ) . scene where cheech chong improvise song " beaners " ( showing cheech chong doing racial humour way before overrated carlos mencia ) great , too . all chong films laid back , times completely lackadasical feel them , so my pretentious side wondering whether thomas chong real auteur , or he just lazy stoner who managed , somehow , string together few films . discuss ...	1

ostensibly " crossfire " police procedural finding murderer kindly jewish man post world war ii washington d.c. count i thought film telegraphed murderer little early but beside point because story here so intricately textured there many riches found . film touches not only irrational bigotry leads murder but also portrays country yes military malaise following end our 4 year campaign free world tyranny . we now peace question arises where devote our energies . it this climate where after we saved some jews nazi extermination only direct our hostilities toward jews home . film starkly lit filmed director edward dmytryk maximum effect . cast superb robert young , robert mitchum , robert ryan , gloria grahame giving some best , some cases best , performances their careers . this film nominated best picture 1947 losing " gentlemen agreement " film touching domestic anti-semitism . i recommend seeing both films but my mind " crossfire " clearly superior film	1
when i saw this movie 2002 , i thought it masterpiece . i still three years later dvd . let me give you some insite characters first . davey stone : town drunk who drinks all his problems away alcoholic since age 12 when his parents killed chanukah after getting hit truck . whitey duvall : optomistic midget who extremely behind times , poised win " dukesberry all-star patch " , award given out annual holiday banquet . also his feet aren't same size he covered fur . also frequently seizures . eleanore duvall:whitey fraternal twin sister who wears wigs without them " looks like owl " . like whitey , feet wrong size behind times , example , she tries cut corn dog off stick . jennifer friedmen:davey childhood girlfriend who recently abandoned her husband raising her son single mother . 33 works dunkin ' donuts dukesberry mall . she , most movie aspects , would considered " girl next door " . benjamin friedmen:jennifer son , who throughout film develops friendship davey . mayor stuhy duhy : mayor dukesberry , who wife once man . tom baltezor : man whose left hand replaced pirate hook . original winner 35th all-star patch , but gives it whitey . chinese waitor : waitor china dragon , one more funny roles rob schneider past few years . mrs. selman : woman three boobs . commonly refered " mrs. triple nipple " . now meat review , plot this movie isn't really good , but not very horrible . one thing i like , yet dislike amount music . i really don't like people break into song every 15 minutes or so , but songs this good . listen ! even though this animated holiday movie this isn't kids all , jokes this vulgar crude , one example would whitey his hand his pants , he says " my finger your mouth , kitty , but i don't feel no teeth " . meaning he his finger up his butt . all all , this good movie if your adam sandler fan . this movie not next " gone wind " , but good movie whatsoever .	1
ralph bakshi boho fantasy wizards , like richard williams ' doomed thief cobbler , reaction against disney animated features shares many its flaws , well many its own . all his talk wanting show disney how tell real story real passion , there real lack story worse , real lack feeling dull characters disinterested vocal performances only draw attention . but perhaps most fatal all largely uninteresting animation often seems pitched somewhere filmation underground comics , more interesting ( potentially expensive ) sequences played purely two-tone still concept images susan tyrell flat narration giving film uncompleted work-in-progress look . use crudely rotoscoped footage el cid , alexander nevsky zulu choppy battle scenes also rather too awkward work , especially since it never properly integrated genuinely animated characters . its heart there vaguely interesting notion ( it certainly not developed enough called idea ) war technology magic - embodied two brother wizards each others throats thousands years - coming head when bad one discovers motivating power nazi propaganda , but too often it simply clumsily reacting against disney formula rather than telling story you see all too clearly early signs just how badly bakshi would mess up lord rings here . still , fox dvd boasts nice widescreen transfer good selection extras - audio commentary bakshi 35-minute documentary him film , various stills galleries , tv spot two trailers .	1

seen every film version pride prejudice one obtain today , i definitely award palm this one , jennifer ehle colin firth . bbc version 1982 also charming ; its tv-standard shortcomings lighting , cinematography , editing overlooked ; but there simply no comparison firth david rintoul mr. darcy . colin firth uniquely hits off character very reserved man who forced " out himself " attraction unexpected young woman . laurence olivier too suave polished ( well too old ) carry this off well firth , evoking more air offended politician than entrenched , unawakened country gentleman . rintoul 1982 version suitably rough around edges , but works too hard displays too visibly darcy gradual thawing presence elizabeth bennet . firth hides it better , character darcy would , while still letting viewer process . i enjoy elizabeth garvie 1982 version , but i equally well satisfied jennifer ehle elizabeth bennet . if she not come off quite youthful garvie ( ehle only her late 20s when she made pp ) , i find her more convincing girl who prizes wit excels it . delightful very pretty actress , she seems well matched her mr. darcy . most secondary characters nicely this 1995 version , which far best mr. bennet any cinematic pp . other stand-outs include jane bennet lady catherine de bourgh . i preferred only one character 1982 version : mr. collins , whose foolishness better served large , doughy actor than rather ferret-like ( if hysterical ) david bamber ' 95 remake .

okay , if you don't like this movie then my opinion your not horror movie fan . anyone who grew up 1980 knows loves jason voorhees ! only reason you wouldn't fan because your one those stuck up , horror movie snobs who only likes movies such halloween other over rated played out slasher flicks . jason goes hell - final friday ( only it wasn't last ) one more creative friday 13th movies ever made ! sure there might some rather small plot holes here or there but thats no big deal . considering series gone this far , i think it amazing director pulled off something so creative ! instead jason run through woods entire film , chopping up teenagers who bearly act , director decided go different direction . movie starts typical friday 13th scene , attractive woman all herself camp crystal lake . she walks one cabins then eventually decides take shower . pretty stypical stuff usual slasher movie bimbo . soon enough however , we ( fans ) discover she member government s.w.a.t team , sent destroy jason voorhees . jason killer tons people , i'm actually quite shocked government ( or whoever handles there situations ) hadn't stepped sooner ! anyways , they find jason unleash everything they got him . after shooting him bunch bullets finally blowing his body bloody chunks , everyone thinks jason finally dead . what they don't know they're dead wrong ! ( sorry silly pun ) here where i think jason goes hell well . director explains how jason able come back all those times , through all those sequals . it actually idea i myself early days 80 sequals . jason heart takes shape form some creature hell . whenever host body ( whoever jason happens using time ) becomes too nasty it use anymore , it basically uses host . otherwords , it simple body snatchers plot . rest movie we watch helpless victems fall prey jason demon heart , taking over their bodies . soon we discover plot detail helps movie but us friday 13th fans , know it plot hole . no big deal considering it dosn't hurt anything long run actually helps story movie better . jason sister ( if you remember first friday 13th , jason mother said she only one child ) order become reborn again , he needs take over her body . you tell , jason goes hell alot more plot details creative story twists than most other ones series . i won't go into anymore detials movie , you just sit back watch blood fly ! ending also treat us horror fans too ! something any respected friday 13th fan waited see many years eventually blessed it later down road . i won't spoil anything if you haven't seen movie , you'll just watch it . over all , jason goes hell - final friday wonderful addition anyones friday 13th series gore hounds should enjoy much here ! it fun movie gives fans what they want see . more plot , more story , more gore ( get unrated version ) more jason ! anyone who thinks they're " above " this movie terms horror fan , get lost ! you don't belong here ! obviously slasher scene isn't you .	1
avatar so awesome ! i saw one episode chance determined watch them all . it got excellent story line , great characters awesome animation . i'd say it best show tv out there right now , not just considering cartoons either . it got real depth it isn't only fit kids but teenagers(like me ) adults alike . highly recomended ! i don't know if downloading not working past but it definitely working now . i've downloaded few they all work fine me	1

several years ago , i started my personal list 5 greatest movies ever made . four films made list . i finally fifth one . sure , it kind cheesy , deformed guy kind lame , ending kind ho-hum , but some reason , i loved this film . elizabeth berridge amy terrific . it true teens choose spend night funhouse not all sympathetic , but least they react way people might actually react . they aren't perfect , none us . amy sneaks out , lies her parents , smokes pot , sneaks into places without paying etc . what kind teenage behavior ? well son gun , this almost normal . tobe hooper some really good movies but this one deserves more acclaim . i loved it i loved ending camera pulled away landscape funhouse . funhouse itself creepy distrubing . not place i would choose hang out my girlfriend night , but hey ... girl would want spend night me funhouse probably someone i shouldn't going out first place , but that story . i suggest you rent it if you find it then if you like it , buy it . if you can't find it rent , buy it . i don't think you disabpointed .	1
i saw ad this ( popular stoner magazine ) few years back , thought " hey , i'd like get ! " , then promptly forgot it . i rediscovered it while searching through amazon.com stoner comedies , after seeing tommy chong own review , decided i it . basically , i loved it . yep , little weak places , but they weren't trying make cinematic masterpiece here . i'd put this same category movies like " deuce bigalow : male gigolo " or , more similar time period , " adventures ford fairlane : rock roll detective " starring andrew dice clay , one my favorite cheeseball comedies late eighties/early nineties . oh , that one other thing - i could've sworn this movie made ( released ) recently - copyright dvd says 2001 , all reviews info i read led me believe it recent flick . maybe just oversight my part , but it actually made 1989 . personally , makes it even more enjoyable me , i love finding flicks i missed my youth , get see now first time . then i get show it all my friends , who then similarly amazed they hadn't heard it , either . it definitely fun hobby :) [** few very minor spoilers ahead , those who haven't watched it yet **] so anyway , like " ford fairlane " , this movie hit miss times , but when it hits , it hits great , some real goofball humor you'll instantly quoting your friends end movie . also like " ford fairlane " , this movie bunch cool cameos , either playing random characters , or more typically , playing themselves . brief cheech spot utterly unexpected one biggest laughs movie . dokken jamming out tommy house also unexpected sight . thomas howell scene judd nelson simply amazing , howell utterly floored judd nelson never heard him . ( like howell , i also thought nelson kicked much butt " hip " , infrequently seen but highly enjoyable 80s comedy ) howell line , " you've seen ( random porn title ) but never saw red dawn ?!? " laugh-riot , i totally agree . judd nelson live under rock eighties , or what ? red dawn = must see movie ! conclusion , i really , really liked this movie . mad respect tommy chong family putting this together . end , i guess martin mull hypnotic suggestion ( " you'll like this movie . tell friend . " ) made actual impression me . i liked this movie , i'll telling lot friends . check this out sure - long you love goofy comedies , you'll dig it . it far out , man . :	1

now three great hulot films rereleased criterion , we enjoy them pristine quality affordable price ... but new playtime dvd completely updated two disc set warrants new review its own . first all , film , towering , nearly impenetrable achievement comedy world , visually cleaned up features crisp , clear sound , which makes it easier than ever before take dive into tati insular world ... enough already written film itself : some love it , some hate it ; my suggestion watch open mind , least couple times , reviewer wrote , you " active participant " appreciate this film : tati camera won't direct your attention you . i also recommend hulot holiday mon oncle should viewed first . i can't stress enough how great extras . if you're tatiphile already own copy playtime , i'd still recommend this release . there hours documentaries but real jewels interviews great man himself . speaking slightly stilted english , tati passionately articulates unique comic philosophy informed his films his career progressed he shows no regrets toward making film bankrupted him baffled critics distributers alike time ( film conceived international audience mind , but wasn't screened u.s , example , until 1970s ) . during course interview , tati also assesses his career within larger context film comedy makes some comparisons work earlier greats such keaton particularly chaplin . put simply , i've never viewed more fascinating extra criterion release i look forward revisiting his films even greater appreciation than ever before	1
i think very few actresses could pull off juliette binoche feat . ok , none come mind : binoche one woman tour-de-force , example universal present counter-point during conference led cultural relativists . i watched this part trilogy last : red first , then white , then blue . i think some reviewers this movie impose quite narrow definition liberty , one might -- or might not -- dovetail kieslowski own . we know very little julie vignon relationship her husband child prior their tragedy . i believe this intentional critical aspect this film . face horrible circumstance julie vignon one thing she knows she : depend her strength , resources , clarity thought . i not think it necessarily case her suicidal impulse pos t-t ragedy driven entirely her loss : bereft , certainly . but she clearly complicated marital situation , coupled whole other life - both inner extra-marital , plus mess rabid public face : short , i think it would force all these circumstances would drive her knee-jerk action she ultimately not take . this " liberty " not just vignon understanding liberty , but , rather , contemplation meaning liberty both personal national levels ( what liberty mean unified or " united europe " ? married person ? widowed person ? street musician ? prostitute ? addled mother ? ) . vignon not cold ; fact , quite opposite : she pragmatic rational - not even hyper-rational . she wholly good she generous ( wonderful line uttered sandrine latter part movie ) . reflects flip side color blue perhaps double-meaning runs throughout this movie . yes , blue - color cold , lack feeling . but what blue , color peace tranquility ? loyalty ? productiveness ? sparkle ? strength ? i watched this movie alone : me it required concentration , certain state mind . i know some people who thought it would played better faster slow mo rewind , but if you liked color paradise eternity day , other movies unfolded their own pace but didn't skimp beauty , you might like kieslowski blue . this one chew , i look forward watching it again	1
i hate this movie ! because it protrays 17-year-old girls such negative light . i'm almost 17 years old i felt disgusted adults think all teenagers smoke drugs drink when they really don't . real life , teenage girls don't kind stuff . i think hollywood producers should make movies girls following their dreams finding themselves rather than they drugs overdose die . it so disgusting media presents teenagers like this public then adults think that what young girls like . i don't think i ever seen movie seventeen-year-old girl like this ever . it worst movie i've ever seen my whole entire life i shouldn't seen it begin . i'm sorry i wasted my time watching this piece crap . i love sandra bullock , i think she cool woman great actress , but this piece trash too horrible words . it sick ! don't watch this all !!!!!!!	-1
i'm bit surprised see somewhat tepid 4-star reviews this great film , one my all-time favorite movies ( others godfather iii , dr. strangelove , notting hill , player , pulp fiction ) . acting , plot , direction , setting marvelous . i don't even particularly like lake como ( it easily my least favorite destination italy ) but i love this film ! if nothing else , movie should remembered classic line " but como so boring !	1
this film carax his most mature , simply following paths godard truffaut their inevitable conclusion , sort enforced envolution cinematic language . i liken carax gustave mahler : half-disillusioned possibilities his influences , but still dedicated seeing them through end . there not much else say film . either you see where he going or you don't; either you respect innovation or you don't; either you're onboard experimentation or you're seasick , yet still docked . end , shutting down too quickly may mean missing out new artistic language , new development structure meaning . any case , it never hurts hear little scott walker , especially schizophrenic walker heard here , i.e. tilt . avant-garde never looked more ... pleasantly dissonant	1
your whole family should enjoy this hysterically funny suspense/comedy stars topper blonde ghost . hal roach lavished this l941 production opulent sets -- especially enormous mansion where all action takes place -- dazzling cast comedians supporting actors . joan blondell plays curaveous ghost who wants roland young ( topper ) help find villain who killed her . billie burke top form ditzy , screaming mrs. topper . but its rochester who steals all his scenes his double-takes priceless one-liners . patsy kelly terrific mrs. topper long-suffering maid . " topper returns " rare example where third episode series ten times better than original " topper " ( 1937 . you can't go wrong this comedy watch your family or laugh like hyena alone your own home .	1
one most compelling events release kenneth lonergan you count me it gave visibility mark ruffalo who plays troubled young man who , unable deal childhood trauma lost his parents car crash , lives life unattached agony isolation . he loner drifter , medicating his self-pity pot short-lived relationships . his sister sammy , played wonderfully laura linney , reacts same tragedy , many ways , overresponsible overcontrolling super mom . two opposite reactions same tragedy course result sibling clash . this film shows great complexity biting comic insight , attempt this brother sister shed their defense mechanisms most importantly reconnect one . ride never easy this film . no easy answers given . just important , this film , which deals pain loss , never descends into maudlin hallmark movie sap other films would . balancing edgy humor profound psychological insight , lonergan written directed tale captures layers upon layers psychological complexity accompany trauma loss . amazingly , he it fast-paced film scenes turns comic dramatic . matthew broderick , example , plays hilarious role sammy neurotic anal-retentive boss bank . conflict him sammy leads plot point i'll let you discover film . but most all , this film shines because mark ruffalo plays such endearing , sympathetic , sometimes infuriating character . you won't forget him	1
touching wartime musical some great tunes ever-incomparable judy garland lead , what more could you want ? maybe historical value gene kelly screen debut ? maybe . garland , her first " grown-up " role , looks absolutely fantastic onscreen , glowing lighting up every shot . second viewing , i found myself wishing dialogue scenes would hurry make way musical numbers , 19-year-old judy garland electrifies scenes such " after you've gone " " how ya gonna keep em down farm . " you see exactly why she often named world best entertainer ; her stage presence , discernable even black white transfer , brilliant . while garland didn't prove her true acting chops until " star born " , which she gave obviously oscar-worthy performance , she still tugs appropriately heart-strings when called upon so . gene kelly acting clearly amateur this stage , but who blame him , it his first picture after all . we'll forgive him brilliant work he later ( magnificent dancing talent , course , which sadly under-used this film ) . sure it sappy , sentimental , predictable , but who cares ?! it pure escapist fun judy , gene , wonderful music ride ! so sit back enjoy yourself . i most ridiculous grin my face whole time	1

dashiell hammett best known his hard-boiled detectives , but he struck gold when he created " thin man . " movie adaptation even better -- witty , zingy mystery lovable pair detectives their dog . no wonder it spawned five sequels , even though hammett never wrote . inventor clyde wynant missing . party , his daughter dorothy ( maureen o'sullivan ) sees detective-turned-rich-hubby nick charles ( william powell ) asks his help finding her dad . but when clyde secretary/mistress murdered , clyde primary suspect -- especially when other bodies show up . nick resolutely determined not get involved , but police his rich wife nora ( myrna loy ) , he finds himself enmeshed case . he believes wynant didn't it , but case covered false clues hidden motives -- until nick himself unearths skeleton wynant workshop , which solve whole case . first moment you see nick dancing his shaker , it obvious " thin man " winner . it first six films starring nick , nora asta wire-haired terrier , while hammet never wrote anything more this detecting team , didn't stop hollywood continuing their saga . this tight , suspenseful little mystery , plenty suspects might it , but you never quite know who actually murder . but story peppered astoundingly funny dialogue ( " i heard you got shot five times tabloids . " " that lie ! they didn't come anywhere near my tabloids " ) , cast weirdos , ranging gangsters greedy ex-wives wooden gigolos . nick nora ( based hammett lillian hellman ) absolutely delightful . powell loy absolutely electric this movie , exchanging witty barbs ( " oh , nicky , i love you ... because you know such lovely people " ) pretending they don't adore each other . this ideal movie chemistry . they're also backed good performances nat pendleton , william henry minna gombell hard-boiled cop nick helping out , creepy hyperintellectual wynant son , wynant greedy , pop-eyed ex-wife . but all performances here solid ; flattest acting asta . its kinetic dialogue tight plot , it easy see why " thin man " classic . but real reason watch it simply powell loy	1

i too bought this vhs vincent d'onofrio . my only negative comment his performance there not enough it ! i'll say right here now i'm not big fan smits or scacchi , d'onofrio overpowers them every time he screen . it beautiful story , i see why director gillian armstrong attracted it - it love story bit real-life depth ( rather than those soapy ones where ridiculous problems created characters lack imagination - julia roberts films , anyone ? ) . said , two lead roles needed played stronger actors , ones could keep up d'onofrio vivacity . worth look fans	1

everybody who says this , i ask , you seen drunken young master ? because these 2 foar superior . i am not trying discredit your opinion , but far modern movies go , this may his best , least since people america known who he . so story jackie beating people up when they trying force workers work overtime without getting paid , then they fire them when job they don't need them anymore . director lau kar leung(i think jackie left his name this , i mean he freaking it ) plays part officer who investigating something going factory people smuggling ancient artifacts out china . so other words story kinda sucks(at least this cut version it really sucks ) main thing watch action . i kind hate it when this happens becuae there not enough fights this bad story . i only think like 6-7 good fights this movie . now once again we may not getting all fights because this cut version . character wise only person who stands out me late great anita mui . she far best character actor/actress this movie . so end we get really spectacular fight , but my favorite one where they hired axe gang take out jackie . jackie absolutely top form here , not like he wasn't other scenes , they just didn't mix stunts fighting like they this scene . i know jackie break least one bone shooting this scenes , i don't know this factually , but you watch this tell me if there any known actor world who this . oh yeah , this like 16 years after he made real drunken master . something i don't really care fact they don't even mention real drunken master this movie . real drunken master simon yuen , his son yuen woo-ping all crazy footwork . so there really 2 drunken masters , except screen they only show old man dm . so , even though nobody drunken style like jackie screen , woo-ping could pull it off even better , but he not actor . so i am just saying it would really helped this movie if they least mentioned drunken master , but now everybody just knows jackie drunken master because they not seen original know idea who simon yuen . course they know who woo-ping , they don't realize it his dad who pushed this movie over top become huge blockbuster china . if anybody wants see far superior movie this than make sure you check out original if you want see movie slightly better than drunken master than you should check out very unknown dance drunken mantis . this movie brings back real drunken master introduces us northern drunken boxing champion . yes that right , we get drunken master doesn't doubled , hwang jang lee . i won't leave his sidekick corey yuen out either . now this movie chief fox iron monkey playing jackie role , this would easily top 10 movie all-time if they could gotten jackie , or lee yi-min , or kid 7 steps kung fu . but instead we just get top 50 all-time kung fu movie . i let you know right now , seriously , beware drunken mantis style . so yeah , movie pretty good , not story action , anita mui delightful character gives it 4/5 . also dvd quality great widescreened picture all-important french language track english those us who wanna try listen it . i would definitely advise you seek out chinese verion if this really one your favorite movies , because this almost bad jet li dubs . drunken style real gungfu style folks , if mastered real life you just deadly jackie . kungfumagazine.com some good articles it if you interested martial arts .	1
when i saw this its first run , i didn't know it box office flop . it anything but me . it most inspiring film my youth ! i can't think any other film caused me something my young life . i procured copies original engineering drawings plane made detailed working scale model . subsequently i chose engineering profession . after seeing film i read both " we " " spirit st. louis . " movie surprisingly close latter . i am glad we cinemascope dolby 5.1 version this personal classic . i don't know why this film flopped 1957 , but i think stewart age less it than others saying . it made 10 years earlier , it would not cinemascope , sound would suffered , billy wilder might not directed . i wouldn't want give those things up stewart " right " age . it great film played actor passionate part it tells great story . .... case where ticket-buying-public didn't get it right	1

quite possibly , stupidest movie ever made . " well-written " -- could fooled me .

" finely edited " -- i guess there art cutting real turkeynot campfest , not comedy , just plain bad . get some busty dolls some dopey guys , throw them stew , show some teasers breasts , add cheesy , dashed-off script guy who suddenly exemplars " i say , not i " plan it becoming " cult classic .

i always avid fan westerns general , charlton heston particular , but this one those movies where legend surrounding it far exceeds actual viewing , even allowing its butchered studioscharlton heston course , plays major dundee , man very forceful character - resolute , determined , even rebellious ( " invading " mexico attacking french army ) . such man later found hopeless drunk wallowing gutters durango thoroughly incomprehensible . purpose " invasion " mexico capture or destroy apache indian , charriba , so one would expect audience watch movie anticipation great climax when two sides finally meet . when they meet however , action over less than minute , charriba simply shot michael anderson jnr . so climax , my view , anti-climax . we then presented new climax , when dundee his men defeat french army order get back across rio grande . although this encounter lot more exciting than one apaches , overall effect , far i am concerned , rather like effect one gets when reading murder mystery discover murderer somebody who only entered final pages ( scene where wounded richard harris single-handedly takes other half french army so unexpected view what gone before , virtually unbelieveable ) . regard movie heavily cut studios , i would suggest if any cuts made , they should cut durango scenes entirely , plus all scenes featuring senta berger . romance only slows down action adds nothing story , whilst too much romance leads boredom . finally , watched movie new score first , then original score , i say i preferred original . movie opens charriba saying upside down strung-up soldier , " who you going send after me now ? " original then opening title , " major dundee , " accompanied mitch miller sing gang singing major dundee march . me this much more stirring rousing score than new replacement , sets scene what one hopes exciting movie . all means buy this dvd piece movie history , part either charlton heston or sam peckinpah collection ( even though peckinpah disowned it ) , but my money don't expect western anything like great likes big country , magnificent seven , or how west won .	1

all too often when consumers run across interesting movie they never heard before , they make decision buy or rent it based packaging instead writing down name show then looking up reviews it . this approach makes consumers playthings unscrupulous marketers . one such company anchor bay entertainment this summer released 1988 flick called " dead next door " dvd . packaging this dvd touted this movie lost horror classic now resurfaced . fact , its labelled " collector edition " " making " documentary added dvd . such lengths anchor bay gone order deceive uninformed customers . marketing claims only partly right . dead next door really " lost " horror flick out sight ( not even cable television ) since it originally released 1988 . however , it not classic , unless you consider poorly made features " classics " their own right . think latter day ed wood type production made evenless talent than found ed wood movies . dead next door brainchild akron , ohio teenager named j.r. bookwalter who somehow persuaded hollywood movie maker sam raimi put up financing flick shot super 8 . gratitude , bookwalter named lead role " raimi " one lesser roles " dr. savini " after sam raimi associate tom savini . name evil cult leader named rev . jones honor real life rev . jim jones who responsible jonestown mass suicide 1978 . how original . dead next door good example what happens when teenager no real movie making experience given miniscule budget make feature length flick . abandoned houses , high school serve unconvincingly high tech labs , government offices headquarters zombie cult . plot completely unimaginative , acting just plain awful , original actors voices clumsily dubbed back sound completely wooden . while watching this , you find yourself frequently looking your watch even though flick only 84 minutes long . case so many today shot video ( sov ) horror flicks , dead next door comes off looking really cheap gives impression just thrown together over weekend hopes cashing cool box art , intriguing title gullible movie fans . good reason since dead next door shot just few days comes across cheapjack production made haste but little talen t.t he dead next door horror flick so bad it bad . both this flick subsequent productions , j.r. bookwalter shows lack eye detail total unoriginality resulted his name mud among knowledgeable horror flick fans . any event , dead next door waste both your time money no matter how low price you get it	-1

classic horror movie , jamie lee curtis perfect these movies 80 '	1
spoilers , but i'm sure most people know this movie already ..... i suppose what would disappoint bela lagosi fans he not vampire , but vampire actor . what really makes this film shine through not bela , but " luna " -a very beautiful gothic woman who amazing vampire stares , looks like pure goth . it basically detective movie but not disappointing one .. lots women screaming , vampire scenes suprisingly well ; even bat props look real . it bugs , rats , crawling spiders , very well fog . movie only 60 minutes long :-( so i would consider this more " moviette " or mini-movie . i found it very satisfying . too bad it only available vhs .	1
i first watched this film when i teenager 20 years ago , i really touched it . now , 20 years later , amid mediocrity characterizes most ( but , fortunately , not totality ) films made during past 30 years , i appreciate novecento even more . obviously , like every masterpiece , this film its own demands : not expect easy-going film . impressive photography ; well chosen cast ( except , perhaps , deniro which i never considered good actor most people ); film intent ... some features convert novecento gem .	1
only thing kept me watching this movie see if there going twilight zone-type ending tied it all together . remember zone where five wildly-different people ( clown , cowboy , ballerina , etc . ) trapped round room , when they finally escape , you find out they're just dolls trash ? it lame zone , but i thought watching this movie kelly lynch wanted stay inside abandoned desert house -- wondered if house going place life death . kelly might hovering two room her new " husband " satan . or angel . something really off-the-wall . but it didn't happen . it pretty much straight-forward story dysfunctional low-lifes trying figure out their messy lives -- without telling us very much themselves . acting very good kelly lynch looks great naked ( even bandages her wrists wearing dirty hosptial gown whole movie ) , but story gets lost desert . what heck happened baby shows up couple scenes then disappears ? that what i wondering rest movie but nothing more said	1
i watched this movie first time since early 90s amazed what wonderful picture it . film nominated best picture , best actor nick notle best supporting actress kate neligan - unfortunately , miss striesand not nominated best director , which surely misfortune because it she who coaxed these marvelous performances these actors . watch it love it	1
child 9 , who recently lost her 30 year old father cancer , i viewed this movie ( 6 times ) theatre , when it first came out ( circa 1966 , san jose , ca ) . perhaps it because i extremely sad impressionable period my life , but movie lifelong impact my political views values . upon finding dvd amazon , i purchased it , after viewing it now , woman my late 40 , i feel same way i when i child . very wary government so afraid their constituency , they would reduce them mindless robots , placated substance abuse , religion , willing turn everyone who didn't fit or comply . we heading there , america . i heartened yesterday , when after viewing this dvd me , my teenaged granddaughter told me she discussed movie her literature teacher . turn , her teacher asked if she could borrow movie , share entire class . i am donating my original copy her teacher class , ordering myself . perhaps our youth once again bring change , peace , freedom , honesty , caring back into america . i hope live long enough see day .	1
after several viewings when much younger , watched again . why this movie work ? it built very weak premises . main characters aren't particularly interesting or complex . yet . it seems capture moment " falling love . " most beautifully way rarely shown movies . you see it happen -- during visit nicky grand-mother riviera . you wonder simplicity it : sharing emotion , beauty time , music , setting , view , chapel , so loving elderly grandmother . later , reunion stopped freak accident , gives film turn caught imagination movie goers past 50 years ! believable , realistic love story , however , david lean brief encounter much closer perfection	1
jon heder excellent his breakout role . i watch any movie hes no	1
young actor great this movie , but film itself non-exciting bit boring . **	-1
i got this dvd out library mainly out curiosity , i admit like reviewer i not really expecting find this riveting , especially it german sub-titles well just one person speaking unseen interviewer , answering questions years she ( traudl junge ) spent hitler youngest secretary until fall bunker berlin 1945 . i sat watched this dvd without getting up break , it so fascinating i also surprised i felt some compassion traudl junge , after all she worked cruel despot who ordered murder millions innocent people which included not only those jewish race but gypsies , people who dared openly gay , jehovah witnesses so many others i don't enough room this critique name them . traudl junge ability bring out me , hardened cynic when it comes nazis their crimes against humanity , any kind compassion , shocked socks off me i tell you . i sat listened this old very dignified woman who made no attempt excuse who what she during war but she never came across ( least me ) apologist hitler , rather she saw foolishness her youth absolute banality evil into which she many other dropped into such ease . she also gave insight into man who become enigma , she not make him human , he lost his humanity long ago , but she gave sense who he through her dialogue , how charming he could , his odd little foibles such him ardent vegetarian his passion dogs , all qualities what should endear you person but this case only repel you when you learn who person these qualities . blind spot surprisingly riveting , you want hear what traudl say i ended up watching it all one go when i thought i would flick through it watch it piece meal if all . worth watching , if you get chance see film " downfall " also read book " until final hour - hitler last secretary , " all three help you understand person , traudl junge also who man she worked , where traudl i some compassion , hitler i no compassion whatsoever even after watching one film , one documentary reading one book looks his life through eyes other people no matter who person , you still find him wanting	1
1975 good year movies likes " one flew over cuckoo nest " , " jaws " , " dog day afternoon " , , my favorite year , " dersu uzala " . there couple popular movies year i never got around seeing ; " nashville " " shampoo " . i finally got see " shampoo " other night , frankly , i disappointed . what disappointed me whole concept main character , george , played warren beatty . he just too important too many ways too many people come across believable . i wasn't surprized see , co-writer , beatty created his own character level . i still give movie decent rating because it well-directed , well-acted , moves pretty well . it probably bit edge 1975 ( major motion picture , ) still would inappropriate younger ones . i gather it political commentary because so much background involves nixon/agnew campaign 1972 . i'm no big fan either those politicians but i came away thinking they got better script somehow . i hope movie also comment sexual revolution those days . there plenty it little emotion or purpose ( other than obvious ) . indeed , sex comes across loser richard spiro pr race . george can't get enough it laments he just can't pass up pretty woman . then we led believe he actually emotionally involved one many he physically involved . it hard tell which one would , however . end he makes his choice but , then , she seems uninterested we . lee grant won best supporting oscar her role wife jack warden character . she alright her role but seems benefitted lack competition . one who stand out jack warden . he excellent smooth operating money-managing , wife-cheating , where's-the-party sort guy who always seems control ( or , least enough control anyone seems this movie ) . his competition oscar year , however , george burns his memorable role " sunshine boys " . i like good satire but i didn't see one " shampoo " . i guess thirty years waiting left me underwhelmed . i hope i get better reaction " nashville " when i finally get see one .	1

i just saw this movie i very impressed genre bank robbers . i very happy one hand movie took " gay theme " swing it movie didn't involve aids people dying . other hand it took negative swing because it didn't give very good portrayal gay relationships either . honest here , if it " straight " couple relationship way it portrayed , i would not thought anything it . i would thought it like any other unhealthy relationship out there . no , but it portrayed " gay " relationship so i see where it disturbed me probably others well . i others come realization all relationships unhealthy . they don't " straight or gay " unhealthy . also , they bank robbers petes sake . there something wrong them people ( gay or straight ) anyway if they robbing banks . there one thing i say this " gay themed " portrayal , robbers not queeny or flamboyant giving " weak " view gay men . so me , positive thing . i recommend this movie wants something different not your " run mill " gay movie	1
michael keaton perfect this role . no one else could played part . he selfish , demanding , self-centered hard headed most all full fear . slowly he begins change even though chaos all around him . not only this good movie addicts/alkies , jail inmates , etc . people who trying control addict/alkie would also benefit this , there no way control someone elses addiction . it very entertaining . there some hysterically funny scenes once aa not made fun . i couldn't find it rent it so i bought watched if 3 times all ready .	1

forget friday 13th part 1 . sure it first series but dosn't always make it best ! friday 13th part one good film some people might even consider it one best horror movies ever made . personal level , i think first almost every horror series ( halloween , nightmare elm street , friday 13th ) over rated way too played out . too many people talk first series like it only good thing horror general . granted , some sequals really crappy ( robocop 3 perfect example sequal gone bad ) but dosn't mean every sequal bad . think it moment . if there never sequal friday 13th movie , we would never even know who jason voorhees or all those wonderful sequals down road ! after all , jason never came until second movie . which brings us actual film , friday 13th part 2 . it perfect sequal all levels , giving fans more what they want . horror movie sequals ( especially slasher flicks ) need few things them make fans happy . blood guts almost always needed horror sequals . more better ! buckets blood fact . thing , attractive women dying horrible ways ( mainly due their own stupidity ) expected usual . what would horror movie if dumb blonde wasn't doing something stupid gets her killed !?! last , horror movie sequal needs tie up loose ends left over first movie . friday 13th part 2 all those expected things handles it rather well process . basically plot this sequal simple , more kids die camp cyrstal lake ( aka ) " camp blood " because they're stupid . movie starts off rather thrilling enjoyable moment right off bat . sake those who haven't seen this movie yet , i won't spoil anything you . fastforward little bit into movie ( skip some less important details ) movie set up yet round " slash ' em up " friday 13th style ! all means friday 13th part 2 great example sequal right ! if you've never seen friday 13th movie before , start off first two . if you find yourself enjoying " teen slasher scene " , move other classic sequals series . friday 13th never let me down ( not once ) terms gore i think it safe say most horror fans share same opinion matter . if your one those " horror fans " who only enjoys first series , stop reading this review right now ! go back watching halloween part 1 tenth time pretend sequals never happend . everyone else ( gore hounds real horror fans ) enjoy splatter plot turns ! friday 13th part 2 perfect sequal alot ways . i've said my bit , over out !	1

midnight clear ( keith gordon , 2002)keith gordon probably best remembered playing arnie cunningham john carpenter so-so film version stephen king so-so novel christine . gordon , however , hung up acting togs late eighties went behind camera , it here he truly shined , turning out such brilliant movies waking dead television genius such series house , dexter , homicide : life street . man amazing track record . so it some confusion i regard those works where gordon comes off somewhat less accomplished . midnight clear one them . based novel william wharton , midnight clear story world war ii platoon ( full misfits , natch ) who ordered scout out mansion inside enemy territory . they encounter enemy -- but not enemy they expect . survivors german platoon house down hill looking surrender . two groups spend companionable christmas together before they turn task deciding how get each other out situation they've found themselves -- enemies wartime becoming friends . this not your typical war film ; characterization much more important than action here , many other substandard war films this stripe ( hart war tigerland immediately come mind ) , it almost seems if director wanted still play it action film . there not enough real character development here float entire movie ; we get know our main character well enough , character upon whom entire plot turn later . we get little less guy who here purpose building sympathy . rest platoon , very little , enemy , nothing . we know more back-line lieutenant -- minor character best -- than we germans . not up standards set either gordon or wharton . *	1

it one great romantic movies celebrated english duo , michael powell emeric pressburger , who both wrote directed it . " i know where i'm going , " released 1947 ; but it just not well known their " red shoes , " or " stairway paradise . " this film stars young , charm-to-burn wendy hiller , joan webster , middle class young englishwoman who knows exactly where she going : island killoran ( mythical ) off island mull , scottish hebrides : marry sir robert bellinger , her immensely wealthy boss . however , weather need not cooperate her . storms keep her stuck mull long enough meet fall love torquil mcneil , laird vicinity ( it his island house bellinger rented . ) mc neil , played roger livesey ( erstwhile colonel blimp ) modest fellow , but pretty handy gaelic poetry when it counts . island mull enlivened some sturdy supporting players : pamela brown , finlay currie , young singer petula clark girl glasses . finally , hiller begins panic rain seems melting her plans , her resolve . she insists ferried out further island , risking her own life , lives laird young couple , well . but weather not allow her leave mull it ultimately too late . movie filmed black white , it beautifully shot any powell pressburger ever made . scotland sometimes harsh landscapes look dreamy mists ; hiller train trip across united kingdom textbook example flavorful economy . special effects boys wonders tools then hand create fierce ocean whirlpool described local " legend corryvrecka . " film probably bit sentimental its portrayals happy villagers singing dancing , probably accurate its portrayal society still not far removed feudal : those villagers sure tug their forelocks when laird hoves into view . its musical score , featuring ancient scottish song title , quite lovely . listen , if you're romantic , go ride	1

man movie camera film you're either going love or hate , it unlikely you'll find comfortable mid-ground . it silent , russian made , experimental . it opens manifesto rejecting inter-title cards , affinity or reliance theater literature . it won't reject any tricks cinema , though - including stop-action animation , slow motion , times dizzying , machine fire montages . it uses documentary footage tell its story . although it doesn't tell traditional story movie structure . it opens empty movie hall , records projectionist queuing up reel one . cuts hall , stop-action animates chairs unfolding . cuts orchestra - conductor baton raised , orchestra readied suspended . enter audience . love it or hate it , this movie never forgets it movie . i loved it . i loved when projector started real movie started . journey - one movie takes - well described second american title , `living russia . ' we seem spend most movie following man old , hand-cranked , tripod supported movie camera he travels through some russian city or other . we , over his shoulder , seem go everywhere observe everything - young woman sleeping bed , people sleeping park benches , store-front mannequins rest . eventually woman bench sleepers awake , mannequins animated , we travel time through work recreational life city . then it foundry , cigarette packing plant , beach , volleyball court .... some people find this art house movie terribly self-absorbed its lack conventional narrative frustrating . if you only like movies throw good story you probably won't care much this film . if you're not sure give this one try - beneath it lack `story ' fascinating story written celluloid , vibrant , wry , witty .	1
title character not get much screen time this film . he doesn't even get any lines ( most his yells so you can't see his mouth ) . this really story jane . jane decided go africa search her father who left her her mother many years before . way she must defend her virtue , kill crew boat she hired , pilot boat her father . there she finds man who seems his brains baked sun little too long . eventually they all go off search escarpment find elephant graveyard . once top they find giant inland sea bizarre tribe living near graveyard ( we only see one dead elephant so time i not know " graveyard " found ) . they also run into tarzan who habit not speaking passing out whenever he exerts himself . i really got feeling only thing any film creators knew tarzan what they learned johnny weissmuller films . escarpment seems half continent . it nearly impossible climb so i don't know how dying elephants manage get up it . jane experiences bizarre tribe ( where she gets painted white ) seem lifted ursula andress film slave cannibal god . there very little right this film ( other than it finally end ) . jane goes super-able frightened schoolgirl but eventually falls tarzan reconciles her father . but end it not really worth watching . viewers who hoping see bo derek nude , almost all found during closing credits so you might well just skip right them .	1

cary grant ingrid bergman make superb team together , it really shame they only acted together once before , " notorious " ( which i would also recommend anyone see ) . ingrid really perfect this role , considering she just reproofed her scandal overseas married man , she shines , especially those moments rare , open comedy ( moment when she screams " how dare he make love me not married man " then shrieks loudy before stomping off into her bedroom hilarious -- not simply because line bit ironic statement , but because you would not normally expect her something nature . ) cary grant , , course , sublime , his cool , ironic british humor cast-off attitude setting off ingrid smiling charms excellent balance , though most charming aspect grant performances he always manages look buffoon , somehow , yet still completely tangible audience . when we find out he lied his married hurt ingrid , we really should sympathizing ingrid over whole affair . yet when he dancing madly around inrgrid dance later , not knowing she aware his secret , he still grins broadly , if knowledge he , always , entertaining completely charming , we can't help but still adore him tha t.t he only thing i found tad daunting this movie camera work , some longer scenes . beginning , you given full view apartment where two lovers meet , granted , it lovely apartment . but after 5 minutes , you really begin wish camera would zoom , or refocus , or something , least , could hold your interest . looking same people same , pulled-out view longer amount time than comfortable really annoying , which shame , because it detracted severely actors ' performances . i really expected more donen , after seeing his work " singin ' rain . " but , then again , " singin ' rain " gene kelly co-director -- probably accounted difference . other than , it completely enjoyable film watch , i would recomment seeing it . dvd superb transfer , color sound really pop out , really showcases ingrid cary their very best	1
people like me who lived through fall berlin wall ( 1989 ) but little too young time paying much attention like this blast past . much wit summed up one scenes ( which only seen deleted scenes ) when lead character friend mentions his situation little like delicate situation " back future " ( big hit just reaching eastern bloc time movie set ) . tale revolves around boy who keep past alive sake his mother health it illustrates both excitement those who experienced west first time betrayal ( this case felt his mother ) those who upheld former regime . it clever look social change general bit history hasn't yet seen often film . i loved it	1

i've fan this series many years , i still believe this one best franchise , even though jason no where found except end cameo . i fully believe shock who killer goes book one best twists movie history , such what learned star wars movies . movie itself really well , but musical score takes it level adds so much more horror it . you can't hear song night not little scared , it one those songs puts chill bones when it heard . first person view camera takes it sees through eyes murderer really well , so death scenes . overall , this movie just doesn't get old not matter how many times i watch it	1
if mind-bending thrillers like basic instinct prove anything , theme expert becoming obsessed his cryptic subject presents great deal potential . this film attempts similar tapestry . our protagonist ( ewan mcgregor ) finds himself progressively involved eavesdropping disturbing femme fatale across street ( ashley judd ) who blackwidow-spider type habit zapping all males she beds . problem , nothing much happens this premise . we never find ourselves feeling agent or his liege . no romantic overtures dangerous undertones . no edge seat interactions ala sharon stone films early 90s . instead , there queer apparition agent daughter punctuates every second scene adds pile threads end up nowhere . such constant failure take advantage its almost-intriguing buildups gets film my generous 1-star rating , anyone but mcgregor biographer needn't bother	-1

alright , i'll confess slight infatuation jet li , but even not make this movie more than passable . plot all over place . it barely made sense - characters would suddenly arrive , locations would develop then nothing would come them . bad guys just silly - i like real malice evil my badies , i like hate them enjoy their come uppance . well silly twisted bad boy just pathetic , jet li , ever serene , so far above whole mess , so detached lovely , just going through very routine job jet li . evil imperialist yankees plotting capture unsuspecting chinese immigrants enslave them cartoon cuts outs . like every other enthusiast this genre i enjoy carefully choreographed fights they good , but not good enough redeem this film . give me kung fu hustle any time - now there quality	1
all movies i seen jet li this one my favourite . dont get me wrong i enjoyed jets movies lot , but i put this top my list . hired assassin ( which you know full well he would not hurt fly let alone kill ) eric tsang takes him under his wing only things dont go planned . however , there long action scenes where jet gets show us some excellent fighting , comedy scenes , good story go all this . i must add i not think i would enjoy it much , but i proved myself wrong , i am glad i	1

i know i'm going minority , but i really appreciated jo van fleet performance above all . i liked high standard biblical preaching father , confused unloved competing youth james dean , very confident rival brother , his personality plus girlfriend , but me jo van fleet stole show . i can't help it ! her exquisite dominance character portrayal , far distant serious mother , gave me reason relish . i happen like strong women movies , i don't know why . she begins total mystery , dark woman walking alone herself , making huge sums money deposits town bank . she gets followed stranger who turns out her lost son days gone . they reunite , his intrusion , they get know each other she finds he dilemma . get know each other scene her small " office " makes me big believer top notch acting leave one breathless , without technical effects . it well filmed scene leaves two pros what they best-act ! her trail actions like lighting cigarette , reaching ink pen , slightly fisting herself forehead , dozing off alone late night her office chair , make her one most noteable cinematic female characters since judith anderson mrs. danvers alfred hitchcock rebecca . timeless piece work live forever movie history . way , i read one comment jo van fleet appearance actually minimal , but then margaret hamilton supposedly only 12 full minutes screen time wicked witch west . quality , not quantity . .	1

i loved this film , characters , setting , what spoken , what left unsaid . talk wrong place send 5 women ( nuns ) who repressing their sexuality ... women palace . it not constant winds haunts these women , but their desires , their regrets , memories this palace housed concubines harem many years ago . women who nothing think but sex , waiting one man come fulfill them , compete amongst themselves his attention . thing pained them most their forced celibacy endless days tedium ennui , sentiments soaked those walls , so many years later all these women experience same longing desires . erotic , most certainly , but haunting ghost story first caliber	1

panned patronized time it initial release , elia kazan adaptation his best selling book arrangement plays much better now than it 1969 . made after 6 year hiatus filmmaking time when movies enjoying unheard freedom due demise production code , arrangement clearly shows kazan still director reckoned . basic premise nothing new . highly succesful businessman ( kirk douglas ) suffers mid-life crisis attempts suicide . how he other characters deal aftermath make up rest story . kazan always actor director film provides showcase young faye dunaway douglas ' mistress who gets him reexamine his life but wants out someone else . deborah kerr her last major film appearance superb difficult role wife who tries understand what douglas going through but doesn't want give up rich lifestyle she become accustomed . strong support given hume cronyn family solicitor who plans his own richard boone rare non-western role douglas ' ailing father . his slide into dementia both heartbreaking terrifying . marlon brando originally agreed play lead but bowed out allowing kirk douglas who really wanted work kazan step . while not stage trained like other principals , he acquits himself well emotionally opposed physically demanding role . combination raw emotions , alternating points-of-view including black humor , touches surrealism ambitious then still today ( think american beauty ) . movie not without its flaws . it runs too long occasionally sloppy everything editing make-up but powerful writing intense performances make arrangement provocative filmmaking nearly 40 years later . called everything harrowing emotional ride self-indulgent mess ( see amazon summary ) it ultimately home viewer decide ( my 4 star rating indicates where i stand ) . kazan always controversial figure because his huac testimony 1950 but his greatness director cannot denied remains captured film all see	1

koreans honor their greatest military hero this epic drama which takes place late 1500s . career tactics this admiral still studied u.s. naval academy , doubtless those other nations . screenplay based couple novels , so there some fiction , but life yi soon shin well documented , so there plenty fact supporting story . if you not familiar korean drama , it good keep mind this not hollywood product , but they very well special effects such considering non-hollywood budgets involved , it easy see past all enjoy tale told . it long series , but presents epic power , depth dimension well worth watching it unfold through each every episode . it would great also see kbs make other dramas available viewing through amazon , such " seoul 1945 " .	1

watched this film three times since 1996 , i keep revisiting it hoping maybe something me would change make me like this film more , but it hasn't!!!when movie wins nine academy awards i think , maybe " intelligentia " knows better . they don't!!!this film positively plodding . acting or screenplay not anything exceptional any way . ( no small wonder fiennes scot t-t homas beat out ! )i am person who usually moved what i see , but more i view this picture , more i realize why seinfeld show dedicated whole episode their hate this movie . when i revisit nominees 1996 i see what weak field this film up against , but certainly fargo , shine , secrets lies even jerry maguire more compelling than this 3-hour bore . each his/her own . you either love it or hate it . i preferred latter vehemently	-1

no this isn't courtney friends , but once you get past - this must watch tv ! while show content shocking , it so well written edited it all fits . it definitely sequential drama makes much more sense watching episodes back back . fleshes out characters so you start care understand them . courtney shows her acting chops best those moments when she silent lets her expressions say it all because sometimes her dialog bit stilted . best character functional schizophrenic photographer , don konkey . he exhibits endearing combination weirdness , loyalty , insight sweetness become break-out star this series . if you only watched one episode wrote this one off - go back watch few back back you may just find yourself addicted .	1

" screamers " based short story " second variety , " late , great author philip . dick . same author who brought us " androids dream electric sheep , " aka " blade runner " " we remember it you wholesale " aka " total recall " more recently fine film " scanner darkly . " although film itself without doubt low budget film , movie itself still entertaining . this sci-fi film takes place year 2078 . it time continual warfare , both miners who refuse mine anymore due radiation , corporations who control future military , political , economic base . enter colonel joe hendricksson ( peter weller ) . he charge small group survivors still fighting war he himself sick . planet sirius 6b also host new fighting element : screamers . screamers mechanical machines kill anything moving surface . atrocious casualties both sides thinning ranks what once thriving colony , machines created help continue fight . only these machines evolved . like their human counterparts battle , they learned kill more efficiently : even creating newer more advanced killer-screamers . when spaceship crashlands sirius 6b , one survivor informs colonel hendricksson some disturbing news . reports so-called cease-fire promised lie . news reports sent back past 2 years fabricated . moreover , he now believes war senseless never end . therefore , he sets out make contact other commander enemy forces make peace ; since leaders back earth won't , he decides end war . this film very good low budget film . performance peter weller disillusioned commmander colonel hendricksson , stands up very well film . ' screamers ' they razor-sharp , fast moving machines cut down anything or anybody moving . although film would better if more money allocated into it production , it still very good film overall . i highly recommend film , it entertaining worth watch .	1
i saw this movie when i student latin literature thought it captured spirt plautus plays brilliantly . later , i saw stage prodction which i liked well . but no one replace zero mostel . he one most naturally funny men world . this vulgar bawdy even corny times but it lots fun . it one my favourite comedy movies all time .	1
i trying years find this " clownhouse " movie . it such hoot watch , but also some really creepy scenes make your hair stand end . clowns always given me creeps , my entire life , this movie really scare someone like me ! i watched it group people , all us would jump parts here there . no sci fi or special effects this movie , just good " really could happen " horror movie . what fun !!! this one those old movies you know you watch over over years .	1
this not only my favorite western , but it also one my favorite films . i don't buy lot videos own , but i this one my permanent library . when dvd comes out i'll sure get it , too . when i first saw this theaters ' 72 i attracted action , humor , sentimentality ( i still can't keep dry eye when i watch final scene watch bear .... ) i got older i realised there lot more this movie . there consistent theme law justice , distinction them . when we first see roy bean he petty outlaw , less than man . he total contempt law justice , which he doesn't distinguish . then , when he first becomes " judge " , it dubious title only- fill his own pockets . time goes he intuitively dispenses true justice name law . final climactic scene , when asked who he , he replies simply , " justice . " he gone full cycle , scoff-law less than man , embodyment justice itself , more than man . you'll notice his chief adversary lawyer gass , man knows everything law nothing justice . " man " steals more legal trickery than old outlaws ever dreamed stealing . it this movie made me see law creation men , while justice ideal emanates directly god . i don't know if this theme john huston mind , but it what i get out it	1

original " candidate " masterpiece , awfully creepy film , considering subject matter . i personally would not watch original first then this ; i'd it other way around . this film loosely takes idea first one replaces communism scare corporate conspiracy . oh , it still works just fine , but only few scenes i find myself comparing it back original one . meryl streep absolutely chews scenery this film , playing combination hillary/coulter/matalin hybrid who suffocates her son ( sacrifices him , literally ) because her political " true believer " status . her tirade directly fellow party members who initially reject making her son vp nominee classic . it reminded me alec baldwin chewing up his five minutes " glengarry glen ross . " most fun movie watching liev schreiber start unravel he realizes what they remember gulf war not what it seemed , early scene where fellow vet confronts denzel character after rah-rah speech boy scouts his kuwait exploits . they don't waste much time here before letting you know something really wrong . jonathan demme directs he uses his " silence lambs " technique extreme facial closeups great , disorienting effect . it pretty freaky , quite often . they update original " trigger " isn't visual one but verbal one , which i thought nice touch . repeated viewings , you'll catch some things you didn't notice before going background some " i just see ...? " cameos , most notably one only robyn hitchcock . i swear , one scene background , guy who either or really looks like barry white playing security agent . one last highlight completely over-the-top " convention " climax , when two candidates come out face crowd . " theatricality " over-the-top absurdity it all ( new mt . rushmore ?! ) probably seemed ridiculously funny few years ago , but would probably irony-free these days . oh yeah , you'll never look cup o ' noodles same again after this . this movie isn't just thriller elements modern mk-ultra conspiracy but also commentary our current political system , whereas original dealt more freaky thought communist sleeper agents our midst . highly recommended . hey , it demme after all--it hard go wrong this . if you liked final explanation/twist what happened ' nam " jacob ladder , " this right up your alley	1

nearly all movies made kurt vonnegut books simply awful ( happy birthday wanda june , mother night , breakfest champions ) . there one delightful exception -- slaughterhouse five . makers this film took time trouble make their movie subtle . they accepted fact vonnegut never appealed loud , over-stimulated , self-absorbed , resource-guzzling masses . kurt books appeal directly depressed , quiet , suffering young men women who still school still think deeply life . hero , billy pilgrim , pretty much carried events happening around him . he finally sees insanity trying take charge his own life learns simply accept things way they . this essentially taoist tale . most stories told vonnegut taoist perspective . hero dropped into middle meat grinder life told repeatedly he must not allow himself turned into hamburger . but , contrary his most feverish guilt-ridden efforts , he turned into hamburger . when he finally accepts reality lump hamburger , life becomes little easier him deal .	1

after living this film 15 years , it seems me best description its theme comes words character liz ( jane birkin ) , who context speaking work her husband , painter frenhofer . according her , it concerns something " shameful--it not body shameful , not nudity , but something else . . . " " something else " violation , existentially speaking , enigma painter model . such violation cannot seen without mediation art . cinematic context , it risk direction takes whenever it approaches its subject frontally , we see rivette tendency retreat wide shots , place events off-screen , or circle behind his players . this critique bresson , who insisted calling his players " models " rather than " actors ? " ( it impossible not recall storied psychological scars bresson methods allegedly left his players . ) it clearly not simple , there close-ups noiseuse seem cruel actors frenhofer his model . this goes beyond bresson other ways : rivette , always reader , patched together thumping good story literary sources ranging poe balzac james , process created true mystery thriller . mystery hinges four-minute shots hand scratching out drawing makes it no less thrilling . it tumbles forward toward profoundly ironic ending worthy best james novels . initial critical take this film it most thorough document artistic process ever committed film . well , yes no . it seems artistic process painter , but i think there may playful game " bait-and-switch " afoot . watch b�art . watch , especially , piccoli , who veritable encyclopedia actor art , mesmerizing his scudding , absent-minded movements he his sudden precision , always surprising . rivette devotion actors clear all his films : think his sets , so resembling stages their creaky boards , sound " effect " rivette more often than not takes place score . it may artist canvas , plaster , stone , or screen may reveal something secret , even shameful , his models . it may even unscrupulous artist thief soul . but rivette , one , shows la belle noiseuse he given these things some serious thought . he always generous his actors . result trust artist model demonstrated this film amounts strong rebuke idea film cannot show thought . it ; it comes price , but hands master it great gift players it audience	1

official story excellent example how mix political cinema human drama , avoiding agitprop or crude sloganeering put human face issue argentina disappeared - particular children taken away undesirables given well-connected families who won't ask any questions . when one well-heeled adopted mother learns this begins suspect her adopted daughter may one those children , rather than turn into sermon film focuses her own fears she tries disprove possibility until ultimately she same uncertain hell families disappeared - she suspect , but she never truly know . although some devices may seem little too schematic - she history teacher who depends solely `verifiable ' official version her country history - it wears them lightly often extremely powerful . best foreign film oscar rather dubious history , but this definitely one more deserving winners	1

first all , i would like start off saying this movie sucks . here few things supports my decision . 1 . dacascos not know capoeira . he played berimbau ( insrument used capoeira ) wrong , he pronouced many terms incorrectly , he no flow his movements . 2 . acting horrible . while watching this , you kind get picture director wanted finish this movie soon possible . most lines just stupid . dacascos character no real history . apparently this mysterious past you really could care less because plot so predictable . 3 . fighting laughable best . capoeira only martial art outlawed so violent unstoppable . you don't need corny fight scenes show it usefulness . most fight scenes where repeated movements shot different angles . dacascos doing meia lua ( spinning kick which both hands ground you strike ) knocking out three people once . one ridiculous scene , saverio ( drug lord ) pointed where he wanted dacascos stand so he could miraculously appear behind him perform unchallenged jumping kick back his head . i wish experinced capoeirista would fight scenes . although this movie horrible , it only movie which capoeira suppose main artform used . while watching this movie , one only hope this poor performance dosen't hurt capoeira chances cornerstone movie .	1
my boyfriend loves charlie brown so this great gift him	1
we should start making one thing clear : films zalman king no basis reality whatsoever ; they're erotic fantasies , pure simple . how else explain his casting choices leading roles his films : carrie otis , sherilyn fenn , david duchovony , richard tyson , bridgette bako , etc . people real life seldom sex appeal above-mentioned names . then there stories cloak these fine specimens , which almost always involve young innocent woman led down road sexual discovery , usually domineering though charming man , who she secretly lusted after sometime . what king films lack dramatic verve , they make up hitting their intended target : your libido . critics pounced like never before his feature film adaptation anais ninn erotic classic , ' delta venus . ' but they clearly missed point , ' delta venus ' isn't so much feature film , it most epic , most visually beautiful episode king 90s showtime series , ' red shoe diaries . ' context , it succeeds its fairly modest goals . set 1940s paris , ' venus ' introduces us aspiring writer named elena ( audie england ) . what appears morning ritual , she rushes banks sienne bitter january cold , muted urgency , one thing : watch handsome lawrence ( costas mandylor) -- man she yet meet --- row through foggy river . it isn't too long before she meets lawrence party thrown her agent , marcel ( eric da silva ) , discovers lawrence also writer , thriving , if controversial career . he , fact , leave france american tour support his latest effort --- but not before whirlwind affair elena , which far more profound effect her than she could ever imagined . lawrence gone , no money , no luck getting her stories published , elena crew friends --- artist , singer , their same-sex lovers --- suggest elena model nude cash . but marcel got more lucrative idea : she could write explict sex stories nameless collector erotica , who'll pay her handsomely it . ulitmately , elena accepts both offers , when collector , through marcel , insists graphic realism her stories , she ups ante her own sex life , fullfilling her desperate " desire plunge into living " " capable many loves . " audie england performance elena unfairly panned . she isn't great actress , but she just right mix doe-eyed innocence , restless intelligence , raw sensuality bubbling just beneath surface make her believeable . her initial scenes mandylor mildly touching , we see her teeter school-girl crush burning womanly desire . if nothing else , she least marked improvement over woozy carrie otis ' wild orchid . ' take how you may . costas mandylor really isn't this movie much , but he makes most what there . two chemistry , without which ' delta venus ' would really terrible critics said . granted , king doesn't always hit mark ' delta'--a sequence set party st. tropez particularly irritating his reach themes seem overextend his grasp . there definitely points which dialogue seem strain capture nin prose . critics also complained this film simply doesn't reflect reality life 1940s france . ( ugh . ) but counter , go back top this review read first sentence again . you really expecting zalman king give you blow-by-blow hitler invasion france ? if you're going this simply watch interesting love story -- turned beautiful cinematography , gorgeous actors , atmospheric lushness -- you not disappointed . fans tv show ' lost ' fans get kick out cameo made adewale akinnoyue-agbaje mysterious clairvoyant who gives ... special reading redheaded prostitute	1

i skeptical this film expected disappointed , but contrary , i pleasantly surprised . essential thing remember this maurice pialat * vision * van gogh , not documentary . taken spirit , there much here vincent fans enjoy . those unfamiliar van gogh life work likely lost ( probably bored ) , but those who familiar vincent his oeuvre appreciate research pialat put into this film artistic choices he made . i also encourage viewers who may felt they missed something first time watch it second time , because there many small things best noticed second time round . one detail i particularly appreciated replication van gogh actual room auberge ravoux auvers-sur-oise this film ( not case " lust life " or " vincent theo " ) ; those who visited auberge moved their experience -- like myself -- feel surge recognition first time humble little room appears onscreen . course there some major inaccuracies/speculations pialat uses fuel drama . most obvious central love affair film ( marguerite gachet ) , which pialat invention most implausible number reasons . but it serves its purpose context film . i not get impression ( one reviewer below ) affair presented motive suicide--it not . suicide affair both result larger malaise . jacques dutronc simply extraordinary vincent , his acting filled subtlety . he doesn't stoop histrionics or scenery-chewing ... he doesn't need . every gesture , every facial expression , every look his eyes says something character . no wonder he won cesar role . this neither vincent " lust life " ( kirk douglas ' tormented soul searching love understanding ) nor vincent " vincent theo " ( tim roth mad-as-a-hatter egoist ) . this vincent quiet cup coffee before he goes work morning escapes dr. gachet house enjoy solitary lunch wheatfields ( latter one my favorite moments film -- simple but lyrical ) . there no sign " mad artist " van gogh mythology . suicide comes much surprise film it must real life . we don't see it coming . apparently there region 2 dvd available uk deleted scenes bonus materials . i wish it available region 1 dvd us !	1
i really like this film . first all it absolutely beautiful look . tahoe water water everywhere - all sumptuously photographed . story emotionally intense rollercoaster lengths mother go protect her children . intense , often suspensful sometimes creepy , this keeper . swinton amazing here - like one raw jangling nerve . she amazing watch . rest cast fine their roles , whether shady , clueless or sympathetic . well worth view	1
i cannot believe all negative reviewers . obviously you never adult party where people behave like teenagers after delt alcohol mixed drug nobody ever tried before their age . least not here . but i similar party , it ended similarly . fights happen , but not serious . you take things happen party open mindedness or not them . your husband or wife or girlfriend ... etc ., not going behave usual you see bad side them . if relationship can't handle one party like this one , it probably can't survive marriage . story kept me interested almost whole way through except female gossip got alittle boring , otherwise very watchable , funny tragic . i would like see it again	1
put together powerhouse talent like brilliant mary-louise parker , hilarious whoopi goldberg , sweet drew barrymore , you " boys side " : cinema gold . this movie takes you entertaining ride , pulls your hearstrings like 18 wheeler end . two thumbs up	1
if you like movies i , this dvd set should satisfy any film fanatic over 21 ( that right ) extra features -- clearly prototype what we film fans want our dvd sets . see producer irwin allen his rolls royce pink polyester leisure suit ( complete white shoes ) discussing finer points ' poseidon adventure " " towering inferno " he takes us tour through 20th century fox informative it funny . commentaries film historian f.x. feeney sfx director , mike vezina , add dimension understanding this interesting film . much already written this film itself other amazon critics here , suffice say acting this motion picture ( save two little brats jennifer jones ' charge ) quite good newman architect mcqueen fire captain , both excellently cast . then again , when these actors ever disappointed audiences their respective roles ? veterans faye dunaway bill holden rarely disappoint , richard chamberlain downright creepy , even fred astaire ( 80 years age when this made ) manages inject some needed satire here there he tries woo jennifer jones . those sf bay area , setting this movie san francisco distinctive lobby hyatt regency embarcadero used many scenes first half movie . ok , this not going long review , film not really impart any substantial revelations life death . i could get very deep argue film metaphor man vanity ego dedicated capitalistic excesses power , wealth greed , but let get real--it just one damn exciting movie excellent special effects ( academy awards cinematography editing ) , reasonably good acting all around , edge-of-your-seat entertainment . i just hope they don't make remake la " poseidon adventure " this film -- irwin allen rendition just fine .	1

so fireman ball gentle look human comedy or it sly subversive poke nose inept , authoritarian government ? perhaps we should take word director milos forman . it just gentle comedy , he'd shrug his native czechoslovakia after picture released 1967 . course it subversive , he'd say , after he'd flee his country 1968 , when soviet tanks sent install tougher , duller brand communist leaders snuff out brief prague spring . how subversive ? new czech leadership immediately banned movie " permanently forever . " all this , it still one sweetest , most good-natured looks how people behave , even their leaders , who undoubtedly among most bumbling , self-serving incompetent group men you'd ever hope not meet . small czechoslovakian town leadership fire department planning ball raffle honor their aged former chief . they'd planned year before his 85th birthday but , well , they never quite got around it . now he dying cancer they feel they really ought something . there great banner meeting hall , dance drinks food , beauty contest featuring town young women , great raffle donated delicacies , bottles wine toys cosmetics . but , oh . one thing after happens sweet irony , banner burns . girls don't want take part . slowly , item item , things begin go missing raffle table ... first chocolate cake , then bottle cognac , head cheese , chocolate ball . " every one stealing here , " wife one blustering fireman tells him ., " you only watch , you old honest idiot ! " she one stolen headcheese her bag . firemen entertainment committee , group puffed-up aging men , dither bicker endlessly over details problems . " busts ... busts important " one thing they all agree they examine candidates beauty contest . one point head firemen committee stops music tells crowd some items taken raffle table . he says lights go out few minutes he expects items returned . lights go off . lights come back . even more items table missing . it all looks like ball eventually end shambles , but then they hear alarm . farm house fire nearby . firemen townsfolk rush fire manage rescue aged farmer his underwear . but fire engine stuck snow . there no water pressure . farm house burns down ground . but least firemen find way comfort cold , old man . while he watches his possessions burn , they suggest he move his chair closer fire keep warm . this such wry gentle comedy , so sweet-natured , it reassuring realize leaden hand czech authoritarianism now long gone , this movie remains all us . this criterion presentation looks sounds just fine . there excellent interview milos forman	1
" bedazzled " my personal favorite film , although it not always laugh-out-loud funny , it consistently surprises viewer its wit theological discussions regarding nature feud god devil . plot involves plight stanley moon ( played nerdy perfection dudley moore ) who works wimpy hamburger stand longs after his co-worker margaret spencer ( eleanor bron ) . after reviewing his personal situation life , moon decides suicide his only option . last second devil walks ( played peter cook his best ) offers stanley seven wishes exchange his soul . hopefully , this dvd this film justice some nice special features . very least , it gives viewer intriguing option woefully mediocre remake . remember magic words : " julie andrews !	1

formula familiar but enjoyable . group british tough guys assembled enterprise combines violence humor , while cherishing their peculiar personalities even finding goodness where none should grow . we've prisoners winning gardening competition , pot dealers helping little old ladies , crooks leaving crime life real estate agents . now here " mean machine , " corrupt british soccer champion , jailed rigging important match , ordered prison governor coach inmates ' team . big match against guards ' team . if this premise rings faint , far-off bell , you may remembering robert aldrich " longest yard " ( 1974 ) , one burt reynolds ' best performances , told same story , more or less , terms american football . barry skolnick " mean machine " more than inspired " longest yard ; " it based same tracy keenan wynn screenplay , indeed " mean machine " even original title " longest yard .

i understand why people prefer videos like live sunset strip , but what those people fail see this one rawest , most heart-wrenching stand-up performances ever put film . start finish , pryor laying himself bare--i'd give this video four stars his boldness alone -- completely honest moment , without care whether audience " " him or not . several times they clearly not -- you sense tension room when he chastises walk-out admits homosexual experiences . it monologue where pryor transforms himself into " willy junkie , " however , makes this video must anyone interested art stand-up comedy . it masterpiece audience manipulation -- first , it seems like harmless , amusing caracature , but soon it morphs into horrifyingly honest portrayl . i dare anyone watch this not strong reaction some sort ( it me tears ) . granted , it isn't funny ( who says stand-up funny all times ? ) , but it shows what pryor best : exploring area most people spend their whole lives trying avoid -- rock bottom .	1

after watching " new jack city " , " sugar hill " definitely similar , but milder , pared down version former , still stark realities street life drug trade common denominator . while new jack , wesley snipes character " nino " cold , bloodthirsty , womanizing , heartless druglord . snipes ' role carmello sh much more conservative terms his mannerisims , attire , he compassionate , humane , sympathetic , but still not forgetting he first foremost drug kingpin who needs take care business . ironically , carmello must care his ailing father , whose life shambles result abusing same product made his own son rich , eventually succumbs . i would even go limb say nino njc could regarded re-incarnated life this film character(carmello ) . carmello eventually tires his life dealer , realizes there more life than jet set lifestyle , wealth material things . eventually , carmello given chance redemption , but must live rest his life crippling injury inflicted his own brother , who eventually dies well . carmello starts over far concrete jungles nyc new wife child . remarkable clarence williams , ernie hudson , vondie curtis-hall , lovely theresa randle , abe vigoda other actors add depth this film . even after 10 years , this movie still hits home	1
this movie absolutely incredible . i loved every minute it . i think it safe say leonardo dicaprio outstanding actor even his young age . he robert de niro make fantastic pair actors . 5 stars	1
you more neurons firing your frontal lobe than average 14 year old this one . some called this " mockumentary " , but term oversimplifies film . this love story . it not " boy loves girl , loses girl , then gets girl back " . it " boy loves himself until he meets girl ( " hattie " - " sweet " one ) he unwittingly loves more than himself , dumps her , gets girl ( " blanch " - " lowdown " one ) , marries then divorces her , only then realizes how much he loved hattie ... then just fades away ... without her . " just like real life , there many hilarious moments shared intertwining souls wide ranging idiosyncrasies , but just like real life , true love infinite then gone instant . this why film presented documentary - " true story " . characters , time , place all arbitrary meant entertain you while delivering classic tale love unappreciated then lost forever . sometimes there isn't " hollywood ending " love story .	1
i thought supernatural would just sci-fi thriller , but then i started watching it surprised discover there real plot line character development . i think this show wonderful would recommend it everyone	1
spoiler alert : it rather hard review this film without giving away some key components . i don't normally include so-call " spoilers " my reviews , but this case it lot themes film . this film came out during glorious era spiritual horror flicks like " exorcist " " omen , " because great success those films , this humdinger sadly overlooked . this truly horrifying film deserves place your dvd collection , especially if you into this specific genre spiritual horror flicks . cast impressive list actors who , unfortunately , has-beens 70 , or up coming actors who now rather famous . christina raines , main actress , sadly , never made it big she should she gives very solid performance rather difficult disturbing film . i found other actors good , but bit hammy times , but doesn't detract overall impression film . fact , it may , bizarre way , add it considering casting actual freaks , forgive political incorrectness term , film . this film like freak show sorts or car accident itself . we don't really want see what screen , but we can't help ourselves . there enough this film revolt some infuriate many , especially it condemnation " sins man " we try accept today our over indulgence term " tolerance . " when one sees this odd film , one must keep mind it based catholic faith interpretation sin , certainly instution not well-known it tolerance any sin . so if you inclined whatever feels good your life , especially point excess , you may find yourself squirming your seat bit while watching this film either out awkward sense guilt seeing your sins kind exposed this film , or anger your way life isn't considered " acceptable " staunch religious . no one likes someone pointing condemning finger him or her , even when it may earned . our natural instinct either feel shame or anger or even mixture both . way , i mean " freak show " literally when i mentioned it earlier . i don't care term myself , but those film considered themselves such i grew up time location no problem term , so please excuse my use it here i honestly don't mean rude . there less make-up involved this film than most aware actual circus freaks used film , especially climax scene . fact , my dad knew number them they part freak show coney island , famous amusement park south brooklyn where i spent many summer day riding cyclone roller coaster . occasion my dad would take me some bizarre shows park it interesting then see those shows film later able say " i know guy ! " me , young age when seeing it , it added oddity film . my parents obviously far too permissive films they let me see when i young . i saw this film when it came out " exorcist " " omen " i barely my teens then . anyhow , i grew up bensonhurst not too far where they filmed this movie i recall taking pictures actual house where they filmed exterior shots ; i unfortunately lost them over years . house neighborhood very congested red hook section brooklyn , despite directly across river bustling manhattan overcrowded section brooklyn , there intense feeling isolation conveyed film . much credit this goes director , michael winner , achieving this via camera positioning . course , he experienced shooting new york directed brilliant " death wish " charles bronson earlier . whole concept film bit silly but weirdly interesting lone priest guards gates hell until he passes guardianship over someone else before his death . if he unable so , then gates hell remain open they temporarily left ajar during transition one " sentinel " next . idea satan , played burgess meredith , comes up keep hell gates open open wide convince new sentinel commit suicide , mortal sin catholic church something main character attempted once before her life , instead accepting thankless life isolation servitude means redemption past sins . silly premise film , one can't help but feel both uplifted end sad new sentinel her sacrifice made behalf thankless strangers . analogy christ crucifixation life priest/nunhood clear here notion how sinful , ugly , sadly self-centered suicide viewed catholic church many outside it . please spare me negative comebacks this isn't my personal view suicide . i tend feel god takes great pity those who not face trials life often brings those who attempt or succeed suicide often distraught not thinking clearly . i trouble believing god would punish such troubled soul , but discussion ( argument ? ) . like " exorcist " " omen " before it , we sadden losses sustained sacrifices made end main characher who may not totally noble but certainly likable . " sentinel " alison reluctantly takes role new guardian . she wanted so much out life already felt god owed her something , hence her suicide attempt earlier , yet , she still gives god others spite her past pain . one can't help see how she may offered redemption her past mistakes taking this burden , but she allowed free not accept it , but she although she may so begrudingly , she it salvation world . " exorcist " father karras not , misinterpreted some , commit suicide end , but rather sacrifices himself save regan , possessed girl ( he catches demon souls so-to-speak ) . " omen " peck character , mr. thorn , willing kill his only son save world . sound biblically familiar all ? these spiritual horror flicks popular reason still because we respect those willing sacrifice themselves selflessly others , even if they don't really want it . perhaps it because we may think ourselves incapable such action or would like believe we would take same road these heroes . it matters little end what your religious beliefs or if you any all . we just can't help moved one so noble nature , even if he or she reluctant so ( consider george bailey " it wonderful life " ) , giving all he or she our benefit . consider our love appreciation soldiers who fight us , police firemen who equally risk their lives us , complete strangers you get my drift . i always enjoyed these kinds spiritual horror films when they well-acted , written directed , they become classics . i am bit reluctant label this film " classic " , but it still excellent film holds up well . it didn't define genre like others i mentioned , but it certainly accomplishes what it set out . it frightens us appropriate times , grosses us out others ( it very graphic ) gets us see both worst best humankind . it may not true classic like " exorcist " or " omen " , but it certainly solid companion such films worth spot your shelf	1
this movie started out good but then got all mushy action gunfire . good snowboarding stunts , cast great , sawa looks little scruffy looking . like i said , snowboarding action , dont mix well it gets muddled when badguys come alon	1
film adaptation hit abc series 1960 it all . action , danger , romance , comedy ! adam west burt ward their best batman robin , lee meriwether just sexy catwoman than julie newmar(who unable appear film prior commitment ) , cesar romero , burgess meridith frank gorshin hilariously excellent villains . special features dvd mini-documentary featuring adam burt talking their days set batman movie , there also tour 1966 batmobile told man who made it possible , george barris . i love this film , i not seen it years . it may not tv series we wished , but it close enough	1
c'mon now , fess up : you ever really believe john wayne cowboy ? or any other actors 30s , 40s 50s westerns ? their clean shirts , their white hats , their crisp scarves their middle-america ethics , they convincing harrison ford president united states . westerns times past what we wanted west , not what it . because real west wasn't pretty it wasn't romantic . it stank ! this movie i able believe western setting first time . altman mccabe mrs. miller ( novel edmund naughton ) not only deconstructs cliches -- lone hero standing up lots bad guys , hooker heart gold , town pulls together -- it suggests far more plausible realities how west won . altman town business its own survival . while , roger ebert points out , " everybody knows everybody , " long before picture started , there no team spirit here . each character mercenary , no one noble . that probably how it real west if you wanted survive past next tuesday . that probably why film focuses so much church--it little bastion relief after all hypocracy goes monday through saturday . early beatty mccabe says he trying get away " partners , " people coming into his life telling him what . one altman central points you cannot world mirrors organism , where many parts not single cell what determine survival . more even than fred schepisi excellent underrated barbarosa ( 1976 ) , this western anti-hero . or maybe non-hero . we sense mccabe not escape men who want his business interest first time they meet -- everyone seems figure out but him . mrs. miller also seems fleeing something--we're never sure what exactly -- but she appears out whole cloth looking mccabe says she " sent " look him , not really explaining anything explanation . her motivation hooking up him remains elusive me . she could better elsewhere . -- or maybe she just needed man boss around . rest cast what ensemble casts robert altman films : they advance director bird eye view his surroundings . quirky shelley duvall low-key john schuck , they inhabit brutal world , both emotionally physically . conditions harsh . everyone everything dirty . nights dark . comforts few , mostly found bottle intercourse , both social carnal . it any wonder these people care only themselves ? final message i took away mccabe mrs. miller . towns -- business empires , everything else -- founded tough people who persevere anything but romantic idealized symbols they become much later . west john ford , william wyler , tall cowboys god-fearin ' townsfolk , comforting . it disneyland vision how we came , higher purpose part mix . but whether it big corporations or big towns , their survival result violent actions , amoral choices pure survival instinct . it instinct mccabe , despite his own sort anti-hero , lacks , pays ultimate price . wal-mart comes town . that part american story too . we subscribe this myth america land rugged individualism , but fact america embodies collective corporate more probably than any other non-totalitarian country face earth . or maybe even counting totalitarian countries--it just different kind totalitarianism . freedom , altman tells us , myth , or least type freedom americans always hold theirs theirs uniquely . it not kind film leave you smile you walk out theater , but then , most robert altman movies aren't . way , this film antithesis wyler big country , which tells us there plenty everything everybody , everyone his piece . 1950s , seemed true enough . time we reached 1970s , however , world different place . film gorgeously shot one my favorite cinematographers , vilmos zsigmund . it cold beauty , but if you find poetry mud puddles cloudy skies , you impressed . ( this one few movies i've ever seen where rain actually * beautiful . *) extremely low-key lighting matches mood , makes us feel cut off rest world . ( i don't know why gordon willis got slammed so much godfather his lack light when this movie made year earlier every bit dark . ) leonard cohen songs perfect complement . their contemporary feel lyrics tell us western genre deconstructed , once all . some people , mccabe mrs. miller may not their cup tea . it film yields more after subsequent viewings . there not lot plot , few elements there still baffle me -- shooting one coyboy cold blood no apparent reason , example . film takes its time get point point , this post-star wars world may prove frustrating some . still , those who take their time it , mccabe mrs. miller beautiful poem west , both real one one exists solely our imaginations . print good , though not pristine . music track sounds fine , but sometimes dialogue murky hard understand -- even altman . supposedly he asked clean up some sound elements some reason refused . trailer , surprisingly , anamorphic . ( you won't care unless you hdtv . ) there not much extras , just altman commentary ( that pretty good once ) short tv behind-the-scenes documentary . i liked this film lo t--t o me it one those great " 70s sensibility " flicks like chinatown godfather network -- but i understand how it might acquired taste , especially today	1
characters likable , there some decent progression growth seen over course film , but only half scenes necessary . it seems if they just wanted give gene wilder few more chances quirky . gene funny guy , there no doubt , but enough enough ! film family friendly , except few instances harsh language violence , but it really nothing compared sorts things get into theaters these days . it worth look , but only if you're willing deal some pretty decent stretches time when there not lot progression story	1
this series just tad too much blood my taste ... it verges horror , here there , which bugs me ; i even like super-violent action movies just fine , but brutally slaughtered recent corpse thing ( more ' personalized ' violence than killing bad guys ) not my style . this why i gave it 4 instead 5 stars . aside detail , i find this show totally addictive . brothers make ' buddy movie ' effect , whole supernatural framework creates sort non-religious yet definitely spiritual effect ( big mystery why these guys never ever seen praying show ; i actually known people who lifestyle similar what show depicts , central ) . not mention young men so passionate , powerful , strong , yet sensitive , darkly troubled past , sheer sexy it nearly intoxicating over long run many episodes . ;-) anyway -- show actual plot , it well filmed intelligently well worth watching . i recommend it	1

i saw series when it shown originally pbs tv many years ago . edition i purchased technically somewhat dated slightly edited , some interesting scenes -such account verdi last hours his faithful friend libretist arrigo boito- deleted . movie filmed largely location , which makes very realistic setting . example scenes busseto , which aside modern conveniences charming it must century ago particularly moving . there no option select language sub-titles , die-hard italianophiles settle english . performance all actors superb , after while one forgets they not speaking verdi mother tongue . film life verdi must-have verdi aficionados	1

this movie i fell love immediately . i borrowed it friend once , couldn't get enough- i've seen it so many times ! there parts it i felt could've better , but it overall definitely wins my praise . one thing i say those who not caribbean descent it may little difficult understand language . though i think this significantly adds movie , one who not speak jamaican patois may trouble . i myself am not caribbean . i many west indian friends listen lot reggae , so i understand patois pretty well . but even , it took me two viewings get everything said . so if you don't speak or understand it , watch movie someone who , or watch it repeatedly till you get it ! enjoy	1

i seen many historical war dramas far east ( mainly china ) most them not only historically inaccurate but strong bias toward enemy . yi soon shin , however , rare exception . not only drama very historically accurate but it also very comprehensive detailing meticulous battle planning admiral leads each victory but also political in-fighting chosun political factions ( second-guessing nature king ) which causes his eventual death . also , special effects great . battle scenes ( whether sea or land ) realisitic outstanding quality . only problem i find dvd not placed sufficient focus contribution ming china . then again , this not unexpected since this korean drama focusing great admiral . also , entire selection should 104 episodes . i don't know why it stops 101 . if you want more comprehensive knowledge subject , try samuel hawley imjin war ( which portrays yi soon shin more accurately quoting original sources ) . any who only intered fighting may also want check out stephen turnbull samurai invasion ( which more colorful maps detailed description battles japanese perspective ) . lastly , anyone who fan samurai warfare may want check out shogun : total war creative assembly ( now gold version ) .	1
storyline movie simple one : two soldiers captured people who live mountains . leader people mountains wants trade them his son , who prison . so leader tells two captured men write their mothers tell them come get them they make deal , so so forth . movie not one greatest movies i seen , but it not terrible piece . ending great completely unexpected . , i'm not sure if it just me , but plot character motivation seemed derived viewer common sense rather than any real motive movie . example older soldier kills sheep herder ; whole exchange seems like something out monty python . throughout movie there sense humor , me person i watched it laughing hysterically few scenes ( most notable when prisoners get drunk ) random times throughout . overall film gave off surrealist feel . it never quite seemed real all . exchanges characters just keep getting more more unrealistic ( i'm not sure if writer planned or not , but it seem lag near end ) . movie definitely loses points front . also there never seemed any real connection things . beginning threw me off , when they attacked them brought them back horses threw me off . it somewhat difficult get into movie , but once it got going it easier watch , then it drug then it over . not recipe success my eyes . although i'm not sure if way russian cinema , but certainly isn't way american cinema runs , least not kind deemed good quality . but overall i would recommend watching it , it good movie . but sure you're watching it someone else so you able laugh them share few raised eyebrows plot how doesn't seem realistic .	1

i'm absolutely stunned . i wouldn't surprised if every five or ten minutes words ' wow ' or ' oh my god ' came out my mouth . last half hour most phenomenal part movie me . i think i sat there my jaw hanging open whole time . it completely disturbing but , same time , amazing fascinating . there so much goes movie , but it all makes sense somehow ... yet , it all so utterly confusing . this film absolutely brilliant i believe this jeremy iron finest performance . i went into movie aware both twins played jeremy irons but middle movie characters no longer jeremy irons , they beverly elliot mantle , which what i believe acting supposed . i wouldn't say this my favorite movie , fact , i wouldn't even put it my top ten . but most intriguing amazing movies , best acted role , i would put this film right top . my recommendation you would rent this movie yourself stunned just like i . you may not want add it your permanent dvd collection , but this movie worth seeing least once . ( note : there some disturbing images movie . if you don't tough stomach , you may not want watch movie .	1
wasn't this movie made cary grant most money , most successful grant film , one broke record consecutive weeks ny radio city music hall ? after recent re-viewing , i see why , although it hardly grant best . fact , i don't suppose it even approaches his top twenty . tony curtis , it different story . tony , signed most his studio career universal , didn't really get much chance develop his full potential , except oddities like some like it hot , vikings , spartacus , most his films pretty much dreck . ( think all classic directors whom janet leigh worked , then ask yourself how tony fail take advantage his status #1 usa leading man . ) but operation petticoat give you idea kinds things tony best , kudos young blake edwards writing him such good part page after page surefire comic situations stage business . script filmed ten years later , well , grant wouldn't it course , but i think times would allowed more full implications tony character sleazy promiscuity emerge ; here sexuality tamped bit submarine setting general radio city atmosphere . wasn't cary grant even least little bit annoyed playing script which he would basically old fuddy-duddy like james cagney mister roberts , tony playboy , signature cary grant role ? fact operation petticoat must trying some " everyman " service comedy mister roberts , it same febrile energy , his awkward introduction servicewomen other female stereotypes , something same drab fire ; i imagine women enter both films only suggest there wasn't any hanky-panky cary tony because no way could either them gay . dina merrill appropriately icy here , though she knows she not really welcome , she just there allay suspicion . i love her look , but she no grace kelly , that sure , human warmth far away her range working-class solidarity	1
this simply response latest review made " viewer " this film . i , quite simply , feel review level narrow-mindedness film recommend not basing your choice their review . state " world favor get rid them " well saying these criminals " irredeemable beyond any rehabilitation " very prejudiced . lack restorative justice inability find effective deterrent not necessarily fault people who commit criminal acts , but state . before saying you wish cop there " take care hustlers muggers prey upon innocent visitors ( otherwise beautiful ) places like montego bay negril " you should try question why these muggers hustlers even exist . could it because travler presence itself ? anyway , i not believe you justify killing criminals satisfy your own traveling enjoyment . it reasons such this people who lead path criminality not get appropriate attention rehabilitation . try questioning methods state not ' hopelessness ' criminals . i recommend this movie , it a+ . just not watch it mindset this last reviewer quite narrowly insists .	1

what i mean say if you've camp thing before propper age , you'll understand like this movie . some humor this not meant young on . ive going summer camp since i 7 since worked camp . i'm 11 years older ( i'm 18 now ) wiser ; i know dark sexually drived stuff part staffers , how night u get your fellow staffers talk opposite sex , sex , sexuality general . that exactly what this movie its seven 19yr old staff members , each their first year college extreme persona behind them . staff try hide darker things ( well , no , that not exactly true ) infact , i like movie so much because all campers knew what going staff ( better than staff times ) all real summer campers know evesdrop cool older staff . staffers movie find naitivity around them charming indulge their campers ' curiosities questions ; either or they no control over their emotional outbursts . it actually sweet , well-acted , dark comedy . summer love ( gag me spoon ) , fate ( double gag me ) but mainly relationships staffers , campers , how two groups mingle . anyway , part it first love but it not mushy romance , guys girls alike enjoy this , while it wont camp you went , u recognize components movie relate your camp . it just hysterical . movie camp condensed into hour half different aesthetics . so , yeah , i love this movie , me my camp buddies get kick out it , i hope this helpsoh , if you're fan heathers ( made same guy ) like me then you wont disapointed this , unless u liked all suicides heathers find them necessity film enjoyabl	1

i think , perhaps , people want make this movie more complicated study " truth " than it . fact , it tells simple story involving simple truth : we some base instincts motivations which cannot always denied societal mores . film not pleasing those who want see more " character development " same reason " bridges madison county " panned - point movie not who characters why they became who they became . point , two similar spirits met , mingled , moment , loosed themselves artificial restraint . relationship two main characters this film no chance developing into anything beyond lust rutting satisfaction lust . " damage " occurs because lusty rutting offends so many fundamental mores . situation two " lovers " develops it becomes less less human until it finally beyond any control - lust becomes addiction destructive worst kind drug addiction . it doesn't simply " spin " out control - destructive energy builds until it cannot contained . energy such it sucks its other , unaware point , victims into its vortex they all devoured - damage total destruction life it only short time before . film should prompt thoughts " artificial " restraints " normal " urges instincts . what wrong two people physically attracted doing things these people ? what wrong same kinds people who rolled together kitchen floor " bridges madison county ? " " love " require fidelity ? should we not - humans - all concerned emotional damage we cause ourselves those we love not restraining natural urge ? this movie train wreck opening scene . it something you might want look away - but just can't . it might disgust you but it also might thrill you . it reason people listen shock radio watch soap operas . it reason people say our society gone or going hell . it our base nature we like think we don't or , least , under control . it what happens when - if - we ignore our humanity give head our basest instincts . when you watch it , don't just watch it . let yourself go . then , end , wonder if it dream you'd enjoy reality or if you relieved it just dream . it phenomenal movie	1

koreans honor their greatest military hero this epic drama which takes place late 1500s . career tactics this admiral still studied u.s. naval academy , doubtless those other nations . screenplay based couple novels , so there some fiction , but life yi soon shin well documented , so there plenty fact supporting story . if you not familiar korean drama , it good keep mind this not hollywood product , but they very well special effects such considering non-hollywood budgets involved , it easy see past all enjoy tale told . it long series , but presents epic power , depth dimension well worth watching it unfold through each every episode . it would great also see kbs make other dramas available viewing through amazon , such " seoul 1945 " .	1

some books movies wwii haven't aged too well , not because they weren't good , but rather because material or humor so topical , doesn't make modern audience laugh or relate because they weren't there never understand these jokes , get subtle references , or just understand frame mind which this made which audiences time came it . there no doubt this film made during wwii , but even though lot situations jokes products specific time , they're quite funny easy understand . perhaps it not quite technically fine-tuned or tailor-made just them earlier movie masterpieces like ' chump oxford ' ' pack up your troubles ' , but there lot funny moments this . it seems like so many people said lh post-1940 films unfunny/embarrassing/pathetic/etc . people begin believe it never question it . yes , they're lacking special magic present hal roach studios , but doesn't take away fact they still quite funny always great job material . some funniest moments include when they're " helping " pretend-victim edgar kennedy ( wonderful see him playing their slow burn foil again ! ) , when they go into city hall receive their assignments , when they're mr. kennedy house later get into scuffle him ( scuffle leads them dismissed air raid wardens ) . i also immensely enjoyed subplot nazi spies who planning blow up factory , how boys alert townspeople somehow , even though they'd dismissed air raid wardens , save day end . sure it smacks made during wwii , but i love books movies wwii . still , there little things this movie make my rating more like 4.5 than full 5 , like how dumb stan ollie made out . they've always kinda dumb , that large part their appeal , but they dumb sweet endearing way , like two overgrown little kids who didn't know any better , not dumb practically borderline retarded . one jokes supposed stan struggling write four letters his name his air raid warden id card ; this way stupider than they're supposed , almost cruel laugh over , like asked laugh someone who retarded barely able write one name . ollie even says one point , " i guess we're not smart like other people . " i'd strongly recommend this one their best post-1940 features someone who into wwii , but not someone who isn't familiar boys already	1

this among most underrated films i ever seen . characters , casting , subplots , tony goldwyn superb directing , i simply cannot say enough this film . diane lane superb young wife mother whose youth came halt when she becomes pregnant 17 she later child after her daughter . lane character pearl adventurer free spirit who married good man who , alas , unbelievably conventional , uptight , boring , so unromantic i found myself wincing several times throughout movie . scene where he confronts pearl blouse man so lackluster i thinking , " yeah this guy seems really upset " . speaking blouse man ..... far i am concerned viggo mortensen most devine man who ever graced this planet . he already overwhelming artist activist , but when one adds his superb acting abilities list he almost unbearable . mortensen role jerome walker among his best performances far his most sensual . moment pearl meets walker attraction tangible she looks him sees everything she wants everything she wanted . her affair walker gives her back things taken away her when she became wife mother . mortensen beyond temptation knocking pearl door . way he moves , holds himself , looks every woman who comes into his bus seduction itself . he takes one look pearl knows what this woman lost what she needs regain part herself she sacrificed . moment he bites tag off tie-dye shirt he gives her ( one sexiest moves you ever seen ) you cheer this gorgeous couple wish pearl free order live her dreams this sublime man . love scenes this film beautifully practically set screen fire pearl abandons her barely-there inhibitions very obliging walker . perhaps most intense scene movie when pearl son injured while pearl walker . they pulling back up summer commune pearl accosted her fellow housewives tend her her injured child . she walker rush boy side , it walker ( much dismay pearl mother-in-law ) who knows how tend wounds comfort boy . after her son treated pearl husband rushes into house three parties love triangle same room . your heart breaks pearl her anguish written all over her face when her husband turns walker thanks him assisting their son , you don't hurt her you hurt her . it gut-wrenching scene so visual it almost more stirring when you mute audio . runner-up most poignant moment this film when pearl daughter watches her through pair binoculars woodstock . busted understatement millennium discovery . even so , pearl looks absolutely beautiful her joy freedom walker swings her around his arms . once more , viggo mortensen , low-slung pair tight pants , no shirt , artfully painted he lowers diane down slinkily crawls top her ..... lighter note , i would thinking " good job mom ! " ending happy bummer same time . i'm not going give it away but i thought pearl would make different choice than what she . when you watch scene pearl walker his room you understand what i mean . it moment viggo mortensen shows us what truly superb actor he naked emotion his face , voice , eyes . if you loved bridges madison county , you love walk moon . if you fan any actors this film you love it . if you viggo fan you need something cold drink if you just want see great movie this certainly leave you satisfied . above all else , this terrific selection watch someone you love .	1

this movie lot potential . i not even mind changes movie stage production . but , any one any singing experience knows it impossible sings these songs without opening your mouth ! leads all running around singing intense songs their mouths open crack . i could not enjoy this movie all because i knew they lip syncing . if something like this bothers you , i would avoid this movie . acting definitely falls flat .	1
" inspector clouseau " most obscure entry pink panther franchise , even more obscure than " curse pink panther " or " son pink panther . " technically third movie series , " inspector clouseau " finds alan arkin title role french inspector jacques clousea , character peter sellers started make famous two previous movies character sellers would become inextricably linked four more afterwards . " inspector clouseau " lacks boundless energy director shawn levy actor steve martin 2006 entry franchise or subtle sophistication any director blake edward actor peter sellers ' indisputable classics , but director bud yorkin actor alan arkin entry undeniably unique actually quite entertaining . " inspector clouseau " finds ever klutzy clouseau heading france london france again then onto switzerland take psychotic gang behind great train robbery , led mysterious " johnny rainbow " . clouseau assisted shifty scotland yard inspector weaver ( frank finlay , who played inspector lestrade " study terror " again " murder decree " ) who arms clouseau array james bond-style gadgetry . way clouseau , he always knack , finds his way into arms beautiful babes takes out dangerous underworld assassins trying kill him , all completely accident . bud yorkin directing style quite different blake edward , whole movie feels like completely different animal any other pink panther flicks . but movie finds charm sense fun all its own . lack jazzy henry mancini score adds distance other panthers , but ken thorne hummable score suitable replacement . memorable moments include scene where clouseau moves chair chair while debriefed scotland yard commissioner ( patrick cargill ) , scene where he finds himself " modeling " seductive photographer , hilarious sequence where he weaver become intensely competitive playing games speeding train . there also sufficient number twists turns make this movie worth look despite its obscurity .	1

here great film sprung forth czech new wave : film , through its small gestures subtleties makes some big statements . i'll leave it you all discover forman delightful insights into human behavior loves blonde . suffice it say , plot --- which involves young girl ( hana brejchov�) attempt find true love factory girl --- could become whimsical even sentimental other hands . forman , whole thing grounded earth . instead weightless romantic comedy , loves blonde aims realism , while forman maintains relatively light touch proceedings , everything happens her --- she finds love piano player , makes love him one night , then eventually pursues him his home , where she meets his ever-bickering parents --- still its own kind weight it . only way i describe it , i guess , weight real life . i haven't seen more accurate recreation marriage dulled out any other movie than i saw second half loves blonde , milda parents : it comic , yes , but it also uncannily realistic , maybe you'll recognize your own parents when you see control-freak mother carefree father this film . blonde movie ... well , she doesn't necessarily become sympathetic movie progresses , but we get sense why she begins attach herself piano player milda : she sees him escape drudgeries factory life . understand , you'll find ending this film poignant maybe kinda sad . ( her dream shattered , but she keeps believing it anyway , either out hope or simply desperation . ) but enough my pretentious analysis , hehe . point , milos forman loves blonde , like jiri menzel arguably more celebrated closely watched trains , film , though short 85 minutes , takes its time observe human nature face oppression , its own light subtle way . its comic surface only makes it seem like slight movie ; but its subtleties scenes comic observation , it heck lot more say our little human foibles than lot other romantic comedies . recommended	1
i seen many historical war dramas far east ( mainly china ) most them not only historically inaccurate but strong bias toward enemy . yi soon shin , however , rare exception . not only drama very historically accurate but it also very comprehensive detailing meticulous battle planning admiral leads each victory but also political in-fighting chosun political factions ( second-guessing nature king ) which causes his eventual death . also , special effects great . battle scenes ( whether sea or land ) realisitic outstanding quality . only problem i find dvd not placed sufficient focus contribution ming china . then again , this not unexpected since this korean drama focusing great admiral . also , entire selection should 104 episodes . i don't know why it stops 101 . if you want more comprehensive knowledge subject , try samuel hawley imjin war ( which portrays yi soon shin more accurately quoting original sources ) . any who only intered fighting may also want check out stephen turnbull samurai invasion ( which more colorful maps detailed description battles japanese perspective ) . lastly , anyone who fan samurai warfare may want check out shogun : total war creative assembly ( now gold version ) .	1
after watching " new jack city " , " sugar hill " definitely similar , but milder , pared down version former , still stark realities street life drug trade common denominator . while new jack , wesley snipes character " nino " cold , bloodthirsty , womanizing , heartless druglord . snipes ' role carmello sh much more conservative terms his mannerisims , attire , he compassionate , humane , sympathetic , but still not forgetting he first foremost drug kingpin who needs take care business . ironically , carmello must care his ailing father , whose life shambles result abusing same product made his own son rich , eventually succumbs . i would even go limb say nino njc could regarded re-incarnated life this film character(carmello ) . carmello eventually tires his life dealer , realizes there more life than jet set lifestyle , wealth material things . eventually , carmello given chance redemption , but must live rest his life crippling injury inflicted his own brother , who eventually dies well . carmello starts over far concrete jungles nyc new wife child . remarkable clarence williams , ernie hudson , vondie curtis-hall , lovely theresa randle , abe vigoda other actors add depth this film . even after 10 years , this movie still hits home	1

this movie awesome ! my sister i used watch this all time back day so i ordered one each us . cinematography bit weird though , it seems recorded little differently dvd , it almost foreign look it ( like australian or some english tv/movies ) . it doesn't change viewing experience , i just little surprised when i watched it	1
this out all many versions jane eyre my least favorite ... granted samantha morton very adorable fairy/ elfin like face like mr rochesters description her , but her acting no highs lows . she stands up mr edwards little too much giving really snappy answers , seemingly no respect her employer , which not fault hers , writing script bad .... so direction . ciaran hinds totally over top . he so angry no understanding , his eyes very lustful times crazed . he not all like character described brontes epic book very sad tortured man who falls hopelessly love innocence singular personality earnest , honest yet strong sweet jane eyre charlotte bronte brought so vividly life her classic words . over acting both during proposal scene almost comical . me there no love , feeling or chemistry here two actors just lust .... he seems going through middle age crises just eyeing up this young girl , she though supposedy virgin ... she dosn't act like one . plus this movie seems very rushed you never get good foot hold story especially during janes childhood . i also miss gypsy scene omitted many these movies expertly dalton /clarke mini series , which brought some brief light heartednes otherwise very dark story . if you want see great versions . i highly rate 1944 movie orson wells though it abreviatd version , movie truly captured spirit feel . it moody dark mysterious . fantastic timothy dalton version which most accurate book all movies taking actual lines right brontes story . dalton clarkes acting simply superbly sublime ! however if you like me , see them all make your own decision . they all something offer most entertaining ...	-1
yesterday i went into british supermarket bought this dvd called " assassin " , because it bridget fonda cover , star , i thought she great " jackie brown " . i thought film rather ok : interesting anyway . then i tried find it amazon . nowhere ! no such movie . 43 movies " assassin " title , but this wasn't one them . bright idea struck me , i entered search bridget fonda . up pops this film called " point no return " , identical cover , swipe me if it isn't same film . what point this retitle ? no answer : no point . now i've read all reviews it bit shock learn " assassin " frame-by-frame remake french film called " nikita " , unknown me , original zillion times better . well , figures . american remakes european films inevitably dismally inferior , since americans totally lack seasoned culture , wit , irony understanding human nature which developed over couple thousand years europe . " assassin " , aka " point no return " , now ruined me . i see it all just provide opportunity bridget dive out cabbages mushrooms kitchen , generate computer-enhanced explosion tenth floor , step aside stunt-girls perform some athletic kung-fu , high-jumps fisticuffs . too bad . i still thought bridget rather good part , story sort interesting : now i know why . keitel seemed reprising ( or anticipating ? i'm not sure dates ) his cleaner-up role " pulp fiction " . there also seemed faint echoes " prisoner " --- once you're you cannot get out . reversed gender role-play seemed subversively signalling woman woman , even if she hit-person . better than 2 stars , i hardly ever give three . but i doubt it get better repeated viewings .	1
i won't give summary movie ( many reviews already ) but i say this . why no widescreen ? i believe region 2 version this dvd got widescreen presentation , but why people stuck region 1 dvd players get stuck full screen version ? i've seen widescreen edition it looks much better ! aside flaw , this great dvd worth buying if you love goofy max , loved 90s , love catchy music or just like disney general . 4 stars only because absent widescreen presentation . otherwise movie worth 5 stars	1

wow some people take children movies too seriously . i own harriet spy i still love it same since it came out i think it nick classic . if you think it its shame new generation kids grow up without movies like this . harriet spy few things it seem like its not children but if you pay attention watch it end it also teaches you appreciate what you plenty other good morals . movie description bit simple complicated same time its 11 yr old wants writer but her spying her writing actually its more like shes exploring writing everything she sees . you cant just read reviews movie you see it cause some reviews dont this great movie any justice . acting great story line very original thought provoking . if your parent you would like know if this good movie your kids well im tellin you it . i 8 when it came out it made me look some things differently . this great movie you shouldn't let your kids miss this this definitely teach children appreciate good friends more important good parents . i'm sorry if this review doesn't help or give good movie description but this very underrated movie leave good impression kids not bad one	1
ah , yes : frailty human condition . one moment domiciled , husband-doting grandmother ; next , moaning lover coupling man half her age . director roger michell reminds us we're all capable behaving outside box his moody film , mother . sixtysomething may ( anne reid ) , recently widowed , decides move london closer her two adult children . while getting closer kiddos -- learning more them , herself -- she finds herself physically attracted married carpenter ( daniel craig , new james bond dude ) who her son friend who also affair her daughter ( plot get any more tangled than ? ) . may throws caution wind affair young man -- affair definitely tweaks " ick " factor , subsequently turns her already fragile family upside down . reid plays her role robotically , unemotionally , while craig character less than flattering . matter fact , there isn't flattering -- or likeable -- character entire film , yet viewer drawn into this dysfunctional mess just like crowd rushing train wreck . mother indeed pay homage human condition , subtly pointing out its frailty same time . -- . mikels , author , reckonin	1
terrence malick acquired tremendous cult following auteur , but this , his first film , only truly successful one among them -- one finest films ever attempt capture donwside american dream ( it without pretentiousness ) . although many films inspired notorious 1950s killing spree charlie starkweather caril fugate , natural born killers frighteners , badlands really only one resonate -- part because it treats its starkweather-fugate analogues not quintessence gleeful evil but rather polite disaffected , making their killing spree all more astonishing . kit carruthers ( martin sheen ) handsome , well spoken , very gracious ; he chastises himself when he speaks ungrammatically records notes telling children very pietistic typical homilies playing fair listening minority opinions but acceding majority . he shoots father his girlfriend holly ( sissy spacek ) only when man threatens deny kit what he feels fairly his -- holly -- , thereafter he uses his gun means rid himself simply people who attempt arrest him . it becomes basically adolescent wish-fulfillment scenario . when kit holly escape forest build themselves elaborate treehouse , they become like swiss family robinson or huck joe raft escaping their pursuers . cinematography film widely praised , its extremely inventive use music ( carl orff " musica poetica " well songs mickey sylvia nat ' king ' cole ); sheen spacek could hardly improved upon central roles	1

you like cop movies ? if you then you're luck . alien nation essentially cop movie ... aliens . fact it just cop movie aliens what makes this movie little groundbreaking . however like any other genre movies , this cop movie isn't perfect . it falls into some same trappings most cop movies . spite alien nation innovative science fiction genre , even if innovation itself played out nausea elsewhere . this isn't high cop drama like black rain or heat . it isn't necessarily low cop drama either like v.i. warshowski or rookie . cop drama part pretty much middle . so what makes it innovative ? well ... it aliens . one things make really good science fiction when aspects real life get represented fashion . films like aliens their viet nam war contrast , contact its spiritual belief contrast , their holocaust similarities all stand out above crowd because they compare their situations real issues . alien nation same . not buddy cop themes but themes racial hatred discrimination . instead some other ethnic minority you get alien refugees planet . you get all parallels bigotry modern society this film , they address it concise manner . said it still cop movie overall . oddly matched police officers learning accept each other , drug lord looking take over , lots gunplay cop jokes ... they all end up here . this aspect movie merely average . just like all other cop movies you seen over decades . cinematography , settings , script , style all fall victims cop movie theme they all nothing really write home when compared other police films . this doesn't mean script , cinematography other stuff i mentioned bad . it just doesn't stand out above crowd . appreciate alien nation what it : parallel society discrimination against people different than us . understand fact vehicle they used portray this , it appropriate one , clich�d cop plot . if you like cop movies sci-fi then you found winner here . rest you i won't say it overall great movie , but i say it pretty good one .	1

" conversation " little seen masterpiece francis ford coppola , made " godfather " " godfather pt . ii . " it mystery-drama , plays like horror movie similar nicolas roeg film " don't look now " sense works dread , rather than fright . two-time academy award winner gene hackman plays harry caul , wiretapper whom we first meet he recording conversation young couple park . caul sees his job job , he doesn't get involved people he records nor he pay much attention details conversation . he supposed record it deliver it . his suspicions begin grow tape when he tries personally deliver it mysterious person who asked it instead badgered man assistant ( harrison ford ) it . same time we begin realize how bad caul his job . his partner stanley ( john cazale ) quit already began working wiretapper . superintendent his apartment building managed get inside his multi-locked apartment drop off birthday present . ladyfriend his tells harry time she watched his spying someone hour ... it no wonder when rival wiretapper comes his office him he manages record intimant conversation harry woman . while mystery revolving around " conversation " continues , harry begins deciphering some sentences his suspicions confirmed when he hears sentence : " he'd kill us if he got chance ? " this question fuels rest movie , until very creepy superb climax . some most haunting parts film come end this due visuals film . one much-talked scene comes when harry flushes toilet motel room it begins overflowing blood . this scene ( few follow it ) some most effectively creepy scenes i've seen long time . gene hackman superb harry caul , multi-layered character page must seemed very one-dimensional . harry man no personal life , almost no friends , he man lives shrouded mystery . coppola already proved time this movie came out he cinematic genius , but he mostly known movies like " godfather " " apocalypse now . " those films 3 hour long epic films , but i think really see how much range coppola director it nice take look " conversation . " few people seen this movie , it much smaller scale film most his movies but it truly masterwork . great acting , great direction , great art direction , great cinematography . grade :	1
titan ae really good scifi movie . it fantastic visuals , chases , good enough story keep you interested . voice acting also pretty good . unfortunately movie suffers what many movies , especially this genre , suffer . they don't commit adult or child-based audience , nor go after strictly scifi audience or more general audience . so what ends up happening you get just enough both , without fully focusing one target audience , kind sterile , but still good . if you looking mind blowing concepts something other than ' standard scifi fare ' this isn't where look . if you want good movie keeps you entertained kids watch too , this great flick .	1

i'm not into slasher-type horror flicks ; viewing people get hacked death holds no fascination me . yet , i find " friday 13th " flicks appealing some reason ; possibly because they usually involve young adults fun camp-type environment , which naturally stirs fond youthful memories . story centers around halfway house troubled youths middle nowhere . tommy jarvis , who still traumatized events previous film , arrives home . murders slowly start mounting up leading action-packed climax . first film series serious murder-mystery horror picture . this not case part . although " new beginning " plays it semi-straight , it numerous goofy , campy elements . fact , there so many laugh-out-loud moments it almost comedy . which not say it bad ; matter fact , these aspects makes part highly entertaining re-watchable . film notable featuring three very lovely women -- blond , brunette redhead no less . blond " pam " played melanie kinnaman , protagonist story . melanie so incredibly gorgeous it hard take your eyes off her if you're red-blooded male . i originally caught this film tv so when i recently picked up uncensored dvd i bit surprised amount needless cussing ; little bit here there reasonable reasistic ( not mention amusing , if right way right time ) but it bit overdone here ( just bit ) . i'm sure filmmakers threw it simply comical touch . any case , it goes without saying if you find overkill cussing offensive you might want skip this one . bottom line : dvd worth picking up if no other reason than beholding awe-inspiring , succulent beauty melanie kinnaman ( which explains my title mantra ) . other than , it just very fun entertaining flick . criticisms regarding absence certain character -- who really gives flying freak ? film good job showing what ultimately happen those severely traumatized jason . so , yes , it belongs series .	1

if they bringing high mighty dvd finally , then maybe it time unravel complications surrounding this film feature it dvd . so proudly we hail one greatest all war movies , because it told woman point view ( so speak , it still male director person mark sandrich ) it sometimes ridiculed derided , usually armchair critics who should walk mile nurse shoes before daring denigrate her bravery under fire . claudette colbert plays janet davidson . unusual choice nurse , colbert eschews most her usual glamor ( except san francisco embarkation ) really gives herself part . colbert often good when she play against strong women , here sandrich surrounds her gallery independent types , way francois ozon made catherine deneueve shine recent 8 1/2 women . janet born leader even though she only photographed one side her face , which somewhat limits her utilitarian duty during battle scenes . even covered grime jungle grease , colbert still turn heads , when she meets george reeves , sparks ignite , hot enough burn corregidor down ground . veronica lake plays up her dark side playing lieutenant d'arcy , time bomb just waiting explode . often seen soignee bewitching , cute fringe hair playing peekaboo her eyes , lake here going cornell woolrich-style vengeance against japanese . if tarantino made kill bill 1940s lake would beat uma thurman role easily . she hotter than pistol she ms. 45 . paulette goddard , i think , most challenging role i agree other reviewers who say this goddard best part . while colbert lake really just occupy same acting space throughout movie , goddard character change , so viewers watch her mature fly night flapper only men her mind , woman heart who lives help others , not just impress them her oomph . it harder than it looks walk line , but goddard pulls it off without whimper . often cast sexpot pure simple , or gold-digging mantrap she apparently real life , goddard entirely persuasive her role , like lake , she natural action scenes . i want her my nurse . her romance " kansas " kind cute too . all all , underrated movie kind plot screws deeper deeper , unbearably tight , like das boot , except set pacific	1

mumford delicious little film 1999 written directed lawrence kasdan ( big chill , grand canyon , accidental tourist , silverado , etc ) who usual poses some interesting questions our contemporary take concepts . it quiet , beautifully acted ensemble film wears well indeed . mumford ( underused loren dean ) man variegated past who settles into little town name mumford , decides he listen people talk , sounding board folks who need communication this basically non-communicative world , becomes ' psychologist ' every sense word - good sense . manner which he listens many people within little town mesmerizing insightful citizens he encounters assists varied beautifully sculpted vulnerable human beings . fine cast includes hope davis , jason lee ( one his finest roles ) , mary mcdonnell , alfre woodard , zooey deschanel , martin short , david paymer , kevin tighe , ted danson , jason ritter even more . dialogue introspective , healing , edgy , entertaining overall feeling left viewer end piece one wishing more ' mumfords ' would around our neighborhoods - or rather we all could become ' mumfords ' little conviction concern our fellow beings . this kasdan concept movie touches our hearts while it stimulates our brains . grady harp , october 06	1

i first saw this movie tv years ago ; they advertising it , since i'd never seen or even heard it before , i intrigued premise , i decided give it go . i missed part film when friend called , but i hooked it after we hung up . it not perfect film . there plot holes , yes . but reeve seymour so good , so believable , they draw you . i read reeve took some criticism after film released too sensitive his portrayal richard collier ! well , 1980 you , folks . dvd problem , or maybe it just my copy , where times film , image suddenly becomes rather jerky . fortunately , this doesn't last . i enjoyed watching interviews , hard though it see once-vibrant christopher reeve wheelchair , talk around operation his respirator . it hard , too , see him film , walking running ease . there just something this film takes hold you . i mentioned before , reeve seymour give perfect performances . i suppose magic here relationship them really works , this such rare thing anywhere , any time , we willingly suspend our disbelief . they both fit into their roles if parts written only them . it not " chick-flick " . it so much more	1

amusing , entertaining .... two words i would use describing this holiday confection samuel goldwyn . lavish sets , costumes , music good performances cooper norwegian sigrid gurie(she equally good three faces west john wayne ) . sigrid gurie suffered greatly her shaky career : time mof this film it found out she born flatbush , brooklyn " siren fjords " " fake " . fact her parents norwegian moved back norway when sigrid 11 months dismissed . ( their ship not so far titanic when it sunk ... ) vivien leigh born darjeeling , india liv ullmann tokyo . they never labeled indian or japanese . there many similar examples why poor sigrid suffered this idiotic case unbelivable . goldwyn indeed called it " great hoax " ... why sigrid left goldwyn after " algiers " no wonder . but she leave us this film , algiers three faces west - she playes each role differently . it`s shame goldwyn didn`t look after her - me may star tradition dietrich garbo . though i must say ; sigrid gurie quality presence all her own :-)	1
many reviewers seem rate monsieur ibrahim highly because omar sharif smiling presence . this caused them overlook , however , film canyon-sized plot holes overarching sentimentality . i agree film its good points : scenery ( parisian street scenes apartments , turkish countryside ) , music , lesser degree , sharif performance ( when it avoids ladling syrup ) . certain individual scenes work well . now questions : who father , why he such miserable human ? why mother leave ? more important , why she briefly come back ? there brother , or not ? there holocaust angle ? if not , why ? or why keep it completely oblique ? what planet beautiful , sweet , happy prostitutes imported ? boy no peers rely ( or corrupted by) ? should lonely old shopkeeper thought best only source wisdom 16-year-old boy ? even if wisdom doesn't rise above level what forrest gump would say ? if this supposed early 1960s , why word " algeria " not come up conversation ? some , these questions irrelevant , however , given chance see aging omar sharif screen . others , beware	1

i can't understand why so many people singing praises this film . others pointed out , this film none-too-subtle ripoff , primarily " jacob ladder " ( which , itself , inspired " occurrence owl creek bridge " ) but also elements " one flew over cuckoo nest , " " twelve monkeys , " probably other classics sanity-bending genre i can't recall moment . we not even five minutes into film yet when i turned friend i watching it said , " this going end up ' jacob ladder ' remake ? " that how blatant it . thirty minutes into it , i mentally naming films each sequence film stolen whenever there scene change . there even shot which we see adrien brody character staring into coffee cup , camera slowly descends toward surface liquid exact copy similar scene " taxi driver . " now , i'm well aware stealing ( aka " influence " ) hallowed tradition all fields art , influenced one predecessors not itself bad thing . problem this film not even tenth good any films it steals , not even hundredth original . film intent seems merely try give you same sense creepiness dread you get its sources , but it completely lacks their depth . " jacob ladder , " " twelve monkeys " " cuckoo nest " great because you delve deeply into souls mental confusion central characters . all characters " jacket " interesting cardboard cutouts i never came care what happened any them . only reason i even gave this film two stars because incredible acting talent ( brody , jennifer jason leigh , etc . ) wasted it . how adrien brody able stomach this after doing " pianist , " i no idea . their talents worthy greater productions than this . don't waste your time .	1

this best version alice adventures wonderland , starring fiona fullerton alice , dvd . previous editions very shoddy - yet film so great even those watchable despite fading colors graininess . this new ( 2005 ) edition colors brought back which really nice . graininess could still use some work though it would really wonderful if major studio would buy rights this film proper restoration . there also music important scene cut this film - two songs never made it theatrical release one scene where alice meets cheshire cat tree cut before original release - very curious thing very popular scene book ! it would great if next dvd release this film could proper restoration also include some special features . many actors this film went become major stars ( ex - michael crawford phantom fame ) special features could include deleted scene if it still exists original soundtrack recording well some interviews stars - like what chitty chitty bang bang willy wonka . don't expect any special features this edition - there aren't any -- more surprisingly there no menu all - bare bones , but still classic important film alice lovers - much more reminiscent lewis carrols books characters than disney film	1

i saw this movie many years ago loved it . what i've read most recent reviews , however , leaves out script based real , historic trial hanging took place harrisburg , pennsylvania . it notorious man whose character portrayed sean connery , before hung , placed his hand wall his cell swore his innocence . handprint still seen jail , which now historic landmark . it scrubbed , sanded , even painted over -- yet it still shows through . now it available dvd form , i am buying it my husband , who i think enjoy it . we both decend pennsylvania mining stock -- not irish , but jewish ! fact , during mining violence 1920s , my uncle delivered payroll mines . rules said he carry gun ammunition -- so he carried . 23 pistol 12-gauge shotgun shell , claiming rules not say ammunition match gun he no intention killing anyone . . . .	1

hour gun ( 1967 ) takes off where director john sturges ' earlier " gunfight o.k. corral " ( 1957 ) left off . movie opens wyatt earp ( james garner ) doc holliday ( jason robards ) trading hot lead ike clanton ( robert ryan ) gang tombstone corral , follows extended courtroom scenes which earp defend himself against charges wrongful homicide , concludes meat movie - death serious wounding earp brothers members clanton gang , earp extended chase everyone involved . revenge almost always works westerns , hour gun revenge western . garner , whose greatest assets warm charm embracing smile , play it frosty focused . main pull this movie constantly brought up earp unlikely friend , ever loyal doc holliday - earp upholder law , or someone who uses law means which he cold-bloodedly track down kill men who murdered maimed his brothers ? i don't normally judge movie its historical accuracy ( least far i understand history , ) but hour gun begs it when it inserts title card after opening credits proclaiming `this how it really happened , ' or words effect . movie gets earp post- o.k. corral vendetta right his complex relationship holliday believable . other hand , movie paints earp do-gooder who driven dark side clanton his evil machinations - corral gunfight , even , seems set-up job crafty `cowboy ' ( old slang livestock rustler . ) biggest historical inaccuracy clanton death - i won't throw spoiler here , but movie penultimate showdown its protagonist antagonist works better symbolic , rather than factual , capstone . all all this pleasant enough depiction earp vendetta ride against clanton gang . far i'm concerned garner one great under-rated actors his time , if he puts dimmer his magnetic smile he makes convincing earp - his scenes robards , always good , worth rental or purchase price . robards ' doc holliday plum part - dissolute gambler , chronic alcoholic , suffering late-stage tuberculosis . ryan may play clanton little more smooth calculating than his real-life model , but he so good these kind roles it doesn't matter . strong recommendation .	1

i seen many historical war dramas far east ( mainly china ) most them not only historically inaccurate but strong bias toward enemy . yi soon shin , however , rare exception . not only drama very historically accurate but it also very comprehensive detailing meticulous battle planning admiral leads each victory but also political in-fighting chosun political factions ( second-guessing nature king ) which causes his eventual death . also , special effects great . battle scenes ( whether sea or land ) realisitic outstanding quality . only problem i find dvd not placed sufficient focus contribution ming china . then again , this not unexpected since this korean drama focusing great admiral . also , entire selection should 104 episodes . i don't know why it stops 101 . if you want more comprehensive knowledge subject , try samuel hawley imjin war ( which portrays yi soon shin more accurately quoting original sources ) . any who only intered fighting may also want check out stephen turnbull samurai invasion ( which more colorful maps detailed description battles japanese perspective ) . lastly , anyone who fan samurai warfare may want check out shogun : total war creative assembly ( now gold version ) .	1

' me mrs jones ' light , entertaining romantic . it well written , acted filmed . even minor characters personality . though todays world security concerns , specificly our leaders it unreal believe ease which harry fletcher ( robson green ) gains access prime minister ( caroline goodall ) , but if you put aside , movie enjoyable start finish	1
river runs through it difficult film review or even fairly comment upon . it beautifully-filmed overflowing sort natural scenery --- thick dark forests , cold , free-flowing rivers , wide-open skies --- most movies would steal show . it also features cast actors , tom skerit , emily lloyd , craig sheffer , brad pitt , giving what i long remain convinced most outstanding performance their careers . this classic 1991 motion picture ( re-)tells true story writer norman maclean youth early adulthood nearly century ago wilds rural montana . norman deep , pensive person , many ways opposite his younger brother paul , free-spirited daredevil whose adventurous nature good-hearted but perilous , everyone around him except paul himself seems see . norman paul father upstanding presbyterian minister whose scholarly erudition sternly eloquent sermons give way frequent intervals undertaking great passion his life : fly fishing . reverend maclean loves nothing more than take his sons river fly fish trout . these trips elder maclean imparts life lessons boys passes words wisdom they each go recall during course their lives . time passes film we leave boys youths rediscover them young men . visiting norman returned home 1920 , completed college east . paul now somewhat infamous regional newspaperman , who uses his articles skewer corrupt local figures business politics . where norman every bit staid responsible his childhood hinted he would grow , paul hard-drinking charmer whose fondness high-stakes poker games frontier saloons nights out wilder local women stands odds his upbringing respected maclean household . during summer follows norman homecoming after graduation , he his brother father once again return river fly fish , norman finds love beautiful girl neighboring town , entire maclean family watches paul slowly destroys himself fast life he cannot seem leave alone . film tells kind engrossing , touching story very few cinematic works , one crowning jewels modern motion picture achievement . river runs through it times funny , others profound , throughout it radiates its quality , ultimately ... ultimately i hope anyone reading this see this great film him or her self	1

i rather impressed how strong this film . heard not much it i expecting ' da hood ' film . i didn't much confidence ernest dickerson ( surviving game , demon knight ) his direction hasn't matured past decade . i eat my words now . he definitely brings strong visual integrity never die alone . dmx turns believable performance king david new york drug dealer who legs it la when he steals his bosses stash . upon his return years later he promptly offed two-bit thug . his dying moments he bequeaths his entire legacy investigative reporter david arquette ( who great his role too ) . before night over arquette pieces together his life awful past full heinous crimes unleashed , but it not over yet arquette becomes marked death king david still very angry boss . mere 88 minutes never die alone tells intriguing story non-chronological order sets up remarkable array complexly interwoven characters . it surely character drama first before anything else . don't misjudge it no more than violent ' gangsta ' thriller . violence brutal honest but it not distract , none it superfluous . dickerson direction gothic , urban noir edge it feel 1950 pulp novel . it dark , very dark some may feel slightly uncomfortable how frank never die alone it depiction misogyny utter ruthlessness it central , highly evil character . dvd 2.35 : 1 anamorphic widescreen dolby 5.1 sound . there bunch extras i never time check out . but this definitely movie fans ( initially unrecognisable ) dmx , just don't expect one those nice but bad characters he played exit wounds or cradle 2 grave . king david bad , bad man	1
i tend agree high praise here , but i few thoughts add . first off , every shot beautifully photographed there some simply amazing tracking shots . sense , this " art " movie if there ever one , perhaps reflecting it ( alleged ) subject matter . little this seems flamboyant its own sake . aspect worth note medieval " feel " movie . times it really seems if someone took film camera back 700 years or so . oh , it should mentioned what tremendous testicles tarkovsky must take his subject matter , early 1960 russia , renowned medieval icon painter . this mighty thumb nose soviet state arguably act subversion . pacing slow , but no more glacial than movie like 2001 , or once upon time america , say . but here brass tacks novices know : this movie episodic say least , only film i know wherein title character takes lengthy vow silence . when vow finally up , movie seems lose interest andrei altogether , he becomes background figure . but it here , finally tarkovsky shows what he straight ahead narrative -- although narrative isn't andrei . it young son newly deceased bell maker , who insists his father told secrets bell making only him . it'll mean his head if he . . -ing , we viewers aren't sure . here where movie picks up pace emotional power . how much this power relies two previous no t-t oo-seemingly-connected hours hard say . oh , vladimir gets sacked . convincingly . there images scenes stick your ribs . it help if you're already interested art , religion , russia , or splendid cinematography . or bell making , come think it . if one your neighbors begins medieval smelting process their back yard , odds they've inspired this film	1
