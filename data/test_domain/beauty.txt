i bought this product sephora . i it two weeks used it only 2 times . when i tried use it after , little red light wouldn't come it just wouldn't work . i took it back sephora exchange since i still within 30 day exchange period . second one worked two months ... then same thing happened . i only using it maybe once or twice week , most . this product horrible . i never dropped it or anything like . fact , soon it would cool down after using , i would place it back box it came . i am actually process returning it manufacturer . honestly , i wanted good flat iron i thought this good product because it expensive ... big mistake . my friend bought straight iron $100 she it almost year . she also straightens her hair lot more often than i . i don't know why i didn't ask her where she got hers . please read all reviews before you make this purchase . if you don't believe me , wait see if someone you know buys it so you find out first hand how bad this product .	-1
i not like this shampoo all . fairness , i give it two stars because it may not good coarse african american hair . it seemed make my hair clump together made it difficult comb through when wet . one thing detangle it however ojon hydrating conditioner which i love . pleasant scent foamed up well	-1
i'm sorry but this one worst perfumes . i seriously spray myself 10 times within 30 minutes you can't smell thing . yes scent great , i love it . but only person who opportunity smell it me . really really disapointed . i guess i'm just used channel ralph lauren lines . they quality last most day . this stuff plan old junk like most new stuff coming out these days .	-1
philosophy states their cosmetic containers : there no such thing unblemished skin . well , this sure true , when you use this kit kit . i pictures proove , more than month using acne kit kit not even one acne spot dissapeared . i'm combining it oxygen peel- this doesn't help either . i happy young horse all this products around $40 : night day cream , facial wash blemish serum . all they ( maybe except wash ) drying out skin . soon i buy super-moisturizing revitalizing night cream sensitive skin , high spf day cream ( my skin started showing dark , sun-exposure spots , altough i using spf filter ) finally no acne or gone . i dont get it- i better results using $0 , 97 hydrogen peroxide after toner than this hydrogen peroxide- based line cosmetics . same price i could bought stuff really works-the one vanessa williams happy . i know cause i tried it , didn't make my skin feel like sahara my next choice . save your money . p.s. oxygen peel o.k. dough	-1
i'm very disappointed results . i am fairly young , 31 . i very fine lines i thought this would make them disappear . it really didn't anything my skin . plus it greasy unpleasant smell . i not recommend this	-1
if you order this kit , make sure you time practice it ! it takes several practice applications get shade just right . while it cover completely , it not flawless . you tell you've covered something up your skin . if it not big deal , you might just want leave your tattoo visible instead big discolored spot or someone who really good colors makeup cover it you this kit	-1
i bought this shortly after i started using it sides my noise started swelling up peeling . i didn't know what going i stopped using it it immediately went away .. soon i started wearing it again swelling pain came back . i am person who doesn't break out very often i tolerate many products . i now permanent red mark right side my nose it hasn't faded yet . i tried take it back nordstrom they wouldn't exchange i t.t his product sucks it only one i using i know thats what caused swelling .	-1
eyeshadow isn't bad , nice color , but packaging disappointment . brush sits down center encased loose powder you can't get very much onto brush . there no way open casing either , so its pretty useless . i found powder odd texture loose eyeshadow also .	-1
never i so unhappy my makeup i when i using clinique . i used stay beige ( which i lightly patted my face top clinique superfit liquid makeup - i oily skin told this would help reduce shine ) end result it just made me look ghostly . i also hated how clinique liquid foundation powder didn't matching shades , so i settle honey liquid beige powder . much i went back macy try convince them these weren't my shades , they just wouldn't listen . either they didn't time or patience help me pick new shade , or they convinced i making big deal out nothing . instead sitting there arguing them ( which i shouldn't first place ) i just switched different makeup line : laura mercier , which i am very happy . i've many other friends who unhappy clinique switched over different makeup brand , well . i'm not trying knock product . i'm just saying it wasn't me or many other people i know . i would definitely not recommend clinique anyone . i'd rather pay little more get better results rather than settle $20 product just because it affordable .	-1

i used this product evening noticed immediate plumping . i also use lipfusion xl ( 50.00 )- but sometimes results not long-lasting . when i used too-faced lip injection mask- results immediate , seemed continue hours . when i woke morning- my lips very plumped- much more so than lip fusion alone . i use these products together- lip injection mask too-faced amazing ! used first , then lip fusion xl layered top after rinsing off mask- it seriously looked like i undergone medical-procedure lip-plumping ! i highly reccommend this lip injection mask .	1

i am very glad my purchase . it gives subtle natural glow skin not tacky shiny one . i am usually not very comfortable wearing foundation i prefer tinted moisturizers . happy light gives even complexion without heavy . it also offers sun protection , spf 15 . if you don't need more than medium coverage , it worth considering this brand .	1

... if you don't use this stuff ! after too many years uncomfortable shaves wait 2-3 days shaving let my raw , sore neck recover , i finally started some research into what i could add my regimen/technique improve results . i read numerous articles benefits pre-shave oil , so i decided add this stuff my arsenal ... i'm never going back . first off , price might detrement those who used $3/can drug store shaving cream , but little goes long way , this little bottle might actually last you longer than 4 or 5 cans cream or gel . you only use small amount each day , it spreads evenly over your whole face . when used tandem good shaving cream , it virtually eliminates razor burn uncomfortable shaving . my razor glides over my face each morning now . if you look your razor each morning disgust like i used , give this stuff shot . i guarantee you won't disappointed . try their shaving cream " old school " shaving brush well . pamper your face ... this how shaving supposed before cheap aerosol shaving cream disposable plastic razors started ripping our faces shreds	1
not your typical thick , floral-smelling perfume , this perfume smells exactly like its name advertises -- like lemon juice mixed sugar . it seasonal perfume ( i can't imagine smelling like lemons winter ) . it smells very crisp , fresh , clean , which i enjoy lot , but i imagine others would not ; same things i like this perfume , could smell like cleaning product others . go your fridge . get lemmon , squeeze its juice out into cup add some sugar . if you enjoy smell you get , buy this perfume -- i highly recommend it . if not , stick something more traditional vanilla/floral like ana sui " dolly girl "	1

our local macy recently offered free skin typing samples go it . i really only went pick up free moisturizer i've found some judicious sampling you don't pay item . instead , i fell love this soap ( got free moisturizer too-hooray !! )when sales rep first handed me bar soap , i balked . i've known people who've used clinique but just idea washing my face bar soap freaked me out . they offer liquid version but rep told me soap better exfoliant . i can't say sure if that so but i say this really great face wash . i addicted after one use . since it bar soap , you'll get really great sudsy foam . it mild , pleasant scent it washes off easily . i mild version i just love it . my skin feels clean but never tight not only it not cause breakouts , it immediately calmed one i . i'll definitely buying more . i want add , however , it drying wintertime if you normal skin i switch cream cleanser . it may not problem oily skin . dry skin , i'd really avoid it winter least . you still ideally need makeup remover before soap . i also became recent convert clinique rinse off foaming cleanser . but even if you don't want use product , remember removing your makeup separate step .	1
my first thought crumbling some this into my running bath it reminded me bubble baths when i kid . there this really nice subtle clean smell this bubble bar . i really like it not overpoweringly smelly bubble bar . it great those who don't want flowery bath , but who can't tolerate overwhelming patchouli blue skies bar . i wish i'd bought two these instead one this one blue skies . plus , this good bar mixing bath bomb . really probably any bomb would . good stuff	1
i love fresh scent avobath , there just nothing like it . it smells like springtime me . i yet notice any glitter avobath bath ( i've taken 10 ) so if you're glitter shy , don't let stop you trying this one	1
this first bronzer i actually finished . this gives most natural finish blends really well . i like it matte because i'm not fan sparkly bronzer . ever since i started using this , i'm just addicted can't live without it . it gives skin really natural , healthy-looking flush . i've got medium/olive skin i use " light " . my skin doesn't look orangey or dirty . try it i'm sure you'll like it . make sure you use really good brush .	1
i hooked sebastian shine serum forever . then i switched this after hearing all rave reviews . it makes it just shiny sebastian , but my thick wavy hair , it easier apply . i only need quarter size amount , way less than any other product . it nice soft finish . so if you like sebastian redkin shine serums , you'll like this . i'm not going go far say it miracle worker . it makes your hair shinier . it helps little my frizz , but doesn't depouf .	-1
i use both this mascara lancome flextencils when i'm going out , flextencils first then coat hypnose . my lashes look huge not too clumpy . flextencils add great length , while hypnose adds volume . i use hypnose itself just average day . great product ! makes my lashes big not clump	1

this far best shaving product i ever used . yes , it pricey , but if you get past , you won't disappointed . i hesitated purchase this months b/c price , but my friend gave me sample try -- i hooked ! it decandent creamy , little goes long way . i also used spend more money expensive razors get closer shave ; i now only use cheapie razors my legs so much smoother than before ! i also use this under my arms no irritation ( this hesitation , i very sensative skin ) . fragrance amazing well . sweet , name , but not overpowering . this works very well layering benefit other scented products , or their maybe baby fragrance , they all smell similar enough compliment one .	1
i love smell philosophy pure grace . shampoo/shower gel smells just clean fresh perfume . it not too drying either	1
all i say this product great , because my indian heritage , i got dark circle around my eyes after baby my dark cirlce got worse . i looked so tired older dark cirlces . i bough lot products cover my undereye dark circles , but i not happy all . i keep trying new concealers but no satisfaction all . one day i went store they sell bobbi products , i just looking powder matched my skin tone bobbi brown . they got me right powder color she asked me try out some bobbi brown creamy concealer my dark cirlces . i not sure but i let her try it me . i so happy see my dark circles gone . i keep getting compliments how fresh i look makes me feel pretty . since than its my all time favourite . little goes long way . i think its great people serious dark circles . i got little kit small mirror , included yellow based concealer little darker creamy concealer even out yellow concealer your skin color yellow powder finishing touch . you just get right color concealer your skin complexion . its little expensive small kit but i love it its money worth	1
i know this reviews clarifying lotion 2 but i thought i would let people know new product clarifying moisture lotion 2 . i dry , sensitive skin when assessed girls clinique counter i came out skin type i/ii . i use extra mild facial soap , clarifying moisture lotion 2 dramatically different moisturising lotion . when i looked reviews here amazon i suprised find so many people unhappy product , but i happened go clinique counter other day found australia there two ranges clarifying lotions , original , which what everyone talking , new moisture lotions . according sales assistants new moisture lotion developed asian market alcohol free asian region australia luckily gets both . they exfoliate like regular lotions but there no sting or tingle skin feels really soft . my face feels like polished marble moment my makeup going staying much better than before . i tell you my skin never looked better since starting clinique i would recomend this skin care line anyone .	1
not only this gel smell terrific , like real raspberry sorbet , it functional well . this lathers up nice you don't use lot product . you use it body wash , shampoo conditioner i suppose bubble bath too . so makes it four one . i take this trips because its easy grab put my overnight bag i take less product me . i also use this when i'm running late take quick shower . this also comes many other yummy scents . try them you not disappointed .	1

white linen classic fragrance daytime use . it fresh , crisp scent perfect summer , when heavier scents " turn " this my first " young ladies " scent , remains one my favorites . other white linen items : powder , body lotions soaps wonderful layering this perfume . because it so light , you can't overdo it . its crisp white blue packaging , it makes lovely gift anyone	1
there i waiting shaving my legs water tub draining away when suddenly i looked down noticed all these little glittery confetti hearts . so cute ! nice surprise i didn't see them while i taking bath . i see little candy flowers floating . this bath high " cuteness " factor if you one those " everything pink " moods , then think pink may suit your candy mood . lavender oil , tonka absolute , vanilla neroli oil makes this calming bath leaves you little happier . you may enjoy this bath even more calming sweet " honey i washed kids sweet honey soap " or " sultana soap " bar which sumptuously smooth leaves fragrance your skin lasts all night . if you want pink/vanilla soap , then you may want " rock star . " if you into mixing matching according scents , then trichomania mildly scented coconut looks like vanilla shampoo bar it goes well vanilla scented american cream conditioner . i vote tad more vanilla , although you toss little vanilla oil bath or some vanilla kitchen also works well . eating sugar cookies tub optional . ~ rebecca review	-1
i'm picky my lipstick . not only shade great ( not garish or sparkly ) but i want it smell pleasant ( or not all ) , taste pleasant ( or not all ) i want case feel substantial click when i close it . ok -- so how this one measure up ? shades awsome . i like baby lips natural lips . it smells ok -- kind like vasaline -- but only faintly . estee lauder lipstick much stronger perfume smell lacome tends smell fruity . it tastes faintly like chapstick . case relatively heavy it clicks . neither taste nor smell off-putting but because i'm so picky it only gets 4 stars . ( texture smooth well it doesn't feel heavy your lips . ) if you want natural ( not sparkly ) lips everyday this good choice	-1
i love trying new fragrances , when i came across this yesterday tried it , - i became hooked instantly . it beautiful perfume somewhat floral fruity same time , but isn't too overpowering me , lasted quite while . packaging great . it fresh looking pretty , but it fragrance itself hooked me . i got few comments it right away , so i think i'm going back store buy some . it might little too heavy hot summer days , but perfect winter . i think this definately suit cooler climates better , or if it too hot , it probably become sickly too strong . if you like blend fruit floral , this you . it stunning different . i love it	1
my hairstylist accidentally bleached my hair too much . if wasn't bad enough , end week i noticed my hair visibly dryer lost its shine . i used this " marinating " oil overnight - slept plastic shower cap . i surprised how easily it washed out morning . there no " oily " residue weighing my hair down either . i very impressed results , it put shine body back my hair - i've only used it once , they recommend overnight treatments once week - i'm expecting even better results end month . i'd definetly recommend this product .	1

i've using this product couple years , i can't imagine ever without it . first time i put it , however , i used too much my chanel foundation refused spread - it just sat blotch my face . i took " present " back makeup counter where they told me use amount equal size half pea - my entire face ! i doubtful , but spreading it super-thin worked , plus each bottle lasts long , long time . here my favorite things this product : -foundation glides supersmooth-fine wrinkles less visible-makeup stays put all day long-keeps oily skin shine-free-works great eyeshadow base keep it creasing-makes skin feel softthe one downside if i don't wash my face night , i break out , probably because it really like " sealant " your face . other than , i love it , probably never switch base .	1

i've noticed products lush stores almost always smell different when you get them out store . store , i didn't like smell this shampoo bar all , but i bought it because awesome softening benefits seaweed . when i got home try it out , smell much nicer subtle . i guess all smells store take over you can't smell actual product accurately . this shampoo wonderful . only needed three strokes bar down my below-the-shoulder length hair my hair lathered up really nicely . just sure keep this shampoo bar ( all shampoo bars ) out water when you aren't using it or it turn into mush . took off star because traditional bottled shampoo much easier convinient work store . really nice take you trips , though . if you want shampoo conditioner bar , try hybrid or godiva	-1
i saw them use airspray type foundation america next top model ( not sure which brand ) but i impressed this technique wanted try it - only one i found dior . far best foundation i've tried ! i like other dior tint foundation - but thought it too heavy . mist feels light ... maybe little too light . yet once you apply , it job perfectly - you really get even airbrushed look . i won't give 5 stars simply price - sorry but $60 too much 2.3 oz cangood news if you apply it right it last while	-1

okay , so 80 bucks seems like lot money plunk down at-home microdermabrasion kit ... especially when everyone homedics ' oreal marketing more cost-friendly version what appears same exact thing . however , experience ( lots money not-so-well spent ) taught me , most cases , you generally get what you pay . case point : few months ago i finally made decision trade my 99 cent ultra-black mascara high-end name brand version same product ... i immediately discovered mascara-induced racoon eyes really avoided ! who knew ? after , i vowed never pinch pennies when it comes beauty . now there , course , some exceptions ; my mother swears oil olay -as i- but when you're talking microderabrasion , proceedure cost much $150 per session , it hard believe you achieve same exact results something mere fraction cost . skeptical but desperate youthful looking skin , i opted splurge dermanew facial rejuvenation system . prior my purchase , i fair amount research so i knew what i getting cr�me de la cr�me more than twenty-plus versions i choose . just two weeks after using it , i began notice my once sallow complexion ( thanks stress , lack sleep yo-yo dieting ) replaced healthy glow . now my skin looks soft peachy , kind like it when i twelve ... you know , when youth beauty effortless ... sigh ! all all this product best someone little no skin flaws . those who expecting miracle results or results similar what you would get full-service salon treatment may dissapointed . my advice , shell out necessary funds order get your skin under control , then use this product upkeep . this great removing dead skin regular washing tends leave behind .	1
this great product enhanse define curls . it work perfectly very curly hair without any stifness . only reason i don't give it five stars because if you long hair want define your curls but hav some volume well , this mousse tendancy reduce volume very long hair . so great curls , but without volumizing effect . price too kind expensive . this product cheaper france : around 18-24 euros . it worth price though kerastase products seen best europe	-1

during my seven year shaving career , i've run gauntlet shaving implementations . after shaving contemporary disposable cartridge razors electric razors `goo ' , i left much desired . ingrown hairs razor burn starting little too familiar . upon taking set out box , i met quality heft each piece went straight sink test drive . i didn't receive my art shaving lavender scented shave cream until day after , so i made aveno shave gel i hand . first thing i experienced while working up lather badger hair brush , distinct smell wet badger . after thorough washing rinsing , badger smell subsided enough continue . i read few guides classicshaving.com proper technique , but really there nothing it . i made sure my skin taught let weight shaver all work . i found it didn't take much longer than normal shave , even my first go . it took me two weeks shaving get my first knick . point , i getting little complacent placed razor my chin odd angle . it very minor i haven't repeated folly . smell wed badger totally subsided after three days use ; replaced soothing smell lavender . i'm looking forward trying out other shave creams . while art shaving cream provides adequate lather coverage , i feel it could thicker . i am , however , only comparing it contemporary shave gels , whose thousands dollars rd could produce incomparable lather results . i foresee me my futur life long relationship . i asked my dad why he never told me satisfaction you get good double edged wet shave . he said , " i don't know . i guess it just so long since i've used one . right now , i'm using one 4 blades vibrates . " guess what he got father day .	-1

" when used dry these powders deliver subtle shimmer all over eye ; wet your choice added definition or used liner . love packaging - small pot opening brush snap lid - no mess no fuss , only great looking eyes ! - gail cook	1
this nice , light daytime fragrance that pleasant wear weekends other casual times . ( evenings , nothing comes me my must de cartier ! ) it citrusy but little more depth balance it so you don't go around smelling like fruit stand store . this first unisex fragrance i ever tried i surprised i liked it , though it bit " soft " my husband taste so i'll never get him try it . that probably better , i'd hate start sharing fragrances him .	1

okay , i am bit biased because i soft spot polo products but polo black arguably best i used years . i use finish new cologne every month . after smell great , it not overpowering , it great morning evening . plus it doesn't hang your clothes , so if you wear your shirt again , it doesn't this " hanging " smell . first time years , i am going use same cologne 2 consecutive months ! great product	1
if you buy this shampoo , buy something else it get this glue out your hair . i guarantee you disappointed , it equivalent herbal essence . ( also leaves your hair like glue	-1

i haven't outbreak acne 5 years until i started using this cream . i kept using it thinking my huge cysts couldn't possibly this very pricey stuff . i went dermo she said stay away these thick creams specifically anti-aging because they horrible your skin . i went back my cheap neutrogena lotion anti- aging it felt sooo much better lighter within week my skin cleared up . i didn't even realize how very thick this stuff until i started back my neutrogena . i feel so bad $$$ i lost i wish i would've gotten sample first . i encourage you same .	-1
i bought this eyeliner expecting great things , sorely disappointed . application difficult , mistakes almost impossible correct even if immediately , i can't soften line ( it * * smudgeproof ) . if you used brush-on-liquid-liner , very steady hand , want dramatic look , this might work you . i prefer softer line , so this didn't . also , it almost completely flaked off over course day . i'm giving it two stars because it really smudge-proof , no sliding or transferring . i didn't dark shadows smudging but i flakes , so i'm still not happy i t.t his definitely not worth pricetag	1
i used entire tube faithfully face cream over course several months . while i thought it moisturized fine , i not notice any change my lines , tone , texture . money i'd go get several tubes neutrogena anti-aging products - they work better , nicer texture smell much better	1
well i dint like smell all , i see nothing lovely this perfum , if ur looking good perfume give this holiday season , check out fantasy britney spears it smells so nice , or curious britney thats classic its must give or , . lo live smells really nice too so if i you i would rather not buy it if ur giving it present , or urself its not really worth ur money !	-1
after great success merkur classic i decided own up get futur . i super excited because i thought myself , " shoot , one pass instead two ... " not quite . starters razor bulking plain heavy . not kind heavy i'm comfortable trying shave i shouldn't feel i might drop darn thing . i started 1 first day get handle razor . not good shave , missed alot spots patches hair . so day two i went level 2 razor . same story , second verse . it left patches didn't shave well some areas . 2.5 areas got smaller but still ... they there . went 3 setting razor almost mangled myself . so next week i went back 2.5 it more consistantly , still gave me crappy shave . i give this one star because if it supposed better razor than anything before it , there shouldn't learning curve one double edge . least not one this severe . i get way better shave using my merkur classic i really think least me , this way go . i say use caution merkur futur . i also say if you're already getting good shave double edge you , don't buy new style sake buying new style . if you're double edge gets old ... buy new one same kind . only suggestion .	-1
i love cinnamon buns shower gel , so i thought i would try lip gloss . one thing , it smells/tastes nothing like cinnamon buns . i don't know what flavor , but i don't like it . maybe they added almond or something . secondly , it way too sticky . my hair kept getting stuck my lips . it reminds me vaseline . since i got this product kit , i cannot return it , but i not using it again	-1
i never tried anything philosophy wanted try 3 1 stuff , i thought lavendar pound cake would smell really good . i actually really disappointed . it sucks shampoo , body wash too- i ordered blueberry pie too , i haven't even used it , its just sitting my closet . price you get lot lasts long , but i wasn't impressed	-1
it true this product smells absolutely awful after it applied face . worse , it absolutely nothing . i applying significant amount morning night , 6 weeks , allowing it soak dry ... it nothing	-1
i got very irresistible givenchy perfume gift christmas . first smell , i loved it . then i spritzed it yikes ! 2 months ago i still scent me . it too flowery -- it not clean , fresh scent . more " i sprayed little too much potpouri here " scent . not people mild allergies perfumes either !!	-1
i agree reviewer . this product not worth price tag . it claims vanilla scent , it , but it barely noticible . don't buy this product based how it smells . moisturizer , you much better $23.00 .	1
ick . i bought ultra light kirsch because i thought it would similar discontinued grapey color i used love loreal . smell - fake grade-school grape-aid smell grossed me out . feel - i like lip gloss feels glossy . this stuff not shine enough or last long enough . color - color mild me . i very disappointed . i felt like i wasted money time . i still recommend loreal lip juice , though . i believe it same company , lip juice glossy , shiny , long-lasting way more cost-effective	-1
i used this product few times , trying justify money i spent . i could leave it my hair all day , effect essentially zilch . hair dead . it doesn't matter what propaganda beauty/cosmetics companies use promote their products , there no way vitamins , minerals , etc . going " feed " or strengthen your hair . when products washed out , so moisture . it dumb idea my part think putting guacamole my hair going make it a)smell good b)feel good . it really dumb me pay so much this stuff when i could've just easily much more cheaply made it myself	-1
its good waking up , because once you put it you feel refreshed because your lips feel fire . i like sting shine it . it finishes pretty fast roll ball may feel like little drag keep rolling lips , but i think it worth trying it unless you extreme sensitive lips , this stuff strong . i mention great smell ? yum ! me my boyfriend loved it .	1
its effect very much depends climate you live . if you live colder dry climate , especially during winter it exactly it promises - great moisturizer , lines diminished , puffiness . i really love using it - i am 35 currently living cold dry climate . but hot sometims humid climates , or during summer it just doesn't work well - i don't know why . i like it lot this my 3rd bottle , although i am using it seasonal eye care	1
if you like me get occasional zit when you least expect it , then this works out well . it not remove zit , but it cover nasty monster pretty well !! i put it under my lancome powder it really made difference . because it clear it blend whatever foundation or powder you use . oh yes it covers all redness comes those nasty zits . girls new best friend :	1
this currently my absolute favorite scent . i get so discouraged when smell somthing store love it , buy it , take it home put it , smells completely different me . i never problem this scent . it smells delicious bottle skin , if you like citrus . it smells like fresh , ripe orange , slightest hint spice . man my life finds it quite cuddle worthy . if you not familiar perfume oils , just somthing note . they highly concentrated , little goes long way . it also phases nicely , intense pleasently subtle long lasting . bonus there only few ingredients , so it less likely irritate sensitive skin . one bottle last last , there flexable applicator wand inside lid . i really can't say enough this wonderful fragrance	1
when i first tried this perfume , it reminded very much victoria secret pink -- it same distinctly sweet , strongly scented unique floral note , yet here bouquet significantly softer , sweeter . it would work well someone who likes sweet , girly scent light yet still pronounced . one drawback staying power poor : i couldn't detect any trait this just few hours later . this bit disappointing give high price , yet this still might good choice someone who looking everyday fragrance doesn't mind reapply	1
i : long , thick , fine hair naturally wavy . i don't color my hair but i get frizzies split ends , some dryness . i tried this product out after receiving small sample [ ... ] order , fell love it . i -love- smell , surprised other people didn't seem . i vastly prefer it some faker , more chemical smells lot shampoos seem use . i didn't use it leave , but deep conditioning treatment , afterwards i kept flipping my hair forward over my shoulder , both smell it just feel how amazingly soft it . this product left my hair looking healthy , shiny , gorgeous days . i get fair number compliments my hair general , but after i used this stuff i getting stopped street . everyone lady starbucks my professor mentioned how beautiful my hair looked . i highly recommend it . i tried lot hair products , including some ( like fekkai glossing cream ) made olive oil , better results ojon ( though i like lot fekkai products ) . other products i recommend : healthy sexy hair shampoo , conditioner , leave-in conditioner , jonathan product anti-frizz serum , origins happy ending conditioner , fekkai products curly straight hair , depending your mood :) products i don't recommend include suave fekkai glossing shampoo ( left my hair shiny all right , but frizzy . ) i would suggest ordering it sephora , they carry several sizes , give samples all online orders , very , very good taking returns , even if you've tried product out just don't like it	1
i like this scent . my first thought pears , before reading what notes , yes , apples . this not hardcore apple scent , but enough so . very fresh sweet but not too sweet . crisp spring-like . hint , tiny hint dandelions tiny bit rose , just tiny bit . my husband likes this scent me well , which saying lot . he hates roses foody scents , but still likes this .	1
i really like this product . i would not , however , agree person who said it entirely too strong scent . i would actually like it stronger , less peel more juice smell . but it nice scent , cleans very thoroughly . not best i've used , but very nice	1
this soap smells great ! smells just like cherry lollipop ! continues smell even after shower throughout day . mix i love juicy shampoo , american cream conditioner candy dusting powder	1

i thick , coarse , african-american hair relaxed ( permed straight ) . i usually use this product wet hair ( after shampoo)when blow-drying my hair straight . it makes it really smooth shiny . i received lot compliments my hair since i started using it . warm temperatures it melt down but my opinion it makes it easier use . when it solid you supposed rub it palm your hands liquify it then put it your hair . it smokey scent it but no one pays attention ... they looking how great my hair . i love ojon conditioner ( it very best i ever used)but shampoo my opinion seems dry my hair .	1
very good product great kind fruity smell . leave hair soft full " bounce " . easy comb hair after using this product but might combine kerastase conditionner very dry damage hair if your hair very long . price here still more expensive than europe : around 22 euros	1
i absolutely love clinique eye shadow . all their eye shadows go so smooth , never crease , just perfect shades colors my skin tone . almost peach color great because i use it highlighter under my brow or just base , either way i use it just every day ! :	1

smells great ! not too harsh my thin but long hair	1
i'm not makeup or product junkie any means , but simply can't miss even one day using my all lips . it cream ( much like moisturizer ) exfoliates smoothes your lips makes them fuller/plumper . it also fills any lines you may around mouth so i recommend using it not only your lips but also outside lipline . although i using it twice daily many years , i believe someone using it first time should see results fairly quickly . friends mine who wear lipstick ( i don't ) also claim if they use it right before they put lipstick it makes it go better last longer . ( apparently you also use this product eye cream smooth crowsfeet around eyes , but i havent tried this- i prefer caudelie eye serum cream . ) simply put , i highly recommend this product know you'll see results i !	1
it lovely light refreshing perfume . lovely daywear . loves it guys	1
this one my favorite perfumes . i love anything vanilla this great combination it violets , musk iris . it strong smell , so go easy it . one spray lasts all day .	1
i received tube philosophy cinnamon buns flavored lip gloss christmas ( other philosophy products ) . i super excited try this because i've told numerous people philosophy products spectacular . first , i must point out there sparkles this lip gloss . although they're very subtle your lips , if you're type gal who hates sparkles shimmer your makeup , i'd stay away this product . smell , it smell like cinnamon buns . it certainly not taste like it however ( which good thing ... i tend lick off my lip gloss if it tastes good ... this lip gloss not taste good ) . it very sticky thick so you don't use too much . it also stays your lips good amount time . would i suggest this product ? if you're looking good-smelling , long lasting lip gloss , i'd definitely recommend this . however , if these two things don't matter you i'd suggest you skip this ($10 tube lip gloss isn't cheap after all ) go drugstore brand lip gloss	1
i never found compact foundation , cream or powder , looked lasted even remotely well liquid foundation dusting powder over it . until now . this amazing makeup , best part it doesn't take whole lot product achieve perfect coverage . my skin tends red , but this doesn't even hint it . plus , it nice matte without too dry . everyday , this my time saving , face perfecting miracle .	1
i using this cream almost 2 months now results amazing . my sun spots lightened it also decreased redness my face . i continue use it highly recommend it .	1

this shampoo totally fulfilled its promise bright , shiny hair me . i nice hair begin ( if i say so myself ) , but i used this conjunction one lush conditioners(american cream)and my friends told me i shampoo model hair day . i'm not crazy beer-ish smell , which why i'll give it four rating . however , it doesn't seem very strong once you wash it out benefit worth it	1
i don't know why nobody else likes this product , but so far it only one works my ingrown facial hairs .. yes , it stings bit when i put it , but it quickly goes away . it doesn't dry my skin out , it actually helps get rid dry , white-looking flaky skin after i shave . i used get ingrown hairs so bad my face they would there months . eventually i'd get point my own surgery needle try extract hair . if i get ingrown hair now , i just use tend skin once morning once before bed , it actually extracts hair it own ! it gets rid redness swelling also associated ingrown hairs . only time my life my face actually looks clear , tend skin product it me . before i finish , i'd just like add i'm kind person nothing ever works . any product i try , never advertised . whether it shampoo , deodorant , medication , etc . tend skin one rarities actually work me . believe me , i've tried lot products ingrown hairs	1

avobath bath bomb turns water lovely luminous pale green . avocado , olive oil , lemongrass , bergamot , rosewood oil , gardenia extract makes this skin calming , soothing , moisturizing dream . " green luster " makes this bath especially beautiful gives it mermaid mood . i loved this one so much , i'm ordering two next time . scent lemon/lime , but time you get tub , floral scents more prominent . you add some bubbles , but they don't seem last very long - well , i using bath gel . so , you may want find bubble bar because olive oil seems make them disappear pretty fast . least , my theory because i've noticed bath oil same thing . avobath goes well whoosh products or happy hippy shower gel . if you mood , you might want amazing " godiva " shampoo conditioner 2 1 bar ( magical quality - makes hair super shiny ) or " i love juicy " shampoo " veganese " conditioner . last two also citrus scent especially delicious . when i use lush products , i'm good mood all week long . it truly amazing how happy content i am long i some lush products around . :) ~ rebecca review	1

oh my gosh ! i love this lip gloss so much . i first bought one last year , it best item makeup i've ever bought ! it goes great over other lip gloss/lipstick or alone . all colors great , but i'd start our pink first . my personal favorite " spring fling " because it not so bright , but it still juicy . you deffinetly not regret buying one these . it worth every penny	1
i using this product years . i really oily t-zone , i find this product keeps it control . it very good cleanser removes oil without drying your skin . no matter what color your skin tone may , i think you like this product !	1
tounge-and grove way handle detached make it easy use shower ( dont my glasses ) . detachable brush medium soft bristles easy skin . strap brush cotton , so this probably isn't once-in-a lifetime purchase , but very good price . everybody needs one	1
i long , thick , wavy hair loves frizz up . i tried every anti-frizz , hairstyling product out there , they either didn't work or weighed my hair down . i didn't want like this hair dryer hoping it wouldn't live up hype ... but , it excellent my hair . after using dryer ( no styling product ) my hair straight , shiny felt great . me , it didn't change amount time i dried my hair , so if your considering buying it speed , don't , unless you thin or short hair . it worth $200.00 price tag ? depends you personally , but i recommend you shop around because there better deals out there	1
i tried just every hair product market this very much surpassed my expectations ! i wasn't sure when i put it my hair , but i styling it , i amazed . it created lot volume my hair stayed shiny . i am ready try rest product line	1
this one philosophy 3-in-1 products . it used shampoo , bubble bath , shower gel . i've only used it shower gel , so that all i'm able review here . shower gel , this product exceptional . it extremely rich thick gel , produces generous lather abundant bubbles . i find it somewhat moisturizing- it doesn't explicitly moisturize my skin , but it also doesn't dry it out , even winter . addition , gel opaque creamy , rather than clear , like most shower gel . melon daquiri scent summery fruity . it pleasant sweet melons scent . it doesn't smell especially alcoholic ; though it part philosophy line 3-in-1s meant smell like fruity cocktails- like margaritas pina coladas . scent more fruity melon than alcoholic melon . said , people who like juicy , fruity scents likely love this . while i haven't tried using this bubble bath or shampoo , rich lather i get shower gel suggests me it would probably work very well other two parts 3-in-1 . one thing may problematic people- scent doesn't last beyond shower . i can't smell it my skin anymore when i get out shower , though scent quite strong while use . some people may find problematic . i like it doesn't clash my perfume , so it okay me .	1
i admit i tried find cheaper sunscreen same things this one without irritating my skin , but i keep ending back this one . it awesome . it feels great your skin , works great , so lightweight . it so easy wear under makeup if necessary , it leaves flattering look skin . when it first showed up i thought it awfully small amount , but then i realized it only takes tiny , tiny amount cover your whole face because it water-light . so it lasts ( least me ) least month daily use . my opinion only thing they could improve this product would make it sweat/water-proof , but then it might not feel good skin it . i can't find better facial sunscreen money	1
i love pine . i want eat it . i am nature detective so i love out doors so this woodsy perfum great me	1
... what you've doing or last night . this stuff feels nice cool leaves this great shimmering highlight which looks absolute natural best out few other types i've tried . really nice stuff !!	1

i've using this product , mild facial soap dramatically different moisturizer , fourteen years now . i remember my consultation clinique rep like it yesterday . therein lies rub -- if you've never used these products considering doing so , it best visit clinique representative help you decide which products best your skin . lot times , people not know what skin type they or think they one when it really . if you're not using right ones your skin type , you won't get results you need . clinique reps help . talk them first then you purchase anywhere ! i myself combination skin . clinique rep warned me i might some initial blemishes , i , but they tapered off after week or so . just out shower , or after long day who knows what may gotten your skin , this uplifting , cooling-when-it's-hot , breath fresh zinginess . often one all over swipe this cotton ball not enough -- so use other side puff , dab more clarifying lotion apply again , maybe more cotton ball till it no longer turns any shade . this worth it . you taking off not only makeup facial soap may not caught , but any impurities daily activity attract skin -- dirty fingers unconciously rubbed over neck or cheek , etc . follow up clinique moisturizer that right you your skin feel five times lighter . your skin important . these products helped mine stay amazing shape over years	1
i've mild case eczema , so am also always keeping eye out products help my skin , without resorting cortizone creams ... i've some success past using straight jojoba coconut oil eczema patches - but not enough keep up hassle oily spots skin . i even tried making my own recipes - some success . but , it time consuming i just don't time mess around kitchen cosmetics hobby . after looking reviews various types lotions/creams lush line , i decided give this one go . i've only using it couple days , but already my skin less irritated , scaliness seems diminishing some . ( eczema strikes top my feet bit ankle ... makes wearing combat boots bit annoying when its acting up)i'll probably need week or two steady use really know if it works i'm hoping , but so far so good ... there no real strong scent lotion - so it shouldn't bother those who sensitive smells . so also pretty cool end well :-) works great rest my skin well !! no more dryness winter weather anymore	1
used night cream or moisturizer under makeup .	1
white linen lovely , soft , exquisitely feminine fragrance . it floral notes tone down true soft lingering beauty . this one my favorite lauder fragrances one i really recommend . 5 stars estee !!	1
this product really what it says - it lifts smooths , conceals too . it best concealer i've tried , i've tried many . one note though - lightest shade very light . i very fair skin found it too white , so i exchanged it 2nd shade , which would also work well fair medium skin . great product	1
i like clean fresh scent . it not too heavy not overpowering . it comes cute pink bottle	1
i looking new scent stumbled upon this . i sold instantly never gotten so many comments any perfume i ever worn before . well worth it !!	1
i've always really dry , chapped lips always putting lip balm under my lipstick , before bed , probably million times throughout day . but nothing seemed help ... lipstick always seemed dry them out even more nothing looks worse than dry lips lipstick . it just makes your lips look even drier . buzz latte lip balm most amazing product ever !!! it smells like coffee really strong first but then goes away . it doesnt taste bad either . yes , its $8 bucks tube ... but tube twice size normal chapsticks so cost evens out . this product lasts forever ... why ? because it stays so long ... even lipstick or lip glosses . first time i put this when i tried friends . within hours i noticed dramatic difference so i went out bought my own . my lips never so smooth full . bare escentuals continues suprise me all their products !!! i dont think i every try makeup line . i think what makes this product work so well its got lot shea butter it . but this product amazing ! you even dip it bare escentuals blushes or eyeshadows create matching lipstick . this absolute must any makeup collection or anyone who suffers dry , chapped lips . you wont sorry .... you'll notice difference right away	1
years , i paying more imported french mattifier devastated when company stopped selling here . i tried other popular mattifiers ( namely smashbox photo finish ) , but this far best . turns out it good thing i forced find product . this product makes my shine huge pores my cheeks just vanish . i'm matte longer during day , since blush sticks this product well , i don't need foundation . i'd recommend it anyone wants their skin surface look smoother less shiny . i'm not huge fan clinique general , but this one product keeps me coming back	1
i love this shower gel , coming me , high praise , since i not love shower , am especially crabby when this activity must morning . you see , i much prefer languish warm bath , letting bubbles work getting clean me , instead devoting my energy good book . yet when i'm standing shower , enveloped clouds delicious blackberry steam , i am miraculously transformed crabby morning shower girl into very happy girl who then goes her merry way walks up friends work offering arm encouraging them " smell me " . lovely !!	1
i've used this product year couldn't happier . i am not ' makeup person ' this product just what i need smooth out my complexion moisturize my oily skin . fine lines large pores appear less noticable , skin remains shine-free , skin tone appears more even skin feels softer . one recommendation ..... directions tell you wait 2 minutes allow product ' set ' . get best finish , especially if applying powder ( like i ) or foundation over primer , you need wait full 2 minutes . this can't stressed enough .	1

this cutest packaged eyeshadow market . brush sits down shadow perfect amount powder gets it . if you don't get much shadow tip , just shake bottle little brush fills up more more dramatic effect . unlike other loose eyeshadow powders you use your own brush , this doesn't get too much brush or your eyelid it easy layer . it fantastic shimmer it each color looks good my skin color ( which really rare most cosmetics ) i can't tell you how much i love this stuff ! so go ahead buy it , don't forget shake bottle cap brush each time you apply so powder re-dispursts bottle . :	1

i'm really anal scented/flavored lipglosses- especially ones scented or flavored vanilla , but mac lipglass isn't vanilla-ish all ! it got very pigmented color , it stays long time gloss , each tube lasts long time ... don't let what other reviewer said vanilla scent throw you off	1
i've using this product years . every now then i try product hopes finding something little cheaper . i never found anything comes close this one . i'm over forty , but still somewhat oily skin , get breakouts occasion . if i use this two three times per week , i definitely notice i fewer breakouts . my skin smoother more even . i like menthol feel . i don't smell it all , find it refreshing . i've also tried 7-day scrub don't find it come close this product . grains 7-day scrub few far . exfoiliating scrub , they very concentrated . too much ? just add little water . i only hope clinique doesn't stop making this	1

i using these since sometime early 1990s . before web made them easier find , we used ask family friends visiting hawaii pick them up us . i've recommended them many others over years because they easier than back brush , more vigorous than wash cloth , quick-drying . salux brand rougher ( i think better ) than imitations i since seen	1
i don't know how many mascaras i own but there always two or three i hold my favorite or just different occasions . one those hypnose i really like it when i go out or just looking dramatic look . postive : 1 . ) look : i've never neccessarily wanted wear fake eyelashes but they look almost perfect . unbelievably , hypnose gives you look . it amazing just how feathery your eyelashes look . 2 . ) flaking : this mascara never really flaked bottom my eyes . that really important me . negative : 1 . ) this mascara starts out great but after two half weeks it starts emptying out you . this might just because there days when i reapplyed it or simply because i just used it pretty well ( 1 coat just everyday because how much i liked it ) . summary : if you want natural yet " those real lashes ?! " look , then you'll like this mascara . i'm giving it four stars instead five simply because how long it lasts but if you use it once it while , then it last you while	1
my background : i used gillette sensor . it okay . i upgraded sensor xl . it pretty good . i tried mach 3 , i hated it -- it felt like i wiping my face wall blades . i finally settled sensor 3 -- nearly 2 bucks blade . it got job , but there no real joy shaving . considering i it least once day ( twice if i'm going out night ) process should more enjoyable . after quite bit research , including newsgroups customer reviews , i splurged got merkur futur ( though i got chrome finish ) . shaving awesome , i literally look forward it . lathering up shave cream ( i use crabtree evelyn sandlewood ) this brush real treat . super soft , holds ton water , results thick lather . ( warned , first few times you use it , it stinks like wet badger ... but it goes away ) . razor itself heavy ... i mean heavy . which good , because you need let razor work -- no pressure , or you take off you face ) . main difference this razor shaving cartridges , you actually feel blade against your face ( opposed chunk plastic ) . anyone who shave barber knows how great this feels . once i got technique down it close smooth shave i ever . finishing up cold water splash , non-alcoholic toner / aftershave , moisturizing lotion , invigorating way start day . please note : stated above brush smells little " badgery " first , but it goes away . head razor not pivot , so you follow contours your face . head itself it bulky , so you work your technique around your nose , under you chin . sum , this razor adds old-school , refreshing routine my mornings . i love it , would whole-heartedly recommend it .	1

i read reviews this product , decided go it . i love smell ( although it distinctive scent it may not everyone ) , it make my hair really soft . however , i semi-fine hair , it made my hair really oily-looking , even though i used tiny amount . i think people thicker hair may benefit more this hair treatment . it reminds me glorified coco butter just few more ingredients ( coco butter way cheaper ) . i use ojon restorative hair treatment again , but probably only weekends when i'm not going work ( because oily look ) . bottom line , definately smell it first make sure you like it ! they sell it pure beauty stores , among other places . , if you try it somewhere before you buy it , it ! make sure it doesn't give you " oily " look	1

ok , if you weren't already aware , blotting papers merely same material you use separate your bum public toilet . however , i am not inclined stuff few seat covers my purse . sephora put their blotting papers mini roller attractive light blue container . this better than other packaging options , where too small papers offered kleenix-box style . sephora rolling sheet option allows you take much you need , offers efficient cutting edge easy tearing . now that what i'm talking	1
why would anybody review perfume ?. my case , this first time i , reason so recommend it . " white linen " simply wonderful . am i exaggerating ?. i don't think so ... truth told , i didn't buy it myself : it gift . notwithstanding , i gone buying it ever since lucky day which i discovered it . why ?. well , because i like it , due fact it goes well my personality . i know , seems strange explanation , but it truth . this perfume isn't new , fact est�e lauder created it 1978 , coincidently year which i born . all same , who needs new perfume , specially when there old one works so well ?. this one includes , among other fragances , citrus , peach , jasmine , lilac , rose amber . result unique , very pleasant . whole , i say i recommend " white linen " those who appreciate subtle but special perfume . if you want more words describe it , i suppose i look them up my dictionary . but i guess best course action would trying sample " white linen " : then you no doubts what i am talking :) belen alca	1

short history !! house creed one oldest perfume manufacturers world founded 1760 james henry creed . house creed quickly became favorite among english court queen victoria appointed house creed official perfume supplier . house creed also became popular other royals too ! alright , so himalya created men . i'm woman fallen love this classic scent enjoy wearing it myself . himalaya one my personal favorites made house creed ( however i'm pretty partial too all scents created both men women house creed ) . according descriptions i've found , himalaya blend mandarin , grapefruit , sandalwood , cedarwood , amber , pepper tonka musk . i feel himalaya rich , smooth , classic scent never go out style . this fragrance concentrated , so little goes long way scent lasts long time without re-applied . i received plenty compliments this fragrance when i've worn it	1

i love this foundation . i warm sand moisture rich foundation . it incredibly smooth , long wearing color makes my skin look bright radiant . bobbi brown makes very natural foundation colors there range colors all different skin tones . when i'm shopping it seems most lines cater lighter medium skin tones , but bobbi brown really come through flattering options all skin tones . only draw back this foundation not provide adequate spf protection , even though it says spf 15 . therefore , you still need wear sunscreen underneath least spf 15 . i use this foundation every day i wear sunscreen paula choice ( which i love ) . i think color options available , long lasting color smooth texture make this foundation worth price .	1
i'm really anal scented/flavored lipglosses- especially ones scented or flavored vanilla , but mac lipglass isn't vanilla-ish all ! it got very pigmented color , it stays long time gloss , each tube lasts long time ... don't let what other reviewer said vanilla scent throw you off	1
these great candles make great gifts because they packed so nice . candles burn evenly nice slowly . scents great ! natural smelling strong enough but not overwhelming any way . i burn one these my first level scent whole floor unlike most other candles where i need burn multiple candles get same level scent ... so yes , they more expensive than candles you get but when i burn this one , its only one i need burn time ... cheaper candles i dont really end up savings because i am burning several once .	1
