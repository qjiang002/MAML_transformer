shape conforms perfectly designer hands , but unless you share same dna , i'd avoid this product . i've used many these over years this only one i struggled . constantly shifting it get it high low points place tolerable . i finally reversed it , pointing it towards me it worked little better . this just needs simple pad . instead , they've overdesigned it gimmick .	-1
this worst electronics puchase i've ever made . when i first got mini it great , looked nice sounded great . within 6 months battery life started go way down , after year it down nothing , didn't work properly , would show full charge not last more than 20 minutes . if you're going take chance ipod , definitely get newer different model may better quality than this one	-1
i bought this item because amazon never 3m model i wanted stock . so i settled this one . big mistake . wheels this stand only 8 inches apart which makes your cpu very unstable . spring steel friction fit makes it difficult one person attach or remove this stand cpu . it really two person operation . finally , if your cpu side access panel , you remove it stand gain access since stand uses pressure fit hold it computer . take look 3m cs100 stand . i think it much better design	-1
extremely disappointed , especially after lot research read great reviews this product ( axion 7 " player ) received . i bought it my wife road trip she excited large screen ability connect antenna watch tv . player worked fine first dvd we tried , but after screen freaked out went almost black . you couldn't see picture but you could hear movie just fine . no complaints sound i guess , but what good if screen doesn't work ? needless say i returned this fast possible . fact , if i could rate it less than one star i would , since it didn't even last one day . terrible product	-1
i've this phone approx . 9 months now , maybe longer ... i truly don't know how i've stood using this dual phone system so long . however , tonight i've taken giant step " upward " towards better quality design panasonic kx-tg 5432m dual system . this dual handset worst i've ever experienced cordless system . moment i set it up , static atrocious . step away base unit over ten feet it sounds like someone gargling gravel or mad cat hissing your ear . i can't even step into my attached garage talk someone without major static point not even able heard other person . even within six feet base i receive intermittent static becomes obnoxious distracting , not only me , but other person other end ... they hear it too . i never purchase uniden product , if this non-quality product they put out . i 2.4 mhz system would outshine this system ... i wish i'd never gotten rid it . title says ... if you desire lot static when you talk phone , this system you need bring crackling symphony music your ear . melodic consistancy this system creates ones enjoyment talking phone not put you sleep , but rather increase your aggravation dealing what sounds like major electrical storm going inside your head . uniden should ashamed this product . stepping down soapbox now ..	-1
i owned dmr-es40v over 6 months . it combo dvd/vcr unit . i sufficient time become intimately familiar pros cons unit . manual : it imperative manual . this machine somewhat complicated , frequent trips instructions necessary . if everything working correctly , you usually find instructions you need somewhere it . it overly time-consuming though , since items don't seem logically flow . if you dig long hard enough though , they there somewhere . set-up : somewhat experienced setting-up home theater , this generally easy . text pictures sufficient . searching through function menu , i learned perform same action different levels required using different imput buttons . this needlessly confusing . course auto clock set function isn't very accurate ( i haven't seen accurate one yet ) . dvd playback : general playback pretty straight-forward . i really miss some extra playback features my jvc progressive player ( which 3 years older ) . finding scene movie comparatively difficult . zoom feature missing . many convenience features not present . dvd recording : recording onto dvd-ram disc dream compared old fashioned vcr tapes . i really enjoy using them . quirk -- you must unit stand-by record scheduler . this mandates watch recorded show while recording another(on same disc ) you must wait until unit begins recording , then select show watch navigator . uhf tuner some trouble recording somewhat weak signals channel 19 . other weak channels record but not 19 . this problem started 6 months after initial set-up . there annoying bug daylight savings time , newer extended time period . panasonic web site suggests going into set-up menu unchecking dst box ; thus removing feature . if this anything , it would allow you set clock manually . without automatic dst adjustment would not annoying , but even though you turn-off this feature it still resets your clock twice day noon 7pm est . this ruins any tv scheduling you set . this malady persisted until date former dst spring-ahead arrived . several weeks scheduling hell ! i requested assistance customer service but never received telephone call promised . no message , no number call -- just promise call again when i home . vcr use : this feature really buggy . you supposed able eject cassette remote ; but this only worked month or two . when tv show scheduled recording unit won't tape it if you merely insert cassette . it doesn't recognize insertion cassette unless tape made move -- either playing little or fast forwarding/reversing . this really annoying . last impression : last movie ( last king scotland ) i watched took over machine . remote control would not function , disc would not stop , disc could not ejected . it necessary unplug unit , restart it , eject disc , totally reset all menu items -- which randomly reset various settings . worse some settings no longer selectable . one other movie would not even play machine -- forcing me use trusty jvc unit . i must say this machine many same problems still occurring new units what i read this forum other ones . these units released sale way before they ready public consumption . i recommend looking elsewhere .	-1
specs look good . hdmi 1.3 , 1080p , firmware upgrade over ethernet , etc . unit seems solid ( heavy ) well built . however , toshiba chose ship this hd-dvd player only composite a/v cable ( yellow , red , white rca jacks ) box . best resolution you get this cable 480i , not even good s-video connection ! it pretty amazing high-end consumer electronics device which advertised its high-definition capabilities hdmi 1.3 interface shipped without cable set ( component video or hdmi ) actually makes it possible customer connect it hdtv . i don't know how much cost savings toshiba gets out not including cable costs less than $5 . now let get real review : pros : - one best features this unit its capability upscale regular dvds 1080p . upscaling very high quality . unit also various noise reduction options help some poorly mastered dvds . - if weight unit any indication , build quality high . - it ethernet port firmware updates ( possible future functionality)cons : - very slow boot time . takes longer boot than my windows xp pc . - especially durimg 1080p hd-dvd playback , unit gets very hot . make sure your enclosure/rack open back . there somewhat loud fan unit back player . - this player no zoom/scaling functions dealing non-anomorphic dvds , so you use your tvs scaling function . kind pain since image quality suffers when video go through two parallel scalers	-1

things i like : ( 1 ) option tile front keyboard up makes typing much more comfortable . i skeptic it before i purchased it , but really like it . also , this first keyboard i used allows so many typing angles . ( 2 ) included software gives great deal control over customizing all extra keys keyboard . even if you don't windows vista , you program gadgets key suit your needs . ( 3 ) keyboard no lag me , whatsoever . ( 4 ) i'm big fan standard 3x2 key setup home keys , etc . ( 5 ) this small change , but i'm using this setup dell inspiron 6000 laptop . software replaced large volume notifications ( onscreen display showing volume level , mute , etc . ) smaller more attractive style notification . me gusta . ( 6 ) curved keyboard also comfortable . it requires no time nor effort getting used it . ( 7 ) i haven't any problems keyboard " out range . " ( 8 ) mouse , i'm switching wireless intellimouse explorer 3.0 , which also made microsoft , laser 6000 mouse included . this new mouse more comfortable . ( not huge difference , but noticeable . ) it also lighter , slides around little effort . what i don't like :( 1 ) lock key above number pad set default display same two options when you click ' start ' then ' log off windows . ' i would liked option change key shut down / hibernate dialog instead . i haven't found option available , so far . ( 2 ) keyboard little bit wider than others , but i don't find it problem . it just different . additional programmable buttons outweighs downside extra width . five stars	1

i lot research , not wanting rush into anything then regret it after seeing something else week later . i buy newest 40 " 720p samsung $1899 ... then i stumbled upon this one circuit city $1999 bought it spot ... paid $50 delivery it my living room three hours later . i've it week now , i love it . standard-definition picture quality just okay , but any us buying these tvs watch sdtv ? i get 15 hd channels through my cable company , including all four major networks plus espn , espn2 couple music movie channels . therefore , majority everything i watch available hd anyway . sdtv content still looks decent typical viewing distance 10-12 feet . hd content looks awesome ( including black levels ) , my cable provider broadcasts only 720p . i only imagine how good 1080p content going look once it becomes available . i'm going wait year or two high-definition dvd format war play out before i buy blu-ray or hd-dvd player . but i've watched standard-definition dvd my xbox this tv , picture beautiful . i'm sure high-definition dvd would look little better side-by-side comparison , but you not any complaints watching standard-definition dvd this tv . short , this excellent tv , especially compared other 1080p models its size range . if you're looking something range $2000-$2200 , this one you want . enjoy	1

look , bargain-basement product , what you expect ? first , you expect it work , i confirm it definitely work . when plugged usb , it signals xp correctly . driver software very tolerant . you install it any time there never resource conflict or problems system recognizing device . so installation 5 minute process . next comes capture initial encoding . well , software bit lame far features gui . typical . but it absolutely saves mpeg2 / dvd format just you'd need it making dvds all your dish network or ps2 or vhs content . frame rate full 30 fps . it takes svideo or standard rca video signal . both just fine quality . resolutions not great ... but its passable dvd when you crank it up . don't think you encode some blu-ray quality mpeg this though . far overall durability product , i've literally left mine plugged into wall running 1 year straight . it gets hot , but its never so much flickered or needed reset . bottom line ? this thing like kids toy- its cheesy but tough nails . get it your first analog signal mpeg encoder . its good value .	-1

pros : three customizable video profiles ( movies , broadcast tv ... ) ; excellent brightness contrast ; good viewing angles center ; generous input options ; cons : big , centered on/off button cries out my toddler turn it on/off/on/off . finally put 35lb barbell front i t.t he biggest con not tv but dearth hd content . others ' comments broadcast tv looking horrible hd sets cannot overemphasized . same dvds sd dvd players . latter note , buy good upcoverting dvd player ( lt ; $150 ); visual results simply outstanding . also note you need run component video minimum , hdmi preferred ; using s-video or composite complete waste money you spent tv . so other ' con ' you probably need new a/v receiver cables . so recap , if you want good experience , you need hd tv , upconverting dvd player , a/v receiver component or better yet hdmi connections , hd broadcast content ( cable or satellite ) . this not cheap endeavor	1

this little reader fast easy use usb flash drive . pop your card , plug it , wahlah , all your files shown . transfers very fast easy . it uses standard usb cable , so it likely you could use same cable variety devices ( mp3 player , camera , cell phone)the device somewhat flimsy , however front always snaps off when you try open unit rather than working like hinge , it should . this somewhat annoying reattach hinge everytime , so it gets 4 stars . still very good buy , especially price	-1

i bought this recently not knowing much what out market terms tablets , i some advice if you're going buy this product . pros : it shame wacom doesn't make tablets 5x7 since i found out this perfect size- it not so small you no room draw properly , it not big enough you hurt your arm long movements after tiring day work . price- i bought this 20 dollars local radioshack , but you get one much cheaper online compared wacom graphire which 4x5 upwards around 50 us dollars . it compatible almost every graphics software works remarkably well . unless you're professional graphics designer , you won't need any costly wacom tablets if you've got this . cons : when i first unpackaged it , i tearing my hair out two days trying figure out how make this work windows xp . all you out there similar problem , download this driver newer versions windows relax : http://www.compgeeks.com/drivers/kbgeartablet.zip pen sensitivity need set your desired pressure-sensitivity first , so don't try it out before going control panel changing settings . i find best setting use barrel button option left double-click . :) hope helped bit	-1

memorex makes excellent paper sleeve protect cds dvds lying around gathering dust . paper sleeves also particularly good when mailing cds dvd discs because they protect disc while reducing cost postage . it costs less mail cd dvd media paper sleeves than it mail same cds dvds slim jewel cases . this savings alone should make these sleeves pay themselves ! color white neutral doesn't distract you able focus label or other writing cd or dvd . i agree reviewer who notes there hole back sleeve into which you insert flap . this ensures cds dvds don't dislodge when they transit postal system or your car you take them one place . they also useful people who accumulated so many cds dvds store media even slim jewel cases now takes up too much room . overall , these good quality paper sleeves right price . i highly recommend these cd/dvd paper sleeves people who want practical cost-efficient alternative jewel cases .	1
i installed this unit my hp amd 64 x2 19-inch lcd monitor . installation very straightforward , no problems experienced . unit two rows power outlets - eight outlets total . all surge protected , but only one row battery backup . each row includes outlet offset allow transformer power supplies connected still accommodate use other outlets . unit also surge protects incoming telephone line , interacts well transparently my dsl service . unit comes usb connector cable used transfer information unit computer . also included " powerchute personal edition " software . this software replaces ups option used under " power " icon widow xp control panel . powerchute pe allows user selection alarms power options best fit user needs . powerchute pe automatically loads computer startup , resides icon right-side window task bar . it monitors unit status , provides information concerning abnormal power events occurred future reference . order assure there enough battery power this unit operate properly , i only attached pc monitor powered row outlets . transformers seem use lot power , gain most time available adequate shut-down times they should only plugged into " surge only " outlet row . when a/c power fails , unit immediately picks up power load . it then begin shut down pc if a/c power not become available shortly . default method it uses place pc into " hibernation mode " , saving desktop exactly " " future start-up . it accomplished this task my pc perfectly . if i wanted ups keep my computer running several minutes during a/c power outage , this not unit i would purchased . however , keep my system re-booting due power interrupted momentarily , or shut down pc safely should power outage last longer , this cost-effective solution those tasks .	-1

i trying find way easily carry lot camera equipment quite some time . i tried backpacks , shoulder bags , duffel bags , but none them really worked all well . then i saw lowepro street field system completely customizable pouches , vests , belts , accessories . it works great , you only get pouches you need so there no waisted space you organize them however you want according how often they used ( put frequently used items easier access places . ) variety alone this system worth investment , but quality ease use also very high which big plus . you get case any lens , camera body , or accessory you . i even cases my cell phone water bottle . one word caution , sure measure your lens lens hood backwards if you use them make sure entire thing fit into pouch , because sometimes lens fit , but then lens lens hood not . i often carry 5-6 lenses , extension tubes , teleconverters , extra memory cards batteries , bunch cleaning supplies other gadgets , which weights ton . but when they evenly distributed this vest/belt lowepro system it actually very manageable . only down side everyone staring you because you thousands dollars camera equipment strapped your body . but if you overlook , this way go . i used this system many zoos without ever problems , fact just unzipping single lens switching seems safer me than opening entire bag equipment every time you want switch lenses . many cases also come built rain/snow cover so if weather changes all your equipment not destroyed . you also put just few pouches normal belt when you just going take photos back yard or don't need take all your equipment , which nice . i really can't say enough how much easier this makes traveling lot equipment , if you hopelessly searching better solution , consider this , you won't regret it .	1

i just purchased this mouse over weekend retailer but should've gone through amazon it cheaper ... anyway , i am most impressed this mouse . it very accurate , so much so i began see what other surfaces i could move it still accurately move around screen : my chest w/ sweater , my pant leg , my other desk chair didn't hinder mouse any way ! i would highly recommend this mouse laptop users who travel won't necessarily desktop work . lx7 also very comfortable hold - i smaller hands weight solid but not too heavy once you put two aa batteries ( supplied ) . tapered shape height back mouse support hand well . scroll wheel responsive i like side side zoom feature too . it not super loud clicker/grinder type like microsoft mice . tracking very good - photoshop/illustrator cad users take note . extra second function buttons top mouse programmed quick launch settings . finish very good - this top-quality product . logitech it right	1

i purchased this phone it shipped directly my elderly father state . description never indicated batteries required it not come batteries . i known , i would either ordered phone or batteries go it . instead , phone sat 2 weeks waiting one dad caregivers purchase batteries . dad swears it doesn't speakerphone option since i haven't seen phone , i no idea if it correct phone . if it advertised speakerphone capabilities , they not well marked other " big buttons " . i'm disappointed	-1
we found this light very good quality . when purchasing , we also considered similar light black decker . this light seemed sturdier tighter construction . we bought locally , so we option testing these store , before we bought ( they all come packages which allow crank free , so you try them . both models , we discovered some work better than others . what i mean some bd work better than other bd some iluminators work better than others . this may due way they treated store - some used over over again before purchase . it took while , but we found one held charge long time . fact , when i charged it home , it lasted bright light ( three leds ) 1.5 hours kept emitting dim light 12 hours . one bd we purchased ( returned ) stayed only 10 seconds after charged two munutes ( not useful ) . advice : these internet-ordered probably more likely free in-store over-use ( repeat - probably ) . however , you also can't try them before buying . so , like many things you'll need weigh those pros cons . if you get good one , you'll probably agree it very good little flashlight . also - you probably find them locally $15 , so keep mind well .	1

garmin forerunner 305 awesome . it tracks numerous metrics your run including distance , pace , heart rate ( optional hr monitor ) , grade , elevation also real-time averages all these metrics . then docking station you dump all your training info computer software allows you review it things like create courses your workouts . only reason i gave it 4 stars rather than 5 included software leaves bit desired . maps very little detail my case i know they actually incorrect . i know garmin better map since i one their gps units my car it works great knows every little street . forerunner very good product really improved my training	-1
this great dvd player if you want play divx movies or mpeg files burned your computer onto cd-r , dvd-r , dvd+r etc . it plays just every media format any kind blank cd or dvd . it also plays standard store bought dvds just fine . i needed it because all dvds i made home would receive disc error when trying watch them my old toshiba . it connected played fine my 42 " flat screen lcd hdtv . photos burned onto cd also play slide show without connect your camera - very cool . only thing this player i would change would remote control . it looks cool but kinda clunky pointed precisely right spot player or you'll end up pushing button numerous times no effect . otherwise i'm more than satisfied continue use it long time	-1

first , me - i am hp printer bigot , pc user . i bought this printer print labels cds , installed it mac ( which i barely operate ) , so i'm really unfamiliar territory . said , printer software installed no problems . i printed test cd no problem , quality stunning ; significantly better than my hp 950c , which getting old , but still considered photo quality . i'm sure this partially due using 6 colors ink , instead 4 used hp ( i graphic arts background could explain why this , but not here ) . it also printed very fast - photo quality cd label printed less than three minutes . i very concerned this , because i afraid i would wait around 10 minutes per cd , which would made multiple printings very tedious . software designing cd labels great - much better than hp d5160 software , according features reviews i've read ( hp d5160 other printer i looking . it priced same epson r260 ) . replacement claria ink cartridges available all over internet under five dollars each ($5 ) - ignore other posts here , google it yourself . speaking ink costs , when buying printer you need proper mindset : printer free , you're really paying ink . this true virtually all home printers sold today . get used it . so here my summary : pros : outstanding print quality , very fast printing , low cost , good software . cons ( compared hp ): noisier , larger , probably uses more ink than hp .	1
i bought these use my desktop computer system . i spare paradigm subwoofer , so i added setup these things seriously rock out . they blend sub very well , crossed-over sub 100hz . very nice attractive , too . smooth sound , good imaging despite sitting desk two flat-screen monitros them . big sound relatively small size . glad i bought them	1

buyers beware ! i never written or posted consumer rating my life . i am so disappointed vonage overall customer service ; i feel i no choice but warn others . vonage its own words not guarantee quality its service . vonage customers experience : ( 1 ) dropped calls , ( 2 ) garbled communications , ( 3 ) non-responsive dishonest customer service department . reason vonage not guarantee performance because it knows it cannot . my first mistake believing vonage help desk , during my initial , " 30 day money back guarantee period , " when they told me my issues due line quality not vonage . since then , i spent three months vonage my high speed internet service provider technicians attempting make this service work . all speed tests indicate my isp lines fine . i high speed internet technician visit my house last week only tell me everything checks out . all this said , my vonage phone never worked worse . i made call today recipient could not even discern whom i . when i finally threw towel decided vonage not me , i hit $39.99 service charge upon cancellation plus cost phone , despite documented lack performance day one . vonage performance substandard any measure . closely look all other options before bringing vonage into your life definitely terminate all agreements within your first 14 days avoid inevitable early termination fees . make sure you read below clauses vonage terms service agreement before you agree anything . vonage customer service manager , mike , sited these disclaimers when i told him i not satisfied service :( 1 ) " no warranties service , " section 4 , paragraph 4 ; ( 2 ) " return device , " section 2 , paragraph 10 ;( 3 ) " termination fee , " section 3 , paragraph 6 ; and(4 ) " money back guarantee ; limitations conditions , " section 3 , paragraph 7 . when i switched vonage , i simply looking reliable telephone service company stands behind its product supports its customers . vonage lack line reliability poor customer service motivated me document my experience . i call vonage customer service my old fashion landline because voice quality my vonage phone so poor i would not able conversation . after waiting 20 minutes talk service manager , mike , i told i contractually bound because i not terminate my agreement within first 30 days . this moment i thought stereotypical shady used car transaction . i lured buy vonage because promises great service all free bells whistles only " internet calling provide . " instead i received lemon , phone unreliable company not stand behind its product . while vonage may get my $39.99 termination fee cost vonage phone , i not feel i just lay down vonage failure perform . i feel compelled ( 1 ) warn others vonage hopefully save them aggravation i experienced ( 2 ) hit vonage where it hurts , economic pocket book . i am terminating my service soon possible .	-1

i essentially bought onkyo 804 receiver replace 10 year old onkyo model not digital unit ( obviously ) . i currently new sony 5-disc dvd/cd player panasonic dvd recorder directly input , hdmi connections , my 42 " panasonic plasma hdtv . receiver takes digital optical audio output tv ( use video 3 select receiver/remote control ) plays it through my 5.1 speaker system . also , dvd player digital coaxial audio output connects receiver coax input ( use dvd select receiver ) . course , my old onkyo cassette deck connects through regular rca jacks uses onkyo r1 proprietary line connection run cassette deck through receiver remote . note i not even need use receiver 2 hdmi inputs or 1 output this simple scheme . setup menus require using your tv screen , so you temporarily install plain rca video cord receiver monitor out tv convenient front video input jack i . this receiver many listening modes they all sound great . thx cinema mode my favorite . sound separation , particularly movie dialogue out center channel , outstanding . my dvd recorder also plays dvd audio discs , which superb this unit . setup not difficult if you read through manual twice before even starting . microphone speaker initiallization excellent ; works just advertised , you may over-ride any setting manually if you wish . note if you only use 5.1 speaker connections ( not 7.1 ) i , 4th 5th speaker connected side surrounds , not back surrounds ! i kept it simple still use all my original component remotes , if no other reason than they each more options available use than do-it-all receiver remote . i use receiver remote volume , radio tuner channel selector , input mode selector , listening mode selector , that it . money , best receiver i checked into , including some nice denon's! lots power connections . only took 3 days shipping too . unit run hot , so keep nothing top grill .	1

( fairly fast , too ! ) i mean photo-quality . cards look like they just came professional printing house . part excellent design this printer paper isn't folded back over onto itself like hp printers . this means higher bond paper ( like photo papers , business card stock , resume ' paper , other thicker materials ) feeds straight through without getting caught , bound , or jammed ! no more cockeyed , misaligned printing ! no more smudges smears ! print cartridges smaller , but contain single colors -- no more sprinting office depot order four color cartridge because one color empty . buy only what you need . no more throwing away all your magenta yellow ink because cyan empty . scanning seems work well , ocr software contained installation actually translates typed word reasonably well . overall , excellent design . unfortunately , office depot tells me canon discontinued this model .

sony 40v2500 really great hdtv . purchased direct amazon wound up great price free delivery tax free . little patience needed get best possible deal . delivery prompt faster than advertised . if one afford extra price , 1080i only way go . sony states 1080 definitely standard future . i must agree , however , many other customer reviews it little unbelievable remote not universal remote . sony should more than little embarrassed . i just viewed premiere planet earth series full hd it truly spectacular this tv .	1

previous review mentions antennas key good cb setup correct . normal cb user i would recommend either wilson lil ' wil or wilson 500 antenna . both magnetic mount antennas . lil ' wil antenna relatively small antenna it only around $39.00 . actually any wilson cb antenna fine . also , good job setting up your antenna you should purchase swr meter . they not expensive . you only need meter connected inline radio antenna when you adjusting antenna . once you adjusting antenna you take meter out connection connect antenna directly radio . don't fooled cheap ordinary cb antennas like you find radio shack . not settle anything less then wilson antenna . cobra uniden both make fabulous cb radios so either make fine	1

i'm not going pretend say i'm great audiophile , pronounce these phones best ones ever made , because they probably aren't . but they first pair i've bought cost more than $20.00 . i haven't opportunity listen any expensive headphones tell difference . i bought these headphones replace pathetic ear buds came my new mp3 player . i admit i bought them because they look sooo cool ! they light me , they sound good , lot better than my ugly , $20.00 koss headphones . i bought pink pair because skullcandy donates money breast cancer charity . that important me , because my family lost my dear aunt ruth disease last june . i think her every time i slip these comfortable headphones listen my favorite tunes . i don't think these hadphones real serious audiophile , but if you like me , looking upgrade " cheap " pair headphones , look good doing it , go it	-1
i recieved this product christmas , i charged it once since then , listened it 3 - 1 hour rides , 1 - 4 hour ride 1 - 2 1/2 hour ride , batteries still full . 9 half hours nearly non stop battery bar hasn't even moved . i put 1,200 songs it , i still room , i even some 20 minute songs there . earphones kind uncomfortable . wristband allows it carried easily around , although it become uncomfortable after long periods time , because it tends loosen up after while . no artist name previously mentioned ..... you manually imput artist name so i don't know why you're complaining . sound output great , better than ipod , me several friends compared them . all all i highly reccomend this product , it only flaw it size , allows it misplaced very easily	1
i bought phone " worldbargains " // price great it arrived within reasonable time // i buy " worldbargains " again	1

i bought this microphone go one sony minidisc recorders . it very sensative . this , course , good thing - or bad . plugging mic directly into recorder ( without extension ) not worth much because it picks up so much sound unit itself - very distracting . so , one must use included extension move it away uni t.t he mic also very sensative movement ( similar wind noise ) so one really needs just set it out-of-the-way location leave it . even turnig volume unit down ( which operates similar mics " gain " level ) leaves unit very ( you guessed it ... ) sensative nearby noise . i guess ideally i wish two mics weren't quite so omnidirectional	-1

i shocked read previous reviews since my experience totally opposite . my phones don't only work perfectly but they also comfortable , small , clear reception . i've purchased motorola products before they all worked great ( so far least ) . i live apartment where many other wireless devices used my neighbors these phones held their ground just fine ( not like microsoft wireless mouse/keyboard combo i recently bought ) . i also voip service ( voice over ip aka internet phone ) company named broadvoice ( much better cheaper than vonage ) they work great . i really no complaints all this product although some improvements could made ( e.g. internal battery so it doesn't lose time or 2 phone line support would nice , but i'm splitting hairs )	1

i bought this phone cousin ( keypad , answering machine base ) myself six months ago , like it lot . i've since referred it two other people who both histories crappy cordless home phones . they both bought this phone both love it . only identified probems : when recalling caller id number , phone not add 1 out-of-area calls . so cid return feature only works numbers my area code . once great while phone , when picked up off receiver , search not connect giving " out range " message . while this sounds like major problem , it happens rarely fixed simply picking up speaker phone base .	-1

i really no complaints . it simple , clean , looks nice . people complain nothing cover screen but i just took advice manufacturer : " screen area left open . if you concerned screen scratches , you simply cut square plastic package skin comes .

i excited this product couldn't wait get it . got one christmas well ... hmmm . after trying it out couple days i'm pretty dissapointed . i use it usb 2.0 while plate pretty cold , beverage not . i tried it glass , then thinking aluminum would conduct cold better . difference almost negligible . it barely keeps already cold beverage cool ... certainly doesn't cool room temperature beverage even after sitting unit hour . it somewhat cool if volume liquid very low(an inch or less ) rather neat idea just didn't totally come fruition . you're better off just using beverage cozy .	-1
i got this phone because i thought it looked cool thought it would interesting phone talking you talk into different way- this phone , mouthpiece mounted top rotating socket you hold earpiece up your ear . it definitely different look , you see it action - say , person actually using it - fully appreciate aesthetic effect . there few nice things this phone , such braided cord both telephone jack connecting earpiece main part . however , what i think disappointing true purists these phones made out modern , lightweight , cheap-feeling plastic rather than type heavyweight plastic make genuine plastic phones 1920s-1970s feel so substantial comfortable hand . so , i give crosley points just producing such item , it indeed work fully functional telephone fairly well , although what people other end line tell me , drop signal strength distance increases microphone quite steep , indicating microphone perhaps not good choice this device . sum , i think this phone worth price , but know it not necessarily going or feel like real period piece . said , there no wiring problems	-1
i bought this hp ipaq 2795 pda few weeks ago . initially , it intermittently started freeze also couldn't work bluetooth so i called hp customer service . they asked upgrade rom through some online instructions . upgrade deleted all data i saved device i got fresh start again . it worked fine again couple days it froze again while i middle meeting . this time i tried doing hard reset it didn't work . so after meeting it plugged it again cradle ac power pda rebooted again started working fine . again it worked fine day screen froze again . this time nothing getting it out this freezing . i tried hard reset , clean power reset ( described instructions book ) , plugged it cradle applied ac power . it not coming out this freezing . it this state last 4 - 5 days now . i'm highly disappointed quality this pda . i bought one high end model hp i though it'll work fine me . it embarrassing $470 pda behaving like this . one my friend cheap palm tero it never behaved this way . i don't want go through rom upgrade all time loose all my data short-cuts .	-1

i am digital photo junkie - addition taking tons photos i use several programs edit them before i print . problem i ones i end up printing special projects or large format , i don't many regular 4x6 photos around . my older epson stylus photo r300 prints great photos , but just takes too long printing out 4x6 photo albums . end i literally thousands pictures just sit my hard drive . then comes this picturemate snap i just received my birthday . it perfect those everyday pictures ! just pop disk , select photos press print .. out come high quality prints snap ! no computer - no software needed - completely portable . it like turning my digital camera into polaroid . i doubly impressed extra features it , not only viewer but ability zoom , crop , red-eye , add borders , turn bw or sepia few button clicks . it handle carrying very lightweight . i don't plan use this my computer since i two other epson printers already . i would highly recommend this anyone digital camera . only drawback i found so far print packs hard find local stores , you'll want get one right away because supplied pack only print 20 photos . i expect longer snap market , easier packs find . i like they come paper ink set number photos . overall great product	1

i've always found cheapie little ear buds sold airlines order watch their movies utterly useless . besides not fitting my ears ( they fall out ) , even volume turned all way up , i simply couldn't understand movie dialog softer passages over roar aircraft noise . i'd watch other passengers envy while they relaxed comfortably using noise canceling headphones . i decided that what i needed ! when i started shopping pair noise canceling headsets long cross-country flight my wife i going take , i decided even though bose quietcomfort models highly rated , i couldn't justify spending much money something we'd only use maybe 2 or 3 times per year . after lot research looking less expensive alternatives , based features , price , reviews i read , i settled creative labs hn-505 one buy . my wife i recently used this model over 10 hours each cross-country trip we found they worked quiet well ... but few minor shortcomings . interestingly , one leg our trip i opportunity try out bose quietcomfort ii headset passenger sitting next me compare it side-by-side cl hn-505 . here my observations : * cl hn-505 absolutely incredible value money ! i'd definitely buy it again . * fit earcup sort hybrid true " over-the-ear " ( like bose qc ii ) " on-the-ear " design ( like bose qc iii ) . earcups sit part way over ear not completely seal off outside noise . presumably this design makes them more compact less bulky storage . * my wife found earcups bit tight her ears ( squeezing her head ) . she got tired them her head after 3 or 4 hours . careful adjusting headset i didn't this problem . * while they effectively remove " roar " aircraft noise , they their limits . since they only mask noise within certain frequency band up certain volume level , they'll still allow some noise through reduced volume . if you're expecting complete silence when you turn them , then you'll sadly disappointed ! yes you still hear announcements aircraft pa system still faintly hear baby crying back plane , but they effective reduce overall volume all noise tolerable , comfortable level . there very noticeable difference when they're turned off . * soft rushing sound ( almost like white noise ) heard background when turned . this isn't noticeable noisy environment like airline flight . * when i compared bose quietcomfort ii headset cl hn-505 side-by-side , i found bose quieter than cl ... * but * keep mind bose qc ii true " over-the-ear " design whereas cl hn-505 not . i say performance bose qc ii wouldn't convince me pay * ten * times price cl hn-505 * i watched several movies flight found dialog even most quiet passages easy understand . * i like fact cl hn-505 only uses one aaa battery it conveniently hidden head strap ( not cord ) . * on-off switch located rear right earcup within easy reach while wearing , but this same location makes it way too easy accidentally turn it when storing it carry baggage . several times i've gone retrieve my headset it storage bag , only find it turned some unknown length time . good news battery seems last very long time . i've used mine over 10 hours plus time it accidentally only one battery so far , it still going strong . * i'll never again travel without them	1

past two weeks or so i've testing out philips shs3200 clip earbuds . verdict : return . they very , very uncomfortable , even if sound great it doesn't matter if you can't actually use headphones . which means i revert ot my sony pair couple days . i found these big discount only ... three dollars . i needed this pair pretty desperately , or least it would suffice until i found something i'd want major retailer . only other time i've bought earhugger would eh710 over head headphones which i also rated 4 stars , but someone begged me those , so i gave them away . they sounded nice comfortable i also remember getting them discount . these , i wasn't expecting much , just something sounds ok fits well . which actually what you get , except sound bit better than ok . these clip earbuds , much like popular sony . ear . they usual earbuds but clip goes around your ear more comfort more stable fit . that really all you get , but three dollars how earth you expect extras ? it also long five foot cord so it won't awkward walking these your ipod or so your pocket . i've also noticed hook detachable , so if you just want buds then you . sound quality , these don't sound amazing but sound good , especially because price i thought these gonna flat out suck but they're actually pretty darn good . they don't fantastic deep bass , but they full bass what they , making them sound full rich . mids sounded good , not overpowering nor mids lacking , maybe bit much 200-500k range , but it not all bad . these don't amazingly clear sound if that what you're looking , these lack treble little bit , but again price i can't expect stellar sound . i put these little music test , they sounded good my ipod cd player but pretty average itunes unless i tweaked equalizer bit . my stereo system they sounded fine but best when playing cd . they sounded good most my music collection , sounded really good hip-hop , rb , dance , spoken word , light rock . when i turned hard rock or hard hitting rap it sounded kinda tinny , but still listenable . i turned bass boost itunes my other protable audio sources handled all sounded fine , but higher volumes ( more than 80% volume ) things started disort or sound tinny . overall , not amazing sound , pretty good bass average elsewhere . these some darn comfortable headphones me . when i put them i get good fit automatically but those who've never tried these types earbuds before might feel slight discomfort first week use or least it'll feel weird . just know if they're uncomfortable box you should give them least two weeks before returning . something else you should know these come lifetime warranty ! well , course there catch . you send five dollars shipping . relly there not much worth warranty since i found them three dollars , but if you paid more than five dollars it probably good idea keep packaging receipt around . i said , i only paid three dollars these big lots , chances that best price around . price you going get comfortable set clip-buds that'll sound decent last least couple months , maybe more if you're gentle or using these home . you'll probably find these three eight dollars , paying more rip-off since you probably find something better or something extra bells whistles like volume control or waterproof features . overall , not bad set headphones . they don't same sound headphones more than ten dollars but comfortable sound good enough price . good sound , comfortable , inexpensive , check them out ! 4 stars . response earlier review , these don't volume control	-1

returned it , phone kept dropping calls other side house , some times next room , no reception all yard . we used old ( 8-9 years old ) 900mhz phone really good range , could go all over house outside ( even across street ) still get crystal clear reception , but phone dropped too many times stopped working :-( however , even replacement i got ( uniden 5.8 ghz ) not much better far range , we returning one too . so search phone good range continues . i wish someone would make simple phone decent range , i really not care all new bells whistles such color screen , calendars , ring tones etc . all i need basic phone wont drop calls other side house , speaker both handset base , keypad base ( so i make calls without handset ) answering machine 30 minutes recording time ( decent quality , so i understand messages left it ... ) long battery life auto redial . phone book nice but not mandatory	-1

these brush cleaner cd work , believe it or not . perhaps not quite same your system professionally serviced , but why waste more money than you may . this worthy investment look into first - because these work most time ( it always good idea one continued preventative maintenance anyway ) . if you're getting play errors or severe skipping your cd , you might amazed how much one these help . but here few tips those you making audio cd their home computers trouble playing them some machines ... it may not defective or dirty player all . first , it may best turn off any other programs you may running background . this give your cd burner full resources its burning job . also , make sure your screensaver turned off . if it starts up middle job , laser burn may interrupted cause errors . so shut down all other programs screensaver too . second , it may you well defrag your hard drive before starting burn . if you pretty fast pc , this may not big problem , but it may adversely affect read data process if your computer search all over hard drive find pieces media files before burning them disk . i personally auto defrag program installed my computer runs constantly keeping my system running its optimum . third , i recommend not copying cd " fly " ( other words , directly disk disk ) . copy audio files your hard drive first . most cd burning software " create image " option - use then burn image blank cd . if your using nero , just turn off " fly " option music files copy hard disk first then cd automatically . by-the-way , you may want read my review amazon nero . it , my opinion , best burning software available ! since i started using nero , i not know meaning word " coaster " or " frisbee . " fourth , always burn cd dao mode ( disc once ) . this insure there no gap songs(tao - track once - usually leaves 2 second gap songs causes laser stop burning momentarily songs ) , but more importantly , using dao insure laser continues burn constantly throughout whole cd copying process . finally , most importantly ( my opinion ) , make sure you don't burn cd anything faster than 12x ! fact , if you're playing cd older system , burn cd 8x or even slower . if you still trouble , take speed all way down 1 or 2x . it make big difference . yes , i know it means you won't using full potential your zippy 52x burner , but you just figure out what more important - fast burning or able actually listen what your burning ? most newer cd players very little or no problem all playing cd burned computer highest speed ; however , this not often case much older units . general rule it always better burn audio disks slower . you may also want make sure you're using audio cd certified media . may help little bit too . brand media may factor also . sometimes cheaper cd may higher failure rate . i've heard this some people . personally , i not too much trouble cheaper cd ... usually , if steps i already mentioned followed , cheap media work fine . my experience anyway . but different burners may factor well you may want try some different brands media until you find one seems work best you . using quality name brand media probably safe bet may your best course action . good luck ! :	1

i bought this tv after seeing my father-in-law samsung hdtv ( he lns3251d ) . i seen bunch hdtv but i really liked crisp , clear , bright picture samsung . i also loved how light it comparison my 80lb . tube tv . this model little bit cheaper than my father-in-law , but offers same terrific picture ( i believe only difference his comes " piano black " ) . i ordered through amazon ( great price ! free shipping ! ) picked up tv eagle usa instead taking day off work wait them drop it off . they very helpful friendly . when i first got tv i thought something might've wrong it since my picture worse than my previous tv using same directv box . much i adjusted it picture blurry , moving objects left trails picture seemed scroll . however , ever since directv came gave me hd box ( optomized widescreen picture ) installed hd satellite i able appreciate this tv . must-have any sports fan poor eyesight	1

i got these because my old ibm thinkpad laptop " speakers " can't really heard unless you're hovering right over them , i'm not headphone fan ( besides , there nobody disturb ) , quality those built speakers worse than tinny . when i listen streaming video certain web sites , i want park laptop away me something else . hence search external but portable speakers . these indeed come neat storage box everything fits into without you puzzle master . hookup no-brainer , size , sound amazing . i even tried them classical music cd , they fine . " 3d " feature makes them sound like much bigger speakers . supplied usb power cable nice , attached protective cap usb end . controls simple it wake up low volume good design . they're exactly described specs preceding reviews . all i could offer wish list : storage box not something you'd carry around , so i'll probably manufacture simple carrying bag . if you going use it portable player , you wouldn't even need pack input extension power cables , just little dog-bone shaped device itself short input cable tucked neatly inside . speaker part tend drop kerclunk ! base when you unfold it until you know it going . i also noted if you don't little inplut cable carefully tucked into base , speaker part leaves dent cable , which would wearing after while , input cable hardwired into speaker case , so difficult repair/replace . also , i wish there power input cable besides usb cable , so you wouldn't use batteries devices like portable cd players . but i'm very pleased this purchase .	1

i previously owned canon printer time rated high it served well but old photo quality getting worse point where wife getting our photos developed elsewhere . after reading up newer printers i took our flash card store tried it using hp printer . say i amazed would understatement . i went home immediately ordered printer amazon blew away competition price . when i got it i printed photo my wife previously developed shop side side she guess which which but it close she just amazed . i don't know all technical stuff but i know if you looking great photo printer your home you'll hard time beating this one . since we use computer fix print photos i opted 7160 instead 7360 , screen printer not big deal me since they same printer otherwise . if there anything negative say it would advertised printing speed not exactly accurate ( least not quality photo i printing ) but then i don't think any printers advertised . nevertheless , this winner	1

this unit looks nice plays nice , until it doesn't anymore . this piece crap worked only 3 months turned 10x only , it stood my bedroom where i only seldom listen music . it went dead all sudden , sony doesn't honor limited warranty !! apparently , what i ( short circuit , prevents me turning unit ) common defect it even mentioned owner manual ( ie if you get standy flashing , you're trouble ! ) . i several bad experiences sony , this my last . my advice stay panasonics , they're way way way better .	-1
digital technology , monster cable once again ruined marketplace greatly over estimating what their products worth . great difference digital output/inpt devices compared analog simple . if digital signal reaches device it needs it can't any more or less clear . because your digital signal comprised " 0 " " 1 " if you see your tv or hear music then what ever cable you use works- there no distortation across digital signals , so don't pay extra money- fact you shouldn't need spend more than around $30-50 .	-1

i've one these 3 years now , it spent last few months gathering dust . why ? because case design - while nice-looking - not allow proper air circulation or ventilation drive , so it runs much hotter internally than it ought . i replaced drive twice - each one lasted 6-9 months before it failed . i can't think any reason this other than heat . if i use case again , i'll run it without stylish cover	-1

excellent value quality . easy set-up take down . portability factor great going almost anywhere	1
i'm very satisfied unit . it exactly what i expecting it . it works good either 120v or 4-aa battery power . portability very good included travel bag - i it set up work during week bring it home most weekends . also , it takes up very little space so it placed most anywhere . my only complaint volume control . adjust volume you hold +/- buttons loooong time because it changes soooo slowly . also when you turn unit it always reverts same preset volume level no matter what sound level when it turned off . this very annoying times . workaround , i unplug antenna no signal present , i power up altec . then hold - volume loooong time , then plug antenna . if i've guessed correctly , volume lower when signal returns . overall , i would buy same system again	-1
not only lx7 handily svelte when compared many mice similar features , but it ergonomic dream . side-to-side scroll wheel wonderful feature quickly becomes indispensable . back forward buttons placed sensibly facilitate 2-fingered use instead other models ' more cumbersome thumb-buttons . top all this , mouse absolutely miserly when it comes power use . so much so , fact , i've using mine only single aa battery place . my two niggling irritations ? fact battery sensor tells only when your batteries dead or dying one . but i'll give based aforementioned efficiency . secondly , logitech setpoint pre-programmed button mappings take some retooling get mouse working more than few common applications . that okay me too ; i like they allow you control change them least . all all excellent product .	1

radio very easy use excellect reception , even antenna folded up . while not shortfall radio , rather noaa/nws system , county areas too big . example tornado warning issued this past weeked ; while nearly sunny my location , warning came out weather issue miles away , but still same county . also , plan batteries available when running off 110v battery drain high . i think this caused because weather radio always listening emergency tones . overall very good value i would suggest one every home	1

i've owned creative zen ipods , but nothing touch this thing . if you nice home or car stereo equipment , this player . first , it plays cd quality ( flac ) lossless files , so instead compressing your music sorry mp3 format average 192 kbps you listen music it intended 1411 kbps . many say there no difference , but plug this thing into your home receiver or car stereo you definitely hear it . second , ( very important me ) , you bypass itunes or any other memory resident programs designed " help " load your music into your player - just plug cowon into your computer usb port it becomes additional drive . you then drag drop your files - it simple . it well build , solid feel it . it line-in recording jack wich come handy . it play videos , also . screen small watching movie it ( approx 1 7/8 " ) , but i not watch movies this or any other player screen . even 3 " too small ! time when nobody owns anything smaller than 40 " hd flatscreen why world would you want watch movie little thing ?? anyway , me personally simplicity superior sound quality what i look such gadget . now , i not use my home system cd player any more : i plug this thing into my receiver access my collection high definition music cd quality . i get my car , same thing . no more cd lose , scratch , destroy or forget where i put them . they all archived both my computer drive cowon . it sad see this , but we're all flocking buy products like ipod zune which nothing but impose more more restrictions upon us : buy ( or should i say , rent ) music only their sites , use only their sorry proprietary formats , force us use their proprietary itunes such programs , which invade , crash slow down your computer so forth . not mention zune , which not even play window media files !!!. conclusion , this product definitely worth looking . it gives you freedom flexibility lot things your music .	1
i run this alarm my expedition last 4 years . it true these remotes require some extra care , they provide you wealth knowledge your vehicle situation while you indoors . compatible only top line d.e.i. alarms ( viper included ) . this 2 way remote let me know commands i sent received . it alleviates lot guesswork . glance , i know if my doors locked/unlocked , if car running ( remote start ) or not . if alarm triggered , it even shows me zone triggered when alarm tripped ( it actually shows which door/window opened/broken , or if car hit ) . i too bought replacement remotes this alram , but i knew what i getting into when i bought it start . those you who don't need 2-way function , its important know you program one-way remotes ( much less expensive ) work alarm brain too . i strongly suggest extra remotes every alarm . you should also know locate your valet button case you bypass alarm without ( working ) remote . when you drop computer , its roll dice if it keep working , or not . i've run this alarm 4 years , drop my keys regularly , only needed replace two remotes . i too found customer service joke dei , solve problem my own . but alarm itself great ! hope this helps	-1

i'd like start asking why some you given this system bad reviews because you couldn't hook your computer or whatever up correctly . don't punish product because lack research your part ! download manual or read product description - it clearly states " control module features standard analog stereo audio input two digital audio inputs -- one coaxial one toslink optical . " there no mention multichannel analog inputs , so if you don't optical or coaxial digital outputs , don't buy it ! or , what i ... purchase creative soundblaster mp3+ . this little device attaches your computer via usb allows output ( input ) pure optical digital stream . hook optical cable it klipsch disk voila , dolby digital your computer . external soundblaster live !, soundblaster audigy 2 , philips aurilium also work . system itself . i also creative t5400 , but i wanted something dolby digital decoder so i could hook them up my laptop cheap home theatre setup . i bought this klipsch sale $130 , it fits bill . some complain hiss - i'm experiencing noise too , but it more whine slight bit hiss , more pronounced when i'm using analog input . it might due electrical quality , too ... my creatives never hissed school , but my new apartment , i get noise through them . noisy electrical power outlets cause problems . i think sound pretty good . nothing spectacular , but what i expected . clear good off-axis sound ... mine ten feet away , i get better soundstage without tip-in . sub really good job so small - i put mine corner , it'll move couch . i find it too much music usually , so i turn it down 0 , up +4 movies . system could use more power my application ( decent sized room ) , but that not really what it made . so i'll forgive system . i like assortment processing - native format ( dd 5.1 or 2.1 channel stereo ) , 5.1 stereo , two types dolby pro logic ii , which i'm fan . latter gives good 5.1 sound stereo source , without too overbearing . range adjustment center , surrounds , sub nice , o.o ne thing i really wished system remote control . it couldn't expensive incorporate , would nice touch . i know i could put control disk my table , but i don't want cord running across floor . bottom line , if you're going purchase this , realistic . it not going best system world , but it decent , cheap way get dolby digital or pro logic ii decoding computer , game console , or stereo source . make sure you connect it before purchase , you'll ok . i'll give it four stars somewhat noisy , lack remote , fact i don't think it should cost $300 retail	-1

i looking card i could use easily gnu/linux without trying emulate windows drivers . i'd read this possible this card so i decided try it out . i'm running debian 2.6.17 kernel . all it took following : download madwifi ( free , open source ) , extract program , run ' make ' , ' make install ' , then ' modprobe ath_pci ' . using knetworkmanager you then connect any detected networks easily switch wired wireless networks . it seems work very well so far . i not tested card windows , although since it designed windows yet works well linux i only assume it work least well windows . according very simple-looking quick start guide , windows users need only insert cd , go through standard install wizard , plug card it work . i used belkin products past never disappointed ; it doesn't seem like this product break chain	1

i bought this november ' 05 so i've bit time get familiar product . overall this great receiver someone looking most bang buck . next higher this series ( de998 i think ) practically exact same features , maybe 10 watts more per channel , so my opinion not worth difference price this version . setup annoying ( but not impossible ) . you push buttons turn setup knob all while reading tiny lcd display . several times during setup i would get desired setting , read more manual , time i got back unit setup mode disappeared . course this awkwardness disappears you become more familiar machine . on-screen programming setup one features not included this machine -- but remember how much you paid ! remote very annoying small buttons confusing setup instructions . i programmed it control my dvd player , tv , cable box vcr . once while it " forgets " how talk cable box some reason , or gets confused which component ( e.g. , cable box or dvd player ) it talking . this doesn't happen often but it happened two or three times . fortunately setup not last forever this not exercise you doing machine daily basis . also , most time remote correctly remembers which component it supposed talking . said , sound quality fantastic ! this machine shake walls sound if you turn it up far enough . i not normally listen my music this deafening volume most time but if i am real headbanger mood it happen . when using receiver very high volumes it get hot , not just warm . keep this mind when you place unit , it alot vents top unit . unit convert composite inputs s-video output , which not clear reading manual . i bought this athena 15345 point 5 mkii system home theater speaker package audiosource psw100 10 inch powered subwoofer . this fills livingroom sound quite nicely . also those us who still turntables , you hook yours up this machine -- feature lacking most other units i considered . if i thousands dollars my disposal looking absolute best receiver i would course get something else . although less-than-perfect setup routine remote , this unit produces exceptional sound acceptable price i would recommend it anyone looking great sounding receiver affordable price	-1

i going get oppo upconverting dvd player , since i large collection standard dvds wanted wait out high def dvd war , but only $150 more than oppo five free hd-dvds boot , i figured i would go hd-a2 : i not dissappointed . i leary how good upconverting quality would , but no more . i am really impressed ! my superbit copy fifth element looked amazing ( incredibles lord rings ) . i left my old sony dvd player hooked up same time watched same movie via standard then hd-a2 . i not think same movie could look so much better simply upconverting . sharpness color detail looked much better . this player give new life my standard dvds . powering unit loading dvd little slow , but not point it issue . i am hooking this up via hdmi mitsubishi lt-37132 ( 37 " 1080p lcd tv ) . no complaints all . fact , price dropped $55 right after i bought it amazon refunded $55 so player less than $100 more than oppo . after i get my five free hd-dvds it certainly better deal	1

although hp laserjet 13x ( q2613x ) costs 20% more than laserjet 13a ( q2613a ) , it superior buy number reasons . topping list lower cost per page . 13x print 4000 pages 5% page coverage ( iso/iec 19752 standard ) whereas 13a print 2500 pages . that 37.5% difference page yield . divide up toner price against 4000 ( e.g. , 91.99 / 4000 = 2.3 cents ) get cost per page . secondly , laser toners last long time whether you print few times month or dozens pages day ( they don't dry out ) . finally , higher page yield means fewer toner replacement . my only complaint 13x ( goes 13a well ) page yield cost some competing printers higher-end hp laserjets even less	-1

if you college student , or anyone who deals math , i highly recommend you purchase this calculator . it excellent tool performing many types calculations both algebra , seemingly , calculus , although i only used it algebra so far . unlike other , disappointing graphing calculators , this one permits you use undefined variables ( i.e. , ' ' stands nothing except ' ' unless you want it , which immensely helpful performing algebraic calculations . ) qwerty keypad also makes entering expressions pleasure , rather than chore ; this more than academic point when you test time-limit , hitting ' alpha ' key before typing every variable depicted letter ( , , , , etc . ) use up precious time maybe ensure you don't get all problems . there too many easy-to-use incredibly convenient features this calc list here ; but it truly worth hefty price tag . my only gripes manual sometimes bit obscure ( though it easy comprehend compared most graphing calc manuals ) calc no nthroot function i find , , find cube root number you enter it x^1/3 . these very minor points , though , splendid product	1
not any problems yet . i needed more space store 5 years worth pics , may buy . much better than carrying around 4 1gb thumb drives	1

what great product !!! well designed , fast response times , all items you need included ( bike car mounts etc ) wider screen would nice , but this their first generation motorcycle gps(i guess zumo 650 next ) . over all , fantastic usefull addition my bike car . it kind like ipod , very easy use but very sophisticated .	1
i just looking something listen music while i worked out . this player very basic , but money exactl what it says . it holds enough songs get me through 2 1/2 hour routine . sounds pretty good very easy work . couple drawbacks : headphones come it very short cord battery runs down pretty fast ( usually replace it once week , so i guess it run 10 hours total before it needs new battery ) . other than it looks pretty cool very small ( fits my pocket while i walk around ) .	1
works great no issues . small amout sound fan . i using this past 10 months no complaints , it worked without any issues all . i would definately recommend it	1
i recently bought iaudio 6 am so far very pleased its superior performance . i owned 60gb ipod am convinced former way better than latter . first , iaudio 6 superb sound ( 36ohm ) , its hard drive although small , considerably fast . i love fm tuner well voice recorder extremely convenient small but very robustly built mp3 player ; those features unavailable ipod . finally , price/quality very favorable . this my first product cowon/iaudio , but i definitely buy again	1
i used garmin it great . just put where you going it talks you all way my destination	1

please not waste your time or money this item , unless you money burn . don't get me wrong , car charger part kit great , but modulator radio frequency horrible . it provides substandard sound , no matter what format you your audio . i tried multiple frequencies , multiple formats , every setting zune itself , it just horrible . i am returning mine asap . i cannot justify spending 70 bucks such terrible item . hope this helps someone else	-1

i've owned e3c last two years let me say they best sounding earphones ( or headphones ) i'd heard up until point . anyhow , they went defective me few months ago rather than fork out $70 get them repaired since they now out 2yr warranty period ( shure replace them free during warranty no hassle whatsoever , way ) i decided plunk down cash e500 . i got them cheap , because how i roll , but they're worth retail how good they . you may already know now e3c single-driver phones they blow away any standard fare your neighborhood electronics store . also , you might wondering , like i , just how much better triple-driver phones than single-driver ones ... whether they're worth hundreds dollars more they cost . assuming one appreciates music sound quality enough spend decent money phones first place , let me say i taken risk you , homework you put word out streets , er , well , online review , anyway , you : e500 killer . you'd better ask somebody . drop your concerns . these worth hundreds dollars more than single-driver phones , if you care enough notice difference . i listen lot jazz fusion fast , popping baselines , drumming smallest fractions beats you imagine synth work match . e500 , i'm actually able hear detail not come through e3c . when i say detail , i'm talking synth chords drums those fractional beats i literally not even realize present albums i've owned 10+ years . bass , it somewhat deficient e3c compared these . i dealt two years because they sounded better than anything i could buy store despite . only single driver both treble bass , e3c best they they fantastic , given what they . e500 , however , their two bass drivers single treble driver each phone , pose no compromise listener . read again ; it strong statement . believe you're getting something real what these cost . bass strong deep , drums , tight airy , mid-ranges `meat potatoes ' your soundscape , fat loud , accuracy devastating . we're talking sound literally gives me chills times . e500 comfort issue me first ; small ears , i initially found them less comfortable than e3c since housing these considerably larger order accommodate three drivers . now , after three months using these , they almost comfortable me e3c . i would say i need take them out after 30-40 minutes sake earlobe comfort , but , all fairness , i usually need take them out other reasons way more often tha t.t he pth ( push-to-hear ) module joke . i guess it works , sort . you try it out thirty seconds , curse fact some portion dough you spent these phones went towards this nonsense , put it back box , never use it again . thankfully , you not use it since it separates phones nicely . shame shure forcing people buy this stupid , worthless accessory , insulting intelligence people who appreciate good sound not realizing how unprofessional it package this crut expensive , high-end earphones . i won't even get into fact `pth ' part earphone model name . someone should get fired this debacle , seriously . lexus probably wouldn't force you buy fuzzy dice hydraulics ls460 , those things cool boot . earphones themselves still bomb	1
just got this product my birthday , because armband came my nano too small fit around my upper arm . after reading review inalaska , i decided give this one try i am close same size ( 5'11 " 225lb ) . item just described his review , my thoughts pretty much same ( my screen protector not damaged ) . package good value 90% people who purchase it very pleased . unfortunately , i'm minority , because it still too small fit comfortably around my upper arm . if your upper arm 17 " or larger , armband not fit unless you pull it uncomfortably tight ( cutting off circulation ) . i'm going try stretch it see if it eventually lengthen . if it works , i'll amend this review . still , solid 4 stars quality value .	-1

i really like this tv . good : sd performance good . digital processor top noch . hd picture good any . i'm satisfied contras t.t here lot input options . hd tuner pretty good . i'm only using $3 rabbit ears get all major hd channels solid signal strength ( most transmitters 20-30 miles away ) . great price name brand . amazon delivery fast courteous . not so good features minor , but i'll list them incase it helps reader decide : no qam tuner . remote/ir reciever not great . there times i push buttons remote tv doesn't respond . you need point remote lower right corner tv best response . clunky menu navigation ( function buttons remote help , though)univ . remote no codes dvrs ( tivo/replaytv )	-1

i bought pair january loved them . sound lovely everyone describes . however , there something seriously lacking build quality . soft wires felt flimsy me when i first opened it , but i thought i'd just take extra care . 1 month careful usage , plastic-covered wires earbuds downwards became so weather-hardened i could almost use them chopsticks , makes it so earbuds popped out slightest motion . 2 months careful usage , wires half-ripped plug -- which i repaired best i could unsightly electrical tape . however , 3rd month , left bud fell completely off . i am very disappointed -- it one best-sounding phones i've ever ( i've owned both grado s60 s90 , sennheisers ) , but man , they need something making this baby last	-1

i've using this switch 3 months now not single issue . it very easy use . both keyboard controls manual switching work great . i would definitely recommend this switch others	1
both items worked well . light sufficiently bright light up keyboard effectively , while not too glaring , fan worked silently expectedly light breeze . main problem this item price . $17 , desk lamp would provide far more illumination than small usb light . likewise , one could purchase fan lamp less than $20 . stated this , fan/usb light combination perfect when working room where lights necessarily dimmed , such when presenting speech/presentation . i using light around two hours day past 6 months am pleased find manufacturer claims regard led longevity holding true . conclusion , while both products worked perfectly , they really limited use suitable only those who spend long hours where darkened environment necessity .	-1
hi . i find this product very good , but also could find features need improvement . first all , i bought this stuff last year returned it because our laptops couldn't recognize it netwrok . later , i remembered xp sp2 patches installed our machines just before i tried use keyspan server . since sp2 automatically turns xp firewall function , our laptops perhaps failed recognize usb server because this . i wasn't wrong . when i re-bought installed usb server later , i reconfigured security options xp my laptops so firewall doesn't block port used usb server . voila , i could see list usb equipments connected this little gizm o.o nce i configured it right , i found out this thing very convenient just everything . here my equipments attached it : cdrw , fdd , external hdd , printer . all these gadgets working seamlessly now . however , besides above configuration problem , i experienced one or two problems so far . ( if i haven't , i would've given 5 stars this stuff . ) when my epson 5200 all-in-one died clogging problem i purchased lexmark 5270 , autoconnect function keyspan usb server didn't work new all-in-one very well . i strongly suspect it because lexmark poor device driver ; however , it true keyspan usb server incompatible some all-in-ones . i returned lexmark 5270 bought epson stylus c82 . matter fact , i believe usually this goes epson printers all-in-ones . bottom line : i recomment this machine anyone who wants more than one pc usb equipments . however , you need check your pcs ' firewall configuration , when you buy this stuff or buy usb equipment , keep your receipt week or two . you may return this stuff or , if you already one , your new usb gizmo because compatibility issues	-1
i originally purchased this printer our phone server work . i hoping newer design would install without making me reboot system ( it didn't ) . picture quality typical epson , i'm very happy it . i just print occasional color graph or chart , it rocks . it quiet , it small , it takes readily available ink . cartridges newer sepperate component type cartridge . it doesn't like cheap copy paper , jam eventually . it easy unjam clear however , i able slip my ape like hands down into printer , without curse , scream or apply band-aid .	-1
i used most gaming mice released since year 2000 . prior deathadder , my mouse choice logitech g5 . i am not going bash either mouse . both very good . however , i prefer deathadder more . ( note : make sure you upgrade firmware . this make difference lift off issue some people complained about)after tweaking sensitivity where i like it , i noticed deathadder feels more smooth accurate than g5 . i am not sure if it 1000hz polling or sensor , but something feels very right it . only movement issue i getting used lift off height . new firmware improves this lot . however , it took couple days train myself lift mouse slighlty higher , but i am completely used it now . i think g5 might initially more user friendly here , but it only takes matter few days get used deathadder . other items feel " right " me side buttons . they seem perfectly balanced just right amount pressure make it easy depress , but tough enough not accidently press them . i really don't care " back " " forward " internet explorer . i just want usable buttons bind inventory items games . g5 bit let down there only one , reasonably hard button depress . scroll wheel my opinion better than g5 . deathadder again seems like razer found perfect compromise scroll click feel . however , like most mice , scroll wheel button really not option high intensity online game . deathadder might little less usable than g5 since wheel smoother , but i found myself scrolling down while trying depress button . so i don't really use it now , i just wanted give it shot . one thing g5 side side scrolling . however , i never really use anyway , even spreadsheets , so there no negative points my book . however , if you rely this feature , this mouse might not you . terms comfort , i big hand i find deathadder more comfortable play games over long period time . i rest my palm top more instead hovering it off back i g5 . terms craftmanship , i would say i am pleased . mouse feels well built very solid . i would say it par logitech build quality ( except g7 , don't get me started stalling , freezing , totally not " bullet proof connectivity " pos ) . considering looks , deathadder really attractive person . it reminds me exotic sportscar . my g5 silver , rust colored black . it not terrible , but deathadder more sleek refined . i see little iconic razer boomslang 2000 shape it too . i find pulsing blue logo really cool too . it so happens my case black blue leds inside my keyboard g15 so deathadder matches my color scheme . overall , razer winner this death adder . me , it feels just right it very smooth accurate . after couple days , i am used it loving it . if you g5 happy it , you probably don't need buy this one . if your like me like try new things , this might perfect mouse you try .	1
possibly worst design armband . fifth-grader could make better armband felt , velcro , scissors some thread . not only you not see nano screen , or adjust volume while you running ( changing volume like trying text message gloves ) , but you cannot adjust tightness band just one hand , it too little elesticity too small velcro strip . top it off , nano kinda difficult get out band .	-1

most good excellent ctr channel speakers cost you more . $250 - 300 highest rated ( cr ) not unusual . i bought cambridge soundworks mc150 , under sales misimpression it " center " channel speaker . no . so off i went see if this still shelf open box special . glad it . i tested it speaker listening room , it master commander justice . comparison , i tried out some music selections bose 161s ( where superb sl sr surround speakers ) , they clear precise highs , sufficient bass most center channel needs . then sales guy i hooked up ns-c444 one channels , played same selections . yamaha compared favorably . now you might thinking , hey , it only center channel , what it got other than just dialog lef t-t o-right transition . not simple , friend . center channel one speaker your home theatre always doing something , always providing sound . you want capable one . you also want one excellent dynamic response clarity . case point : scene when capt ramius addresses his crew after submerging hunt red october . you hear connery voice foreground , then over 1mc intercom circuit , then booming across sub bridge . example : obi-wan talking dex star wars episode ii . if center channel inferior , he dex sound like they're chatting inside box . if center speaker up standard your left right speakers , they sound full rich " present " ( right there your living room ) . point ponder : if you watch old , monaural pictures some stereo dsp , lot soundtrack come your center speaker . quick test scenes like this : switch your receiver " 2 channel stereo " ( or mode mixes down dolby/dts 5.1 lf rf speakers ) , then switch 5.1 decoding . voices sound same ? pick good center channel your home theatre benefit immensely . i think this one excellent . consumer reports lists couple other good bets you find lt ; $200 . happy hunting ...	1

this great little unit client pvr such beyondtv or sage - i use sagetv my house 3 these clients running free plug specific sage . they work great , picture super , since there no moving parts or excessive heat they're completely silent - they work perfectly . i don't think i'd get one run just stand alone it fetching media pictures such off remote computers - application comes it not greatest . but since i'm using sage interface , no problems . only downside , although it small one , response remote just little sluggish - not bad , but aware when you hit " skip ahead " button when watching recorded tv program it'll lag , perhaps , half second . i've gotten used it don't mind all . since i automatic commercial skip sage , i rarely use it anyway	-1

my old alarm clock radio recently bit dust , so i started search upgrade . i initially looked bose , but stumbled upon sangean radios . i usually listen npr jazz evening , sangean seemed fit bill . plus , i really like design . price . amazon got it me 3 days free shipping , i haven't disappointed radio performance . it great sound , remote control great other side bed ( when you don't want reach over your partner turn it off ) . couple things consider , however . backlight readout adjustable , but lowest setting bit bright dark room . fortunately , brightness control right front . i just turn off backlight before drifting off sleep . backlight also separate setting when radio " off " " . " thing . radio not display time when it . this so broadcast digital data display while playing ( e.g. , stations data broadcasting , display scrolls name station , title song , etc . ) . it would nice see time when you wake up ( after you hit snooze few times ) , but it not big deal . just touch " display " button front , radio switches display time . we also analog clock opposite bedside table . yes , there snooze function ( 5 min . ) , although product info doesn't mention it . you activate it touching any buttons front . sangean also thoughtfully designed alarm volume gradually increase it comes , so you aren't jolted awake . all said , i would recommend this radio . it looks great performs well . price , i'd say it great buy	1

i really wanted like this phone all good reviews , but received one issues , returned it received same issues ; so it must phone model . below items not involve using handset speakerphone feature which requires " wait you " " wait me " behavior ; just normal handset . -when you first answer incoming call , you usually wait few seconds phone make available 2 way converstion ; otherwise , you say hello caller can't hear you you can't hear them . -during call using normal handset , background noise even regular conversation cause phone block volume caller though you using speakerphone feature when you're actually not . after few seconds volume become audible again . this issue causes bits pieces conversation go unheard . this happens more long distance calls than local calls	-1
when my first shredder finally bit dust ( fellowes ) , i wanted upgrade more commercial series last longer , i spent 4-5 hours online researching shredders . fellowes kept coming top list customer comments ( price ) . i loved my earlier home office version ( which lasted 6 years moderate shredding until large hidden paperclip it ) so i'm partial fellowes anyway . but i looked everything out there . i didn't want spend fortune , but i wanted high quality metal parts . i also wanted move confetti type ; strip shredder filled up trashcan too often . this sb-97c it ! love it ! really grinds through everything - don't open up junk mail anymore . i shred through old tax files quickly - top piece provides " guide " so you know how much paper go through shredder once . it also guide cds credit cards i've found very handy . slide out trashcan really holds lot paper . it comes some oil few bags - very nice them include these get you started . i've only this month but i've shredded good amount paper it wonderful . price i highly recommend it	1

after close ten years using hp 4l , ( which still works perfectly ) , i decided look printer larger paper reserve higher speed . i've thrilled p2015dn . speed incredible , paper tray holds 250 sheets , front unit small indicator approximate amount paper left tray . 32 mb standard memory means big print job , even if paper runs out middle printing , it remember print remainder job . here great thing ... this model p2015 unit network ready built-in print server . i small network server connecting 2 computers wireless router our laptops . my 4l connected print server parallel cable . choosing this unit , all i use j45 ethernet cable , plug one end into one my ethernet hub empty ports , other end into back printer . install drivers each computer ( not server ) , you instantly business . just choose p2015dn your default printer each computer . i kept my existing setup my 4l backup printer just case . ) really nice surprise my ethernet hub old 10base-t , yet p2015dn still fires out each page blinding speed . machine doesn't make sound until it processed job , then starts firing pages out . duplexing works perfectly . extra money spent this dn model payed simplicity installation . there no operating manual comes box . there only installation disk . manual found hp web site . my only problem install instructions they tell you not turn machine until install complete , but it can't find machine network complete install unless machine , software not tell you specific point turn machine . so leap faith , i turned machine , it found network , install finished nicely . during install , it tell you it reboot your machine , so don't anything open while doing install . overall , based my experience my old 4l , current performance my new p2015dn , i look forward many years trouble free service . you tell i'm hp fan . yes , you find cheaper makes models same , but me , hp only dependable brand . i only say based personal experience ... i understand others may feel differently . good luck your printer purchase .	1

i wasn't exactly sure what think these speakers first . my setup includes pair these speakers , connected 6.5 " klipsch woofer ( gmx-a 2.1 ) $99 , i wasn't sure if i would get much more performance than stock sattelites klipsch 2.1 ; however , i'm very impressed after few days adjust differences sound . ( klipsch much more bright sounding , i liked , i adjusted equalizer my computer slightly more treble . after , i would say these speakers sound great any way you listen them ) . my personal opinion they sounded somewhat flat their own . i'm not sure how woofer attached would alter sound , but they seem nicely rounded their own . recommended anyone looking great price mid-range component .	1
i like design headset . it lightweight . way headset hangs your ear might feel little weird time time , but if you playing game your pc using this device voice comm you would probably ignore awkward feeling your ear after you get sucked into game . unfortunately , me , this device not deliver what it promised : 1 . - when you connect device windows use it preferred sound device . so when if you trying play game you using other comm software chat your teammates , instead using your primary sound device game lifechat sound device voice , windows switch lifechat sound device all sounds , which , my view defeats purpose headset . you get around this selecting your primary sound driver windows settings menu , but this pain . 2 . - sound very low muffled . mike buzzing background noise , lot feedback echo . i problems trying understand what my team mates say they barely understand me . poor sound quality renders this device useless . i wished it different ... generally speaking , i like ms products , but this one really disappointed me , specially since i looking forward get it so long .	-1

i'm very satisfied this case . but first bad : 1 ) it scratches easily . i handle my incased ipod kid gloves it still shows minor scratches surface . but anybody who 5g ipods knows ipod itself , especially black one shows lot scratches compared prior ipods . i think most people would prefer scraches your $25 case vs your ipod so i can't complain too much . 2 ) belt clip bit difficult use . it comes off case very easily . but when you use it , it difficult remove it your belt . that not say it can't it not issue should keep you this fine product . it task probably require both hands though . 3 ) opening connection bottom ipod might too large some . those you who like most possible coverage your ipod might little disappointed case , but those who prefer bigger opening so you easily attach accessories , this plus . now good ( my mind , there lot more good vs . bad ): thing made me purchase this one looks . only other case i've used evo iskin , which rubbery type substance seems act magnet all sorts dirt . i prefer showcase b/c clear face allows you show off ipod itself . personally , i really don't like cases hide ipod under flaps leather or mounds rubber . ipod beautiful piece machinery should treated such . hard surface not dirt problem i rubbery case . there rubber goes around edge add protection drops , but rest it clear . this case allows complete ease removing ipod which you simply moving two switches side case . headphone jack accessible enough able fit l-shaped headphones . all all , this great case , esp money . if you one those who prefer absolute most protection you ipod , then there may other options better you . i think there probably more sturdier cases ones provide more complete coverage ipod . this case great if you like able access ipod easily , use accessories case , show off beauty ipod .	1

this s350dl everything i need portable radio . powered d-cells which seem last forever , fm audio fabulous $150 radio long distant night time am band reception simply great . just tune well lit lcd display frequency if there anything it worth listening it there . selectivity tremendous bandwidth set narrow . i live almost next door powerful station 820khz like listen weak one several hundred miles away 810khz , not problem . no interference strong station . my scant no doubt obsolete communications theory always held great radio reception , double or even triple conversion receivers norm . now i radio advertised highly sensitive selective latest state art single conversion analog tuner circuitry . what means , i haven't clue but i'm impressed . only negative thing i've found radio so far its fine tuning knob tendency jump past frequency you're trying tune up , then , when you tune back down it jumps past downside . i've heard this called backlash . eventually you get lock exact frequency but it minor annoyance . thing takes some getting used i'm so used push button scanning type receivers , rotating old fashioned tuning knob several turns get high end band low trys my patience . overall i'm happy camper find this radio good features far outweigh its bad .	1

i am using my second zune , awesome . first one got broken almost day after i received it . amazon good job replacing item quickly possible . zen media player great , especially user interface ... makes it so easy navigate .. radio feature also great .. i usually turn it go sleep ... i guess navigation better than ipod .. i am not big ipod fan myself but navigation zune far easier ... click wheel would make things more easier but i guess thats patented so microsoft cannot copy ipod ... screen large but they should higher resolution .. would great ... but even this resolution videos pictures good qualityabout zune software ... it drawbacks but synchronizing songs not difficult .. but not great either ... i rather buy cds than music online so i don't care whether they thousand songs or zillion songs .. i just want their online music catalog updated so i get my media library tuned zune .. i am not big fan managing music itunes or media player or zune , softwares like foobar or mediamonkey make life lot easier manage library .. esp . when you massive one like me ( 60gb ) ... constant updates zune software get betterabout wireless feature , i can't find soul around who zune .. so i don't really care ... i no comments thatzune equalizer five or six different settings , which plus factor .. it user friendly since it customizable some extent battery , i read many reviews it poor battery , well new version firewall this problem solvedearphones zune sucks ... they didn't even fit my ear .. i am using sony earphone bose headphones ... although zune earphones looks cool metal so you stick two earphones together .... i question if microsoft people aware electricity magnet produce electromagnetic field whose fore harmful body ... esp . sensative part like brain ... until unless i am not confirmed this doesn't effect brain .. i am not using themi my homework properly , my biggest competitive zen vision ( reviews this far better than zune even ipod , cnet even gave zen some title , product year or something ) but i took risk trusting microsoft ( which not good bet ) , so far it working up expectation .. sad part i around . 4 gb left cheer	1

i need this recorder i recently diagnosed w/ppm ( piss poor memory ) . seriously , this handy little gadget . it tiny size allows you carry it just anywhere yet buttons display big enough make it easy operate . i'm disabled writing very difficult so this recorder great classes instead taking notes . also , i often find myself forgetting some important bit information my doctor may mentioned so i now bring recorder every office visit . built microphone works very well i've it record voices over 15 ' away . variable control voice actuator record sounds reached certain volume then stop recording when volume drops . this means no more recording dead silence allows you use less memory . price low such great digital recorder i highly recommend it anyone looking buy digital recorder	1

i am not going write what this phone what it doesn't , you read it other reviews . i explain what problems i you might it . least it might help you troubleshoot similar issues . first , it easy setup phone , connect it router phone line , register your skype name make your first land line call . quality good . then i placed skype call friend .. first problem : no audio , nobody hears anything . i tried use skype account my computer make calls to/from sph200d .. no audio . i looked all settings device , support website found nothing . i tried connect admin webpage using provided cd documentation username password admin admin couldn't connect(second problem ) . well , i reset base unit still couldn't connect admin page . i searched online god bless internet found documentation cd old current username/password admin/password . what even better reseting base unit helped audio problems ! hooray ! now i make good quality skype calls without need go downstairs my computer . next biggest problem i've experienced no matter automatic sign option turned phone(and web page ) asking password every time you sign off/sign skype . turning phone off , reseting base/phone , using different skype id , etc not help . i called support , waited 15 minutes told i need register product online first . well it sense , i so called again . 10 minutes later customer representative deli ready provide me excellent service . first , he said yes automatic sign should work my phone not defective , asked me all steps i already , i.e. reseting , etc . no luck . then he left check this issue called me back state phone must ask password every time i sign security reason ! ( what remember username/password option there ? ) . nice lie customer make him believe problem solved . note : if you turn phone off - yes there option turn it off , please press hold red button - without signing off , then when you turn phone it wouldn't ask you password . right , but all this time phone off , friends see your status online/away may try call you . well , there solution i've found myself - never sign off , just change your status offline . i not decided yet whether return/replace unit or keep it . maybe when you learn tricks how use device it would serve you well . but current price/quality i would not recommend it , too bad there not many alternatives . good luck it	-1

battery grip k10d helpful some situations . it holds back-up battery actually functional camera without swapped out main battery , thus doubling your battery time . you remove it , however , change main camera battery . storage space inside grip also holds second sd card . i would given 5 star rating if this card also functional , however , it not merely serves storage card . wireless remote control also stores battery grip but don't expect find one box . you purchase remote separately ! i am not sure grip needs quite so large size makes camera diffficult tote smaller camera bags , makes it cumbersome hang around your neck . second shutter release control dials extremely handy ! overall i think this very good product only minor drawbacks ! i highly reccomend it anyone purchasing k10	-1

what it designed , speakers top notch . pros : pros fairly obvious : space saving , great look , no cumbersome wiring , surround effect clearly separated , it not dependent room configuration . additional pro sound quality : mid range wonderful , jazz vocal sounds fullness you'd expect polk audio . treble crisp without breaking . all-in-all , sound sufficiently top-notch even someone who appreciates good sound systems ( except some you serious audiophiles ) . pro speakers strong enough handle enough power sizable room , say 20x20 room . cons : cons pretty obvious too . it not real surround , so it not give 360-degree feel sound field , but rather gives 180-degree feel . note you need add your own subwoofer sufficient power your room size . bottom line , i am very happy this purchase .	1

i installed this machine home office network via ethernet . install took awhile , changed registry settings without asking . uninstall not restore system it original state ; only hours manual resetting . how many users restore registry ? further , software/drivers not like printer turned off or missing . if you install this road laptop , you expect program , hpzinw12 . exe , search missing printer every 100 seconds or so using all available cpu time . if you unlucky enough middle client presentation , chances good you just lost job . if you turn off printer office , your office systems also search printer display unclosable dialog asking you switch unknown program while using most their available cpu time .

long-time panasonic wet/dry shaver user , i've owned both high end low end shavers , including procurve , found closeness shave equal both . pricier razors need charging every week cheaper razors smaller , quieter lighter run several weeks charges . however , pricier razors also sealed against water intrusion much better last 5 or 6 years , less expensive ones start failing due leakage year or two . ( but price , who cares ? ) order get close shave these babies , secret shave shower when skin pores open . that why panasonic electric razors class themselves . when wet , they shave least close razor without risk cuts . ( when dry , their closeness no better than any other brand . ) money i didn't spend high priced model provided me good excuse also invest very nice nimh one hour battery charger enough high capacity nimh 2700 mah batteries ( thomas-distributing.com)to end my dependance disposable aa alkaline batteries forever . razor run tad slower 1.2 volt nimh batteries than 1.5 volt alkalines , but still works just fine . great little razor ridiculously low price . when other razor companies get message ?	1
i review this simply because it not great . noice cancelling its job , sound quality ok , but little bass side , but way headphones sat your head just uncomfortable . its plastic head thing folds nicely into pouch annoying because crack which you fold headphones sometimes gets your haird caught it pulls it out when taking them off . me glasses , i often readjust headsets often because they push sides my glasses my head too much , causing discomfort . so me readjust them , i often pull out hairs ! just plasticky hard feel them--it just not comfy . i'll admit i got quite bargain ten bucks this item , but i would never pay 40 bucks headphones like these , especially without cushioned headband others , cheaper prices , often offer .	-1

i read many customer reviews before buying this gps . now i see many things mentioned reviewers differ my personal experience . here what i noticed so far : 1 . maps : appear quite accurate . this writing , i not experience any problems maps . i doubt paper maps would more accurate , or updated more frequently . 2 . updates : i recently downloaded installed version 3.11 , no problems during or after installation . 3 . battery : not great , but quite reasonable . after all , it car gps , so most time it plugged anyway . if you need ac adapter , i suggest buying ac 12v converter instead . ( this what i ) . it more universal used power other units ( coolers , car phone chargers , etc . ) ac outlet . 4 . satellite reception tracking : no complains here . 5 . menus other ui : nothing horrible . when you get used it , it becomes comfortable . 6 . music player , photo viewer : imo absolutely useless . ( same bluetooth , which not build into this unit , some people complain ) . you really no better way playing your music or answering your phone calls ? then it pity . honestly , i am not sure why they even bother building all this functionality into car gps unit . still , it works , it not true you need proprietary software or specially formatted sd cards it . i used windows explorer standard sd card copy mp3 files my laptop play it my gps ( no magellan software ) . summary : good gps unit , especially price ( i got mine under $300 ) . if you need navigation computer , consider buying gps antenna your laptop , then carry it you all time :) . me , it enough not get lost unknown city , finally get where i wanted . plus , it quite cool know how far you destination , how long it take you get there , even if you know route heart	-1

this perfect width stand 46 " hdtv . it hangs it very secure would also good 52 " screens , although 52 " , set noticeably wider than stand . glass shelves themselves surprisingly strong tempered glass supposedly support up 50lbs , though you probably would not put large size amp/receiver it . however , it seems strong enough support my large 25 lb center speaker , which thanks adjustable shelves , i am able elevate it only half inch under my tv which ideal movie watching . i worried first center spkr might too heavy but it sitting pretty it 3 weeks now . i used wider sized glass top shelf accomdate my extra wide center spkr my dvd player glass shelf below it . my receiver sits base stand i always rest easy knowing receiver plenty ventaliation thanks open design adjustable height shelves . pole itself one solid piece extruded alumimum thick very well constructed . it probably strongest piece kit . base also reinforced metal framing underneath mdf wood base , so there no worries either base or pole failing . only thing not impressive black finish base which quite nice look shiny , but you tell layer lacquer used quite thin could wear out over time or chip easily if you're not careful . also , due finish glass shelves , there visible dust buildup after week or so . this project mostly 1 man project , but you probably need 2 people when it comes time mounting your bigscreen lcd or plasma stand anything 42 " or bigger . tools required phillips screwdriver wrench 6 large screws base where pole sits . rest screws all use allen wrenches which provided . also word advice glass shelves . try not put anything heavy made out metal or ceramic directly glass surface . while their structure quite strong , tempered glass easily shatter into thousands if pieces you knock it something made metal/cermamic . if you want put anything metal or ceramic it , then make sure it rubber feet or something	1

win me/98 it possible , file patch , use rudder pedals other games also change controller preference number ( 1 , 2 , 3 , etc . ) . win xp handles controllers differently doesn't allow this . when connecting rudder pedals usb saitek x52 joystick/throttle combo , pedals assume controller #1 , this cannot modified . pedals only work games support mulitple controllers . if game not , order use x52 , i unplug pedals so x52 assume #1 controller position . this really sucks makes one wish old winme/98 , however , they aren't stable xp nor some newer games backward compatible older os . so it bite-the-bullet live it . if your game supports multiple controllers your os winxp then these pedals outstanding , but frequently isn't case . don't play max payne or other games pedals plugged , they primary controller ... ugh	-1
using this more than fun ... it great . i records i not listened over 20 years getting them converted digital treat . using audacity not all easy work , but after 6 or 7 records it became easy . recording vinyl , through normailzation , removal clicks , adding titles lastly save it not difficult all . each record take 2 hours start my ipod , but results wonderful . great little feature audacity fade-in/fade-out feature . though my apologies some artists , it better fade song out than listen lot hiss some songs take 10-15 seconds end . my " thumbs up " this product . wish i bought turntable sooner	1

we bought everyone family one these christmas . wind it up power away . cell phone charger converters come it fit most cell phones family , but it not fit fire fly or newer nokia ( model fm radio capacity ) . but it fits other nokias sony ericson . we've lost power here st. louis twice 2006 days . we no radio , no tv , no bateries , nada . now , we prepared . it pick up tv somewhat , but this not what we got it . if there huge national crisis i doubt tv towers , stations , power outages support any tv or radio . but we light . flashlight not brightest , but it sufficient . when power goes out sund goes down , it dark . we feel better knowing we won't rely candles batteries . we bought orange white ones . they plasticy i wonder how long windy thing last , but careful use this radio certainly come handy until ameren ue tunes lights	1
i thought i monophonic purist until seeing consumer reports review rated sound quality kloss tivoli radio above even bose , boston acoustic , cambridge models providing it hooked up satellite speaker . so fifty bucks , why not ? speakers nightstands parallel my head , so sound hardly balanced . other hand , it kind cool hear trombone coming one side bed oboe other . so thumbs up extra speaker , though i'm not go crazy install kloss sub-woofer underneath bed . not only it over-priced but even without sub-woofer speakers , my ears , already bass-heavy . maybe i'll reconsider if my cat stops purring prospect vibrating mattress suddenly seems attractive .	-1

checking other reviews here amazon showed everyone either loved this western digital drive ( gave it 5 stars ) if it worked or else they blackballed it if it failed . prices these drives continue fall , since larger drives ( 500 gb well even 1000 gb ) now available , they really good buy excellent way externally store well transfer data . my experience this drive very easy install , reformat , use extra drive . no problems . only thing i really don't like fact it doesn't real on/off button . circle front turn off power , but whenever computer starts , this drive starts well . means unless drive manually turned off after computer starts , drive always when computer . i prefer drive only when i need it save it unnecessary wear tear . other external drives maxtor even other western digital drives real on/off switches . this drive make noticeable hum while running	-1

people saying years tapes would die , but fortunately , they never seem . i know number people who car stereo both cd cassette . matter , i am starting see cassette walkmans again . if you follow my reviews , you know because dangers cd rot , i prefer make tapes my cds use them when possible . those you who don't know cd rot , it capable wiping out whole collection cds . what happens heat moisture turn cd purple make it unreadable . ( extreme cases , holes cd prevalent . ) if your cds not so over top , they may actually transfer well onto normal bias cassettes such maxell ur or tdk . previous reviewer pointed out if you making tapes your cds use your car , lot times normal bias cassette suffice , since most car stereo speakers not designed high output . ( he called maxell ur perfect workhorse tape . ) but moving high quality tdk sa tape , these tapes superb capable holding material even high intense cds such " metallica " ' ride lightning , ' " megadeth " ' rust peace , ' or " exodus " ' tempo damned . ' i'll conclude saying tdk sa not only give you excellent travel friendly copies your cds , but using them when you travel keep your cds safe cd rot .	1

i picked these up compusa which closing many it stores . yes there fan noise but what you expect it raid . you writing reading data very fast rate would you rather fry drives ? drive not need sit right next you . set it farther back if it bothers you . if you want hear what real fan noise sit server room few hours configuring multiple drive raids few dozen servers around you . what i call fan noise . this thing nothing . it provides redundancy ( raid 1 ) very good cost point . personally i would only recommend raid 1 . if you run raid 0 loose one drive you loose all your data . this not raid 5 which allow you loose one drive keep going . so my advice if you need fast large amounts storage fail over ( raid 1 ) then this product you .	1
i would recomend these phones , especially anyone who invested $250+ mp3 player ( you may well listen well ! ) . they're collapsable , which makes traveling easy sound still great . much better alternative ear buds which more potential damage ear drums or cause other discomfort . they also come stereo head those us musically inclined who use amps . i wouldn't reccomend them use while running or other exercise beyond walking , but style , comfort , quality sound i give both thumbs up !	-1

i previous bad experience all-in-ones , but bought this i liked bw laser network feature ( got it during sale half price ) . i liked it so much i recommended it client , who replaced her aging fax machine . copy ability , sheet feeder , great , scanner works very well , even over network , everything seamlessly works macintosh windows computers ( i two macs windows box ) . scanning resolution good enough almost everything 600x600 . main downside , why it got 4 stars not 5 , reliability . my machine arrived malfunctioning copier . page would come out badly distorted . amazon sent new one , no hassles , i sent old one back . one i bought client staples , after she 6 weeks , it started problems . faxes wouldn't come out unless you turned it off again . no warning lights - just wouldn't work . when it came back , faxes saved memory last few days would spit out . frustratingly , when we called hp this , our warranty allowed us mail it them , wait 3 weeks , then they would send us same one back repaired . no thank you - i didn't buy machine without it 3 weeks . expedited option , which cost $50 , them send new one we would send old one back . they would ship new one next day air - after 2 week backlog . no thanks either ! so , buy machine it great machine , but keep your receipts , or consider otherwise evil extended warranty , there good chance this problems within few months	-1

i really liked idea this product , they some good templates , but after putting hours into designing book writing up captions , i printed it pictures looked horrible . software resizes images automatically fit layout , but some reason leaves pictures pixelated fuzzy . i took pictures 6mp camera , they look great when viewed computer or printed other software , but when this software resized them they came out terrible . there really no way around it , except try guess proper resolution each photo crop resize yourself before inserting photos , but would take several more hours . this product wasted hours my time left me very disappointed	-1

usually i discount negative reviews . i think people may sour grapes against company , or not understand how install or work something . i somewhat tech savvy - i installed our wireless network took little doing . i work technical recruiter , so technology doesn't intimidate me . i like technology . so i nudging my husband print server so i could print without going printer plugging . he came home this belkin product went installing it . usually i like research before i purchase product , but he wanted handle this . so , he installed it , i went back checked his work , he followed instructions exactly . i know he some trouble , called tech support my suggestion - i would never gotten wireless router hooked up without tech support . only problem , printserver doesn't work . so , i tried installing software my pc , trying problem solve there . i called tech support hotline back , got operator who promised technician call me back short period time . i waited 2 hours , then went out run some errands . there still no message technician when i returned . this morning my husband needed get some work home . he created document , knowing print server not work , he wired up printer print way . but now , printer won't respond signal , so he can't print way either . so we deleted belkin software rebooted computer . he still can't print . so , i went back my pc , tried delete software through control panel . it won't delete . i am getting error message . i can't print either . so now i am hold belkin customer assistance . maybe it coincidence but good english person who refers himself operator , i swear i hear little indian accent . doesn't mean customer support outsourced india , even if it , doesn't mean customer support bad . but my experience this while i get real live person phone , he can't thing help me except promise me someone call back . when i tried get my problem escalated , i overwhelmed him he put me hold . i am still hold . i hold 35 minutes no help sight . i called back my cell phone , someone who sounded so much like first operator i spoke said he would escalate my call level 2 technician , someone would call back 1-2 hours . when i strongly protested , asked his name , asked number i could call directly , he offered transfer me immediately , now , i hold additional 10 minutes my cell phone . i am starting sense trend here . my husband - boiling over his inability print important document , gone off work print it there . i am sitting my sofa phones going stereo , waiting see if anyone cyberspace going pick up my call . i usually discount negative reviews , but this really my experience this product , if you considering purchasing it , i would encourage you think through little further .	-1

i've my e-10 around nine months most impressed it performance . my interests radio pretty much revolve around . . ( or medium wave ) dx'ing shortwave listening . it performance a.m. par highly regarded kaito ka-1103 which i received christmas this year . shortwave performance very close , however , kaito superior this area ( features ssb tuning well) f.m. ? e-10 well above average but falls short kaito ka-1103 . i've yet see radio equal kaitos performance this area , but e-10 closer than most . build quality , ergonomics , appearance second none better than most . slightly rubberized texture this set just plain feels good when handling adds overall impression this " top line " portable multi band receiver even though it moderately priced . it lcd digital display one largest nicest i've seen , very easy see well lit pleasant orange backlight . other amenities such 500 plus memories , 12/24 hour clock , i.f. shift antennae trim which both useful shortwave reception , local/dx switch internal battery charger nicad or nimh batteries all add up make this radio i'm glad i purchased often recommend those needing radio this type . even accessories included this radio such carrying satchel , earbuds , reel-up shortwave antennae top notch ! now , if you're wondering why , after all this praise i only gave it four star rating , not five it because eton not provide ssb tuning capability this receiver . it shame because it shortwave performance good enough utilize it . my opinion they shortchanged this otherwise exceptional radio . hence they only " hit triple " (which way more exciting nonetheless , i'm baseball nut too ) not home run	1

i would give high recommendation this tv . it perfect size bedroom especially if you're not looking overwhelm room but you just want something watch late night movie , morning or evening news , or late shows high def . dvd player works great really completes package it seems not increase size tv all . picture outstanding isn't what really matters end ??!! only little annoying thing concerns what would great feature but big limitation - tv aut o-o feature so you use it like alarm clock but it requires you select channel which tune tv once it goes . it you use hdmi i am get signal your cable box , you must tv input mode set hdmi but you can't set aut o-o hdmi input ( it must channel number ) . engineers just didn't think one through all way . oh well , still great tv	1

i purchased this product after quite bit research after finding it finally available windows i couldn't wait get my hands one . why wouldn't i ? it supposed best thing since sliced bread . first it looked like really cool product , , if your system mac . logitech great job selling nulooq windows system users but only give you half software operate it . there no tooldial windows version ( fact they don't disclose ) which probably most powerful feature this product . i now feel though i wasted my money what useless tool ( if you windows ) totally conned logitech . what even worse fact logitech don't any future plans include tooldial driver window users . so if all you want able zoom scroll then this product you .... i know where there one sale !!!	-1

this everything i looked mp3 player , but only first 6 months . half year getting it headphone input went , making audio staticy constantly going mono . send it repairs . after 5-6 months light use ( mostly car , so it not like it bumped around bags pockets ) problem reoccurred . send it repairs again . couple months later , after 1 year warranty expired , i noticed battery life started decrease . few weeks it got point lasting only hour after fully charged . i nevertheless continued using unit , extra careful damn headphone jack making sure i charge it every night . so couple weeks ago ( 15 months after purchase ) it stopped working completely . when turned it gives " hdd error " message . resetting not work . computer no longer " sees " it when it plugged . i emailed tech support got they said it looks like hard drive needs replaced possible cost $195 . needless say i won't investing two hundred bucks into clearly faulty unit . i really liked it before problems started eventually planning upgrade 60gb model , but i doubt i'll trust this manufacturer again	-1
i bought this tv march this year ( 2006 ) it worked perfectly until sony techs came out " updated " my firmware . i not any problems tv but thought it should updated or possibly affect warranty . soon tech left i turned tv , fan running " high " loud . this not happen until software updated . i went into functions tried use high alt function turn fan low ( off ) but would work . good news i bought extended warranty get it fixed , or replaced ......... word caution , you may consider not updating firmware if tv working , buy extended warranty . i paid $300 4 years figure i'll get least one $250 bulb out deal ( yes , it covered ) . otherwise , tv perfect	1
i purchased sony dav-fx100w system over internet . it surprisingly arrived only few days . assembly wiring instructions well . it looks good matches well my sony hdtv . sound quality just fine movies tv programs but fair best listening music cd or fm tuner compares inexpensive stereo . base not tight kind whoompy , although there plenty it . i actually decrease it 3 db . many sound stages remarkably different true sense there such " sport " which sound like stadium . most time it best " auto " performing method audio recorded . ir transmitter/receiver works well but there still plenty wires rear speakers such ac power amp , wire ir receive amp , wires amp both rear speakers . not clean one might imagine product description . mentioned previous reviews , 5 disk changer very slow rather tricky insert disk until you get knack . 5 disk change not necessary system would probably used dvd watching movies opposed inserting multiple cd listen music . i certainly would prefer my stereo ! over all i am satisfied it recommend it . it performs well what it intended , reproduce sound movies tv . again it good looking system .	1
while i am pleased quality sound this system gives me , i am little disappointed . i've this thing couple years now , 9 months it stopped giving me sound . so i went back replaced it . they didn't even ask what problem , they gave no arguement because they so many returns replacements . then over past few months dvd player making pretty loud noise whenever i use it , i turn volume up pretty high just not hear it . now player stopped working completely . i dvd there i can't get out ( which record part sopranos season , they dont sell discs seperatly their seasons expensive which pretty annoying replace ) . bose failed me once , shame them . they failed me twice , shame me . i'm gonna go something else	-1
2.0 gb sandisk cruzer micro flash drive looked like good deal when i saw it display office depot . it roomy enough all my data configuration files , rated usb 2.0 , reasonably priced . my first choice would larger version 1.0 gb iomega i use work , but , alas , such wasn't available . unfortunately , i waited too long put sandisk through its paces , or i would tried get refund . many others remarked , it horribly slow . while backing up my roughly 10,000 files , i found it taking second per file -- longer big ones . this translated around four hours complete whole operation . bulk deletes take just long carry out . using my beyond compare file synchronization software * read * sandisk compare its contents what my hard drive went reasonably fast -- until , no obvious reason , it hung one particular word document this evening . i couldn't even get my windows xp machine shut down without yanking sandisk its slot : usual " safely remove hardware " operation wouldn't work . after three attempts read same file , three reboots , i tried delete it windows explorer -- this operation hung too . finally i able deletion dos prompt . just like 1985 ! i then recopied file , now beyond compare finish its work without hitch . but i trust sandisk deliver up my precious files when i really need them ? i dunno .... so , it back drawing board . maybe now iomega come out 2.0 gb model . sandisk , i'm reminded painful adage : you get what you pay . ugh	-1

i trying find way easily carry lot camera equipment quite some time . i tried backpacks , shoulder bags , duffel bags , but none them really worked all well . then i saw lowepro street field system completely customizable pouches , vests , belts , accessories . it works great , you only get pouches you need so there no waisted space you organize them however you want according how often they used ( put frequently used items easier access places . ) variety alone this system worth investment , but quality ease use also very high which big plus . you get case any lens , camera body , or accessory you . i even cases my cell phone water bottle . one word caution , sure measure your lens lens hood backwards if you use them make sure entire thing fit into pouch , because sometimes lens fit , but then lens lens hood not . i often carry 5-6 lenses , extension tubes , teleconverters , extra memory cards batteries , bunch cleaning supplies other gadgets , which weights ton . but when they evenly distributed this vest/belt lowepro system it actually very manageable . only down side everyone staring you because you thousands dollars camera equipment strapped your body . but if you overlook , this way go . i used this system many zoos without ever problems , fact just unzipping single lens switching seems safer me than opening entire bag equipment every time you want switch lenses . many cases also come built rain/snow cover so if weather changes all your equipment not destroyed . you also put just few pouches normal belt when you just going take photos back yard or don't need take all your equipment , which nice . i really can't say enough how much easier this makes traveling lot equipment , if you hopelessly searching better solution , consider this , you won't regret it .	1

first all , these good speakers , nice design but it one flaw . batteries ... . it eats them up ... fastb . if you use batteries instead wall plug it comes , it wont go loud , if it thinks your playing it loud , it start .. skipping .. or something sort . but , it good sound quality , honeslty when your go , when you really need it blasting ? also they just .. barley large enough you cant put them large jean pockets sadly , but it doesnt weigh much all . i really like how if i ever say .. lost my ipod somehow , it cd player ( walkman ) hook-up so they wont become useless if i lose ipod . ( wall hook up also comes many different adapters )	1

i bought these use my samsung z5 mp3 player . while packaged earbuds good , sound just drowning bass . i like good bass , but not when it completely overpowers everything else . i given sony 51 try promptly returned them ; they sounded ok , but kind made my ears hurt , $40 , they weren't worth it . i read some reviews these 828 , so i decided go these . sound incredible . bass well defined , but balanced nicely midrange treble . i literally hearing nuances music i didn't other buds . they fit very well ( though any earbuds start feel uncomfortable after period extended use , which discouraged anyway ) . set black foam earbud pads included . i always prefer use pads , but it course your own call whether or not you use them . pads wear out , but you buy exact replacements radio shack ( pack 4 $4 ) fit perfectly . personally , i usually end up replacing pads every few months or so . my only gripe 828 ( only reason 4 instead 5 stars ) cord too short my taste . foot or so would nice . otherwise , this great product around $10 steal	1

i've looking way fix dvds our toddler " enjoys " . obviously he shouldn't handle them , but he loves " helping " so how i resist . unfortunately he scratched up his favorite dvd point it won't play most sections . so this device arrives i run repair , buffer then repair , repair clean . my disappointment disc wasn't playable ... until , i tried using more than few ( small ) drops repair paste . using three big drops his dvd playable once again . i'm repairing cleaning dvds library too . if we still netflix this would indispensable . instructions clear device works quickly . its pretty noisy though	1
i received this unit via my home insurance after my rca 5-disc changer stolen . unit itself solidly built , i don't any issues playback performance or picture quality . i think if you get this unit , you'll pretty happy it . what stinks documentation , remote , setup . manual your typical poorly-translated engrish guide most people come expect inexpensive electronics . fortunately , if you've any experience setting up dvd player , there not much different here . unless you want progressive scan . here what you if you want use progressive scan mode : 1 . connect both component cables s-video ( or composite ) cable your tv . hopefully it both inputs ( most hdtvs ) . 2 . put your tv s-video ( or composite ) input . 3 . enter setup menu ( not confused options menu ! ) choose progressive output . 4 . now you unhook s-video ( or composite ) cable put your tv component input mode . thankfully this one-time hassle , but it still assinine panasonic couldn't either designed autodetect or used physical switch like my old rca . rca , i just hooked up component cables , flipped switch , set up dvd player 16:9 aspect ratio i . lastly , dreaded h07 error . i think i figured out what probably causing majority them : when you eject tray , currently playing cd/dvd still motor continues play . neat feature swapping other discs without interrupting your music , but upshot ejected tray empty slot it . you guess what happens if you accidently put cd/dvd into seemingly empty slot mistake ? avoid this , instead using eject function , use swap function . this stop playback make sure all discs out drive avoid damage . overall , great player price . just careful it bear tricky setup	1
i use it outside my deck watching dvds summer . it sturdy , easy move around , quality excellent . i would highly recommend it	1
while sports kit very reliable fun use , i found it still more mp3 player than training tool . better more casual mid-week run than speed work or keeping track details long training run . this not say it not great running tool . website great offers lot motivation . , you don't need wearing nike shoes use this . there many options ebay sports stores attach pode your current running shoe .... but i still like my garmin forerunner better ..	1

i read some other reviews stating this home theater system makes buzzing noise . however , i my doubts so i ordered it anyway it great . no buzzing noise mine all . i apartment didn't really want spend whole lot coin major system i couldn't really use anyway because noise restrictions . this system nice clear gives me home theater experience i looking . they give you plenty wire run edge room still enough slack hang rear speakers up behind couch wall . granted speaker wire isn't all thick , proprietary male/female connector into unit which would make upgrading monster cable pain . it still sounds great under $200 bucks why would you care anyway .	1
i bought 5 these computers house . i would got better ones but house auto generator so all i need 30 seconds power . i noticed review person saying there unit going battery mode even when power still ... my understanding this unit detects ( dirty power ) when it detects it , it then stop accepting ac power . i think software it comes allows you turn feature off or even turn sensitivity up	1

i started searching wireless surround speakers due configuration my apartment . wired solution simply would not work due location my couch distance my tv . after searching while , there only couple options available : sony dav-fx100w , system panasonic optional wireless option , wireless receiver kit made kenwood . after looking reviews all different options , sony dav-fx100w appeared like best choice . i'm very happy decision . dvds look great my hdtv 1080i upscaling feature . forewarned , if you wish use this feature you need purchase very expensive hdmi cable your tv need support it . i bought 3ft belkin cable ( instead monster ) it still over $100 . dvds also sound terrific ; surround impressive wireless solution . like any stereo , it important adjust levels each speaker , i pumped up surround speakers little well center channel . subwoofer , others stated , pretty powerful passive speaker . there could more depth sound , however , it out box solution i think it sounds good enough long standard output kept it default sound level . others complained cds don't sound good ; i disagree . i've played several cds i think they sound great . i also input my ipod through video1 audio inputs , sounds pretty great too . again , like any receive , you'll need play settings audio fields enhance sound your liking . overall , i'm very happy this system	1
sound this system really fantastic price , but i've same experience other reviewer . dvd skips constantly , phillips absolutely no help fixing problem . amazon great offered give 50% credit , but phillips insists i send ( my own expense ) machine them then wait 4+ weeks ' possibly ' refurbished unit . i'm quite disappointed phillips its lack customer service	-1

we bought this device express intent capturing old vhs tapes putting them into dvd format . , it works bundled software meets need . however ! this ( vhs dvd ) long slow process , so don't kid yourself into thinking mpeg4 hw decoding this box going make super-fast process . actual " making " dvd movie still very time consuming , editing . i'm not so impressed windvd , but my son ( who most editing ) preferred its ease use over ulead product , which also included . we trouble one usb ports , even though all ports pc ( purchased less than year ago ) supposed high speed 2.0 usb . but using port allowed device found connected . i wish there some way tell if frames getting dropped . some video pretty choppy ( didn't look way vhs ) but i couldn't quite figure out what causing problem , it didn't repeat later uses . so far , we're happy we got it . if [ ... ] arrives w/o too much struggle , i'll even happier	1

i think this very good receiver . number people complained issues wireless fm modulator static causes . i would say there some static times , but most time i not this issue . however , i clarify statement , noting if you traveling long distances , you most likely switch fm frequency few times during trip ( my case it two hour trip sacramento bay area ) station you set likely not free entire time . however , it very easy switch frequency , so i able adjust it without any difficulties . receiver itself , i like compactness it it not take long figure out how go through various menus , save stations , etc . i not care much suction cup part car kit . although it worked fine my car window , i really didn't want it there , so i actually just use cradle place it one my cupholders , but this personal preference . i would definitely recommend this receiver my friends .	1
prossmallcuteself-powered - comes power adaptor . i 6 devices hooked up it , including 2 usb hard drives , it works fine without adapter - big plus me . most hubs would not work this setup . usb 2.0 1.1 - 6 devices hooked up , 3 low speed 3 high speed , all work very well . runs cool . consnot sure why , but they put 7 ports one side hub power/uplink ports other . this dumb . if you hub desk it looks awkward . all ports should back leds front . here , leds next each port which makes them completely useless you don't see them . hub very light so when you lots devices hooked up font gets elevated . overall , best hub i've ever i tried many	1

beware kingston rebates ! course , i hope your experience would differ , if you buy kingston product(s ) , but mine terrible . i bought kingston compactflash card offered $50 mail-in rebate . i promptly ( , day after i received item delivery ) went photocopy my rebate certificate upc code sales receipt ; then sent it all its merry way . yes , i well within rebate period , both purchase postmark date . my purchase valid retailer ( think huge online e-tailer ) . rebate required sending entire original upc label , which like entire outside package my cf card , size 1 business cards when flattened . no problem . two months later , i get letter saying " your rebate request denied because you failed furnish appropriate original upc code required rebate offer . " well , now what ? i can't re-send original ( it already their possession ) . i called , they insisted repeating what letter said . i re-sent my photocopies they said photocopy invalid proof purchase . after 6 weeks pursuing this , i figured this their scam . they simply wouldn't honor rebate . without original upc my possession , i couldn't really submit their requirements . if you're looking ram upgrade , i'd suggest you look quality company like ocz ( best ! ) , or patriot , geil , or corsair . if you're looking value flash memory card , i might suggest sandisk . one , kingston not make best products , they value-driven products . two , there competitors kingston just good or better value-to-performance ratios same prices . three , kingston not stand behind their customer i experienced . i urge you , please , cautious kingston their rebate scams	-1

buttkicker adds bit shake your home theatre . it doesn't replace subwoofer , but sort-of turns floor into lower subwoofer . i love it . but there some things you should know . first , lfe kit ( amp ) probably best choice start because you can't drive it your receiver - not enough power . so getting game cost you around $500 . which more than aura bass shakers , but far better . second , one lfe kit sofa nicely , but if you , like me , mount it under your floor , you're gonna need two . possibly more , but probably two . because that lot more mass shake , otherwise they'll maxxing out making loud knocking noise . third , it not like riding rollercoaster . you'll feel floor shake loud sound effects , bombs , etc ., but don't expect magic . it makes movie more real , but it doesn't toss you around . all said , it great addition . if you afford cost-of-entry , you'll amazed how shallow system feels it off	1

i took time line read what other reviewers wrote this particular radio some other brands . i chose this over product even though they seemed same . this radios only one complaint , blue light . other radio , people complained setting up clock times . blue light not problem b/c we placed this our bathroom where it could listened while getting ready work , etc . we difficult time reception our house due signal towers foothill near us some products , like cell phones , some television cable companies , they not always work well here . so i concerned may issue this radio . it not only works great but i agree other reviewers sound wonderful . it holds up our other more expensive radio . i would definately recommend this product others who looking great sound	1

i owned forerunner 305 3 weeks . mine performed exactly advertised . gps rapidly acquires satellites i not problem it losing connection . i live hawaii gps no problem finding satellites ( updating almanac data ) providing fix while i sat my living room initial start . since then it occasionally seems take longer find satellites , but while i input my planned workout it continues find satellites time i am , it ready track my progress . heart rate monitor worked perfectly . it not once failed immediately display my hr . so far it worked better than my polar dedicated hr monitors . display feature allows you customize different displays up four attributes each out list over twenty different parameters . example , if you want know how long you left , how far you gone , your current heart rate , sunset while you exercising you make display just ! display illuminates well night . i found pace information very useful not all jerky . since gps not provide speed directly , 305 like any other receiver calculates speed based measured position changes over time . since those calculations tend provide pace information naturally jerky , 305 allows you smooth data varying degrees . it records raw speed information , but pace it displays " high " smoothing very steady useful . i not tried other pace settings because i am getting useful information . bottom line , pace information useful , but may require you adjust settings your personal preference . best part 305 how it effortlessly provides useful summaries your workouts , tracks lap lap performance , allows you transfer information computer . i update software watch ( firmware ) , usb connection , computer program so i may avoided problems plagued earlier versions . i very impressed how fast easy moving training plans routes watch historical workout watch computer . entire process took no more than 3 minutes didn't require any complex setup . once your training records computer , they displayed garmin software or number different third party web based software solutions provide different analysis tools , workout plans , trails explore . most features available online free . even if you don't use computer , watch stores long history previous workouts displays your previous workouts useful summaries . summary , 305 great tool runners who want monitor their workouts or keep accurate record their training very little effort !	1

this very well made cooling fan your laptop . however , if you 15.4 " screen your laptop hang off it inch both sides , 17 " inch half both sides . problem ? no , not really . you want air circulation underneath cool . 3 fans great . most cooling boards only 2 . earlier reviewer said he didnt like it because back " open " . well reduces weight increases air circulation . it well designed my opinion . on/off switch nice . it only work course if laptop running . you never forget turn it off . it runs amazingly quiet . you cant hear it but you feel it . it really meant keep battery cool help heatsink fan . cooler working battery last longer . it good angle work . i really havent found anything wrong it . i highly recommend this item , however , if i make suggestion improve it , it would add couple usb ports it .	1

sound quality good but i really don't like style ... it smaller than you'd expect it , because image shown not actual size mp3 player . reaction time when you press buttons display screen ehh bit slow i'd say ... i just always happen pass song . i'd much rather buy ipod but heard it not most reliable thing ever . but i know fact ipods very quick , unlike this mp3 player . i'm shopping new mp3 player around $50 but found no luck getting sleek styled reliable one . i guess i'll just wait prices ipods lower . i not trust pre-owned ipods or any electronic pre-owned items , you never know how previous owner treated item before selling it online . also , this mp3 player only two colors really , silver white . earphones gave too much loud surround sound which i really disliked , so i used earphones my previous sandisk mp3 player . okay ... so maybe this mp3 player doesn't really many problems , but these just my preferences i just don't like overall appearance it . many my friends ipods they work well ... no problems yet , so i guess they're pretty reliable . also , battery mp3 goes quickly ... if you going long trip , i suggest you extra one or two batteries you . i constantly check see how much battery life left my mp3 display screen . i really not recommend buying this mp3 player if you teen like me , because you regret it . i found style this mp3 extremely unappealing while after i bought it ... time went i started dislike it more more . soon prices ipods lower , i'm definitely buying one . i ... like many teens look mostly sleek style ipods offer course reliablility ... after all , it very fustrating time after time buy new mp3 player because how unreliable it	-1

this great solution people who want always-on file server shared multiple computers . i think performance average this kind device , but if you only want access disk single computer , you'd better esata or usb drive which much better performance . performance especialy slow when you first access files , but i think might due power savings features ( server rated consume only . 6 amps ) . configuration extremely easy or without supplied configuratin utility through really simple web interface . documentation minimal , but you don't really need it long you know default admin account admin no password ( which i lookup online ) . one note , if i make this purchase again , i'd probably get 250 gb instead 500 gb drive i didn't realise how long it takes copy backup 500 gb data onto relatively slow server	1

i really like this printer ! very glad i dumped my hp favor this . most other reviewers covered everything , but i wanted mention ink refilling . this printer uses opaque cartridges , so you actually see ink level inside . this important because this printer set up recognize when you refill cartridges : if you refill cartridges , you disable ink level detector , machine records fact you bypassing their outrageous ink prices ( this applies non-oem cartridge replacements well ) . once cartridge used , chip not reset ( you epson chips proper resetter ) . therefore , ink level never known again , other than pulling cartridge out every now then checking it visually . pre-filled non-cannon cartridges : they don't come ink level chips . you remove one your spent cannon cartridge attach it non-oem cartridge . this doesn't allow printer tell you level ink non-oem cartridge -- it merely allows catridge used . i managed deal these annoyances , i lot high-volume printing , i am very careful refilling cartridges so they don't leak out into printer ( i.e. , i two sets cartridges , i leave newly-refilled one out machine least day make sure it isn't leaking once refilled , i use rubber plugs come most refill kits instead flimsy " tape dots " supposed seal refill hole -- they don't work ! ) . all said , this great little printer . it no fax , i haven't tried scanning function , but strictly printer , it suits my needs perfectly . i run printouts online business , so this thing gotten major workout already 6 months or so i've owned it -- much more than many you may ever print , print quality very good . it , however , require 5 different ink tanks , each which replaced/refilled separately ( no more wasted ink ! bonus , course this always good us ink refillers ! ) : 1 . ) black2 . ) black pigment3 . ) magenta4 . ) cyan5 . ) yello	1

i'll admit , i lost my original stylus while moving my home , so i buy replacement . pro : this new stylus works just well , added bonus built ink-pen - that fantastic . con : only negative ( it only slight negative ) , telescoping top doesn't work quite well original . don't get me wrong , it telescope feels great when ' long position ' . but while ' holder ' , sometimes it doesn't pop-out first push . it more slight annoyance than problem	1

i strong preference trackball over mouse ever since trackballs first became available because , unlike mouse , trackball requires very little space no physical movement other than rotation ball . i owned several mechanical trackballs various manufacturers over years but all eventually became difficult use because build up dirt their internal mechanisms . but this kensington optical trackball which operates very smoothly -- , optical , rather than mechanical -- should continue so . it smoothest operating most convenient trackball i've ever owned . i not any sticking problems commented previous reviewer ; mine operates flawlessly . if you've never used trackball before , please consider trying this one . you may quickly become trackball fan	1
pros : gigabeat considerably cheaper more capacity than ipod . it compatible plays sure vongo ( movie download service ) . nice screen , although suited more watching short recordings than full length movies . pretty easy transfer almost any video mpg or wmv player ( although mpg require conversion wmv through mediaplayer ) . cons : battery life not very good , i average maybe 7 hours . interface player much sloppier than ipod ( play/pause , forward track , back track side player pretty easy accidentally bump ) . mediaplayer very buggy program , when you set it up auto-sync there often duplicate albums other weird problems . i recommend using something else transfer your music videos ( even just drag drop ) . player slow response times when advancing tracks sometimes ( couple seconds or more ) . overall : though i listed lot cons , i really like player . it very nice not tied down itunes only major source legal downloadable music , battery life issue isn't all important me - it made it pittsburgh paris playing almost entire flight .	1
i talk landline or treo 650 all day my home office . i've using palm treo headset treo calls , my treo wired headset landline calls 5.8 ghz panasonic cordless phone , surrounded 2.4 ghz wireless internet signals . while this setup works , issues ( ) i am tethered desk ( often tangled dropping cordless handset ) , ( ) switching headsets hassle ( i not try wearing both headsets separate ears -- too confusing i want one ear available local environment ) , ( ) landline callers often complain they hear " echo " their voice treo wired headset , ( ) extra step plug my palm headset into its charger ( its lack low battery indicator ) results recharge it when i need using it . my ideal solution would enable me answer calls either phone single headset , keeping my hands free working my computer , un-tether/untangle me so i move around my office home , provide convenient recharging stand headset ( like jabra jx10 ) . my functional priorities : ( 1 ) 2-way voice clarity , ( 2 ) wearing comfort stability stay my ear , ( 3 ) range . cool style/design not significant factor . i stumbled plantronics 510 headset , which seemingly unique " multi-point " technology enabling it pair two phones same time . on-line research revealed seemingly well-designed desk phone adapter integrated headset holder/charger . value optional " handset lifter " hard assess without seeing it working . but entire system expensive ($399 list plantronics site , $300 other retailers ) , it requires wired desk phone--it not compatible cordless , due way it connects wired handset . however , i know plantronics manufacturer serious office headset solutions , so i figure you get what you pay . i read some reviews ( few available , not even listed treonauts site ) , found it web $210 , ordered it test it out . well , i've only using it 3 days , but it superb ! i dusted off old wired desk phone ( keeping cordless programmed numbers place calls ) , plugged everything together , paired my treo easily , kept all default hear/talk volume settings , charged headset - started placing/answering calls -- flawlessly ! talk quality , even my critical , hard-of-hearing friend no complaints . listen quality , i raised hear volume switch base one notch , now it perfect . handset lifter awesome ! i dial call cordless , then press call button headset ; handset lifts you hear call going through ; i hang up cordless . range-wise , i walk upstairs kitchen refill my coffee , step outside greet fedex man , * almost * get mail - which 70 feet base station ! conservatively it looks like i get good solid 30 feet , through walls , no quality loss ( though still only 10 feet if i'm talking treo ) . nice feature : if i * * go out range , low tone indicates this -- without dropping call -- high tone let me know i am back range resumes call ! receive call either treo landline , i just touch call button headset , which conveniently centered my ear . once you set listen volume good level , this only button you really need touch , it easy " find " . comfort-wise : very comfortable ! over-the-ear design keeps headset feeling solidly place ; smallest earpiece fits snugly my ear , but absent pressure other earpieces i've used ( gels ' hard ' earbuds ) . i hardly feel its weight my ear , there * no * pressure inside my ear ; i easily wear it all day . when i take it off , i stick it right into its holder/charge - so it always charged up ! packaging could use one very small improvement : headset eartip guide could use some verbal description , complement diagrams , selecting/fitting right eartips , removing them headset you try 3 different sizes . i am careful , discerning technology consumer , am aware real proof satisfaction comes after weeks use -- not hours or even days . i save all packaging return product not perform expectations . i tell you i am already confident 510sl keeper ! i post updates this initial review couple weeks	1

i recieved this dvd player christmas gift . i know it cheap dvd player got it gift , so can't really complain . but i'll point out some stuff just case you're considering this one . screen : screen resolution isn't great can't really see much change adjustments , but dvd watchable it . compatabilityit plays dvd-r i've burned most factory bootlegs i've tried . some bootlegs audio off . don't know if it player or disk since some bootleg disks don't even play my panasonic or samsung dvd players , but disk works fine computer dvd drive . haven't tried any original disks since i don't any here . it also plays mp3 pictures . resolution pictures don't show up clear screen . battery:haven't really chance watch full movie it , but battery seems last long . i only charged 3000mah battery once since i got it . battery charged while use . cables : i like it comes ac adapter car adapter . i don't know why it doesn't come video audio out cable . it ports video audio out , but no video . :( i hoping able connect my ipod video it bigger screen when watching videos . bottom line . if you're looking cheap dvd player don't want spend money more expensive one , this one not so terrible . it light enough , screen size good enough . if you laptop dvd drive , you'll probably enjoy watching dvd more since it bigger better screen . i give it 4 stars out 5 , it cheap price it what it supposed even if it not exceptionally well	1

if you're like me , you probably wondering if these little cables actually worth money . i using cheap thin wired connections before , my receiver would lots background noise buzzing , so i thought i'd go ahead give these things shot . afterall , i listen mp3 all time my computer through my high end receiver . i'll tell you what , these things work great , worth extra money . now keep mind , i'm audiophile who very picky sounds . so casual listener who doesn't mind occasional background hissing or lack crystal clear sound transfer your computer your receiver , you might able find cheaper connection . but once again , i think extra $$ well worth it i highly recomend these . your only concern here economical one . far product concerned , these things top notch	1

dinovo cordless media bluetooth desktop , logitech produced product sleek appearance . product looks sharp mouse nice hand-feel . mouse rechargeable battery comes recharging cradle , so disappointment finding dead battery your cordless mouse relegated " old days . " when product works , there noticeable lag keyboard entry or mouse movement response screen . surprisingly , lag time seems greater this bluetooth device than my older non-bluetooth cordless desktop , but it not so long make product unusable . however , this product two fatal flaws . first , other reviewers found , my experience dinovo it crashes constantly . secondly , logitech no help whatsoever this product . keyboard mouse work less than 50% time simply not acceptable my needs . bottom line this product didn't even help my clutter problem my desk , because my corded keyboard corded mouse sit right next computer , rapid access whenever this product decides stop working . this product troublesome , unreliable decidedly not recommended	-1

i initially disappointed yellowness whites produced huey , but then i realized my eyes need calibration . i figured out after while , you go back " uncorrected " pre-calibration view then looks too blue . really test this , i got some test pattern prints web printed them good lab compared them my monitor . yup , thing works : colors matched . i don't know why so many folks giving it 1 star -- they defective unit or they possibly doing something wrong ? any rate , you get over initial shock because you've using uncalibrated display so long . extremely small size , quick calibration ( much faster than spyder ) nifty ambient light measurement capabilities , there no better product under hundred bucks . i've mine six months take it back forth work home -- it barely takes up any room my bag . calibration routine so quick i edit images my lunch hour setup doesn't take big chunk time . if i go through lengthy calibration routine , this would deal breaker	1
recently bought spindle 50 pack sony dvd+r all errors . i noticed other reviewers using dvd identifier see real manufacture black disks . i downloaded dvd identifier scanned sony dvd+r 16x what came up ( sony recording media co . ) these blank disks terrible , all disks errors half way through burn process would produce errors , stay away these blank disks . i recommend fuji disks whick scanned through dvd identifier ( taiyo yuden co . ltd . ) burn excellent verbatim disks whick scanned through dvd identifier ( mitsubishi chemical corp . ) these too burn excellently . hope all this helps	-1

great little gps unit -- good bang buck , especially linux user . i surfed checked out number usb gps receivers , most not specifically mention linux supported . not only , but many support multiple data formats apparently require driver software change data modes . according holux web site , this unit worked linux they even offered drivers . i late model low-end dell laptop running simply mepis i use car , it got hassle use my old hand-held gps because i change batteries , stick mount windshield use serial usb adapter , not mention changing data format nmea mapping software i . ordered received this unit , plugged it into usb port , power light came , after minute or two started blinking indicate it good position lock . fired up my gps software laptop , position indicator right my house . took laptop out van , stuck gps receiver out sunroof , ran computer 36 hours straight while mapping various trips -- receiver worked flawlessly . if you run fairly recent linux kernel this unit should work just fine you also . well worth price	1
this pretty good cb basic rig it price class . if all you looking no-frills cb car keep touch others or get road information while traveling , pro 510xl nice rig . i cigarette lighter plug my pro 510 so i easily put it car whenever i go trip . audio speaker pretty clean , i found range cb pretty good it size . it helps good antenna , such wilson 1000 or something similar . one thing i don't like radio microphone pretty cheap . uniden chose use electret microphone element mic pro 510 pro 520 radios . mic element draws 3 volts power radio itself power mic element . this makes it virtually impossible use any other mic other than one comes radio . i told you use some sort amplified mic , like one astatic series hand mics pro 510 if you want go better quality mic radio . if you try use regular dynamic mic like most cb use , transmit audio just won't sound very good . mic uniden supplies radio adequate , i wouldn't say it excellent . all-in-all , i think pro 510xl good basic cb . uniden backs rig 2-year warranty . give this radio look if all you looking simple cb traveling keeping touch others road .	1

like everyone else i researched portable dvd players quite extensively before buying . i settled this model because 1-panasonic reputation , 2-9 " screen , 3-long battery life , 4- fm transmitter , 5-accessories includedwe just made round trip 6 hour drive picture quality very good , these things aren't imax , i am very particular audiovideo quality i would say you won't disappointed screen . audio thru headphones car fm very good . fm signal runs into interference you drive thru different markets but you just find signal readjust settings , very easy . base unit speakers adequate loud enough but don't expect high quality surround sound experience . controls easy use very simple . i originally going get lx-9 docking cradle , external speakers lots add ons . then i realized i probably wouldn't use any extra features price too high . imo , save your money , this excellent portable dvd player everything you would need . it quite portable , fits easily front seat arm rest console , very stable , long battery , includes car adaptor , ear phones , carrying case available rebate . i would recommend it	1

( i fun used christmas patterned fabric left over project sell my christmas related items ) . cons : i didn't buy this sooner ! it paid itself many times over higher auction closing prices sell-throughs because better photos .	1

i bought this product after reading reviews this site i love it , i terrible hand writing always hated way my burned cd looked . i say this made my life much easier . labels always come out just like they show program , program super easy use , i sat down after five minuets i made my first label designed ! only draw back i found sometimes labels don't stick exactly center there slight uncovered spot not enough interfere any player just enough show little bit silver disc but it doesn't bother me all . i love this product recommend it highly	1
product good you expect . all mouse pad very similar design , which not comfortable use , my opinion	1
i've used these recording cds . no coasters after several hundred burns . not sure if cd optimized music or not , but top side cd white easy write sharpies .	1
so far so good . i am able use drive video editing . it little slow , but not sure if drive or my laptop	1
i bought slingbox tuner so i could watch sporting events remotely i am quite satisfied it . setup simple without problems . first moment i fired it up , it just worked -- it worked nearly flawlessly since then . 4 months i using it , only problems i experienced once when box stopped transmitting needed reset . video quality dependent upon upload speed internet connection where you slingbox set up . their website slingmedia folks recommend minimum upload speed 256kbps . they great utility checking your upload download speed before buying . i am very happy i got this little box	1
good-looking product , simple set up operation . picture sound quality spot	1
what better than joystick thats high quality , solid feel , programmable buttons no wires !! you just connect little sensor usb port , put cd ... it installs , you're ready . battlefield 2 i just went controls menu , programmed each buttons accelerator switch easily . this full out full function gaming joystick no wires , great accuracy . can't go wrong price	1
these headphones great sound under $20.00 . im very glad i bought these . they seem durable well made well . i would definitely recommend these anyone looking headphones	1
this sturdy stand helps get monitor ergonic height while freeing desk area . sure read dimensions , since it pretty wide . i found it ok 17 " crt monitor , although it bounces bit . i'm not certain it would work larger heavier crt . great price	1
my setup older hitachi ultravision 61 " hdtv , ( 2 ) bw 604 front , bw cc6 center ( 2 ) bw 601 rear speakers . i ready spend much more money replace my dead sony receiver but since my hdtv not hdmi inputs i didn't see poin t.t his receiver perfect my application . i only component video inputs my cable box dvd player . audio , my cable box uses single coaxial input . my dvd player uses toslink connector my pc uses one other two toslink inputs . this leaves me ability add one more component video toslink audio device . note : 5.1 setup connect rear speakers center channel surround set rear channel speakers " none " configuration . if you don't connect rear speakers this way you simply won't get surround sound . receiver plenty power intuitive setup use . remote easy setup but you press several buttons switch sources because there no macro function ( like higher end receivers ) . that not problem me because i use sony rm-av 3000 remote control which macro functions . don't mislead low price -- this receiver packs lot features money . if you don't need switch or upconvert hdmi , then this right product most mid-end applications . far xm hookup goes ; i'll never use it . i sirius i use streaming internet audio my pc through 50 ' toslink cable listen over receiver . my pc , i creative x-fi sound card optional digital i/o module . only thing missing receiver toslink output	1
it works fine my camry . sound quality , however , just so-so ( considerably worse than cd player built-in deck )	1
xmas my wife myself treated ourselves olevia 32 " lcd tv bedroom . one problem i needed 3 remotes . one tv , one tivo one cable box ( demand ) . both cable box tivo basic tv functions refused work tv . expensive logitech remote i also refused work tv . morning spent googling confirmed there issues this tv remotes . solution presented itself " open-box " sony remote $15 . quite simply put learning mode it learned anything !!! i tv component programmed control all functions i use all three remotes . only time i need change component if i want watch cable demand ( which not often ) . excellent product price , fact i'm going buy one replace logitech harmony main room	1
nicely constructed well padded . looks classy , too . bad news ... no strap or belt loop just silly sideways loop . no protected hole earphone or controller . whole thing just trifle small minidisc . minidisc fits , sure , but no space left earphones or discs ! i suspect same would true many mp3 players well . so it makes nice padded carry-case quot ; cpuquot ; my minidisc system ... but it isn't carrier go jogging	1
we're upgrading our 15 yo toshiba tube tv . sdtv comes out so-so all lcds , pixelating somewhat annoying , but hdtv comes out superbly . we're getting in-the-clear qam analog channels cable , but i find tuner little slow , picture sound lags we compare it our old analog tv set . this might just digital tuners general . initial programming channels took long time , 5 minutes tuner scan all channels cable . we get 10 digital channels , rest ( ~ 30 ) analog . other reviewer noted , this tv actually fits standard cabinet , so we jumped this tv over some other models much wider bezels . 37 " size also perfect small living room , so you far enough back so you don't see all pixelation apparent up close . set simple matte cabinet , which what we prefer over glossy which i find distracting . menu system easy use feature loaded : you customize cc settings ( font , color , etc . ) each channel , picture size settings seemed remembers across all analog channels ( we usually leave it 4:3 ( natural setting )) , picture freeze setting very useful phone numbers , weather forecasts sports . incorrectly noted review there no built-in dvd player . but dvds nevertheless play very nicely , i'm using component video cheapo cyberhome dvd player , so speaks well built-in video scaling tv . composite video sucks , so don't bother unless you really want use your vcr ! not tried hdmi or vga , so i cannot speak those . sound good but not great . i not use srs wow because it distorts sound my disliking . srs focus good dialogue , but again , i prefer unadulterated sound . i use trubass low , but high it bit distracting . stablesound very useful feature , those annoyingly loud commercials . larger room , i would definitely use surround sound setup . i wish some things made easier though . there no direct way turn cc , you go into menu system turn it ( each channel ) , or mute tv . i find this cumbersome if i just want use cc occasionally . i would also liked direct button change picture settings , like if i'm switching movie sports , again you go thru menus this . power save feature nice , but it takes 5 seconds tv power , which takes some getting used . i also find channel browser feature bit useless , even though i am tuning directly cable , not using set top box . you cannot label channels , so i find annoying , channels all jumbled don't correspond actual channel number , so labelling would make it easier navigate channels channel browser . overall , i bought this tv because its superb picture quality , which something you cannot get cheaper set . features good , sound ok , but those not factor much picture quality	1

i've this two years . using winamp , ati multimedia center ( tv tuner software ) , other media players windows xp . software cumbersome set up each program you use , but ability customize any program uses keyboard execute commands , it worth it . also used it powerpoint presentations . if you want transfer your settings pc , you copy install folder " : \program files\keyspan " your new computer , then reinstall software . keymapper uses 4mb memory . remote battery lasts me year daily use , $2 replace	1
i given zune gift , recently . this isn't first mp3 player i've owned but it one largest capacity store data i've owned . up front i'll tell you i'm not hardcore ipod junkie , nor am i apple kiss-butt . i believe products work . said i see why people prefer ipod over zune , though i say zune isn't deserving some bashing i've read these boards people who believe it cool bash microsoft products just because they made microsoft . good1 . zune large , bright lcd screen easily seen sunlight . video picture quality good . 2 . sound quality good . factory earphones adequate delivering music though i pair philips earphones far superior only cost $20.3 . box includes data cable you need syncing . 4 . interface super easy use it easy get around zune environment i've not any music skipping problems 1.3 firmware automatically downloaded when i synced my pc . 5 . unit itself feels solid when held , slightly heavy though not too heavy . 6 . software loaded without problem my winxp sp2 system i no problem syncing machine when connected usb port rear pc . i all my non-itunes songs added player within minutes . 7 . zune allows you beam songs , pictures movies other zune players range . first generation player , it gets job nicely i look forward seeing what generation 2 bring . not so good1 . when i connected zune 4 port usb hub pc didn't recognize it there . i connect it back pc usb 2.0 port order get it work . maybe that design , though i'm not sure . once i this i no syncing problems all . 2 . i've never found zune range share anything . leaving wireless seems drain battery faster . i'd recommend turning this feature off until more people buy zune ( if happens ) . 3 . you can't buy music or movies wirelessly . 4 . although zune wireless it not compatible your home or business wireless lan . 5 . you can't browse internet zune . 6 . zune software no problem getting your music onto device , though zune marketplace vastly understocked compared itunes music store . 7 . zune cannot get music purchased through itunes ( this nitpicky , i know , but would so nice ) . there way work around this - you burn your itunes songs disc then turn around rip disc pc mp3s then import them zune , which i would rather than pay money re-purchase music i've already bought once . 8 . there no way re-organize files your zune once they uploaded device . say example i want throw couple pictures into picture folder so when i view my pics i don't scroll down forever day see them . i delete pic zune through pc software , add pic folder i want then sync pc player . folder added zune library order update occur . 9 . there no way change orientation photos or movies when viewed . i would like able flip them counterclockwise or clockwise 90 degrees view them portrait view instead turning player its side view landscape mode . one reason why this important when i set one my pics my zune background , i'd like able see just how much pic cut off since zune doesn't resize pic fit . oh yeah , that thing ... 10 . pics used zune background don't option re-sized fit screen . what i would like see change zune ( more microsoft than anyone else)1 . options re-sizing pics fit zune screen2 . options changing orientation pics movies3 . ability organize my files zune without delete file re-sync . i'd like able this player software both . 4 . since i use usb port back my pc longer sync cable would nice . 5 . put built-in wireless good use . slap compact internet explorer allow viewing web pages email ! you don't need keyboard view read-only content like weather , news sports it would really add player value6 . allow zune able buy music , pics video without connect pc . again , make use wireless capability zune . 7 . something zune marketplace - it just needs overhaul . it needs additional music , movies definite bump cool factor . 8 . make it easier customize outside zune . you this additional customizeable faceplates xbox 360 - same this player . if you hadn't noticed - individuality here stay	1
i am new this type device , but it works well , intended me	1
my original review below . it still stands if you may some these hanging around 2004 or before . shortly after i wrote this , though , maxell went pot . i throwing away more cd than i burning . it became so frustrating i switched fuji . these days , i would say fuji all purpose best ; hardly ever any malfunctions , no data loss yet . they also seem work fine any cd recorder . so , while maxell used great ( i used them cassettes all time back day ) , they decided some point cut corners rather than make product customers like use reliably . this point , change five stars one . ________________________________________________________________________for me these best cd market . i basically used this brand because they ones i generally used when transferring my albums cassette . same quality continues . i personally never liked using fuji or sony recording media past . tdk wasn't bad cassettes ; however , my record cd-r them 25 wasted discs out spindle 50 . i so far used hundreds maxells ( this line their others ) only one or two discs i discard due errors . also , all ones i made few years ago still sound grea t.t hese best cd-r both price performance	1
apple , once again , delivers yet fantastic product . after doing my research find 3rd party wirless unit , i found i no choice but buy airport extreme card my imac g5 . i'm using linksys router it works perfectly . i made mistake installing card first then plugging antenna . if you install this sure plug antenna first making sure plug all way tip collar ( which takes little force ) then insert card securly it seat . if you don't get very strong signal look card antenna again it more than likely isn't all way . it very easy install so if you comfortable opening up your computer it yourself . once you it installed that all , go your airport icon make sure it ... that it ! you're up running ! easy plug go !	1

i bought this card after i got logitech z-2300 speaker system . it made huge difference overall listening experience . highly recommend it , especially if you're currently using your on-board sound chip decent 2.1 speakers . you get optimal performance if you connect analog audio output your pc cd drive directly card rather than going through motherboard .	1

this my first mp3 player so i don't anything compare it but i love it . sound unbelievable , picture gorgeous touchpad exactly what i wanted . it sensitive but i use touch mouse keyboard very light fingers so it like it made me . that medium setting , sensitivity adjusted . there couple things i'd suggest would make it better but they're minor points . one , instruction manual pathetic . only thing worse user guide creative website . it actually showed menu options this model weren't actual device . but googling zen vision brought up lot discussion forums where all my questions already answered . other thing i don't like how it doesn't separate album artists contributing artists , making artist list three or four times long it needs . lot names i don't even recognize because they're collections windows media player grouped under various artist . i would preferred method sorting but when weighed against incredible sound ease use , it very small matter . i bought custom skin protect screen case it couldn't better . it easy put while you press buttons through it , it easy locations clearly marked . while i haven't dropped it yet ( fingers crossed ) , rubber feels thick enough provide some protection when i . altogether , it realy pleasure use i totally recommend it .	1

this telephone attractive programmable features those so inclined , performs well , provided it located fairly close electric outlet . if used home dsl internet connection , you'll probably install filter phone telephone jack . relocating segment back plastic body enables phone wall mounted . this not too easily because long telephone line must packed into interior bracket . dsl filter make phone hang farther out wall well . panasonic tells me they not sell longer handset cord replace short cord which they supply , so if phone mounted wall you may buy off-color aftermarket cord . wall mounted phone i should downrate it bit because these factors	1

all i've got say if all gps receivers worked well this one , then i would jumped gps bandwagon years ago . alas , receivers past didn't work nearly this well , nor other modern receivers what i tell . this this so sensitive i actually toss it my glovebox completely forget it until it needs recharged . now , if only i cigarette outlet my glovebox , then i would never even think it . said , it extremely aestetically pleasing i would never want hide it sight , i display it proudly my keyring !!	1
i read quite few reviews this other universal remotes i decided this one based price , looks logitech reputation ... i absolutely love this remote ! it easy setup ( once you get package open ;-) it fairly well built , but not any children i am not overly concerned rough handling , besides i would much more worried thousands dollars components getting damaged children than $70 remote you ain't buying one these some crappy old crt beta max ! if i any concerns/issues this remote it would ( others pointed out ) numerical keypad bottom remote , not disaster , just mild inconvenience also usb port cover not seem " seat " perfectly . there quite few reviews i read kill this remote due issues updates incompatibility devices activities not behaving right way , etc ... now maybe things changed last 4 or 5 months , but i zero problem software downloads/installations . logitech pretty specific order which setup their devices . moment i got remote connected cd installed it immediately connected website downloaded latest greatest software version . once you type your components information ( manufacturer , model number , etc ... ) software hits website downloads codes needed work remote . setup activities simple ; you " rename them " , change their order modify them any way you choose . one mistake i made this may something reviewer well when i " modified my activities " i never hit " update remote " button . i promise you , unless you some bizarre components some bizarre configurations or setups this remote answer your prayers getting rid bowl " remote control salad " you probably sitting your ottoman or coffee table !!	1

i got ( 2 ) these stands couple yamaha cp-33 pianos ; basically , free add-ons . i couple professional welded dual-x stands already , so i believe i'm position make fair comparison . assembly not really problem . it took me 30-40 minutes or so put both them together ; i work slow . i agree others included written instructions little bit confusing/not much help , but if you lay parts out ahead time , mentally think process through/study instruction pictures , you'll probably just fine . they logically go together , but my advice : take your time . think process through . i should also tell you second stand definitely went together faster easier then first . once together , i used ( 1 ) support yamaha cp-33 ( 40 pounds ; 88-keys ) stand-up church performance situation . no real complaints ; although overall , it not stable either my other dual-x . little bit rocking , true ; but nothing unmanageable . my guess home use , sitting down ( it center gravity lowered , it " feet " further apart ) , it should work well ; although you might hit stand legs your knees ! try sitting front one assembled before you buy it , if all possible . well , that it ! not much stand , really . but i would say money , you'll probably not able much better . that why i'll give it * 5 * . it fine ...	1

those whom this may concern , this case also fits ipod 30gb photo . case isn't tight people describe it but it fits perfectly . this case doesn't make ipod much thicker . it barely adds any weight fac t.t he plastic it made great . it definately scratch resistant ; it so strong you could use pocket knife scratch back your ipod won't even harmed . when you put case into jean pockets , it tends stick there so taking it out inside-out your pockets ( i hope made sense ) . this case not slid off dashboard either ( although i wouldn't recommend it ) . although packaging says it shock absorbant , i don't recommend dropping your ipod . screen protector wheel protector , i recommend you cut out piece paper protecter slip into case . hard plastic cases come also work but after you cut it out , you'll use sandpaper sand it smooth so it doesn't scratch you ipod once you put it . after you plastic case , you're ipod completely protected . only thing i don't like top too wide open dust tends get top . bottom case perfect ; it closes completely so case also acts dock protector . i ipod 20 gb also , this fits well . 40gb ipods , i wouldn't recommend it . my friends who 40gb ipod tell me it doesn't not fit . some able jam ipod into case but cannot good i t.t aking ipod ( 20/30gb ) out case very easy smooth . it not scratch ipod all when you put it or take it out . those people who sync thousands songs time , you should take your ipod out case because harddrive gets hot skin only making it hotter ... hot = bad . overall , this case wonderful . i wouldn't recommend anything this price perfect compared other cases . honestly speaking , i think these cases took less than 25 cent make factory i believe price outrageous . like i said however , compared other cases ' prices , this actually pretty good . pros : + long lasting material+ cheaper than other cases+ scratch resistant+ doesn't scratch ipod when removing/putting on+ you dock/charge/sync ipod without removing casecons : - you make your own screen/wheel protection- case top little too large allows dust enter- doesn't holes back let ipod " breathe " 5/5 ****	1

if , like me growing percentage computing populace , you use your laptop your main computing environment , i recommend you add pilotmouse laser wireless mini your workspace . you don't realize how much annoyance standard touchpad until you plug this mouse appreciate its wonderfully supple touch feel , epsecially when combined really nice , compact high-end mouse pad like 3m precise gel wrist rest ( mw307 ) . i like pros cons approach used previous reviewer this page . here mine : pros ---- * eye-opening smooth scroll * laser technology amazingly accurate . specs say " 30x accuracy improvement over optical . " believe it . * ergonomics mini really well thought out ( e.g. , little rubbery fins side ; profile height same your standard laptop ) . * nice " travel " configuration - usb antenna slides bottom mouse also turns it off process . kudos industrial designer little nuance . cons ---- * everyone note here , usb antenna pretty big ungainly . * i wanted deactivate my touchpad ( i'm cursed " phantom touch " phenomenon ) , but two occassions now when i've plugged usb device top pilotmouse antenna , mouse frozen up forcing me go touchpad resolution . * somehow , one point , my middle mouse got inadvertantly set relatively useless function horizontal scrolling . i tried use software ( which must downloaded ) set back vertical scrolling - i got it , but not without lot headscratching . not intuitive all i'll say there	1

this powermac g5 , or so label says . i haven't tried this older g4 computers so i don't know if this really needs driver that built g5 or something . i got this heck checking what it me . nothing really . 1 . first you know this adapter connects dvi port , not old adc port . what this means aluminum displays g5 model use dvi . this case , then you problem right there fight over port . unless you high-end optional nvidia gt card dual-dvi port , then stock ati 9600/9800 cards come one dvi one adc . so i would think people g5 or thinking upgrading aluminum display then you needing adc dvi converter hold monitor tv same time . makes using two " monitors " respective adaptors . why ?! unless apple envisioned phasing out adc port soon , it makes no sense . if they envision phase out adc then why release cards g5 still adc port if new monitors use dvi this adapter also uses dvi . they trying make money selling adapters ? 2 . i haven't seen perfect computer tv interface major video card manufacturers same way matrox perfected it . what matrox dual monitors one using tv it automatically routes video signal tv . if it detects your playing movie file , it just brings it out tv full screen . no need drag your windows into screen then making it into full screen . this adapter software interface doesn't it . it just makes your tv into monitor extremely low resolution , naturally . point adding tv monitor obviously put make multimedia viewing experience more enjoyable hassle-free . if you play quicktime file or dvd movie your computer , you would want it played your tv . nope , not here . you drag it then make it full screen . but it doesn't stop there . try opening application full screen tv monitors automatically switches back into one within window . very stupid annoying . so i believe they should follow footsteps matrox create custom software allow just . put check box if you want your video automatically output tv , window , first monitor , second monitor , etc . 3 . above suggestion actually works final cut pro application . but if you're video editor , you really wont even need this . you see once you connect your tv via this adapter then you route your tv your monitor which good check actual picture quality tv screen . it cheap solution . however , if you editing final cut pro then it would natural you either video editing card output tv/monitor while keeping your dual computer monitor active editing . or , you camcorder firewire output or some other similar solution you use route computer camcorder tv . using firewire actually better solution this adapter because it not allocate video card memory tv via adapter . using adapter connect tv you eating up video memory computer monitor tv . so if you 128mb memory then 64mb goes each . this slows down video information evident if you using big computer screens . using firewire video card not interfere allocates full memory your computer monitor . 4 . os isn't even perfect interfacing adapter . you connect adapter you'll need constantly restart computer whenever you connect/disconnect it . simply putting computer sleep waking it won't work . your video card still thinks tv connected despite no tv nor adapter ( after waking sleep ) . shut down computer , remove adapter then start make sure all video card memory allocated back your computer monitor . so unless you high end video card afford split memory interface automatically routes video signal your tv , this pretty useless . it just fun prove you output part your screen your tv hassle all . skip until they improve software	-1
weighing here , i think i add little bit more discussion this product : pros : * supports unicode character song titles folder names ( this means if your song title written chinese , it'll display chinese player screen ; because i unicode library this very important me )* supports multiple file types , meaning you not locked into converting all your songs proprietary format ( my library huge mixture file types iaudio plays them all -- so awesome )* x5l small -- much smaller than i'd thought * my whole cd collection fit onto 30gb storage room spare -- reason i liked this unit * bright , big lcd screen * it not ipod not made apple * volume easily adjusted without looking device * music libraries dragged dropped into player they ready play ( very important feature somebody who already their music library organized way they want it player)negs : * joystick navigation not intuitive . once you navigate up or down your song choice , you're going hit " right " joystick , right ? no , you press " down . " now you're ready go back so you're going hit " left " right ? no , you press " down . " baffling stupid * no " stop " button -- want stop music ? you can't . you turn off unit * order charge or connect unit your computer , add-on component required * ear-buds don't stay your ears cord different length each ear * protective case or belt holder not included unitin general i'm actually very happy this unit . like other reviewers , i waiting just right type mp3 player come out before i bought something . this comes pretty close . i carry my entire cd collection my hand which what i shooting , unit supports unicode titles folders . likewise , i able drag drop already-organized music library into unit it worked perfectly . so , this product good merit . what would make this unit superior product : carry-case belt clip included unit or available somewhere market . ( i yet find good one . ) power/usb connectors should right unit rather than special attachment . also navigation system should intuitive ; i don't mind joystick if system works , but its current programming clunky awkward . i feel very bitter sweet this purchase . it what its supposed , all right features . i'm glad i own it . but cowon would well listen these issues correct them next time around	1
i've using this sony recording church services couple years now . obviously , this not high-tech operation . i convert tape into digital format editing my pc create cd . i've able make some great tapes so far i'm recording huge " cathedral " type church . size cost , i think it great . i don't think i'd use it listening music microphone rather " noisey " . i recommend this persons who aren't ready make major investment high-tech recording equipment	1

this fine pocket radio people who need something small don't want suffer interference using ac adapter . mini300 takes 2 double-a batteries . fm/am reception above average sensitivity . however , radio newbies go crazy drift , radio inability lock into desired station . you're better off spending 10 more dollars getting sangean dt 180 , which runs only one small battery , digital , doesn't drift . if you want something standing alone your office or bedroom , i suggest you buy best radio currently available , kaito ka2100	1
this walkman sony offers serious music lovers opportunity listen mp3 files stored cd , regular cd ( course ); am fm radio seven tv stations . it even sports weather digital tuner ! remote comes handy if you don't want carry actual player your hands you walk town . moreover , it only uses single aa battery time you get lots play time out single battery . even better still , this portable cd player weighs only one pound -- this very lightweight machine poses no hindrance if you use it you walk through streets . great ! first glance controls walkman itself appear intimidating but after ten minutes tops you learn all important most commonly used functions . controls also make it easy adjust levels bass change equalizer settings . other functions , including listening tv station , require more concentration time learn . however , instruction manual fairly clear if you questions you always contact sony customer support phone or interne t.t he product description this page indicates software making " atrac " cds comes packaged this player . however , when i bought this just last week there no such bundled software . instead , product manual indicates i need download relevant software sony website . however , there remains no extra charge download relevant software make " atrac " cd . advantage making " atrac " cd you fit much , much more music onto " atrac " cd than you ever could otherwise when making your own cds . indeed , owner manual this walkman states you fit 30 cds ' worth sound onto one " atrac " cd . excellent ! however , i noticed some disappointments . first , sony advertises this walkman music enthusiast -- they right . this means average layperson like me spend couple hours learning how use all functions this walkman . capabilities this little machine impress me greatly ; but there learning curve persons like myself . i not anticipate . addition , buttons rather small so you need careful how you touch them your fingers . finally , earbuds hurt my ears almost very start listening cd this walkman . i strongly suggest you purchase better quality headset or earphones more comfortable . overall , music enthusiasts thrilled this walkman . abundant features amaze me i believe you impressed , too . quality sound excellent ; you even make sound constant certain level which product manual indicates you won't hurt your hearing you listen music or talk this cd . shockproof memory " skip-free protection " impress me , too . i highly recommend this portable cd player music lovers everywhere . addition , if you time learn how use this machine its greatest potential , any layperson like me also come cherish this walkman .	1
pros : lot features such video playback , mp3 , organizer , alarm clock , voice recorder , fm tuner . using their software basically like opening up explorer windows . resolution sound quality nice . buttons instead touch pad allows more precise control . removable battery pack nice . there additional extended battery pack available purchase . speaker so you blast ghetto music fancy restaurant if you'd like . take compactflash card transfer data . many other fun features . cons : omg it huge !!! i honestly wasn't expecting it big . i thought " hm ... maybe little bit bigger than zen vision ...? " this thing almost exact same size my nintendo ds ! i just can't get over how huge it . it bit turn off those who might want use it exercise walk around . think super old school walkman but significantly heavier ! when delivery guy dropped it off , i shocked box so huge !! i thought they sent me wrong item ! then i opened it ...!!! i almost repulsed how prehistoric it looked ! more cons ... thing lags . it definitely doesn't operate nearly fast ipod when switching menus . i guess that because all things it offers . it get little bit tedious frustrating . even more cons ... lack accessories . i guess i probably won't need toughskin or protector this thing , because if i drop it , it'll damage whatever it lands , purely its size . overall , far functions this player concerned , i'm happy it . however , i'm still trying get over ridiculous size thing . i dare bring it out public ? what would my friends say ? would people stare ?! i highly suspect they laugh . oh well ... i guess i really only going use it play music car . i must remember hide it glove box before i let any passengers car	1
main reason i purchased this product because it supported 1920x1200 dvi interface . product works advertised . switching computers very simple they timing keystroke capture down really well . item compact fits nicely my server closet . my one only complaint usb keyboard port not pass-through usb port . i microsoft keyboard fingerprint reader when connected kvm none my computers recognize fingerprint reader ( only keyboard ) . only when i connect keyboard directly computers fingerprint reader recognized . this very unfortunate since i really enjoy functionality fingerprint reader . i trouble-ticket open avocent , but i am not hopeful . update : i got response back my trouble ticket : " currently avocent kvm switches not support fingerprint reader keyboards . due configurations additional hardware avocent not looking into support secure fingerprint reader access keyboards . use this type keyboard currently not supported device .

i so excited get nav/dvd our new suv . however , i hate this unit ! you can't watch dvds unless car park . whole point me watch movies passenger seat while my husband drove . also , you put navigation cd everytime you want look new address . this means you remove your dvd or music cd put this special disc . you then park put your dvd back start it again ( we screens headrests ) . worst part you can't use any features nav system while you driving ! i pull over enter address or find point interest . while my husband drove , i figured i'd able use these functions . it not user friendly . we read manual still cannot accomplish tasks such programming radio stations ! i regret this purchase immensely . i not recommend this system anyone unless you willing put car park ever time you want use any its functions	-1

we this tv since november 2005 really enjoyed it . we it delivered via amazon delivery option . delivery guys unboxed it outside house placed it floor because we hadn't yet found appropriate tv stand . my father law husband then spent day getting everything programmed . picture quality clear i've grown dependent tv guide which comes tv . we've no problems tv . we definitely liked ease competitive pricing amazon offered . i know some people difficulty shipping . we've found delivery people give you call if you request it , so you don't need wait around all day . person problem delivery people not hooking tv up him , i've never encountered delivery people who would . i ecstatic when guys who later delivered my tv stand actually took time place my tv top new stand .	1

it actually looking dozens flat-panel sets prompted me choose this one , i am entirely satisfied my choice . first dvd i watched lawrence arabia , it truly like sitting theater . few hd channels we actually get ( through comcast howard county , md ) , show promise all hd eventually bring . said , there caveat regard cablecard feature , which i wanted activate , , disappointing results , though it seems largely comcast problem , who claimed , after four tries , they couldn't guarantee compatibility . ( they powerful disincentive provide this service , btw ) . so i go cable box all its attendant wiring ; since this tv mounted over fireplace , it involved fair amount extra holes walls . since i bought this , price even come down bit more , which expected , but overall , this set provided best " bang ( lcd ) buck .	1

okay , idrops works -- just mere polish , it marvelous -- makes your device look shiny spotless . it remove scratches , but you gotta use some elbow grease , lots lots cotton balls , patient -- repeating over over , then over over again , then , over again . after , you'll probably it over then over again , before it over , then over again ... but you see results -- scratches greatly reduced , if you stick it , you remove them comletely ( but again , it'll take while your arm sore next day ) ... patience muscles keys here ! but diligent effort , it make your device look brand shiny new . your biceps delts look more toned too ! one thing -- i bought this my new macbook . most my scratches underneath , back edge , where printed insignias apple information ; thinking idrops safe mild , not realizing printing actually top , i quickly removed one insignias where it says , " designed apple " -- poof , polished it almost all off -- careful around printed areas	1

sony hmd1g hi_md minidisc now little bit more availableand really good idea . it major improvment original minidiscs which only held 60 mins ., 74mins ., 80mins . new one holds just under eight ( 8 ) hours music or datawhen recorded standard play mode . quite accomplishmentfor sony . i agree other reviewer who opines thatsony not seem making decent effort " sell " theirproduct . it almost if they want this format go way " beta " or " dat " one would think sony would want recoup r+d money invested this format . i personally thinkthat $6.98 disc holds much this one great buy	1

i tried out my new pet320 fairly satisfied quality finish product . i played one each , dvd , vcd , audio cd mp3 cd , my surprise dvd audio cd gave out relatively lower volume output max volume than vcd mp3 cd . but fair say volume levels enough enjoy movie distance 2-3 feet , which would your normal viewing distance this 3.5 " screen . audio seemed sound more crisp while using rock equalizer settings rather than default . one thing i not test though volume levels when you some disturbance around , i think it might need lot desired area . picture quality good player very rugged compact look , it would fairly safe say disc mechanism would reliable owing philips brand name . you get what you paying more , since lot stuff bundled together package including car kit , pouch , av cable earphones among other things . it would great if philips threw small remote price , but maybe future models . retractable stand could annoying beginning , but once you get hang how much force you need apply it just works fine what it made . i connected this my tv picture quality perfect , only thing volume won't increase much beyond certain point even if i crank up tv volume . ideal places where you cannot carry your tv you , still need dvd entertainment	1

overall it good product except two things : 1 . usb way too short , little bit over 1 foot . lacie , what you talking ? it probably costs you only one dollar add some extra length . whole point external hard drive its portability short cable doesn't give you . 2 . usb interface , dc power , power switch put all one side , but led indicator other side . again , dear designers , you ever tried work your own stupid design ? you know how awkward ?	1
this usb-hd what it supposed . i no problems so far . it extremely silent . external ac adaptor bigger than others i've seen . although its design porsche , it nothing more than steel box feature surely must not influence your buying decision . it comes formatted fat32 maximum portability among operating systems , but if you use winxp you probably want reformat it ntfs create some partitions over its 465mb formatted capacity . process takes well over hour	1

i've used kvm switches belkin before good results , so i really disappointed when i used this one . my main problem switch seemed dropping some my keyboard strokes . so , example , if i typed " quick brown fox jumped over lazy dog " what appeared my screen something like " th quckbron fx jumpd ovrhe lzy " . there several other minor annoyances . connectors poorly laid out ; example : ( 1 ) when power plug inserted into power connector , plug covers one spare usb ports ; ( 2 ) monitor connector located so close rear unit it difficult attach monitor cable . i would able live these issues , but keyboard problem just too big problem	-1
i got this tv few days ago so far i am very pleased . picture hd very good , rivals some my friend sony lcds . setting up pc monitor shaky , but once you get settings right , it very cool(except sitting close long period time quite uncomforable ) . i am little displeased dvd quality , my other hdtv looked much better same player component cables . i heard tv not automatically upscale component images only those hdmi input , which would explain this . i plan buying hdmi capable dvd player see if this fixes issue . either way picture large improvement over my old crt . i would give this item 5 stars except tedious setup order get everthing working picture refined . i would deffinately recommend this item especially because its built hd tuner .	1

note : though this definitely card i ordered , one arrived wasn't labeled ' transcend ' but ' topram ' . not sure if makes difference or not . i bought this card go my new treo 680 . ( note , other review incorrect , although capacity not read correctly ( it maxes out 4gb ) , card still work fine newer palm treo products , patched work others -- websearch more ) . i like me some media , already filled 2gb card music , movie , tv shows , really wanted something bigger . this card fit bill perfectly . i've got 5gb it already , it plays all music video files very well via ptunes tcmp . only downside card * very * slow write , incredibly slow delete . card reader which came it approaches bearable , but trying delete within treo itself so slow i avoid it whenever possible . still , 8gb this price incredible . update : i reformatted card via command-line use 32k block size , this seems improved speed large-sized files ( music , videos , etc .	1

i want wireless headset skype maybe some gaming . i thought zx-6000 it , but it not . not even close ! first , sound get really bottom out . sometimes my skype friends sound like gurgly lagoon monsters , hungry ready feed . i can't hear mid or high ranges their voices . connection seems unstable , causing pops drop-outs . so i take it back , lagoon monsters may more coherent . initially i thought this skype problem but i plugged my wired headset i could hear them clearly . i like headset design , but it doesn't feel comfortable my ear . i imagine if my grandma took out her dentures sucked my ear i could get same sensation . it ok few minutes , but after , i can't take it anymore .... wearing headset , . volume levels fine volume buttons work , power button . call button , other hand , anomoly . it nothing unless you use voice windows live messenger . even then , you install software . button doesn't work skype or yahoo . but what annoys me most button would serve much better microphone mute button . this headset not mic mute ! volume mic mute controls essetial any headset ! how could you not mic mute ! so those my big gripes . few other things annoy me : 1 ) usb receiver large considering dongles come mice other peripherals pretty small nowadays . it also cord , which good if you want set receiver your desk , but i prefer just small usb dongle plugs directly into my pc . i bought wireless headset ... forego wires , not take one off headset add it receiver . 2 ) it would nice if headset bluetooth so i could use it my cellphone . it stands , it just works pcs . i know , i'm probably asking too much seeing how microsoft overlooked some more basic elements like mic mute ! i want use wireless headset , but there not much like this one . i regret purchasing this headset . i just hope my $[ ... ] rebate comes through soften blow	-1

i purchased this joystick 10 15 hours it time this review . overall it good stick . i thought it drifting first but noticed it actually my hand " resting " wrong . i took my hand off it it stoped drift . i've only calibrate stick once so far . i like stiffness stick , it uniform throughout movement ( ie not increasing/decreasing you near end it range ) . grip little small me , i don't overly large hands ( sorry ladies ) so this might consideration if you big hands . front button above trigger button presses little awkwardly first , but once you get used it it not too bad . three buttons base front stick spaced so you 1 finger each them without difficulty . i would like see pinky button this stick , but didn't expect one since it wasn't picture . all all it good stick , but i can't speak life-span , just out-of-the-box performance	1

we often prefer brand name product such sony , toshiba , or sandisk pay much money strong belief we got great stuff . however , due competition business companies global market , most brand name products now assembled china or taiwan , so quality brand name products , fact , not good we think anymore . if we carefully read some tiny words around upc barcode kingston sd memory card , we see kingston products assembled japan , so quality kingston memory card good quality brand name products like sony or toshiba but we buy kingston memory affordable price . spend my money wisely , i prefer kingston product ; great stuff great price .	1

title says it all . i put them my x51v year or so ago it still pristine . they're slick ( no stylus drag ) completely transparent . they require slightly more pressure i suspect they muddy positioning little bit but it hasn't problem me . far biggest downside getting them installed . backside slightly tacky though stickiness doesn't come off . it attract any lint or dust around once it gets backside it doesn't come off . no washing or wiping could budge it . display must absolutely perfectly clean you need clean environment ( i amazed amount lint floated onto display while i fitted first one . ) you also cannot touch backside or you'll leave fingerprint mock you until you replace shield . i use tweezers small screwdrivers other bits position shield . all they're pricey but they're still best units i've tried	1

it features it claims , software works ok ( my mac ) . it doesn't claim fast , it isn't . 300 dpi ( which probably all most people need ) , its speed definitely acceptable , but not blazing . higher resolutions , scans take quite while . price , i'm perfectly happy wait ( or something else while long scan completes ) . if you're graphic designer scans all day long , you should probably spend more faster scanner	1

so you want home theater . your wife says yes if you hide hideous stack black boxes . sounds simple . this remote makes it very simple . i shopped competition options monster massive home theater controllers . since my budget not $500-$1500 , i avoid big controllers . it monster universal . most my components " code list " worked perfectly just code . my tivo/directv exception . tivo code only made tivo work sat code only made part work . i used learning capability remote even though i program every button , it fast painless . rf features remote work perfectly also . i my components cedar closet 20 feet my projector couch . it goes through walls fine . powerblaster transmits ir signal closet not even facing components works due high ir signal it outputs . macros turning everything on/changing input projector also easy program work very well . $100 i paid this , it steal . there no way monster counterpart gives enough additional functionality warrant high price	1
when i bought this product year plus ago , there wasn't many reviews out there , even here amazon . now i remembered , i checked see there many reviews . it seems many issues this product dying which isn't good . however , those us product hasn't died , this product god send . i tv across room cable box . i 2.4 ghz wireless transmitter received while but once i moved , i major interferences microwave , phone wifi . i researched it found this product which claim no interference these devices . took risk bought this product . i am happy report it works great . limitations it : - it line sight it work well- when you walk front it , sometimes , it make sound crack , which pretty loud 11pm your wife sleeping- no use other applications such transmitter your audio system " traditional " speakers . still best product its application . strongly recommned it anyone , keeping mind what it can't .	1
i like this product . it low profile great value . i connected radio cd player it . radio should kick out automatically once cd player starts . my only minor complaint radio doesn't kick out until sound output cd high enough . i once played cd very quiet passage beginning , it didn't switch over until it got louder . if you just looking great amp you technically declined spouse or significant other can't comprehend , this amp you . auto power feature great . sound very clean faithful . i wish it subwoofer out . would make it perfect me	1
excellent product price . efficient , not too heavy carry around . slight hum voice track dependance remote . these minor points notwithstanding , excellent buy , would recommend it	1
this product works great , good sound , easily hidden . only draw back back speakers still connected together wires . i expected them independent not wired together , probably should read fine print if there any . good product hovever low price !!	1
i like simplicity beauty it ( it so different other mp3 players out there ) . i figured out how add my own ' genres ' how make it recognize my files folders ( retag your files , i simply use wmp it ) . i just need know whether there way make it pick up where it left : turn it off , then , then say minute 2:34 seconds last song played ( that 6minutes 14 seconds long example ) . thing : where you get it new less than $50 ?	1
this well designed product fits ipod mini perfectly , allows it stand upright so it doesn't get banged around etc . while syncing or charging . i bought two - one attached my stereo system used standalone charger ( playing music through stereo ) , second sits next my palm cradle attaches my usb 2.0 hub syncing my ipod . no gripes whatsoever , it very good looking product . i initially bought third party cheaper product , opening ipod too big ( though it works ) , it clearlu designed used larger ipods - it annoying led can't turned off . not very nice room where people sleep . it also looks cheap . apple ipod mini dock looks very classy , not eyesore slightest . reviewer who said:---here joke , dock absolutely nothing more than stand your mini . it comes no cabling it not come ac adapter ( $40 ! ) apple makes sure you can't get any idea what you buying until after you purchased it broken open packaging . --- my ipod mini came ac adapter firewire cable attaches adapter . they plug right into dock , nothing else needed make dock standalone charger . if you want use firewire connect your mac/pc - then you need buy second firewire cable . me ? i just use usb2 cable came my mini syncing	1

i looking bag just laptop power source -- something i could bring school my backpack full books . this case seemed answer- 2.5 inches . when i got it , i knew there no way it 2.5 inches ... it more like 5.5 inches ( i got out ruler , i know . 2.5 inches refers main chamer holds laptop . when you add outer pockets , it bulks up . however , it still very nice , sleek looking bag i am planning keeping it . i would recommend it anyone who basically needs laptop holder one chunky 15.4 inch dells out there ... it really nice , comfortable case .	1
i concerned keeping my new toy safe elements . this product fits performs perfectly . i am impressed fact it thin you really cant see it your mac book . i also like fact i put stickers other stuff my new laptop . reason i bought this product because i wanted some more structure my screen . i laptops before one screen break opening it up . i thought this product would give lcd more stiffness so far nothing broke . this product worth investment	1

i am returning this radio , even though sound very good -- except one difficult station -- reception also very good . i bought this use bedside clock radio . it no real controls except those found poorly laid-out remote ( bose some reason also just uses remote only ) . if you lose remote , or even if you can't find it morning , you can't operate functions . changing clock time , changing alarms or putting radio into sleep mode all take endless button pushing remote . it got very frustrating after while , but because i liked hd sound i planned keep i t.t hat before i found out radio alarm would sometimes just not go off . then machine sometimes jammed up when setting functions refused respond remote or off switch until unit " reset " . resetting unit means unplugging it , unplugging it means you lose everything but your presets ( you go through all cycles set clock alarms ) . final final straw caused me return it find new radio when it started losing signal local station ( but not sister hd stations transmitting same frequency ) . so , sum , i liked look , i liked sound , i liked hd stations , i hated required remote , i hated difficult cumbersome user interface , i hated buggy operation	-1
i bought this a/v switch switch my computer tv source set powered speakers . rca switch produced tons noise other channels , even while turned off . while using tv source , switch added constant " clicking noise " . also this not sold amazon but some " shoptronics " company . they terrible customer service make you pay shipping costs even if device sucks can't even what its specified . beware , not order this switch or shoptronics	-1

purchased surround bar 3 weeks ago . very nice sounds .. i'm happy it - one reservation . advertising leads one believe surround bar utilized wall , or stand . choice i made put it stand i purchased stand purpose . surround bar 4 " height , accompanying cradle it sits when stand-mounted , it 5 inches height . this problem - panasonic plasma i own , it stand , only 3 " above shelf which it sits - thus surrond bar blocks view lower two inches tv screen . weight , height , high center gravity plasma set , it not feasible think it sit high enough stand ( 6 inches over shelf ) accomodate this surroundbar . i explained it all my wife , she cheerily said , " we watch tv standing up see over speaker bar " . i laugh . all my plans clean , installation up smoke . oh well , live learn .. temporarily , i mounted it 2nd shelf . it looks quite good there , but there some impediment each end bar , stand-supports partially blocking left right speaker . stand i bought fits surroundbar perfectly top shelf 43 " , but shelf below only measures 40 " . i am presently contemplating mounting it wall above tv stand accompanying mounting rack but odds my goal home theater - no visible wiring . oh well ... it probably my own fault not knowing how high my plasma mounted it would partially blocked ... but pictures exist surround bar mounted stand , show no such problem . sound excellent . surround sound fabulous . yes , you need buy subwoofer full effect . i use exceptional mirage omni s8 . if not problem my planning surroundbar height , i'd given it 5 stars .	1

i got great deal this refurbished multifunction laser printer am mostly very happy it after few weeks light use . it features i wanted ( except duplexing which price jump up ) , but i honestly can't say i've put it real test yet . one critical performance issues me quietness standby mode brief lag time powering up print . i'm very satisfied both counts . scan quality my only real complaint . print quality speed good brother postscript emulation seems excellent job printing adobe indesign illustrator . copying faxing functions perform expected , although document feeder tried eat few slightly curled/crumpled originals . my only disappointment color scanning capability/quality . my brief admittedly less-than-thorough testing , color scans practically unusable-too high contrast blown out highlights no detail shadows . my test scan extremely noisy , mottled gradations , excessively saturated colors . i don't know whether scanner inherently poor quality or just hobbled very limited software offers far too few controls . i'm going look third-party software before completely writing off scanner . despite scanning flaws , price right i'm still happy i bought printer	1

this tv great . i it out box playing xbox 360 full 1080p no time . i love rotating stand it works great my place . i wanted leave review because these reviews helped me so much . i went best buy looked new model samsung next 40 " version this model . newer one slightly better picture , but me it not worth extra 800-1000 dollars . reason why because when i got this baby home fired it up i wanted nothing . i set picture settings my likings , which easy , i off races . only thing i would say could better , i don't even know if this really issue tv , but when i hooked up older gaming systems like nintendo nintendo 64 brightness adjusted see some games . this probably more because those consoles weren't made such tv , but they still worked fine once i made adjustments . i read all complaints sound i completely disagree . i love sound . matter fact i turn down often . way , you gamers , i some research found out xbox 360 fact play games full 1080p component or vga cables hooked up . microsoft released update last november added 1080p output , ( go ahead just google it or go microsoft website look resolution or cables section ) after you hook tv up console display settings 1080p option . therefore this tv great either ps3 or xbox 360 , games sure look gorgeous it . one other thing could've better tv remote . it very comfortable hand , but it reception pretty weak . i probably get all one remote someday . dvd look great it . sound output my reciever great . all functions what they should . buy this tv its steal . enjoy	1

type noticeably faster than type when taking pictures raw mode my fuji s6500 . it takes 7.9 seconds type but only 5.2 seconds type . makes type 1/3 faster write mode than type . i haven't tried timing it read mode ( downloading pictures camera computer ) , but i expect similar time advantage type . one thing may concern someone using it take movies little warning back shrink wrapped case says this chip may cause interruptions when recording movies 640 480 pixel mode . i don't recall seeing same warning my 1 gb type chip . other hand , i used 2gb type chip take uninterrupted movie no problem using up full 2 gigabytes one movie . but i not able download 2gb movie file my computer my camera . even when computer plenty free storage , downloading 2gb file repeatedly crashes computer . i not state certainty what culprit , whether it camera , type chip , or fuji finepix software . also instruction chip says it must initialized using intialization function your camera . i take this mean don't rely initialization function card reader compatible your camera initialization requirements . i suspect some data loss problems some folks reported these xd chips ( whether type or type ) could traced their not initialized chip properly . my 2 gb type chip made korea samsung . my 1 gb type chip made toshiba japan . both branded fuji	1

they say , " little bit knowledge goes long way ... " if you live or near big city , this scanner absolutely no good because large metropolitan police forces use trunk communication system due large number units work one time . these systems aren't actually scrambled , but due high volume calls , it would hard single scanner unit keep track them so while you might able hear one end converstaion , you won't necessarily able hear other . this unit perfect smaller cities which use frequencies betweem 153.0000 169.0000 their police communications . unit also good tracking airport traffic , you know now , nascar events . best thing when scanning new frequencies access code book your area so you'll know what you're listening time . if you're technologically-challenged any way , you're better off letting someone who knows what they're doing program basic channels you . i like fact that it lot smaller not heavy its predecesors . it conspicuous mobile phone lot easier carry your belt without it getting way	1

you probably reading reviews this product figure out whether it would good purchase decision . if you're like me , you've read reviews many similar portable cd players found just all them so many mixed reviews it almost impossible tell which ones truly better than rest . i fair honest possible this review . so i just made plunge bought this panasonic sl-sx480 ( blue ) cd player . truly , sound amazing . . sound alone makes this cd player worth purchase . bass boost system here four settings : off , s/xbs , s/xbs+ , train . i found train pretty worthless . s/xbs delivers sound comparable any standard sony walkman out there , s/sbx+ turns your standars earphones into simulated 4-speaker surround system ! amazing ! sounds like quality i receive my home car stereo systems . it this amazing sound makes next part my review all more difficult write ..... anti-skip feature poor best . " no skip " gross exaggeration . i use this cd player while work , i noticed within first hour use my cds skipping once every other song or so . this even discs brand new no scratches . puzzled , i referred my user manual checked make sure 45-second anti-skip turned . it . i went full 8 hour shift these clicks , pops , skips frequently occuring , irritating me more each time . finally , i decided just take it back . i replaced it sony d-ej010 ( white ) . took one home put cd it , only find sony idea " dynamic bass " utterly pales comparison . sound . i felt like i listening cassette , tones bass so poorly represented . so i took sony back bought new sl-sx480 , hoping skipping , clicking , popping my previous one suffered just glitch particular player , not problem model itself . so i just brought my new one home , put cd i just bought week ago ( no scratches ) . it skipped . you judge . buyer beware however . what you gain incredible sound , you sacrifice playability your discs . ready some skips . should this problem continue , i'll just go back phillips , which not let me down yet . also , cd player itself very light thin , i not dropped it yet but i cannot imagine it would very resistant hard use	1
there no instructions mentioned before but my biggest complaint card would not fit into slot back computer . usb ports firewire ports made wider than any standard pci card should . order get it work i squeeze metal top bottom each port down until it would fit into slot . very frustrating just wrong , looking other reviews though , maybe i just got fluke card . usb 2.0 ports work fine once installed i haven't chance try out firewire ones	-1

i've my th-37px60u couple weeks now . i bought it because i read many enthusiastic reviews very few negative reviews , particular consumer reports [ ... ] rated its 42 " brother highly . i needed panel would fit my cabinet . i originally planning buy lcd , but when i stores , i impressed colors panasonic plasmas . i recall seeing cooking show , someone doing barbeque outside , flesh tones so forth clearly better than neighboring lcds . plus , best lcd panels cost more than this panel . now i this my house , i confirm when i am watching decent hd show , picture really terrific . rich , warm colors , nice blacks make image seem almost three-dimensional . my local pbs station shows three hours hd programming every night , many these absolutely beautiful my tv . this signal right off air . tv native resolution 1024 720 , bit less than typical lcd panels ( but same 42 " plasma tvs ) , but images my tv plenty sharp , i doubt i would see much more 1080p . but i some regrets . first , you careful aspect ratios such when watching 4:3 material , or movies 2.4 : 1 format , because you don't want view things sidebars or letterboxes because risk burn-in . ( particularly " break-in " period 100 hours . ) so you find yourself switching modes lot non-hd sources . i've learned you zoom things bit get rid letterbars wide screen movies , it nice " just " mode stretches 4:3 material way lessens distortion center image . ( zoom adjustable , very handy . ) if you wish avoid this , watch things without any distortion or croppinig , you might happier lcd . second regret my progressive scan , component output dvd player very disappointing this tv . colors look lousy . i tried replacing dvd player one upconverts hdmi output , which didn't seem improve things much . i am not sure if this inherent tv or just i got lousy player ( or if there settings i wrong player or tv ) . if you large dvd collection you might need consider this . my last regret plasmas something called " edge-flicker " . if you look bright objects against dark backgrounds , you move your eyes , you might see flicker ( hint dull yellow or other color ) . panasonic support web site says this normal . this isn't bad " rainbow sparkle " dlp televisions ( which i see loud clear ) . i suspect few people notice it or care it ( i reason believe i am more sensitive flicker than most people ) . if you sensitive flicker , perhaps lcd would better .	1

this ( 60 gb ipod photo ) my second ipod ( first , g4 40gb pickpocketed my napsack nyc subway - beware ) i've it over year . looking over spate recent negative reviews here prompted me respond . most shrieking pans drooling raves divorced reality . i think it important point out ipod tool only tool - portable music player - compact digital device much common laptop computer . it highly configurable user many choices how encode music - which affects final results great deal . 1 ) scratching . front ipod shiny plastic . you'll need put it protective case . there extremely lively aftermarket . i bought nice silicon case compliant plastic panel covers display $12 ebay . it trick year later my ipod looks like new if i take it out case . protective case must considered manditory ipod . that it - now get over it . 2 ) all hard drive based devices any kind - ipods included - limited g-force tolerance . if you jog , it go into protection - ( music stops unit appears paused until you hit " play " again ) . if you drop it while it running , you might kill it - or cause disk damage require reformat . if you want player jogging or sporting ( skiing , skateboarding etc ... ) buy nano or shuffle or competing solid state player . memory chips no moving parts don't suffer these limitations . they just size limitation . 3 ) all electronic devices subject rf interference - especially digital devices . ipod nice metal body shield , but it crash when taken near power lines , radio transmitters etc ... 4 ) sonically all mp3 players vary quality based how much encryption you choose use . best sound use high bit rate ( 192k or above ) . apple offers proprietary schemes offer higher performance . competing open standards exist just every format apple cooked up . this skeevy apple ? perhaps . it similar what microsoft computers . love it or hate it - it part whole apple experience . i use apple lossless compression it works seamlessly itunes yields wonderful high quality rips . they portable any other deivce than ipod ? no . they work any software other than itunes ? no . am i complaining ? not yet ! i personally think itunes software best software ipod best player . down road if proprietary format limits me doing something i want i might start complaining . life full compromises choices . 5 ) you must turn off equalization if you care sound quality . sadly this true every portable digital player currently extant world . i expecting better apple - but it not so . every single equalization setting introduces audible distortion ruins experience audiophile like me . eq set off i get wonderful sound . 6 ) reliability dealing broken players - portable electronics take lot abuse . laptops shorter warranty periods than desktops because rapidly spinning hard drives don't tolerate motion well . this exactly situation ipod . it tough environment hard drive . there lively after-market hard drive replacement services . ambitious folks buy cheap replacement hard drives open market fix/upgrade their ipods . sure you'll scratch case getting it open - but it better than dead ipod . battery life issues - same situation . if you like tinker you this little cost . if you paying service it becomes more justifiable just buy new unit . this cost effective ? nope . but if you become addicted wonderfuly lifestyle one these players - you'll it . 7 ) audible distortion photo ipod becasue video jack ? maybe early units . i one don't any audible distortion when eq off . this unit sounds noticeably better than my 40gb g4 ipod . it better battery life too . 8 ) what music services ? it totally personal opinion - but i don't recommend buying music itunes or any other service . they all pretty much use relatively severe mp3 compression . buy cds get full resolution . then rip your choice compression . way you full backup you get all music you pay . i also feel music appreciation sometimes takes time . there many songs albums i didn't initally like , but grew love over time simply because i them because they album some more accessible hit . if we only buy hits - we never get know more difficult songs we end up shallower . i'll confess i'm dyed wool audiophile - kind who hangs sonex his walls puts specially made sound reflecting pillows his ceiling . i'm also , like lot audiophiles , opposed digital equipment general prefer warmer fuller sound analog sources ( like my very tricked out turntable ) . said - system shows you most one you use most often - me portable . years i high-end cassette tape walkmen , then portable cd players various stripes . ipod completely blows away all previous portables wide margin . ipod sounds way better than most stand-alone cd players - sonics comparable really good dvd player playing cds . this killer sounding portable when used lossless compression , etymotic er-6 headphones . it better resolution than my big rig ( rocksan xerxes turntable , audio research pre amp , proac repsonse speakers ) . granted this digital - so highs more brittle there less warmth depth . this highly dependent source material . recent recordings good engineers sound great - through headphones or played stereo system good cord via line out cradle . i get around 1500 songs - 135 albums worth my 60gb . ipod high enough sonically it function my test source critical listening back-end components or sharing music audiophile friends their house ( their big rigs ) . this " library " aspect biggest feature ipod - really life changing . i can't recommend it highly enough . my main complaint ipod headphones . included headphones not adequate musically satisfying listening . i recommend grado or etymotic headphones ( even bottom line ones ) . you don't need separate headphone amp - unless you source material unusually low volume . " earbud " type phones all garbage - avoid them like plague . other than - i'm really happy camper ipod	1
i agree case hard remove . like guy below , i panic because i could not open it again . but after i got it open it easier open after . so i suggest opening closing it few times before putting nano . nano fits snuggly case . dust still get inside so you might want open cleaning once while . case get tiny swirls minor scratch 3 weeks i've my nano . that what case so i'm happy its performance . so far , i haven't notice any scratches my nano caused case . this case also better than one sold agent 18 . this case crystal clear while agent 18 blurry/fuzzy quality . basically , countour design see through , agent 18 somewhat see through .. so this crystal clear case goes perfect my black nano . great thing this case you use earbud cord wrap around " hook " case allow you wear nano around your neck . i'm suprise how well earbud audio jack stays while you're wearing it . " hook " doesn't really work well my sony earbuds . apple earbud thick cord better . i haven't really used belt clip but it seems decent enough quality it hanging off your pants/belt . i would totally recommend this case . it its job keep nano protected . i haven't dropped it so i don't know if it pop open , but bunch reviews stated , it bit challenging pry open ;) so just remember open close it several times loosen it up . after this case work flawless	1

i am absolutely pleased this cameras ability . i security technician over 6 years now install cameras well security systems , access control , networks , phone systems , ect . i'm not saying i know it all but i seen lot things hold very good understanding camera . 0.05 low lux excellent . this not meant night time camera . it designed operate very low light such parking lot streat lights . camera 704x576 resolution while still recording 10kb/s . most camera installed business companies only 400x300 or somewhere around range . others mentioned this camera freezing reviews i read , but not once since i bought this camera over month ago it froze . it took me minutes set up dcs-6620g my wireless network i not droped connection since day one . yes there camera out there cost more , but why spend money few extra features you " may " not need . i would seriously consider looking over this cameras abilities before marking it off your list possible choices . far technical support goes i can't verify either way . i small question one features they answered phone desirable period time ( tech support ) able help me . although , person sound bit busy if i just call . excellent buy , i know it bit pricey but i believe it worth it . just think it could worse , some wireless cameras go $1500+ .	1

this great wall mount shelf . there aren't lot 30 lb shelf mount speakers out there . i klipsch rs-62s weigh 26 lbs each , shelves accomodate them . down side one shelves sent screws no thread ! also you install thise into stud , period ! when you initially drill , make sure you find wood shavings drill bit comes out . when you install drill other holes , make sure you measure ground top wall plate assure speakers same height . also , make sure before you your drilling deep , level plate using level you buy any hardware store , so your speakers don't tilt one direction or other . make sure top side top put plastic cover before you attach glass , glass faced so rounded edge front ! good luck	1

i skeptical buying these speakers . after all , i replacing 25 year old 27x18-54lbs speakers . i impressed sound . we placed them 35x45 foot bulding ; 15ft ceilings . three quarter volume , they fill room clear , undistorted sound . they definatley worth every penny . i seen speakers cost more money don't sound good . good feature they indoor-outdoor speakers which good me because they unheated building . i would buy these again without hesitation	1

i ordered pepper pad 3 am process returning it . device great hardware point view . processor snappy , screen nice clear , navigation great . wonderful sitting around surfing net chatting . unfortunately underwelming software makes all tedious . surfing page all sudden either wireless driver crash or browser stop functioning properly . many software issues addressed 3.1 upgrade but trouble installing it no backup disks unable restore functioning version software . very cool hardware - not many umpc usable keyboard screen - part great . unfortunately tied pepper software there issues . if standard distribution linux implemented device would more functional . any attempts install other applications " user friendly " sort way futile . thunderbird no menu . firefox no menus . etc ..... built-in applications only option some those rudimentary best . talk example only supports aim poor job . if everything you plan doing web-based you're okay long none software bugs bite you . remote control some basic templates devices but if you any one off devices ( cheaper receivers/dvd players etc ) you'll spend time teaching it device your original remote - if you get work - never get remote learn my lg dvd/receiver . overall hardware good stuff - if someone gets linux distro working touchscreen keyboard would well worth it . but current state software i'd look elsewhere	-1

first all ... if you issue where you cannot change any items menu ... this : remote , hit " menu " button then press down arrow until you see " picture , " then hit enter , now hit down arrow until you see " mode " hit enter again . you should then see " power up " displayed . hit enter again get setting choices where you change mode back " home " if you showroom ... tv cannot changed any manner . i found tv actually higher standards than most reviews stated . clarity exceptional , it even picks up 13 hd stations via my antenna ; my last tv picked up only 6 . most hdtv standard definition analog signals not look well they " old " sets . however , olevia nice option where you take out some choppiness blocking setting . i would definitely recommend tv . i got it $749 would not take it back $800	1
somehow , i really really like this mp3 player . i like sony audio general they great job this one too . i no problems their software or hardware . it works even my 10 year old computer usb 1.1 . such small thing , this thing nice display screen , which makes it easy browse songs . fm great , it doubles thumb drive . it got sports timer , equalizer so many features . i considering ipod shuffle first , but didn't like fact it don't screen . headphones great i easily hookup my home pc speakers great sound ! only negative thing i see usb cap provided this player isn't attached player body it easy lose , but that not really problem , just got little careful . i'm surprised why some people written ' user-unfriendliness ' this player . i able pretty much everything it , i haven't read manual ( nor probably ;-)) . much better buy over ipod shuffle	1

archos 504 everything i hoped it would . it necessary order adapter kit tape tv shows , but ease use picture quality great . sound good , but could little louder	1
i decided go this receiver instead tx-sr674 which exactly same this except added benefit up-conversion hdmi $200 more . i am not disappointed . this receiver very user friendly . it supports speakers 6 ohm impedance which many receivers not openly support . if you buying new speaker system , it should not matter . set up very easy . plenty inputs ! on-screen set up display very useful . remote control can't operate my viewsonic tv , though . sound sharp crisp . it prologiciix which plus .	1
price this great projector . colors excellent , brightness pretty good . picture better than you see movie theater , but it not quite good my 55 " hd tv . if you looking picture size though good quality picture this work well	1
forerunner 101 extremely accurate fun use . verified it several times . advantages low cost , buy your own rechargeable batteries don't worry lithiums or replacements . purchase inexpensive heart monitor if you want save all added expense getting combination unit . if heart rate monitor/belt goes bad you replace it cheaper . overall cost lower , basics there , batteries easily replaced , keeps good records . little more effort but not inconvenient . prefer it more expensive models .	1
i've this phone over month now , it works great . no problem interference or anything else . i think it great phone	1
my opinion , i think this pedal rulz ! it awesome soundand it really easy 2 use . even though it not include power source , i just picked up 9v @ dollar general dollar . 5 stars , easy .	1
overall this excellent portable , introductory 61-key keyboard . some things i like : 1 ) all buttons easy use . my #1 criteria . most keyboards , i think , hard figure out , but this one pretty intuitive . it easy change instruments , songs , etc . you not want lose instruction book though . there just few things i use rarely i need pull out instruction book remember . 2 ) split keyboard -- you play one instrument , like base or cello , left hand , instrument like piano , right hand , touch just few buttons . 3 ) built-in metronome learning . there also built-in lesson plan , but haven't really used it . 4 ) many instruments really good , especially horns organ sounds . 5 ) auto chord-fill . don't know how fill chord ? no problem . just hit any one or two keys left hand , keyboard fills rest chord you . some things i don't like : 1 ) " realistic " grand piano sound not particularly realistic . 2 ) volume very low , even plugged . i turn sound up 75% maximum get sound acoustic piano playing mezzoforte ( mf ) . surprised me given how large speakers . 3 ) piano not come any essential addons . not even power cord !! no midi cord . no sustain pedal . all these essential addons cost bucks . power cord $16 . add midi sustain ($40 $20 ) , you now add almost 50% price this keyboard . oh , don't forget stand , that not included either !	1
money you can't beat it . four kids i go through batteries case often issues generic brands . these batteries better than other generics i tried discount name brands . recommended	1
its level i think this processor just amazing ... eventhough your pc using over 50% it capacity , it still run other application any problem ... its really fast i recommed get better cooling fan than one it comes better performance ..	1
ok , so i've only this player 1 day . still , it exactly what i hoping it would . it plays all my " trouble " cds like home-made cd-rs some scratches . i love snap holds cover down . i love all buttons big directly front cover - very easy use . i went walk this sholder bag it never skipped . it auto-resume feature where if you listening cd then turn off unit ... when you turn it back it starts where you left off . entire unit feels very solid , like it won't break . i also like clean styling , no crazy designs , just good player . ~ user manual could little clearer , but little playing around everything makes sence . ~ one example it doesn't " stop " button when playing cds . you press " radio off " button . easy enough figure out , but it doesn't say manual . overall , great product . i'm very happy it .	1
i purchased this work my dv-camera some amature projects . i found sound quality some amature videos . i surprised great sound quality ended up using it some professional projects well . batter life also pretty impressive . i not think i changed out batteries over 20 hours use	1

mount works well . i read elsewhere people added velcro make mount more secure . i find if you make sure little plastic tab mount snaps into small hole gps , usually audible click , mount very secure . however , i must admit , i don't roughest biking ( jumping over logs etc . ) . i would given it five stars , but little trouble trying rotate handle bars . i kept tighten it up . seems firm now however .	1
great backpack if you're worried protection . it even fits my monstrous 10 pounder laptop too . problem i it it actually little bigger than i thought it going . part reason this i believe because it stiff ridge around it which protects laptop minor bumps , but it makes bag kindof wide . also despite it medium/large-ish appearance , it really cannot hold much extra if my laptop , charger , mouse there already ( given my charger size brick ) . it really won't hold much more than 1 inch binder all my other stuff . still , it nice bag if you don't need carry 50 lbs books , or whathaveyou	1
turntable works very well . it just right size , rotates very smoothly	1
i purchased this speaker system because i wanted something small unobtrusive . it more than met my expectations	1

this my first home theater system . up until now , i using old kenwood two channel stereo two stereo speakers my old 27 " tv . i am no means home theater guru . we purchased this system go large screen lcd , it all-inclusive , i good experiences sony . all all , i would highly recommend this system , especially those looking easy answer home theater . i used hdmi cable run tv , only cable i buy . sound excellent ( my tastes , anyway ) , bass all i care my 20x20 living room . movies such x-men 3 come across exceptional channel separation . there may systems sound better , but money , this system awesome . now downsides : 1 . cables supplied 22 gauge use proprietary connections unit . it too much pain cut splice , so i ran them as-is speakers . sound still good ( loud i need , children home ) , but true audiophile needs prepared perform some cable surgery . 2 . my cox cable supplied remote not control receiver ( power volume all i needed) ! none codes i tried work , so i am left using two remotes power up all my devices . this may not sony fault , but it still sux . 3 . rear speakers not come angle mounts , but walmart cheap set $8 . they worked fine mounting rear speakers near ceiling . all speakers mounted flat wall , but if you wish mount front speakers wall angle ( instance , if you your tv corner ) , you make or buy some angled brackets . i ended up using miter saw fabricate some 45� brackets 1x3 " wood my walls . overall , highly recommended unit . some minor tweaking , this 5 start system . i not regret my purchase .	1
i primarily purchased this dvdrw drive edit/burn video taken my canon mini-dvd recorder . installation simple , i just swapped out my old hp cd/rw drive used included disc install nero dvd-playback software . drive tray action solid , overall construction seems good ( no lite-on this ! ) . read/write noise levels moderate , par other cd dvd drives i've used . discs recorded my canon using -vr mode immediately readable/editable , using included nero software allowed quick video importing , editing , writing full size dvd disc . i can't rate this drive long-term reliability , but since hp cd/rw drive it replaced lasted since 2002 , i'm sure this one go distance well	1

razer copperhead very nice mouse . it laser , 2000 dpi ( which makes moving long distances quick , easy , accurate)it looks pretty cool too , it razer logo throbs , but we all know nothing functionality . this mouse functions exceptionally well , it built ic allow you change settings mouse without any drivers computer 5 custom made settings . this very helpful lans where you don #8217 ; use your computer , or if you lazy just don #8217 ; want install razer drivers . this mouse also should make people who didn't like boomslangs #8217 ; shape happy this shaped more like traditional mouse . thumb buttons very well placed feel very natural press . there two buttons opposing side mouse aren't quite so easy press , but these made lefty not really your pinky . so when all said you 5 easily accessible buttons plus scroll wheel 2 extra buttons if you good figure way work them . bottom line : this gamer dream mousethis photoshop users dream mousethis lazy modder favorite mouse ( pre modded )	1

maybe i am only one who this problem , but we bought this backup our disc jockey service it extremely unreliable , if it works all . problem connections -- we use two video ipods occasionally ipod mini . even provided adapters supposed push slimmer ipods forward engage controls , none them connect properly . i put pieces folded paper behind adapters push them forward more , course , not make stable system when you trying play customer . controls often unusable because ipod not properly engaged or music just stops playing . video ipod also sometimes just pops out plug , again , causing music stop mid-song . i realize this not top dollar mixer never meant used professionally , but shouldn't it least play most time reliably ? i wouldn't recommend this anyone . it waste money	-1
i bought this card my tj25 , supposedly supported device . but problems this card make it nearly useless : - it comes web browser doesn't work . - even if browser work , it would only work 30 days before you buy full version . - only downloadable browser works card eudora , which doesn't anything except display text ( you can't even fill web forms it , so webmail , searches , etc . impossible ) . - card designed work netfront clie mail , software comes internet-enabled clie devices ... obviously not what you would if you buying card . these programs not available separately . - card wouldn't connect either my wireless network or neighbors ' , even though my powerbook no trouble connecting either , no additional configuration required . - while attempting connect , card would often stop responding , then lock up handheld . bottom line : if you want web-enabled pda , buy web-enabled pda . don't buy this	-1

once again i'm amazed how reviews so highly favor this product . these terribly uncomfortable ( my ears ) don't really provide great listening experience . frequency response seems muted until you use largest possible " surrounds " , then they become distractingly uncomfortable . but course , this just my experience , your mileage may vary , they say . personally , i found my apple ipod ' phones better	1

just received radio yesterday , am returning radio today ! pluses .... adequate lcd display good illumination while ac adapter . good thumbwheel tuning 1 khz increments . adequate speaker fidelity small radio . however , volume slew buttons set " numbered " volume levels , settings 5-6 , there big noticeable increase volume(not good ) , while tuning shortwave bands , every approx 100khz increment , there appears " null " area , where signal meter reads signal received , but quiet speaker . also , fm , if hands near radio , signal breaks up(for weaker signals , not strong ones ) , compared my grundig 400-pe , which i feel sensitivity not good hiss bothersome , eton e-5 seems worse still !!! i am returning this today , obtaining sony 7600gr instead . eton e-5 , not bad , but certainly not worth 3 stars or above , especially , if comparing it similar size radio , then comparing it my sony 2010 .	1

" change sensitivity " button strange spot ( least if u large hands ) located center mouse where you need reach far back almost touch pad your palm finger you're reaching - not efficient movement , therefore not applicable games ( you assign sensitivity script perhaps one side mouse buttons if necessary ) . these only minor itches when compared outstanding precision i would highly recommend it	1

i wanted simple printer so i could print few prints time time hand out . sale $50 , this seemed like right one . i already included zoombrowser photo stitch software installed my prior purchase canon a95 camera , so i just needed install driver . note this requires usb cable ( not included ) printer . human nature , i tried print without reading zoombrowser instructions , got lovely plain sky-blue print words " my album " it - but no photo :-) then , out came stunning second print which totally blank but some faint horizontal lines - this residual click my first attempt . ok , ok , so i looked pdf printing guide 15 seconds , followed instructions . got beautiful first print queen mary ship . got gorgeous second print flags ( red/white/blue , green ) againt clear blue sky , third print very nice field flowers near mt lassen ( ironically original proof print this 20 years ago scanned onto my computer just today get rid paper prints ... ) so , i've blown through provided " trial " 5 sheets paper film cartridge , 3 very nice prints ( postcard address lines , stamp area canon logo back - paper comes way . ) ends paper remain white but perforations 1/2 inch end so you remove them after printing . i can't compare printing software any other brand , but setting up plain phot o-o nly print takes 10 seconds menu choices . if you want add backgounds , titles/text , etc , available well . ( got pack paper/film , put humorous captions kind funny-bad office christmas pix ... ) printing directly my a95 takes same time computer - 1 min 45 sec . actual operation involves paper passed out printer 4 times ( 3 color passes protective layer ) so it important back printer not obstructed , particularly power cord which hangs down near edge slot . finished print deposited top paper cassette front . unit looks feels substantial its small size , comes well packed ( survived ny ca shipping ) , decent documentation , 1-year warranty .	1

i gave my son garmin 60c christmas last year . tinkered it couple days before handing it over . it worked well . course i wanted one myself , but cash cash , so i've putting it off . ( side note - i wanted borrow it trip this past spring , when they went get it , it stolen their car map-pocket . it seems these high-theft items ; keep'em short leash . ) my wife hadn't gotten me any " big " christmas gift , so i told her i knew what i wanted , started shopping . i debated explorist 500 600 . chose 600 , its altimeter thermometer . probably could lived without them , but hey , it christmas ! it came yesterday , so i charged it bit , then it no trouble finding 4 satellites under my deciduous tree cover . i go out street garmin find satellites . took it out spin today . spot-on navigation i ran errands . it tracked back almost exact spot i marked home , though it me driving down wrong side street portion my route duplicate - so it off few feet . ( maybe it still thinks it britain ? )now - why only 4 stars ? 1 ) usb connector attach unit either way . there no instructions anywhere say which way it should go . i called 800 # spoke someone ( new delhi ) who heard this lot . she told me what , pc immediately recognized gps file system - removable disk drive , advertised . i really find their website information near-zero . something elementary this should covered website after 3rd call , eh ? 2 ) i bought mapsend 3d topo software . i am interested elevations . it detailed street maps . but - they're not routable ! if you want routable streets ( where unit route you streets not just crow flight direct path ) following car , then either you get both map products , or choose . it rather frustrating . sales information provided amazon magellan sites not make this critical lack very clear . it tells you what you , but not what you can't there no product comparison see what differences . mapsend topo box , it says very clearly , " navteq roads streets data - like found most expensive car navigation systems ( non-routable ) " . er , excuse me , then it not quite like found expensive car systems , it ? i concur other reviewers who find software selection verbiage ( amazon magellan ) more obfuscating than informative . why can't someone create simple comparison chart all various map packages	1

when i got my hands pmc-120 i thought this going best player but when i started play it all glitches started come into my way . i agree other reviews it first generation-device feel it . music : when i tried put music my pmc it syncronized my mp3s wmp 10 no problem ( very fast ) . if u looking grab drop ( copy/paste ) your music mp3 device , this not you because when i it got everything one same folder read " unknown artist album " . so you put all your mp3s via wmp 10 , wich no problem me because it it very fast . problems i encountered it only one " portable playlist " sometimes when im playing mp3 navegating through other albums controls respond 1 2 seconds later after pushing button . one cool thing it shows cd covers without put them . this via wmp10 . sound very good crisp , equalizer setups fair . but you defenetly cant tell difference diffrent eq setups built speacker wich very small horrible sound . pictures : this basically grab drop procedure get your pics device you arrenge them folders or subfolders . you not transfer directly your camera so if you travelling dont pc transfer your pics this little baby wont job you . video : ok , now this where it starts get frustrating me ... i wanted portable media device i would only grab drop my movies divx xvid . i knew this device only reads wmv but it " supports " divx , xvid , mpeg , etc . this " support " deppends what wmp10 play . so this means you sincronyze ( via wmp10 ) your movies no matter format it converts them into wmp movies same time it just transferes it fits it into your pmc secreen size . i this mind when i bought it fine me untill i tried it first time : wmp10 wouldnt convert my xvid movies after few hours trial error surfing web my problem i correct video codecs compatibles wmp10 . so after uninstalling installing i good go so i converted 1:45 hr long movie only 25 minutes . but this short moment joy suddenly interrupted fact wmp10 fits widescreen movies into pmc makes all images long thin almost unwatchable !!!! you cant change this because wmp this automatically . my answer using other software converting my widescreen movies into wmv files . problem it takes almost running time movies convert ... i tried lot different softwares still havent found one it faster wmp10 . other hand if you full screen video you just use wmp10 it it very fast good quality . you connect your device tv but resolution very low so i think this option useless pmc . so veredict : pmc-120 good multimedia player minor glitches . it little bulky but personally i think size not big . i think good side size issue comes its big 3.6 inch screen wich great watch films this me kicks arse compared ipod video . if you want play directly your divx or xvid movies your player buy porduct like iriver pmp series or archos players wich way , way , way more expensive . so i think price what it pmc-120 gets two thumbs up .	1
very good player very reasonable price .	1

when i paid somewhere $20-$30 couple months ago optifix pro kit , i made wrongful assumption high price tag would entail good craftsmanship contrast some cheaper radial cleaners i've owned before . package description made it seem promising enough i've mostly good experiences memorex past , so i just put it test immediately after taking product home . after reading instruction guide carefully before use , i'm positive product used properly , but unfortunately , optifix pro just couldn't deliver goods . fact , not only could it nothing restore any discs i inserted , it worsened scratches it supposed repair ! what more frustrating - two discs it served further damage out print therefore irreplacable . i hope fellow cd collectors sympathize my message steer clear this particular memorex product	-1
appearances description , this appears identical my sddr-92 ( no a15 ) except shape button . this sandisk excellent unit - compact reasonably slim , detachable usb cord . it perfect carrying pocket your laptop case ( unlike my dazzle which fine desk top , but awkwardly shaped compact storage ) . unit reliable fast , , unlike 8-in-1 or 12-in-1 units which use up four hard-drive letters , this unit only uses one hard-drive letter . it supports reading , writing , deleting , etc ., works either usb 2.0 or usb 1.1 . if you not care button software , this unit installs plug-n-play , without needing driver cd ( least win 2000 xp ) . it simply appears removable hard-drive letter explorer . i not install button software because i am not fan extra transfer mechanisms photo organizers my computer . i would rather full , manual control how when things happen , where files put . i think this 5-star unit , but i downgrade my own unit 4 1/2 stars because its overzealous packaging arrogant installation instructions . both instructions , sticky label unit ( which i still not able fully remove ) , it proclaims you must install button software before connecting unit . i ignored warning , unit worked fine without any installation needed . one important requirements card reader portability . since not everyone takes kindly your installing software their computer , card must able work just plugging it into usb port . sandisk sddr-92 meets this requirement , although it proclaims not . this good choice compactflash reader/writer .	1

i 512 simpletech card , loved it . i got this 1gb card week ago it worked great . 512 card used very heavily nearly 2 years , so i purchased simpletech again . card maxs out meter which suggests how many pictures i remaining take , unless it highest setting . it says i fit roughly 950 pictures this 3.0 mp camera highest settings , but i not able take many yet ! batteries only last 300 pictures , so i probably don't need card this big . it nice videos though , it hold 15-20 minutes video 640x480 15fps . it also seems write very quickly . much quicker than my lexar card . most users , i would suggest 2x512 cards rather than 1x1gb . don't keep all your eggs 1 basket	1

power ups ! everything you need know . first all why you want power ups ? there some very good reasons . ( 1 ) you never want your machine go down incorrectly because blackout . ( 2 ) you want work clean power only . ( 3 ) you want monitor your pc power . ( 4 ) you want prevent your pc damaged due power problem like lighting strike want surge protection . first rule ups never trust insurance claim . get your pc insured elsewhere . these companies tendency not support their insurance claims . i pc running some very high specifications over six usb devices , lcd monitor , printer ethernet equipment , everything same time . i never gone above 325w usage average 250w 300w when managing high spec game doing lots background tasks . even though i 400w power supply unit ( psu ) i upgrading 500w psu because it better quality model . way i monitor how many watts i use ups software hardware . so question you need ask how many watts you using . short answer this you don't know until you install ups software tells you how many watts you use because appears only way you monitor your wattage this time . you need estimate what it . i would say high-end domestic pc ( not server ) would use 300w max if it one every device you think off turned . soon we add things like pc , or several printers , or several monitors , then we start overload 325w ups . this brings us first thing we need learn any ups - overloading balancing . overload feature warning system turns when you overloaded ups capacity . overloading two things . it theory eventually damage ups it voids warranty . most ups 325w but there 800w - 1000w even greater models out there home networks use more than one pc setup but honest you probably going get ups per pc setup rather than expensive bigger ups network . so check ups rating . what ups you choose depends how much you want load it . next thing you need check ups if it comes usb connection . if it this big plus because it means you control it your pc ups comes software . now if ups this feature then you loads stuff like turning off ups sound alarms , controlling how your ups handles blackout , how long it uses battery before shutdown or hibernation , if it sounds alarm or not , if it run self tests , data collection monitoring , notifications sensitivity settings . if ups not come usb connection software then you probably should looking ups designed computer use rather than ups non-computer equipment . most ups led indicators tell you status unit . next thing understand testing your ups not breaking it out box , connecting it mains , plugging your pc then turning off house power circuit breaker . you must charge ups first ! so read instructions . usually you must attach battery ups ( plug it firmly ! ) wait before using it . then perform test using software first ! then you consider trying simulate blackout your home see if pc stays up . usually ups programmed shutdown your pc if blackout lasts few seconds . nearly all ups models usb connection customized shutdown event or how long pc should hold ups battery . most ups devices allow you connect modem phone line into device then run phone line into your modem . this important because power surges ups not this protection damage pc through unprotected phone line running into modem usually runs pc somehow . this nasty problem degree security ups provide . if it doesn't this function then it not going provide 100% surge protection pc on-line . networking ups pc pc without ups also increase risk surge protection problems . it not recommend you network ups pc non-ups pc unless surge protection warranty not issue . one last thing some ups input regions ups surge protection other input regions not surge protected . also some models batteries need replaced after few years if you end up using them lot . this everything you need know ups before you choose one . it basically now downloading technical specs ups making sure it provides you what you need . two top brands apc belkin	1
you may well pitch instructions because they're worthless ( only reason i'm not giving 5-star rating ads tech video xpress ) . i ready pitch product well , after losing two evenings trying figure out how get it work . ultimately , i gave up relying solely program it came , i instead opted try it my windows movie maker . yahoo ! perseverance paid off ! once i switched movie maker , this tool worked great ! date , i've converted dozen videos content computer files i able burn dvds . i just leave my xpress hooked up back my television so i don't try remember later how hook it up again . doing , i connect my laptop xpress start video converting process within 3-4 minutes . my movie maker program takes over entire process . ads tech video xpress especially useful me because i teach college telecourse often show edited video clips my students . before purchasing xpress , i crudely edited videos i reluctant use ; my videos lots amateur stop/start points . using movie maker xpress , i able download these videos my laptop , then easily edit them so transitions stop start points became smooth seamless . pretty cool . i'm glad i took chance this product ! below hook-up program instructions i've written myself easy reference later . hopefully they'll more help you than instructions come this product : first , hook up video xpress equipment follows : 1 . s-cable ( buy one , since it doesn't come videoxpress ) goes back your television videoxpress . 2 . use red/white/yellow cords running into back vcr/dvd hooked up your televion follows : - all three plug into " video out " column- all three plug into videoxpress tool other end . 3 . usb plug videoxpress tool plugs into back computer . next , open instant video xpress program verify settings follows : - " ntsc " video standard setting- " 640 480 " " 60 fps ( vga ) " video format- " dvd , vcr , tv " video source- " video composite " video inputunder program advanced settings : - low motion ( tv , vcd , dvd)- cpu support : " sse3 " - stereo system : " mts " - video decoder : " video standard : ntsc_m " under properties within program advanced settings : - stream format : video format : " ntsc_m " - frame rate : " 59.940 " - color space/compression : " yuy2 " - outputs size : " 640x480 " finally , close instant video xpress program .

i've using this system couple months now couldn't happier it . i bought it my office so i could listen my classical cds while i working my website writing book reviews . plus , even though it only short external antenna , i get npr classical music station fm which over hundred miles away . it small enough fit my bookshelf great sound size its speakers . course , it doesn't compare my big stereo living room its 4 ' high tower speakers , but who cares . it delivers most sound i need small space background music . all all , well worth money so far . highly recommended this point	1
i certainly wish it smaller , but i guess that'd hard manage while retaining feel normal keypad . unit works well adds some features would probably handy spreadsheet work , like enter backspace keys	1

good thing first , efficient battery , convenient compact .. doubles up flash drive no cables except headphone carry around charge . thats it . most other reviewers said this product absolutely useless because low iq software people working sony . utterly non user friendly . i develop software living i am not afraid use new software ... even though i able use software main drawbacks over smartness software where it tries control music piracy .. i 1gb atrac songs this player my computer . then one day my computer hdd crashed . i kind thankful i saved atleast 1 gb music this bean walkman . atleast all hours i spent transfering not go waste . soon i fixed new hdd tried transfer songs back my computer .. useless sony softwre not take music files back ... i tried every trick even sony customer support could not help me ( very indifferent group people ) . it rotten piece software makes this efficient device waste money . course transfering files this player entirely diff story i dont want go abt .. it absolutely infuriating	-1

i this exact iriver when i loaned it out , it got lost . so he offered replace it even " better " mp3 player would show photos , etc . i asked exact replacement because i love everything this mp3 player , it fits my needs perfectly . features i love it both voice radio record you also record your stereo or cassette or whatever audio source using line-in feature . it tons space more than i've ever used , small size sound quality great ! i seen some people write they didn't like buttons or problems turning it off accidentally , but i personally never problem , long i slide hold button over lock position . i like it gives cord hang it around my neck , or put it my arm .. however i rarely use armband . only reason i gave 4 stars instead 5 because you cannot view photos it , even tho you store transfer them . i personally don't need feature , but others may prefer it . i love my iriver	1

after reading some previous reviews , i wanted state this player definitely plays back multichannel dvd-audio discs . if you're only hearing sound out 2 speakers , then there must setting you need change setup menu . also , i've burned many dvd-r various dvd burners ( not panasonic branded ) they've all played back flawlessly this panasonic dvd-f87s player . haven't any problems this player i've owned it 18 months now .	1
it worked . all labels side power supply just fell off . kind looked cheap , but it job	1
i've read other reviews this product people complaining losing their data when batteries changed . this not true if you're carefull . first all , my ebookman came bright blue warning flier stating your ebookman needs turned off when you change batteries . pretty simple , huh ? also , don't wait your battery completely die before you change it . main menu screen battery meter bottom right hand corner , i just switch out batteries when meter reaches 10% . i primarily use my ebookman read ebooks i love it	1
i work small business we can't afford risks data theft . this unit put my mind ease , especially since i work very sensitive data . if you love gadgets , this extremely cool product . its sleek within seconds destroys your data . its very compact heavy duty , so its durable easily fit home office , well any place work . you just insert disc within seconds thousand tiny imprints made both sides disc making disc unreadable . this great product because it securely destroys data without shred disc shattered broken pieces plastic everywhere . anyone who owned or operated disc shredder , they very messy . this excellent alternative . so quick easy use , anyone operate it . this should household requirement , much any other appliance your home . i received my norazza data destroyer within couple days placing my order which very fast service . i strongly recommend this product personal well business use !!!	1

hardware breeze install . took 20 minuets including bay . same software , no problems . sound quality much improved over my old live card . battlefield 2 game play much improved my 2.4 /radeon 9700 pro/512 . before i would freeze framing during start rooms , during game play intense situations . now x-fi i none , game runs much smoother overall . dvd movies sound much improved . music also much improved . only problem ive burning expanded mp3 1 didnt convert well out 5 so far . software interface also bit lack luster , but functional . card worth price , hopefully upgrades improve interface .	1
costco here too . 180 great price , but hissing become annoying . it sound like larger capacitor .... its constant ... constant . i hear it walking through room passing within 8-10 feet unit . noise dissapears when tray open , only . i really like it , but hiss getting me . i notice its sale here $129 . maybe ill shop around , spend bit more	1

i bought mine wal-mart $20 , followed instructions two scratched dvd library ( one badly scratched , other still playable ) - saw almost no change scratches or playability . it going back morning . this model relies aluminum oxide paste ( superfine liquid sandpaper ) sand off scratches . i think i'll see better performance one products actually fills scratches rather than sanding down rest disc . cleaning , just get one inexpensive manual cleaners little bottle denatured alcohol - they work just fine	-1

easy use , fairly easy set up . however , stated most previous reviews i read , initial setup may bit more challenging those not comfortable computer navigation use . wish macro creation more detailed ; example , more detail steps create customized macro watch dvd , including ejecting closing dvd tray . pleased purchase	1
i've logitech g15 several months now it many features which i use regularly . paint doesn't seem wear off even if i rub or scratch keys . installation somewhat time consuming because keyboard drivers each part rather than one driver entire thing . pros- lights look great screen easily readable third party lcd apps highly customizable i use chat trillian access my buddy list screen . ( keystrokes go directly screen when you hit button reply , then i send it hitting enter ) i view winamp visualization song title , view my playlist , change various volume controls use standard playback functions i view network activity macros easy program key feel awesome compared my old keyboard . they nice solid click them , but pressure necessary keystroke length both small . cons- included lcd apps terrible useless me long setup more g-keys than you'll ever use minimal game support lcd apps take up valuable ram ( although not much ) keyboard profiler takes up ram must run maintain full functionality invisible lettering when lights off light brightness levels pointless . options : off-can't see it ! 1-visable but dim . 2-slightly more visible but still dim . usb ports usb 1.1 " gaming mode switch " ... i never hit windows key while gaming even though i usually use ctrl alt frequently . i think you'd really fumbling keys need feature wrist rest flimsy default lcd setting cycle through apps ( which i hate ) if i don't shut down properly , lcd profiler resets all its settings default . included pop3 checker doesn't ssl , you need get some ridiculous add which sucks up more resources . mail checker app+ ssl thing ends up little too resource heavy me appreciate . other words , its big pain get gmail working included checker . if you play lot world warcraft or really like tweak your settings streamline your interface , you might enjoy all macros . screen more useful non-gaming purposes , so don't buy it intent improve your hl2 experience ( since lcd doesn't display anything hl2 anyway ) . there many 3rd party lcd apps out there you probably find one make you love screen . warned , unless you use 3rd party apps , you probably disappointed lcd functionality . bottom line- recently priced spiked up these keyboards , i wouldn't pay new higher price one . this isn't kind item i would say i can't live without . its mainly luxury , unless you're serious computer geek ( like myself ) , you probably won't even know how utilize more advanced features . hardware solid powerful if you know how use it . included software cd ended up my trash .	1

this excellent machine . i bought two them . there few things you need . i 100% satisfaction using fujifilm dvd-r up 8x . i success fujifilm dvd+r up 8x . i`ve also tremendous success tdk dvd+r up 4x 8x . some other brands may not work . one thing i`ve learned this machine you baby it little . don`t go recording 3 or 4 -r or +r dvds every day . give it rest recordings . one or two per day okay . definitely give it room breathe . if you stack your machines top each other , put something so they breathe . sure not block ventilation holes sides . you definitely need buy panasonic dvd player play back your dvds - other brand dvd players may not play your recordings properly . one greatest things this machine it records dvd-ram . they re-recordable many , many times each program erased when watched . you even edit recordings dvd-ram . cut out commercials fit more disc or remove commercials when you watch program . only works dvd-ram . i over 50 dvd-ram discs ( panasonic brand ) - they sure take up less space than vcr tapes ! get one or two these recorders panasonic dvd player you`ve got it made ! throw away your vcrs forever ! just remember baby them	1

we bought this printer go canon g2 we bought . excellent choice . first i must say if you considering buying it anyone other than amazon [ . com ] , don't . i dealt amazon [ . com ] years they best what they , no one comes close . printer so easy setup , not like some other printers . we using window xp , it went like breeze.in lees than 30 minutes i printing pictures .... i am still learning all features , but quality pictuers good if not better than any other .. it fast fast , printed 2 4x6 pictures less than 4 minutes , i found you need buy quality paper . i used canon 4x6 bordless paper first until i ran out , then i switched brand , big mistake . use right paper you amazed	1

i trying find way easily carry lot camera equipment quite some time . i tried backpacks , shoulder bags , duffel bags , but none them really worked all well . then i saw lowepro street field system completely customizable pouches , vests , belts , accessories . it works great , you only get pouches you need so there no waisted space you organize them however you want according how often they used ( put frequently used items easier access places . ) variety alone this system worth investment , but quality ease use also very high which big plus . you get case any lens , camera body , or accessory you . i even cases my cell phone water bottle . one word caution , sure measure your lens lens hood backwards if you use them make sure entire thing fit into pouch , because sometimes lens fit , but then lens lens hood not . i often carry 5-6 lenses , extension tubes , teleconverters , extra memory cards batteries , bunch cleaning supplies other gadgets , which weights ton . but when they evenly distributed this vest/belt lowepro system it actually very manageable . only down side everyone staring you because you thousands dollars camera equipment strapped your body . but if you overlook , this way go . i used this system many zoos without ever problems , fact just unzipping single lens switching seems safer me than opening entire bag equipment every time you want switch lenses . many cases also come built rain/snow cover so if weather changes all your equipment not destroyed . you also put just few pouches normal belt when you just going take photos back yard or don't need take all your equipment , which nice . i really can't say enough how much easier this makes traveling lot equipment , if you hopelessly searching better solution , consider this , you won't regret it .	1
it really cheap , cheapes around . also it works fine , no complaints . but it looks little weird , packaging sticker card . maybe nock off ? since it says made china , but it works none less .	1
i used this mouse 3 months my laptop . look/feel general use fine short periods time ( ~ lt ; 1 hour ) . however , i am currently shopping replacement this mouse one problem : intermittently , after clicking/double-clicking , mouse go into " move left " mode ... continue move until it reaches edge screen . sometimes it move upper-left . this so inconsistent unpredictable . i often ( least 10 times 30 minute period ) give mouse wiggle stop it continuing . frustrating if you trying click through multi-level menu , instance . example if you working any cad-type or image editing project where you need insert line one segement time ( mouse move when it feels like it ) . it ok while , but now it annoying ... going buy replacement . if i buy replacement product because how product performs early stage its life , it gets no more than 2 stars . it could just this one particular mouse , but then points lack qa manufacturer end ... again , 2 stars	1

if you want budget home theater system under $200 there probably not many systems better then sony ht-ddw700 . this system ideal small rooms such bed room or tiny living room . considering price , sound quality actually better then expected me . tiny cube speakers presents pretty good clarity . they may look like cheap computer speakers but they aren't bit heavier then they look . center channel may little underpowered since dialog during dvd movies sound tad soft little too low . surround effects during movies dolby digital dts very good though . if set up properly speakers handle surround effects very well . some minor complaints speaker wire attached speakers very thin . they fixed can't replaced . also , if you want heart stopping bass then this system might not you . 8 " subwoofer okay considering price system . it currently better then any other sub included home theater system under $200 . it isn't powered , very light ( only 9 lbs ) you pretty close actually feel bass . volume would cranked up extremely high sub actually rattle your walls . receiver comes 1 optical 1 coxial digital input 4 rca analog inputs . it should enough most cases . extra digtal input or two wouldn't hurt but again system under $200 . setup couldn't easier . you just hook up included microphone , place it your listening postion press button remote . system automatically sets up speaker distance , delay volume levels . receiver comes basic pro logic ii music move modes upmix your stereo sources . it also other sound fields effects enhace sound but they don't really seem enhance sound much if all . basically , if you want home theater system small room under $200 then there isn't much better then sony ht-ddw70	1
caselogic set standard media storage , this continues tradition . few tweaks needed , however . i am certain i soon fill 20 slots . therefore , it would helpful clear plastic sleeve spine inserting title or index avoid open each case search specific disk . graphics sleeves small enough considerable trimming original case graphics needed . actually , i would prefer dvd companies would make their graphics more easily adaptable album rather than other way around	1

there not really lot say this product - it protects your nano , material good quality , it not too thick ( doesn't bulk up nano too much ) not too thin ( provides enough protection ) . i wanted this go jogging my ipod - it fills function perfectly , strap comfortable . only flaw i found ( this not bother me , but i know it might bother others - hence 4 instead 5 stars ) , material act bit dust collector - if you put it dusty packet , it collect lot dust .	1

i bought blue logger both street atlas 2005 sa2005 hh my dell x50v . no problem blue logger gps but my complaints follows : 1 . delorme not include blue logger manager software hh . now they want sell it separately additional $39 . very weird marketing strategy indeed . 2 . software pocket pc very difficult use , not very intuitive . it seems hand held software developed afterthought software pc . it poorly designed , appeared not fully tested normal users prior releasing market . 3 . it very cumbersome slow determine route . even 620 mhz axim , it slow . worse yet , route often wrong . example , this afternoon i use sa2005 determine route friend house . i followed route , i would come dead end street back track 10 miles get correct route my destination . luckily , i decided use my paper map . later , i tried microsoft mapping internet it actually gave me correct routing . last week location , sa2005 found wrong location given address which would take me 4 miles off . luckily , i knew where it ignored routing sa2005 hh . 4 . many other mapping softwares hh allow one use it 1 hand often finger . but not sa2005 hh . after 2 weeks using it , i found myself going back my old paper map . example , if i not calculated route just simply use gps map travel , software only show street i but no name given no street name shown upcoming cross streets . it not help when you lost . 5 . sa2005 maps seems several years old not very up date . i guess that why delorme not want clearly advertise this issue . i am seriously considering giving up sa2005 consider this my $50 learning mistake , looking microsoft street trip 2005 or later 1q 2005 , iguidance who supposed latest map . i am not alone this several other users also complained delorme user forum . i wish i read forum before buying delorme software . well , live learn .	1

my daughter really loved getting this item christmas . unfortunately , cd player not reliable . it freezes ( sometimes several hours ) , unfreezes unexpectedly ( especially great middle night ) , skips repeatedly , or just plain refuses start all . only thing works well radio . we already radio , so purchase big waste money . terribly disappointing . i strongly recommend potential buyers look elsewhere .	-1
best this price . like color functions . mine latest longer than some comparable higher end models . life saver when trying keep busy life organized . great optional backlight feature	1
purchased this player under advise friend because store credit used . first i against idea neglecting my cd player , which my best friend 17 years , some new contraption . but , now i my mp3 , i love it . it small , so it fits right my coat pocket , sound quality superb , fm player gets really good reception . what i like most all able record music any audio device . person over 200 cd it great option . i not downloaded music my computer . i record my personal cd player it sounds great . keys little confusing , but you get hang them after week or two . love arm band working out , hearphones little annoying due difference cord lengths . it doesn't hold much music , 25-30 songs depending length , enough 2 hour workout , but considering size memory cost it good purchase . no regrets here .	1

this product works great under most conditions . only thing made me give it 4 stars sometimes modulation would turn off or half work . i think it its automatic detection feature , when screens come up majority one color , like when something comes out front plain one color background background takes up most screen , it looks like scrambled cable	1
i am audio quality freak ! i love flac ape , 64-bit decoding , cowon jet audio sound re-production over windows media player any day week . i picked this up evil blue yellow box store town , i'm blown away . i never found sound card i extremely happy sound reproduction through headphones until now . generic c-media drivers xp/vista work best , no need equalize or install turtle beach drivers . using set panasonic rp-ht355 headphones , ( course , i bypassed potentiometer headphones because they all add resistance ) this sound absolutely breathtaking . read review these headphones if you looking great sound budge t.t he only other device put out this sound quality my alesis multi-mix firewire sound mixer . but this pro-audio device , it $300 unit ! volume 15% - 20% , loudness option checked advanced properties , this usb sound card more than reproduce enough sound through headphones make it feel like your studio artist performing . works great native vista drivers too ! far negative reviews go , they probably bad headphones , or received bad unit , there no way this device puts out anything but crystal clear sound . i make sure no windows sounds using device primary sound driver , keep all little clicks windows navigation sounds out , set jet-audio direct sound output this card when available . hot swap great xp vista beta2 . i've used these same headphones ... creative sb live 5.1 , audigy ls , soundmax integrated hd audio ( asus a8r-mvp crossfire onboard audio ) , alesis multimix firewire 8 sound cards . only sound card i would say sounds equal or better alesis . buy this - you not sorry	1

i got this my razr v3xx . i haven't put too much it yet , but once i get my stereo bluetooth headset , i plan load up disk use phone alternate mp3 player . one thing i've problem - it not easy get disk out adapter . first time i tried , i began wonder if it wasn't stuck there good , but eventually it came out . it goes out phone slot much easier . since i usb cable connects phone computer , i just might leave disk phone not mess it . while 2 gb capacity seems like lot today , wait few years . then we'll probably wondering how we ever survived mere 2 gb	1

i've sc101 almost year . when it works , it super . when it doesn't , support poor you really your own . i've three different issues affecting data three different machines accessing it over past months . none issues discussed troubleshooting guide , nor faq , email tech support completely unhelpful . i've able salvage my data each time ( yes , ultimately i it backed up could recover if needed ) , but stability support device makes it impossible me recommend it anyone who feels they average home user . ( i am fairly technical user never this kind trouble pc product .	1
i now own three different pairs clip-on earphones : koss , altec-lansing , sony . sony best , these reasons : 1 . they position speaker so it facing forward rather than towards center your head . this way , you get direct sound your eardrum , consequently sound louder ( saves your batteries ) , you get better high-frequency response ( sound doesn't turn corner get your eardrum ) . it just sounds better than others . 2 . stiff plastic design ( no moving parts ) makes them very easy get off , easy tell left right . they don't move around once they your ears . 3 . cord sliding part which allows you secure wires up under your chin , effectively giving you single wire your neck sound source . handy keeping wires out your zippers collar , , i think , handy running , keep everything secure . 4 . no foam irritate your ear distance your eardrum sound . too bad they orange . but orange almost fleshtone , so it isn't too bad ( white guy ) . other clip-on might look niftier ( altecs some chrome which looks way cool ) , but they don't work well . these great clip-ons . just buy them . this price , i'll buy second pair .	1
i'd read reviews amazon elsewhere , therefore knew what expect . product good price , expected . speaker wires too thin . physical set up easy but tuning speakers not . upscaling 1080i very impressive using hdmi ; haven't tried component . remote control easy use but not always intuitive ( how i turn off subtitles without punching multiple buttons ? ) . works well my samsung dlp 1080p . packaging downright unacceptable . box styrofoam packaging too thin . dvd player/receiver placed box top everything else , little protection its wide ( 17 " x18 " ) top . box damaged dvd player dent it causes tray grate stick . brings me return/refund policy . amazon amazing customer service - very prompt , polite , professional , etc . however , they're not able replace just dvd player/receiver unit . entire system replaced i.e. entire 60lb+ package travel back forth . now it turns out they're out stock this product therefore only able offer refunds , price-match when it come back stock . that good hear but still means entire system repacked , shipped back them , get refund then wait without system till they're able ship one out . i understand how they'd see this equitable them customer but it too cumbersome	1
i've used kit it works well , especially outlets overseas 220/240 volt systems . one complaint archos requires one purchase so many extras when basic one like ac charger should included original 504/604 together usb port charger . my second problem ac adapter still takes long time charge archos battery - almost long usb port . said , i'm glad i bought it or i could not charged my archos easily	1
fantastic portable gps unit . crystal clear , bright , wide screen display best market . current leg directions displayed band across top screen ( like other nuvis ) white letters green background ... reminiscent big interstate signs ... nice touch . built-in speaker loud clear enough i haven't even considered using fm transmitter , although you certainly . very fast route recalculation . low profile , super adherent , windshield mount excellent . i going look into other mounts , but discovered its great when mounted low , center windshield . this almost makes it seem like its mounted dashboard . 660 wide screen conceals mount completely , so you don't even see it . ok , 660 bit pricey , but why settle something you may not satisfied ? it .... now	1
this clock just what i looking . only thing i would wanted stereo speakers . but other one i looking ( boston ) really didn't enough bells whistles sound much bassy . i find it hard see clock compared others	1
i clock week , i ordered two more like it . i tried digital wall clock because i couldn't stand ticking mechanical clocks hands . digits this clock clear . radio-synchronization works perfectly . i recently compared it greenwich time using internet , it second . there some weak points . instruction booklet very small type . reading glasses handy . display needs certain amount light able read it wider angles . radio synchronization didn't kick until morning after i set it , but working fine ever since . clock also looks nice . all all , it serves its function very well	1
very comfortable use but exceedingly odiferous coming out plastic sleeve . better after exposed air several days	1
i bought these my dvd player . they work wonderfully ! old analog cables came dvd player looked alright but [ didn't measure up } . these monster cables definately enhance sound my dvd movies , especially dialogue . old cables i made my movies sound bit muffled . but monster cables intensified clarity dvd player my reciever . those us who cannot afford 5 speaker digital surround sound , i would definately recommend these cables if you use regular 2 channel stereo your movies or cds	1
i ordered this mistake- i used them anyway- i just say i've gotten better batteries dollar store- dont waste you hard earned money	-1
item doesn't work properly . video quality okay . there loud background static type noise both tv computer video card when i attempted record show . background noise makes product useless	-1
i mounted these my ceiling just behind my sofa . i intended these just rear channel speakers , but i they sounded good enough i am sending my stereo through them now . installation simple i them out box playing music under 20 minutes . biggest hassel cutting hole trying avoid insulation ! i am considering buying pair put back patio would recommend these even my best friends	1
amazing product , right out box . i would write more but i'm watching penn teller bs ! it right now	1
these affordable , great-sounding monitors , ideal beginning home studio budget . first pair i bought disturbing problems : one channel not functioning , volume button improperly attached , so it recessed into cabinet , i almost went refund rather than exchange , but i patient , amazon sent new pair immediately . i'm happy them . i'm singer songwriter , they're perfect what i . you get what you're paying here : dubious manufacturing quality , but great sound . we'll see how they hold up .	1
i knew it smaller than standard sd card , but i shocked see how tiny it actually when i first opened package . i am using this my lg chocolate phone store photos music . it works great . it comes sd adapter card so you use it standard sd slot . very useful transferring data onto card since most pcs not support micro sd	1
t've using panasonic dvd ram over two years cannot imagine not it . i installed lg4082 my pc because it reads all formats albeit verrrrrrry slowwwwwly . i make dvds pc play them my tv if i choose vise versa . you use ram second hard drive . record your imformation then edit it way you want it ; transfer it h.d. , then transfer finished data permanent -r disc . i used record whole week one hour shows then weekend edit out chaff file main points . programs late lamented " call help " " screensavers " late lamented techtv channel . i also use ram disc record everything i watch case i miss something want replay . who needs tivo ? i tried r/w system but it just seems little too finicky me . i 10 r/w discs now i 8 r/w coasters . r/w bad habit finalizing disc even if your recording fails some reason you end up blank disc your recorder thinks full or non recordable . i think i'll stick dvd ram now , it winner	1
i two subwoofers home theater system . my sw200s saved subwoofers three times ( while giving up their lives ) . first time after large ice storm ( feb 03 ) . second time aftermath hurricane ( isabel ) . third time after small ice storm accompanied high winds ( feb 05 ) . each time power conked out came back ( big surge )	1
price , these headphones surprisingly good all respects except sound quality . although i'm not qualified give critical audio review ( but nobody who qualified would review these ) , i think most people would agree me their frequency response goes fairly low , but they excessive middle/upper bass peak . high end doesn't seem go high advertised ( i didn't notice any " air " ) , there seems pronounced peak range corresponding cymbals vocal sibiliance . when listening popular radio ( which i get variety source material ) , which boosts these same bands , combination nauseating . i hoping they'd flatten out after breaking couple days , although bass got deeper cleaner , low-end peak remained , high end didn't improve . they reproduce simple sounds quite nicely , but complex passages become blur . but then , phones everything well probably cost five times much , or more . it would interesting see what philips could twice price . i experimented reversing absolute polarity ( which required chopping off connector reconnecting " hots " " grounds " " grounds " " hots " ) , but sound got worse , so it already optimal my system , unfortunately . instead in-line volume control , which seems useless this day remotely-controlled volume , philips should provide in-line absolute-polarity switch . fact , all headphones should such control ( some grado phones them ) . correct polarity isn't always immediately apparent untrained ear , so give yourself some time ( possibly weeks typical listening ) , keep open mind . you'll eventually find you prefer one polarity over other . i reversed polarity speakers dirt-cheap tv , sound improved considerably , so it help even most basic sound system . it also possible polarity change source source . some high-end preamps ( such some audio research ) absolute polarity control compensate such differences . it probably good idea turn volume down or mute preamp before " flipping " polarity avoid possibility blowing out anything down line , although i wouldn't surprised if ar polarity control automatically mutes preamp before reversing polarity . some disc players also such control , because it cheap easy digital realm . summary , i would say these headphones great deal unless you need something critical listening or popular radio .	1
i got chance borrow friend mine go 910 i highly recommend it people looking get gps their car . i didn't need any instructions it easiest thing use(and i'm no tech genious !!! ) . i think it updated latest maps it took me exactly where i needed go -- no problems . i no complaints this product am now looking purchase one myself !!!	1

i am air force trained techie over 15 years . i lot experience computers electronics . after lot research i went hollux gpslim236 . initially i very pleased device until it started problems . first it would never lock satellites . ( yellow light stayed ) i found out unit went into sirf protocol mode . i find program called sirf demo get it out sirf protocol placed it into usable protocol nmea . next device started problems blue tooth connection . ( blue light would never turn ) . i would turn device off 50 times before magic blue light would turn , then sometimes it would only turn constant not blink . i could bypass 40 times turning it off bouncing device off my steering wheel . this ridiculous thing get it work . i emailed tech support tried call them all no response . now it most finicky device i ever . i am often tempted throw this piece junk out window it . i must strongly recommend you stay away this device probably hollux all together . now i buy gps	-1

needed fast aa charger charge up nimh batteries my camera flash unit , bit shopping research . found this unit decided give it try . comes 6 aa 2 aaa , so they get you started right off few batteries use , which nice . unpacked everything ( plastic package difficult open up , so careful ) plugged it . there cooling fan built which moves air across batteries during charging , so just make sure you don't rest charger where airflow blocked ( e.g. carpet ) . within stated 15 minutes , batteries tested out 1.2 volts my voltmeter . put batteries my flash took several dozen pictures night without any problems . yet really give them extreme durability test , but overall seems like it working fine so far . some additional comments - if you're looking buy this charger charge existing nimh batteries you may already own , aware charger some " intelligence " - , if battery " bad " , charger not charge these batteries . light turn , then start flashing indicating there problem batteries not charging . out 4 existing older nimh batteries i own , only 2 them charged this charger . i suspect brand new batteries not this problem . it charged my old batteries also within 15 minutes , these old batts tested out 1.2 volts again my voltmeter . based this trial , it not appear you need use ic3 batteries get ~ 15 minute charge times . package not indicate this requirement , either . i note other competing chargers market only give you 15 min charge times if you use special ic3 batteries . non-ic3 batts supposedly give you 30+ min charge times . not so this charger , my experience so far . nowhere package it tell you what input voltages charger supports , so i flipped it over read label unit . it requires 100 120 volt input , so if you plan using this overseas , you should bring voltage converter you . us voltage input only . unit little bulky , so if you going vacation , you'll probably pack it your luggage , not your camera case ( my existing 14 hour overnight charger small enough toted my camera case today ) . it comes cable plug into wall socket or adapter car use . instructions say if you charge batteries car , it take longer than 15 minutes . i not tried this yet don't know exactly how long it take . overall , i am happy purchase would recommend this unit anyone looking turn aa charge times around quickly , particularly any professional photographers who use these their external flash units	1
sure , there may other racks put looks over function , but if you need deep shelves large openings your phat gear , this value buy . i bought this thing house my home theater gear 200 cd changer . cd changer alone 19 inches deep 7 inches tall just won't fit into fancy stand sporting wire blind or shabby 4-6 inch shelf spacing . av receiver pretty big , too ... almost big changer -- it gets pretty hot boot . open rack design keeps air flowing helps prevent any meltdowns . so , if you " real " gear want inexpensive solution , sanus afa models may you .	1

me , this truly plug play device delivers goods ... set up literally two minutes . i simply needed more signal strength , some my machines suffered marginal signal . now , all them receive excellent signal . signal strength needs , i really think this device something should tried first before going alternative -- wireless range expanders/extenders . wireless range expanders , which require configuration routers , work very well once set up correctly . but many people i consider tech-savvy ( including myself ) pulled their hair out making them work . bottom line , this trick actiontec router came my fios service . $90 , it pricey , but time savings well worth it . think additional time saved if you ever change your router or network ! some people here mentioned problems this booster , but i still think this first method try ... worse case scenario , you always return it :	1

phone easy install . it pretty much plug play . it takes day or two get used . it not like our cell phones where we so spoiled everything one button dialing or one button access everything but cit400 meets all i looking ... lightweight , easy use , clear audio , comfortable ear hands , speaker phone great !, good signal far distances ( other rooms ) , ringtone not obnoxious , most importantly , my clients cannot tell difference b/t this phone any other landline . only things i would ask linksys work ... call waiting ... beep so annoying . after call waiting rings abour 4-5 times person calling already hung up , beep continues go off every few seconds . i havent called linksys see if there anything this but i've read manual it not anywhere . also , i hate when i call this phone , it shows up other people caller id ... " 00-12345 " ... i dont think it linksys , i think this skype issue . sometimes it shows up " unknown " ... regardless , i dont want my business calls show up international number . i would rather " unknown " show up or best would my number appeared caller id . all all , this product more than meets its expectations value great	1

" learning " remote required , least most cases . this monitor too new codes programmed into most universal remotes . i purchased wall mount kit mount this unit wall , i think it looks excellent there . mount vesa 100mm 200mm pattern , which doesn't seem like common size . many mounts i saw either 100mm 100mm or 200mm 200mm . some even smaller 75mm 75mm . i finally find one right type , it very easy install wall , least me . i used built speakers think they sound great what they , but i'm waiting until i get my home theater speakers set up so i enjoy home theater experience . i know larger screen makes better home theater , but my bedroom too small make practical proposition . this screen feels like it just right size this room , approximately 14 ' 16 ' . i would recommend this monitor anyone looking something this size , long they don't need built tuner . if you satellite box , cable box , or vcr , it work tuner . order get hdtv functionality , you need hdtv capable tuner ( which most , if not all , vcrs not ) . since it no tuner , i don't understand why it buttons changing channels . this simply observation , not meant complaint this monitor	1

this keyboard folds out well i liked feel keys . however , ir connector needs direct connection ir port pda . ipaq , this port bottom handheld . 210 degree arm not rotate this area . order proper connectivity , you turn handheld its side . this then requires software program download ( not freeware i find ) rotate your screen landscape view , unless you read sideways without getting headache . before buying this product , check your handheld see if your ir port 4-8 o'clock - if so , this may difficult keyboard use	1
job . installation fairly easy . i suggest downloading latest driver installer . works great , although it occasionally must reset if power goes out	1
these little gems perfect my hotel stays - i lot traveling these little guys really help bring little home me hotel rooms while road . i am amazed how full their sound very easy set up usb plug play . travel carrying case it comes way big clumsy , deficits it purpose . i went down rei camping store , purchased little eagle creek nylon carrying bag them which they fit snuggly , perfectly optimize room my briefcase . i've read some reviews before my purchase highs or trebles little lacking - that news me after them now , adjusting my tones my computer seems make up this extremely well . love my altec lansings ' - best us road warriors !	1
i've got two these installed . i ran first one through cassette-tape adapter my truck . i dissatified sound quality , little ticked i'd paid it . i ran second one my wife car it doesn't cassette deck , so we direc t-t uned fm station my skyfi2 . sounds much better ( despite what manual suggests ) . it easy anyway , less wiring hide . these car kits little hard install correctly . you very careful antenna wire . if you twist it or pinch it too much it won't work . when installed correctly , kit works great	1
i purchased garmin forerunner 201 amazon , believing i buying reliable piece gear . it doesn't work properly any built up area , i.e. city , where most us live , or areas too many trees , i.e. where we city dwellers like go when we leave city . basically it leaves stretches your running route out , but stop watch carries ticking . so if you're like me , take satisfaction turning out fast-paced runs ( or what passes fast-paced us amateurs ) , 201 only source frustration . it'll time your run perfectly , just like any stop-watch ( duh ! ) , but then leave out some distance you ran , so you get mile mile average yo-yos very suspicious way . particularly when you've put out steady effort . it'll miss out bits your course different places day-by-day basis . you'll find yourself " adapting " info device gives you : how precision ? interval training feature even worst . you dial some mile repeats , timed interval , set off full blast . minutes tick mile never ends ! that when you find there gaps " mile " you're running , you're killing yourself when you've actually mile , should your rest period . i kid you not , i wouldn't dare sell gps device works 70% time i'm not speaking heavily built up areas , i run spaces where closest buildings least 60-90 feet away ... but this not worst it . i though i getting well made piece equipment . i live brazil , so i bought it off amazon , friend kindly brought it over me us . less than 1 year , it started turning on/off itself , crazy dysfunctional way , rendering it totally unusable . currently it doesn't stay more than 1 minute time . it now runs it battery flat itself . even though i'd scrupulously careful w/ it , not taking it out rain , drying off moisture sweat after every run religiously . some you may say i should used warranty , but when you mailing costs brazil-us , if thing fixed or replaced , 100% customs duty when it gets sent back here , you'd give up , just i . i'm not paying twice piece gear never worked properly first place . my conclusion : try some other model , or even brand . i'd not lay my hard-earned cash this gizmo again	-1
this worst thing . never buy this one !!! there serious noise , big problem ..	-1
these headphones , i got over 5 months ago , i use them both my mac pc . great sound quality , better than bose , no joke . surround sound amazing gameing , its cheating when compaired stereo since now , when i get sniped , i hear gunshot rear right , i turn my rear right theres sniper ... haha i love them , i bring them road trips , school , everywhere . people like " they dont look cool " i dont care ... although they bulky not too portable , great quality price . these phones better , they would noise canceling , smaller , more portable , better adapter 2.5 mm jacks , i always loose little black thing , my ipod , great sound quality , but sometimes when ipod stops musci cuz sensor thinks jack unplugged ... but this happenes like once per 30 mins , no biggie , just press play again . other than non portablility fact little adapter gets lost eaisly due my clumbseyness , there best headhones i ever purchased . dont discouraged non name brand . these headphones circles around bose since they essentially 4 speakers eash ear , sub , 1 frount , 1 rear , 1 center , they all distribute music audio well , since sub takes lows , center takes midrange , take tweeters , all mixed into one , sound ausome . where bose only 1 great speaker work , these headphones like compairing new dual core dual processor g5 4 processors single g5 imac , great performance , but 4 brains ( speakers ) better than one !!	1

if you're looking high-end , look clifford alarms , they now owned same parent company viper but they offer more user-programming options . hardware comparable quality , cliffords just offer more features . i clifford my sedan viper my truck . viper actually louder siren , but unlike clifford if i want adjust sensitivity glass breakage detector i take it back dealer whereas clifford i just it through remote . tip : make sure whoever installs your viper puts it " active arming " mode instead " passive arming " which drive you crazy because it automatically arm alarm every time you close all vehicle doors . i understand it higher up viper alarms simply added features like remote start 2-way remotes , but you not getting any upgraded hardware . these still way better than no-name cheapo alarms coming out now best buy other places . don't cut corners install , it involves cutting into your car electrical system so you want somebody who knows what they're doing	1

it seems run well cool , no doubt because its well thought out packaging . seagate reputation producing good drives . i bought this portable " master drive " use among two or more computers . why carry more than you ? i thought , save space , i would get few retractable usb cables avoid necessity always carrying more clutter cables . surprise !!! seagate uses extremely special purpose usb cable connect its usb receptacle . none my other cables work it . firstly , receptacle so far recessed into drive casing ordinary usb cable cannot reach into it . secondly , if you cut away some plastic surrounding male end cable , it fit into receptacle but ( surprise ! ) it not work . why ? i not know . i tried several other cables worked other drives devices but none worked seagate . i tried searching similar cables internet but , after searching exhaustively , found nothing . you contact seagate buy its special purpose cables ( $9.25 + tax/shipping each ) . pretext odd shaped cable some computers need second usb jack additional power . course , this rare it strikes me simply profit enhancement dodge . result : 8% higher cost more cable clutter	1
i searching far wide perfect laptop bag my 15.4 " macbook pro ... here it . unlike most flimsy bags ( targus , im talking you ! ) this one stand its own empty or full doesn't give one feeling laptop holding whole thing together . it plenty space compartments open all way down floor while keeping your stuff ( detachable membrane sides ) . there also this wonderful little compartment ( wegner staple ) just deep enough so you dont go dig around you things . its also extremely comfortable wear ( even packed full heavy gear )	1

i used sw radios many years many manufacturers : sony , grundig , sangean , radio shack ( made sangean ) . this model eton stands up them all , elegantly designed , logical easy use , great sound . manual short sweet , well written . once you know drill , all settings easy fast . quite intuitive well . there amazing 500 possible presets , though i barely scape up 30 i would use regularly . sound all bands rich . fm superb . there even ' antenna trim ' usable sw bands which rare all but most expensive radios . design feel elegant solid . all buttons knobs positive , affirmative action . two criticisms : e10 goes through sets four batteries little eight hours , entire memory wiped out when batteries get low . but , all all , great radio price	1
good , but just short great . key action nice light , low-travel makes it very easy your fingers really fly across keys , pretty quietly , too . i like fact they trying make keyboards more spill resistant , because i killed more than one keyboard spilling drink it . i no idea how well spill-resistance , though , i am not willfully go testing it out or anything . profile very thin , footprint also smaller than average . personally , i would not minded keyboard little bit wider , because order save space , microsoft re-arranged insert-delete-home-end-pgup pgdn keys two vertical lines instead more common two horizontal lines . i use those keys quite bit text file navigation while programming , learning how use this new configuration touch took me week or so , which kind annoying . small niggle lack usb adapter . doubt , it helps keep price down , but i would really love able use this keyboard my ibook well my pc , but order , i'll buy third-party adapter . , always , inclusion extra keys top keyboard almost useless . i say almost , because i actually use calculator key often enough , but rest nothing but waste space . despite these complaints , i still think one thing microsoft still well hardware . their keyboards mice pretty solid . basic , no frills keyboard , this much better than you would usually get so cheap .	1

number radio stations not yet bought up clear channel , still aimed somewhat graying population , steadily decreasing , we looking radio ability receive one last stations houston area we enjoyed listening , but , because its location 40 miles away liberty , texas , impossible pick up our home . we thought it possible , because plain-jane radio our f-150 picked up station very clearly pasadena we drove work baytown . we tried couple other radios advertised their ability what we wanted , able reach out farther separate stations situated closely radio dial , but no success all . i don't remember where i first heard boston acoustic radio , but it appeared able what we wanted , i continued search out everything it i could , using google . limited experience amazon.com, i knew many vendors sell their merchandise discount here , , " voila . " there it , lowest price i found anywhere . radio arrived almost soon if i'd bought it mall , we nothing but happy it since . my son , who more critical ear than me , told me sound really good . we now get hear enjoy khsn-fm 99.9 mhz , " shine-all-nine " here pasadena . unsuspected bonus , we're also able pick up more powerful am stations(at night , when weather right ) located around middle country , st. louis(kmox-am 1120 ) , shreveport(kwkh-am 1130 ) , nashville , gallatin , tennessee . bottom line -- high quality am-fm radio , very decent price . i like it	1
com'on folks ... let real here . coby cv-h42 headphones may decent sound pair cheap headphones , but com'on ... they're only $5 or less . i've tried them non-amplified computer monitior work , they sound decent . bass average best . if these 40mm driver , then i'd hate hear what smaller one coby set would sound like . i've also tried them my at-home 5.1 amplified pc set-up they distort way too easily . bass distorts almost slightest bit bass . i concur those who say it roll dice get good working pair , left-speaker my set bit weak . i mean let face it ... these some pretty cheap headphones ... if you want cheap , but great sounding pair headphones , you better look set $15+ range . take instance koss ktx-pro 1 titaniums $18 here amazon . they're sold upwards $45 retailers like radio shack . all glowing reviews , they're hellava set headphones . i gave this set 2-stars only because they're decent cheap pair , but audiophiles , stear clear	1

first all - i really enjoy listening xm radio , which what made me consider buying this extension device receiver . it truly good way further utilize roady2 , allowing you listen either xm , or tune local fm stations ( why anyone would want this , i don't know - maybe emergency or something ) . unit fairly simple set up . you first need charge battery putting it into place plugging included ac adapter . it takes 2 hours charge then you ready use unit . you slide roady2 into device until it plugs . ( if you set up roady2 home adapter or auto adapter - you must first remove backing plate roady2 - it snap off little leverage ( light ) straight edge screwdriver . ) after you installed roady2 unit , you good go . first , volume tuning controls side unit little vexing use , but some practice helps you readily raise or lower volume or tune fm radio stations . additional help , there small wheel volume control right ear section headphones . headphone acts your antenna unit whole thing then works very well . i am pleased this unit , but i would advise shopping price , it vary much $100.00 low high . all all , nice addition further utilize roady2	1

maximum archival life cds , it good idea keep them both jewel case , outer container well . after doing fairly extensive web search , i discovered selection boxes hold cds , while contained within jewel case , actually rather limited . many these cases $30-$60 range , actually hold fewer cds than these cases o.o downside , these cases rather plain appearing business-like . but i didn't want flaming pink , anyway . also , their style not lend them portable . files used daily , or something you want carry around you , it may good idea get something more durable carrying handle , made metal or heavy plastic . these boxes made out coated cardboard , fact clearly stated description . but they quite sturdy , if used only occasionally , should last many years . but these cases could damaged , if they accidentally soaked water , or kept extremely damp environment . archival storage occasional access , this best deal i could find , especially considering almost-nominal price . if you lot cds , fill several-to-many containers , only access them occasionally ; these boxes good choice . i probably buy some more , i continue generate cds need stored .	1

i used acronis true image 9 year . i never needed it until today when i cloned my laptop drive external usb drive , put new 100 gb drive laptop , put acronis boot disk , then cloned usb drive back laptop . voila ! perfect . perfectly functioning drive .... but now i 100 gb not 40 gb . i problems getting backup images complete error-free ( sure you defrag your hd first before you image if it needs it ) . i also problems images when i use ' check-verify integrity image ' utility . one time it tells me image corrupt , i run it again it says its fine . screensavers may culprit here .... disable them when making image . if you're going make image ' set it forget it ' .... don't try working your machine while it images . acronis says you this but i don't see point ' driving car trying photograph it same time ( get it ? )' .... it doesn't make sense . use image time spend some quality time your kids , wife , or etc . it took me 39 minutes clone 37.2 gb data onto new 100gb drive . i agree several other users : clone only . cloned drive backups beautiful . you open it explorer , peruse your files folders just like your primary drive , all order check sure data there . here tip : use acronis ti clone your drive . then use program like storage crypt 2.0 encrypt this drive .... then put it your car glove box , your garage , safe deposit box , your tool shed ... anywhere but your house ( don't forget clone occasionally ) . when your house burns down , gets hit tornado ( i live kansas ) , or thieves steal your equipment , you hidden encrypted backup clone drive your data . heck , you replace laptop ; it data you cannot replace . drive encrypted it stolen not show up when connected computer unless you know what program encrypted it what password de-crypt it so it shows up windows explorer . i give it 4 stars because ' image ' function not reliable . but cloning superb	1

i like shure e3g . i don't think them ultimate in-ear-monitor experience , but they've given me much more than lot headphones i've listened recent bought aggressive pricing-cutting their current stock , shure working hard change e3g psp-owner status symbol something like bargain portable audio lovers . sound user going out pair in-ear-monitors , ( shure series , or etymotic er6i/er4 , westone monitors , etc . ) depends number factors which rapidly make any accurate assessment their performance problematic . all in-ear-monitors work putting sound source into just right place auditory canal all frequencies music or other listening you then sealing out external sounds so you get accurate sound volume less likely destroy your hearing any use in-ear-monitors involves arrangement factors which some may find not faint-hearted . e3g no exception . they placed * just right * ear canal , your sound source just right base level music you're listening through them or your music become flat or take strange emphasis . once you get it right though , shure e3s revelation . i use my headphones foreign language study programs music accuracy shure e3g very good both jobs its best , it revelation . two examples ( using sony mz-nh600d mini-disc walkman levels adjusted sound source using yellow foam eartips ): 1 . topic entertainment " total immersion japanese " demonstrated not only enough clarity me hear every nuance what speaker say but me hear artifacts material introduced recording process -- tiny halo white noise before after each phrase -- even flaws isolation recording studio itself sound passing cars . 2 . peter gabriel , " passion : music movie , last temptation christ , tracks 1 2 , ' feeling begins , " " gethsamene " displayed some very good nuances including breathiness wooden flutes very sexy separation overlapping percussion . all all , however , best thing e3g not their base-response but their basic , meat-and-potatoes accuracy . they allow someone like me poor hearing not only hear music but hear subtleties went into studio work behind music . physically speaking , they far , far more robust than etymotic er6/er6i they much better thought out terms human factors engineering like getting them into out your ears without damaging them . units come pocket-sized , semi-rigid , woven nylon case cord-spool inside ( best such item included * any * monitors market ) protect your investment well number ear-tips designed offer compromise comfort isolation . last , yellow , crush-and-expand foam units offer far best isolation base response ( thus , best sound ) but cost their fragility need change them often . i give e3g four stars would definitely five if shure given units just smidgen more base response made replacement foam eartips slightly less expensive ( approximately $20 10 pairs ) , they would lot closer perfect then . things stand , their current pricing , i no regrets voted them my money .	1

i owned pair etymotic er6is pair shure e2s , which both very good quality earbuds , but i say , this far best pair in-ear-monitors i ever owned . you really hear difference earbuds single drivers these dual driver monitors . lows highs don't interfere each other , which may may difficult understand , but you when you hear them . no matter how low bass , highs still constant unaffected ... vice versa . however , my opinion , difference audio quality these earbuds pair less price ( like shure e2cs , example ) , what some may consider , subtle . but , true audiophile , this difference just enough justify spending so much pair buds . i took these through few brief tests when i got them , playing several mp3s rather bass heavy known produce poor sound previously owned earbuds ... i smiled . ues played bass clearly highs bright uninterrupted , way they meant heard . construction quality materials , they could use some work . cord tad bit cheap i'm curious see how long it lasts before shorting out , but brings me absolutely genius idea they created . user replaceable cord . everyone knows , cords short out . there no headphone not short out . my guess , drivers last quite some time , but no matter what , cord short out . well , $20 , you get brand new cord . old one simply unplugs buds ... but don't worry just yet , because they very generous 2 year warranty . what more could you ask ? short , i recommend buying these earbuds . they best i've ever owned , if you very picky ears , they'll appreciate them	1

i bought this printer because my wife wanted printer she could print out photo her new canon digital camera . since camera canon pictbridge , no computer needed this printer . you print directly camera which quick easy . this printer only photo , but it prints out great looking 4 6 pictures very fast . quality excellent , i don't believe you distinguish them pictures printed photo lab . i didn't actually measure how long it took print picture , but it very fast . good guesstimate would appox 60-80 seconds . it not use ink , but process called dye sublimation . according photo printer experts , photos dye-sublimation printer much more durable fade much more slowly than photos inkjet printer . dye-sublimation printing process performed three times , one time each cyan , magenta , yellow dyes , then repeated fourth time apply protective coating print . protective coating applied during fourth pass laminate blocks uv ( ultraviolet ) light , makes dye-sub print waterproof , scratch-resistant fade-resistant . so , this printer give you instant gratification lab quality prints last lifetime without fading ! this printer very compact , so you actually take it you if you want . there optional battery so you print out pictures anytime , anywhere . most people this won't necessary , but those professional individuals who might currently using older " polaroid " instant camera , this allows you take big step up picture quality ! i believe using this printer your digital camera would also less expensive . print cartridges photo paper sold set . i found amazon best prices . only drawback ( which isn't really negative ) cost print cartridges photo paper . it slightly higher than average . quality prints convenience however should taken into consideration . instant gratification quality comes slight premium , i fully believe it worth it . we purchased 100 pack amazon around $23.00 shipping . works out $0.23 ea . only $0.06 more local photo lab . ( doesn't include gas , wear tear car time traveling local photo mega mart . probably washes if you really want analyze it death .... )	1

toshiba second generation unit , hd a2 , very attractive , glossy front silver trim . although console dimensions much smaller more streamlined than a1 , we lose analog audio outputs . its width height comparable typical dvd player , however , its depth little longer , few inches back . no biggie . remote medium sized , black plastic plenty function buttons , but not very intuitive their placement . start up minute or less , which not very annoying if you power unit , then go get snack or take bio break , etc . hd dvd take 30 seconds play . again , neglible wait ample rewards . i own sony 50 inch 50a2000 sxrd 1080p display , which no problems handshaking toshiba via hdmi output . i purchased 9 hd dvd watched 6 so far . every title except one ( terminator 3 - it nice , but expecting more relatively new film , since dvd looked so good ) ranged impressive stunning . thing('82 ) breathtaking . detail kurt russel beard , eye color , etc . popped . mutiny bounty looked like oil painting . willy wonka beautiful . lee marvin never looked so good dirty dozen ( minor film grain ) . it wonderful thing movie hd all extras one side disc , so far . i not seem miss player capable 1080p vs . 1080i , but technology drops price , i may further investigate matter . some(the ht guys ) say , lcd displays inherently progressive scan , so your set may making 1080i signal appear 1080p or close enough my liking . i wasn't willing pay extra $100 a20 find out , so please excuse my conjecture . hd dvd menus really fun , allowing one view them while movie still playing . yes , scan features fast-forwarding , rewinding little sluggish , but so first dvd players . price 1st ... or 2nd . i usually am playing hd dvd wowed picture resolution , not zip through it . some hd dvd titles offer zoom function , allowing you focus 2 , 4 or 8 times closer , however , it doesn't seem ready prime time . if you try pan around screen while zoom , player audio jitter lose sync , which reset stopping machine then hitting play again . again , i am not usually zooming around . i want theater experience my home , but it system limitation . upon reading numerous reviews regarding a2 upscaling potential regular dvd , i understandably curious . i own 2 upconverting dvd players , one panasonic one sony . both use hdmi connections . although panasonic seems brighter more colorful than sony , panasonic seems more combing noise . perhaps , i am not critcial , but it seemed close shave toshiba a2 my other upconverting players far regular dvd , so i can't say i blown away matter . i really like fact toshiba a2 digital clock , adjustable led display dimmer , very nice statistic data via display button(codec type , time , duration , chapters , available audio formats ) i am very happy pcm audio output my optical connection . i not hdmi switching my amp yet . bottom line : if you hdtv you want show off its 1080 resolution reasonable price you can't wait decent combo player or just want " wowed " budget , i wholeheartedly recommend this machine your home theater	1
aspiring triathlete self-admitted gadget freak , i'm always looking something new track my progress . this little device fantastic . i contemplating upgrading my polar hrm one " footpod " tracks speed/distance - but i'm glad i bought this instead . pro con's:pro's:1 . incredibly easy use , program , manipulate . my overriding thought since i got it polar could learn alot garmin . i've my polar s450 3 years still can't get it everything it supposed . 2 . lightweight , wristwatch style configuration imperceptible while wearing it . fact , it lighter than my polar hrm , which i wear other wrist . 3 . incredibly accurate . used it while biking other day ... distance other measurements right my cyclocomputer . 4 . very user-friendly software interface , uploading run takes seconds , without any additional user involvement other than plugging it into computer . 5 . price - very , very reasonable . con's:only one , it stretch ... can't use it while swimming . triathlete , i would liked able accurately measure my distance speed during open water swims . now i kinda wish i'd bought 405 ( built hr monitor ) . maybe when polar wears out ! great tool terrific value	1
this small gps receiver same length width my usb flash drive twice thick . but despite small size , this unit far ahead hp bluetooth gps receiver i previously used . it get satellite fix usually within 10-15 seconds . it even get satellite fix while indoors ( course not any real value but it just shows how sensitive unit ) . i put it my shirt pocket while driving still maintain signal . it small enough attach it my car keyring ( it slot loop type fob ) . way , i am using iguidance gps software my cingular 8125 mobile phone . it hold charge 8 hours charged car charger ( included ) or even usb port my laptop . usb cable , i use it gps receiver my laptop which not built-in bluetooth . so why only 4 stars ? well , it this strange instruction : ' it prohibited operate this system while driving your car ' huh ??? must ' lost translation ' episode taiwanese documentation . otherwise , i recommend this unit if you want very small but very capable gps bt receiver .	1

i love these cases . i bought one set try out thinpaking my dvds , then ordered 4 more rest . i currently own 157 dvds , so far i've moved 97 over these cases ( rest mostly box sets or already thinpaked ) . its very easy adjust covers fit these thinner cases , just trim 1-2 mms two sides , then slide it . i recommend using straight edge blade ruler or other straight guide get best results . every new dvd i get immediately get moved these cases future . my entertainment center no longer double stacked looks much neater	1
this cd player works well sounds great . all functions what you would expect shuffle actually plays randomly . i highly recommend this unit ; it cannot beat price	1
first downside:i've found bluetooth pretty much worthless . if you get link hold it works fine but i've never seen phone gps stay linked entire trip . unit lots buttons options , however so many buttons you cannot possibly hold unit without inadvertently hitting one them . now upside : gps works fantastic performing its main function , getting you where you need go . i replaced my roadmate 700 this unit i tell you i am impressed operation 6000t . i not expecting 6000t much better then 700 but i wrong . this unit picks up your position very quickly i yet see it drop signal while traveling . it everything my 700 but it it even faster better . considering i paid $1100 back when i purchased 700 i paid less then $500 6000t , i don't see how you go wrong this unit . it shame they couldn't get bluetooth right but when you take everything into account , i'm happy i decided go this gps .	1
i using this product month , so far i am happy it . drive so small amount data i carry arund , so i am afraid lose it . , secure ii gives me great sense security . secure ii 9mb . it saved drive just like any other files you save , not protected anyway accidental deletion . so you careful not delete it other unwanted files or reformatting . first thing i make backup entire folder my pc . secure ii runs without any installation your computer . it create vault areas flash drive . example , if you make vault area called myspace size 500mb , you find file myspace . lxv ( size 500mb ) created secure ii folder . even if vault empty , lxv file takes up 500mb available space flash drive goes down 1.5 gb . anything you save vault absorbed reserved 500mb space not reduce remaining space ( 1.5 gb this case ) . using file explorer , all file names , or any related data , saved vault not shown , it shows only myspace . lxv . vault only accessible when computer you insert drive logged administrator . i created vault my home computer tried open it work computer which i don't administrative privilege . vault access dimmed out secure ii , i could not retrieve files inside . product calls win2000 xp system requirement . i tried it windows me machine , flash drive itself worked fine but secure ii not run seeking dll file . i one complaint physical design . hole strap ( which not come product ) put cap , not body . you come home notice you've lost drive data stored it , but cap still securely attached string your brief case .	1
how many pictures it store ? it most commonly asked question digital camera enthusiast but usually question most difficult get straight answer . well , considering i worked memory industry over 7 years i help clarify this perplexing question so unbiased i since changed industries . simpletech sti-sd/256 256mb securedigital card sd , like most 256mb cards , store average 284 pictures when used 2 megapixel camera , 213 images when used 3 megapixel camera , 128 pictures when used 4 megapixel camera , 102 images when used 5 megapixel camera , 80 pictures when used 6 megapixel camera . these numbers based off assumption you going shoot your images highest quality jpeg setting available camera understand they estimates may off much 10 percent due numerous factors including complexity scene shot compression algorithm used your specific camera . i truly hope this review helpful you determining whether this card right capacity your specific needs	1

i originally looking $[ ... ] radios , but i concerned product durability quality fm/am reception . after reading some good reviews this sangean dt-300-vw , i decided jump higher price range try it . it great product , durable well worth price . i've used it 5-days week , more than 18 months now . i'm little hard it because i use it outside 30 minute jogs 45 minute bike rides . after all use , there just little static when adjusting volume control . 900mah rechargable batteries last more than couple weeks me . unit shuts off before batteries go completely dead , if you replace both batteries one time , you won't lose station settings . power lock good use either during activity , or when you store radio . i mostly listen fm music stations , am talk radio . reception fine both . clock alarm useful features . i keep case unit protection , but don't use belt-loop because it easily breaks off . unit small enough me hold my hand while jogging , or place my waist band while bike riding . i hate in-ear bud headphones , so i just purchased some regular external ones seperately	1
product exactly you would expect . drivers installed easily winxp(haven't tried vista yet ) , it compatible both software applications i wanted it . i use it primarily netstumbler , i've only one hiccup , but it com port conflict , so i can't really blame it device . your money , you can't go wrong	1
got mine two weeks ago all i say it just works beautifully . setup snap , no webpages or reading manual find out what default ip address , or anything like . i configured this thing 5 minutes literally ( i'm geek though ) not touched it since then . i'm using all features , cable router , wireless , sharing two disks printing ( using small belkin 4 port usb hub ) all this functionality just transparent my mac . wireless signal quality surprisingly good considering there no antennas hanging out device . also , disk sharing feature works quite fast over wireless , but you really feel difference if you wired though ( i'm using ) . it couple minor drawbacks my opinion , ( 1 ) lack gige , i don't care it but dealbreaker some guys ( 2 ) pricey if you just want router . although , if you think all features it makes sense spend few extra $	1

i recently purchased this item here , i so very impressed . it drastically improved quality my dvd player . you know difference quality when you switch watching regular tapes ( vhs ) dvd ? well , it same " step " when you watch dvds s-video , watching dvds s-video . my son said his playstation 2 looked 10 times better this s-video cord . it definatetly worth money ! highly recomended	1

my review this based my rating forerunner 201 unit itself . this just bracket , it works fine . however , you don't really need it if you don't mind simply wearing 201 your wrist . one caveat it , course , easier see unit when you riding if it mounted bike versus strapped your wrist . my recommendation if you going use 201 both running biking , don't buy this bracket because you simply wear 201 , plus then you don't deal trying remove wristband or making tight squeeze fit into bike bracket . but , if you buying 201 only biking , this may useful because then you could simply ditch wrist strap keep this mounted bike all times .	1
transferring first album my pc took roughly 5 hours . second took 3.5 hours , third 2 hours fourth 1.5 hours . learning software interface took inordinate amount time , even though i've interface programmer . after learning software , it appears every album cost hour record , mark songs , name songs write songs mp3 . if i want edit out song parts or eliminate pops/clicks , it take longer . it really time consuming software doesn't make it simple or intuitive . turntable reasonable quality . it just regular turntable built-in pre-amp . you turn pre-amp `on ' when recording your pc , turn if `off ' if you want use turntable your regular stereo	1

retrospect , i am not sure how well this worked . reviewer stated below , after couple years , when using my cordless phone , i started hear static , then eventually , i heard very loud , annoying pulse tone which person i called also heard . assuming line noise due my phone/dsl line , i called my telephone service provider check line . i thinking changing my dsl line filters or buying new phone ( assuming some problem my panasonic 2.6 ghz phone ) . when i figured out this device responsible , zapper went immediately into garbage . not sure what started problems ( bad battery ?, latent defect ? ) . end , am not sure how effective this device i still received plenty unsolicited calls . any case , this device not worth trouble cost .	-1

i wish it more storage capacity . controls fantastically easy figure out use right away . convenient lock switch keep you bumping button accidently during playback . runs single aa battery , not sure if i'll get battery life they promised but so far so good . ease use definately 5 stars , software fits controls well . connect puter usb cable unit shows up folder , couldn't easier manage content . sounds great plugged into some powerered speakers ! would 5 stars if it least 20gb this price .	1
life long bose basher here , good reason ! many years ago ( 1990 ) i bought bose acoustimas system . it stereo store it sounded amazing - i bought one took it home it sounded tinny , flat cheap . i found out bose charges ton pay their marketing . they still use paper speaker drivers ! i returned acoustimass system years later tried 1-2-3 system ( 2 years ago ) i hooked up new system underwhelmed . my sony 60 " xbr tv speakers sounded just good . i returned it bose store , sweraing never buy bose product . ( i buy some tri-port headphones which very muddy bloated sounding)well , 2 weeks ago i bose store i saw wave music system new acoustic wave system . guy store told me new ( larger ) acoustic wave system their best stereo system . i bought one $1079 took it home . it sounded horrible . harsh , flat not spacious ( this larger acoustic wave ) all ! i felt ripped off . it ugly , cheap looking sounded horrible . my tivoli model 1 sounded better . not loud but better . off bose store i go return it . ( let me also say 3 years ago i owned $ 25,000 stereo only system super high end tube amps , pre amps , $5k cd player , etc . it my dream system i sell last year i some money issues . i really missed my system . ) so i return bose look little , smaller wave music system . it sounded spacious , big depth it very pleasing . it sounded much better than their so called " best " system . i shocked bose would make $1079 product sounded bad much worse than their $500 system . i decided take home graphite give themn one last chance . took it home , set it up wow ! it looked great my table . very nice look i love it no buttons it . plugged it .... this what i looking ! deep , big , spacious , room filling sound just enough bass . it sounded amazing piano music , jazz , classical , vocals , big band ... i then threw some rock consisting ac/dc , kiss even metallica . it sounded very good . not good other music but still bass , sounded very very good . i finally happy bose product ! add this alarm function , auto dimming display small size you think $500 deal . i bought large backlit remote $39 go it next day . bose wave music system great sounding system . those who bash this new version never heard it , period . remember , i came $ 25,000 system nothing made me happy until this system . not this any way better or even comparable my $25k system , but it kills larger acoustic wave , tivoli model 1 , boston acoustics $500 set cambride set . ( yes , i tried them all)if you wanted wave system but afraid bad reviews , don't . this new version wonderful fills my house rich , clear , deep sound . throw some ricky lee jones , diana krall , frank sinatra amazed huge sound coming this litle box	1
it worked ok 2 months , but kb kept falling off . when i complained , i told kb not compatible my viewsonic v37 . yet , it advertised compatible vs ppc 2002 . worse came when i upgraded ppc2003 kb stopped working . i contacted targus told they not plans upgrading their kb drivers this vs ppc . i not believe this should permitted . if you sell something , stand behind it . very disappointing	-1

this mouse perfect size . buttons side easy press once you get used them . now whenever i use anyone elses mouse i'm always trying find those buttons ! they're very handy . also this mouse moves very smoothly . pros : smooth tracking , buttons scroll wheel aren't loud , perfect precision , colors look fantastic when they glow ( they aren't keep you up night bright ) , white very clean looking not get dirty or chip easy all . cons : gold usb plug doesn't work when i start up my computer sometimes so i unplug mouse , plug it back , then it works . also tray icon enabled buttons sides work but it doesn't really bother me ... over all i give this mouse 5 star rating because its very easy use , its not huge mouse . i smaller hands they fit perfectly here considering most mice made ( logitech , microsoft ) so huge . i buy razer mouse if this one ever goes out	1

excellent idea , fatally flawed implementation . it appears limitation midi controller - drums fail sound intermittantly . since this appears design issue , except my request support ion-audio.com:i found problem my new ion ied05 electronic drum set - drums appear conflict , perhaps midi interface ( update : definitely controller ) , perhaps within alesis controller . when playing drums , pad fail sound intermittantly ( occasionally , whole system mute momentarily ) . i hope this isn't first you've heard this issue , fix available . course , i've checked connections , checked sure i'm hitting pads squarely center , tried swapping pads ( though issue affects all them , not just snare ) , etc . if fact , i often reproduce problem simply , repeatedly striking any two pads together , one split-second after other . when it happens , second appears mute first , before first fully produces tone . ________________________until/unless this issue resolved , you'll find set cause repeated frustration , whether learning , practice or performance . ________________________4/15/05 update : after sending kit back ( twice ) , received brand new replacement - which same flaw . ion support all they could - this serious design problem . final verdict - alesys drum machine seems operate fine ( triggering keyboard via midi , no drop-outs ) , but trigger-to-midi device ( ion branded black box labelled iet01 ) must problem . perhaps ok kit learning , but fatally flawed way lead no end frustration , renders kit unsuitable performance	-1
beats me , i just got it yesterday but i'll update this review time passes . i hp they seem prone heat prostrate so i decided get this yesterday , especially since last year factory installed blower spent too much time kicking into emergency mode than i liked . this computer automatically turns factory fan up high when air temperature reaches 72 degrees it loud . vcool i bought staples only one third loud when turned up high . pros : high rpm . three speed selector switch . glows blue when turned -- pretty but who cares . low apparently is/almost , silent . high one third loud factory fan running full blast . apparently blows air it sucks-in straight up . also i seem remember some this air blown down -- not much . i'm not sure temperature difference , however my computerfan usually goes high speed six times day , today it turned only once . price fair -- no s/h charges . cons : so far , only one : they should included instructions device instead assuming everybody reach them internet down load . i hope i hooked mine up correctly . i'll add or take away this review when i know more -- bye ! it april 18 -- all well .	1

this would received 5 if it weren't horrible customer service cowon . buyer beware , set your expectations very low their support . all times i treated them respect , never cursed or acted irate , which i must say very difficult considering way they treated me , new customer . 1 ) only way " speak " support through online chat or email . they not working phone numbers support . 2 ) i received 1 player , doa . replacement player also doa . it literally took 4 weeks before i received working player since they not offer cross shipping defective products ( they email ups ground shipping label , once unit arrives it sits their queue 5 business days , then they send replacement via ups ground)3 ) it not matter how professional you treat support team , they treat you like you inconveniencing them . 4 ) they not let you speak supervisor , they only relay your chat them5 ) check better business bureau rating , its currently fi really don't like so negative cowon but this whole experience left me wishing they didn't such technological superior product . i encouraged them alter their treatment their customers , never received response . even sent them letter , no response . their players great , customer support worst i ever encountered	1

okay , so i just bought jbl scs- 145.5 speaker system they absolutely horrible ! i'm sorry say , but center speaker ridiculously underpowered/barely audible other satellite speakers ( which also weak tend get distorted higher volumes or lot audio going through them ) . subwoofer * very * good , however , so i guess price tag justified subwoofer ( that why i gave it 2 stars ) , but other speakers pretty much useless . just case anyone wanted know how these , i'd recommend staying away them maybe spending slightly more getting better system	1

i've read some different opinions these ' phones people said they don't fit your head ( this ridiculous since they're adjustable ) or they very easy break , which my experience it exact opposite . i've caught cord things numerous times , somebody knock them off my desk , somebody even sat them they still remain same when i first purchased them . no scratches , cracks , disconnections or breaks any kind . i would actually inform people these quite sturdy durable instead making it seem though they snap first wrong move . sound quality just amazing price others noted , they're much better all-around headphones than sony brand same price range . i tested both long periods time gave them each fair amount burn-in . end sennheisers much bigger bang your buck . them sounding like tin cans or even more laughable : sounding better when they're cupped your hands , those statements just entirely false reviewer already pointed out . sound becomes much worse when this because it takes away sonic accuracy spatial experience . maybe reviewer who said this needs some new equipment or better understanding way these headphones supposed work . when you buy open headphones ( which , way , reproduce better sound than closed pair ) you should know what you're getting fact people able hear what you're listening if they're close enough . quality much better , that difference it reason they made this way . if you're looking privacy , grab sony v6 . all all these well worth price tag definitely bring smile your face if they're your first , second , or even third dip into audiophile territory . however , you must keep moving up line if your expectations become too high . headphones this range only so much these most certainly get job tag attached them . sure give them fair chance lot burn-in before you judge them	1

i just needed small inexpensive radio good stereo headphone jack listen work better reception than my iriver music player this guy fit bill perfectly . amazon carries suprisingly few compact fm radios digital tuning aren't garbage . no matter , this exactly what i needed . reception far better than my music player , even antenna unextended , battery life phenomenal . i've this few months , listening it average few hours week i am still my first pair batteries . my only complaint it others noted , tuner volume knobs hyper-sensitive . full range volume barely audible too loud occurs over like eighth rotation knob . fine tuning stations chore because it go 101.10 mhz 101.15 mhz pretty much just breathing it ( it 0.05 mhz digital tuning resolution ) . since tuning knob side , it gets budged slighly every time you remove it included sleeve so you need re-fine-tune it receive your station everytime you take it sleeve which gets kind frustrating . overall quality radio many features belie its low price . four stars based its fm tuner capability alone	1

i've my old logitech mouse more years than i remember . past few weeks wheel started acting up i finally decided it time order new mouse . this one looked lot like old one so i ordered it . i plugged it it worked right away . so far so good . wheel worked great ! plus . pointer true wire long enough suit my needs . i thought i'd died gone heaven , but then annoying clicking mouse brought me back around . click , click , click .... i decided i could get used over time . then i realized this mouse not one buttons old one . simple push button i'd go back screen internet . new mouse round thing looks like button , but it doesn't anything -- it just decoration place show logitech logo . i'm so disappointed not " back " button any longer . i so spoiled years . i needed new mouse this one wasn't too expensive , so i'll keep it . not altogether pleased it though -- thus " 4 " star rating .	1

this tv huge . i originally planning purchasing 50-55 inch tv $2k price range . there lot value this tv . hdtv looks awesome . it even looks better than dvds playing through over component cables . this tv doesn't 1080p support ( it 1080i though ) , but you're not really missing anything because most hdtv programs aren't transmitted higher than 720p ( which this tv fully supports ) . this tv also supports cablecards if your cable provider them available . other semi-problem mentioned earlier there wasn't enough high end inputs ( hdmi , dvi ) , it true though there enough component inputs if you prefer . anynet function tv guide feature useless me , but it always nice extra features . one neatest features plugging my computer into tv through d-sub ( 15 pin monitor ) input . though some care made so you don't accidentally set resolution something can't displayed properly tv . it pretty finicky when it comes what resolutions displayed unlike regular monitor . one other minor issue i viewing angle . tv doesn't come stand , so some thought put into placement this tv . optimal viewing , you want able eye level center tv . overall , i am very satisfied this tv purchase recommend it very good dlp solution those don't need 1080p or lot higher end digital inputs . edit - newer 61 " 1080p model ( hl-r6168w ) samsung might more value only few hundred dollars more prices posted amazon today ( 4.3.06 )	1

bought over 2 months ago , i've yet get tired this little piece ingenuity . i looking multi-usb hub got targus notebook chillhub because it hub plus those fans . hub it works great even when connected only my laptop those low-end attachments like flash drives , etc . if i need more usb power and/or want utilize fans cool my notebook ( which it quietly well ) , i plug ac adapter . granted it bit smaller than my laptop sometimes slipped when i moved it , but i fixed small piece two-sided tape one corner . even if it didn't ( or i didn't use ) fans , its good keeping laptop off flat surfaces so heat doesn't get chance build up more destructive levels . my only beef adapter ( hence 4 stars ) , which should unplugged outlet it still pulls power even when disconnected chillhub . when adapter plugged , it gets very warm even when fans not . i'm not too sure it'll last lifetime chillhub . i also don't like its shape -- its size it made too wide taking over next plug well . overall , though , i'm very happy my purchase , which , time , almost half price found staples	1
i never enjoy reading long reviews so i'll get straight point . idrops works but like all stratch removers it needs time many applications . 5-10 minor stratches , 15-20 medium , 20+ deep ones ... don't worry this bottle literally thousand applications ... cloth you use idrops very important ... i recommend eyeglass microfiber cloth ... 1.50 walmart ... i tried using soft tissue paper it actually added more scratches ... okay , actual process ... 1 . use 2-4 drops time screen2 . take your microfiber cloth slow hard pressure go across screen3 . this 15 seconds stop ( after time it starts dry up dry idrops actually starts sratch your screen)4 . its important remember when you redo steps again you use different part cloth cause dry part restratches it . okay now thats it , it seems bit nit-picky but hey thats what it takes . you might end up running out room your cloth apply idrops so just wash it hot water throughly wring it throw it microwave minute go it again . make sure its dry . it could whole hour before you finally finish especially deep stratches . idrops looks like it makes your stratches little more faded each time . well thats all i got . enjoy your new looking screen . god bles	1

these seem solid , honest speakers . they won't win any design contests .

sandisk 4 gb cruzer mini sturdy reliable usb flash drive very reputable company . i've using 1 gb 4 gb over year back up transfer data various systems , no problems . drive requires no special drivers unless you using windows 98 . there green led base drive lights when it accessed . package includes 2 extra endcaps neck strap , drive ships 3 software applications installed . if you don't want use applications you just delete them recover small amount space they use . cruzerlock 2 data security software encryption , free version . i found its interface bit cumbersome , but it job . time-limited trial versions pocketcache ( backup software ) cruzersync ( outlook my documents folder synchronization ) software also installed drive . pocketcache some nice features , including tracking multiple history versions file , cruzersync makes backup email , favorites , etc . easier ; however version shipped my drive only works outlook , not outlook express . you find more information software going sandisk website viewing cruzer applications page . if you read more reviews net you'll find some complaints drive slow . there faster ones out there ( they cost more ) including sandisk titanium , but it never issue me . this drive compatible older usb 1.1 machines , still gives acceptable performance even speed . some people complain it easy lose endcaps ( 3 caps included ) . if you snap cap base while you're using drive , it lot harder lose . drives very sturdy - i accidentally stepped one without any damage . i've read two stories users accidently running drive through washer leaving it pocket . once it dried out , it worked fine no loss data . only negative point i've experienced if you want use neck strap , it difficult thread through eyelet drive . but bit patience , it doable , it only needs once . aware there lot counterfeit copies this product market . most negative reviews losing data , or drive malfunctioning traced counterfeit . sure buy reputable company like amazon or newegg , if you any doubts check serial number sandisk after you buy . i definitely recommend this drive , buy sandisk products again .	1

first product i ever bought razer one their copperhead mice . it expensive , but i impressed overall design quality product . i've mouse more than year now haven't any problems , even heavy use . when i heard razer branching out into pc audio , i naturally curious . so i decided pick up pair these headphones , their ac-1 sound card . again , they expensive but i felt i would makeup design quality . when i first opened box i found cord melted together few places , like wire insulator hadn't cooled properly before it rapped together plastic twisty . i also found if i pulled these bonds apart , they revealed bare wire . not good . so i sent it back , got replacement . when i opened second pair i found same thing , addition one fancy led lights not working . luckily , i able pull various bonds apart without revealing any bare wire . light still doesn't work though . i am , say least , disappointed razer here . i since read other reviews people complaining similar issues relating quality headphones . ( screws coming loose , volume control loosing responsiveness , etc . ) gamers particular tend use headphones hard don't appreciate when they " break " before their time . if i am going shell out much money headphones , i would like quality product reflect price	1

hp photosmart c5180 printer , hewlett packard brought market very good multifunction device great price point . although it doesn't seem part current hp product line any longer , it still great multifunction device deserves your consideration if you market new printer or multifunction device . you get lot features packed into one unit . printer scanner , there also set memory card slots accept most popular types digital camera memory . control panel features one touch access many functions , including copier functionality . small color lcd lets you adjust printer settings , make copies , configure onboard network interface perform basic photo editing printing functions . unlike any other printer i've seen before , hp includes some document " templates " printer memory . these templates let you make graph paper ruled sheets notebook paper . finally , there included ethernet interface , which lets you connect photosmart c5180 network use it multiple computers . out box setup easy . removing packaging tape inserting ink cartridges first time very straightforward process . inks click easily positively into place . when you've completed basic setup turned unit , you're ready start installing software connecting unit your computer . hp provides two options connectivity -- you use either usb or plug device into ethernet network . i used network connection . hp software found device immediately configured it no intervention my par t.t he included software bundle available pc macintosh computers . added bonus , macintosh version software universal binary -- , it runs both powerpc intel macintosh computers . hp software selection pretty well rounded . you get everything you need organize print photos , make scans adjust printer settings . i found software easy install able use it well within twenty minutes completing installation . if you use network connection , photosmart c5180 basic management web page used quickly check ink levels even perform immediate scan show up image your web browser . ink life excellent print quality very good . photographs printed this printer using special hp photo paper look just like professional prints hold up well handled . text documents not quite crisp those coming laser printer , but they still look very sharp clear . after printing several photos over 200 pages black text documents , only cartridge showed any drop capacity black one . all others still show completely full . unlike many printers , you won't break bank consumables . you buy all six ink tanks 150-pack small photo paper $36 usd . ink also purchased color , $8 usd per color or $12 usd black ink . this helps offset purchase price this printer . unfortunately , there some things not so great unit . starters , pc version software takes long time install . while stability intel version macintosh software nearly perfect , powerpc version didn't nearly so well . i saw lot unexpected crashes or applications disappeared outright , especially when managing photos my powerpc g4 mac mini . some people reported unit scanner not very good . scanner unfortunate tendency produce " noisy " scans , especially items lot dark colors . photocopies made using " black " copy button greenish cast them . i able solve this problem using " color " button copy black white documents instead . printer also moves very swiftly . this isn't problem much it notice caution . you should place unit only very sturdy table or desk , it moves quickly enough some printing modes it could possibly fall off or break what you've placed it . hp technical support could lot better . first one these units i purchased stuck " manufacturing mode " would not act normally . representative i spoke hard understand , didn't seem understand my problem couldn't offer any advice solve problem other than returning printer hp replacement . i returned it directly vendor instead . replacement worked perfectly every respec t.t his unit uses print heads separate ink tanks . while ink easily replenished , i saw no way replacing installed print heads . they look permanently installed , which suggests if they ever fail or become clogged , you may buying new printer . considering hp builds printers usually last very long time , this comes across me surprising decision their part . only time tell sure . finally , there some features i would liked see this unit . topping list would duplex printing module . some higher photosmart models this feature added . it seems like hp planned offer this c5180 well . internal web page " duplexer installed " field , back door completely removed . second would inclusion document feeder . network scanning functionality very handy , but it gets little tedious get up , walk across room change document scanner bed . again , higher end models photosmart lineup include this feature . all things considered , i find hp photosmart c5180 overall good product . it some areas where it needs improvement , but what product doesn't ? i don't think you go wrong this product , much what it very well	1

this ( it super cheap little brother ) some most hyped items audiophile land . i approached super-t skepticism : i mean it 10 wpc amp cheesy outboard power supply . how good could it ? answer very good indeed . my setup athena as-b 1.2 ( super cheap $99 speakers high 90db sensitivity ) , very good speaker wire ( straightwire maestro - yes it worth more than rest system - but it lying around ) g4 ipod losslessly compressed rips music forceful , tuneful , involving . this combo strengths jazz , female vocals , folk , pop , small ensemble classical stuff . hard rock orchestral stuff sounds little small . its zone competency very wide , however - within it bass rich great pace . trebles sweet extended . midrange lush tube-like incredible presence . vocalists sound like they're room i frequently stop what i'm doing ( system my kitchen - so i'm usually cooking ) listen - very good sign . this level musicality this price outstanding . this system blows away my mid-level system dynaco stereo 70 amp , nht model zeros . i swapped dynaco ( classic tube amp 35 wpc ) into kitchen system immediately noticed loss bass impact high end clarity i enjoyed sonic impact . caveats ? first all - it very low powered amp . means you must use very efficient speakers or it not bloom . second , your output only good source . make sure you use source great resolution or you're just wasting your time . i've heard you upgrade power supply get better sound . it wouldn't surprise me . this unit begs tweaked general . i attest it sounds great out box . this isn't true integrated amp . it offers only one input . only controls volume knob power button . me this ideal . you don't need pre-amp ! cheaper sonic impact amp doesn't binding posts ( uses clips ) plastic body smaller power supply smaller on-board caps . it also only $40 - but tweaking manditory unit . i think extra money well spent this one . considering sonic impact/athena as-b 1.2 system less than $250 rivals serious systems - i don't see any competition stay-at-home ipod system purpose-built ipod systems . cd/dvd player would also make excellent front end . this giant killer ? i don't know . i didn't put it up agains arc classic 60 my family room . i don't think it fair put $140 amp up against kilo-buck gear . sub $1000 price range it monster paradigm shifter - even given its limitations . if you listen right music - right ancillary gear , you not disappointed	1
i bought this phone used , ebay , 2 1/2 years ago . i lot reading before i bought it found there known issue battery life handsets . everyone mentioned battery life , there solution . when i bought phone , station 2 handsets $60 ebay . i immediately ordered 2 energizer er-p511 nimh batteries replace panasonic throw aways . i battery life problem my previous panasonic phone set , but , this set never dies ! my family talked hours single charge left handset few interesting places , only found again paging system plenty battery life . 2 hours talk time , it still shows two bars . voice quality not best , but , it not bad either . i use vonage no one tell i'm not traditional line . it definately better than any 2.4 ghz phones out there . range more than i need so i can't complain it . i go corner my back yard opposite side house base station experience minimal static . i've gone so far walk end our street ( cul de sac ) still enough coverage carry conversation , although it weak signal point . overall , i would given phone 5 stars if i didn't provide my own batteries make it useable .	1

we received leadsinger kit last christmas really enjoyed it lot . my family ages : 50 year old dad ( me ) , 44 year old wife/mom , 12 year old son 9 year old daughter . everybody even more fun since getting " classic rock " cartridge because we know lot more songs original vinyl or cd recording reference when we want . only real drawback i think this , or any other " leadsinger " collections there no " master index " songs which tabulates all their collections . this would really help find what you looking , especially if you don't know classification leadsinger uses song . instance , it " classic rock " or hit " 90 " ? one other thing leadsinger could ( this minor ) package plastic case cartridge . cartridges small , not same size any other similar item ( e.g. digital camera flash cards ) , you no place store these leadsinger if your leadsinger mic full cartridges . fun	1
first , let me say i could not review this product completely it quit working after 20 scans ( 30 minutes after charging it first time ) . i chance perform scans 100 , 200 , 400 dpi well black white , 12- 24-bit color . i also able install software import 10 scans into my computer . it scan photos well ( both 200 400 dpi ) , but it tough get images scan perfectly vertical . higher resolution higher color ( 24 bit ) , scanning process took long ( 12 seconds full page ) . when scanning 200 dpi 12-bit color it took 8 seconds per page . also , scanner actually turns off after each scan , thus it takes 15-20 seconds button pushing reboot device before scanning page . importing 7 images device my laptop ( while it still working ) took 4 minutes . ocr software ( paperport ) good , but scan quality ( black white 100 dpi ) too poor allow it functional . 8mb internal memory not enough 128mb or 256mb expansion card definitely needed . what i most shocking very poor craftsmanship . there seams device where plastic glued . one two main buttons recessed into device . also , indicator lights misaligned overlying symbols . i cannot emphasize enough how poorly made this . i am returning it full refund ( 30 day money back 90 day exchange - if bought planon ) . not buy this product ! addendum ( april 20th 2006 ): i very difficult time dealing planon company . return this product within first 30 days get full refund , you must first get authorization which required no fewer than 7 phone calls 5 e-mails . once i finally returned it , they said they credited my charge when they never . upon calling them they said it would " take some time " see credit come through ... 6 weeks ago . they not return phone calls or e-mails order return this it required alot time effort . there business practices ( product quality , customer service , return policy ) poor best . i re-emphasize : not buy this product	-1

aluminum alloy way if you want avoid fan cooling your hard-drive . this well design very sleeks looking case . i seen lacie other external hard drive manufactures using acomdata case . firewire usb 2.0 more compatible older laptop like mine , which only use firewire slow usb 1.1 . yes there on/off switch , which some external too cheap put . there plastic grill front let air through . very easy setup big screws . one issue i noticed since using this case sound insulation . i got noisy seagate hard-drive slim aluminum case no sound insulation , which quiet loud time . my old western digital plastic case quieter hard-drive . so sound level not all fan , it also include hard-drive mechanics . overall it good buy .	1

i recently went through thorough research new phone system , going through research test purchases . main criteria : 1 ) good sound quality ( most decent cost ones okay ) 2 ) very good handset speakerphone quality ( can't stress how important this me , how different quality among brands/handsets ) 3 ) work voicemail ( like sunrocket ) message waiting indicator . if system answering machine it can't voicemail message indicator light . most other features pretty common across models/brands . battery life okay not great most 5.8 ghz systems . best phone i've 900mhz dss sanyo bought 1997 , but they stopped making or selling us . i wasn't looking cheap upto point price wasn't concern . winner : uniden 9465 . any uniden 5.8 ghz digital systems using tcx905 handset same , just different feature sets . i tried panasonic 5.8 ghz high end system , pretty close , handset speakerphone quality slightly worse decider . talking callerid seems like great idea but hopelessly badly implemented panasonic systems . talks too late , after 2 rings taks nonsensically most time . i'm getting classco 9900cw box see how it works . new uniden dect phone build quality atrocious . ge dect phone ( walmart ) horrible . didn't try others , including motorola	1

look price up there . this calculator sophisticated number-crunching gizmo handle 99% standard calculator use . need feature that not available ? good news , this fella programmable . it powers itself freely available light , but yet battery when lighting conditions paltry . its interface lovely thoughtfully conceived , it weighs less than your checkbook , it surprisingly durable : throw it around , let your aunt marge step it , rub it beef give it dog while ... end it'll still work . all , it costs less than pizza . back 1972 , hewlett packard released their hp-35 calculator ( four standard arithmetic functions twelve transcendental functions ) , it cost $395 . don't forget inflation , because translates roughly $2100 2007 . calculator changed world , now here calculator leaves hp-35 dust -- terms speed functionality -- less than 1/100th cost . sure , there lots feature-rich calculators you buy check-out line walgreen only few bucks , so you're probably wondering what makes this calculator so special . if you consider ( ) its price , ( ) its feature set , ( ) its overall utility , this calculator currently apex , folks . * long * way . its there several years . speaking calculator snob , i'm usually unimpressed anything less than classic hp , but far complete package goes , this calculator surprisingly beautiful . i own two them ; one keep my bookbag , one " just case " . this guy , you're getting lot bang very few bucks . it might not graph , it might not perform symbolic math , it might not use rpn or precision-engineered keypad double-injection-molded keys -- above all it certainly not computer -- but it currently best value out there utility scientific calculators nothing else comes close .	1

i purchased this radio week ago disappointed poor reception . my case , am reception poor . fm reception , built antenna ok , but , radio not go digital unless it strong signal . i recommend antenna like . crane ' fm reflect ' . after i connected crane antenna , fm better than my component fm receiver similar antenna . i am now receiving most all los angeles stations ( 45 miles away ) good digital reception . some stations offer three digital channels , i get those . kenedit added : i connected " terk technology am-1000 advantage passive am indoor antenna " this radio able get standard am reception up quality my other radios . note connecting antenna , connections appear polarized . if you get poor reception terk then switch wires around . sound quality even standard am best i heard any table top radio .	1
optical cable airport express makes huge difference sound quality when compared analog cable comes it . now i barely tell difference playing cd my stereo versus playing through airport express . it makes complete sense why cable would sound far superior : signal received computer airport express digital , if signal travels through analog cable it converted analog , thus losing some quality . optical cable lets digital signal continue all way through your stereo receiver . if you currently airport express hooked up your stereo , yourself favor upgrade cable , just make sure you optical input jack your stereo before buying it	1

i recently puchased this phone replace older uniden cordless phone . i've overall pleased uniden phones our home , so i didn't hesitate buy this one , especially since i difficult time finding white phone this price range didn't answering machine . i'm pleased quality reception . i've none clicking or static other reviewers experienced . sound rather clear . example , my husband called me today his cell phone rural upstate michigan , reception uniden phone excellent . ring volume tone good not annoying . my only complaint phone although it made go wall , it look bit strange . i bought this phone my kitchen , wall mount rather high up wall ( 6 feet ) . phone base small , so it doesn't cover entire mount like my old uniden . result , i only attach phone top hook mount not both mounting hooks , so i make sure it stays straight manually . also , it actually sits cradle , so phone base juts out wall . it not hazard our house , but it visually taking some adjustment could problem if your mount lower wall . also , my last uniden phone came normal phone cord short phone cord wall mounting . note this phone not come short cord . ** update ** - we've now this phone 4 months , i can't wait get rid it . if i talk it more than few minutes , sound receiver goes almost all way out so i can't hear other person talking . then it come back , go out , etc . we love our other uniden phone , but we're definitely getting rid this asap	1

i owned this projector almost year half . let start pros : its projector . it projects . i am using it 9.5 ft screen my bedroom . thats it section . now onto cons : within month , dvd player stopped recognizing any type media placed it ( dvd , dvd-r , cd ) . it not load . i own alternate dvd-player , i just hooked one up ignored problem , hoping would end my difficulties ( shipping back company repair comes out my pocket , eventhough its under warranty , not " television " watch period wasn't beneficial ) . next issue came head 8 months after purchase when turning it one day , motor ran very loudly ( noise-level you speak almost yell when sitting beside person which you conversing ) . color also seemed off ( reds appear muddy brown , image much darker without variating tones , i.e. naturally high contrast ) . this more than takes thrill out watching bloody horror flix . only source reduced buzz when using it computer monitor , but this still very loud , especially start-up . since then , this only way i watch my movies , through dvd-rom my computer projecting horrible image wall . my computer speakers also provide much better sound than built-in system speakers , which very necessary use order hear anything over loud buzzing ( if you close your eyes , you would think it chainsaw)the picture itself also very dim . i two narrow windows my room , both mini-blinds curtain , yet it still difficult daytime watch anything isn't bright cartoon . ( back my love horror movies , this causes dilemma)finally after saving up enough money purchase replacement , i am epson powerlight 76c shipped me . hopefully this projector last longer than optoma . i highly recommend researching other projectors before buying this one . just because it built dvd-player , don't let win you over . it just easy hook-up external dvd-player better projector . i purchased this 9.5 ft screen home shopping network 2200$ . talk pricey ! next time i won't so hasty purchase anything . this piece junk . try epson powerlight 96c . i researched read many good things this projector . it costs less , lumens 2000 , 1000 more than optoma , meaning you watch dark movies during day . hook up your own cheap $20 dvd-player . i guarantee you even cheapest dvd-players last longer than this system built-in one . go quality not cheap hooks	-1

i purchased this agp run 3d software occasionally not really games . i updated bios , directx , video drivers before installing card loading it support software . manual general manual wasn't specific my card . it recommend exiting hardware wizard running ati install . amount software installed overwhelming unnecessary . all you need catalyist drivers . not file player , all-in-one-wonder , remote-wonder , multimedia library , unless you plan watch tv pc . ( i don't ) . card no fan but large heat sink . i sempron 3100+ 1 gb ram , additional cooling fans 300 watts . all system shutting down overheating . i lessen resolution refresh rate no avail . card showed rich cooler built 3d configuration , pc check screen savers worked no problem . but just doing web surfing , playing quicktime , running 3d screensaver causes overheating . no games . video payback choppy . my onboard video came motherboard outperformed card but can't run 3d . test , card couldn't run even most basic 3d game demo even it lowest detail settings . i returned card after . overheating shutdowns went away . it maybe great card larger systems but budget system it performance killer . it overheating issues . support software little prevent system crashes .	1

i given zune gift , recently . this isn't first mp3 player i've owned but it one largest capacity store data i've owned . up front i'll tell you i'm not hardcore ipod junkie , nor am i apple kiss-butt . i believe products work . said i see why people prefer ipod over zune , though i say zune isn't deserving some bashing i've read these boards people who believe it cool bash microsoft products just because they made microsoft . good1 . zune large , bright lcd screen easily seen sunlight . video picture quality good . 2 . sound quality good . factory earphones adequate delivering music though i pair philips earphones far superior only cost $20.3 . box includes data cable you need syncing . 4 . interface super easy use it easy get around zune environment i've not any music skipping problems 1.3 firmware automatically downloaded when i synced my pc . 5 . unit itself feels solid when held , slightly heavy though not too heavy . 6 . software loaded without problem my winxp sp2 system i no problem syncing machine when connected usb port rear pc . i all my non-itunes songs added player within minutes . 7 . zune allows you beam songs , pictures movies other zune players range . first generation player , it gets job nicely i look forward seeing what generation 2 bring . not so good1 . when i connected zune 4 port usb hub pc didn't recognize it there . i connect it back pc usb 2.0 port order get it work . maybe that design , though i'm not sure . once i this i no syncing problems all . 2 . i've never found zune range share anything . leaving wireless seems drain battery faster . i'd recommend turning this feature off until more people buy zune ( if happens ) . 3 . you can't buy music or movies wirelessly . 4 . although zune wireless it not compatible your home or business wireless lan . 5 . you can't browse internet zune . 6 . zune software no problem getting your music onto device , though zune marketplace vastly understocked compared itunes music store . 7 . zune cannot get music purchased through itunes ( this nitpicky , i know , but would so nice ) . there way work around this - you burn your itunes songs disc then turn around rip disc pc mp3s then import them zune , which i would rather than pay money re-purchase music i've already bought once . 8 . there no way re-organize files your zune once they uploaded device . say example i want throw couple pictures into picture folder so when i view my pics i don't scroll down forever day see them . i delete pic zune through pc software , add pic folder i want then sync pc player . folder added zune library order update occur . 9 . there no way change orientation photos or movies when viewed . i would like able flip them counterclockwise or clockwise 90 degrees view them portrait view instead turning player its side view landscape mode . one reason why this important when i set one my pics my zune background , i'd like able see just how much pic cut off since zune doesn't resize pic fit . oh yeah , that thing ... 10 . pics used zune background don't option re-sized fit screen . what i would like see change zune ( more microsoft than anyone else)1 . options re-sizing pics fit zune screen2 . options changing orientation pics movies3 . ability organize my files zune without delete file re-sync . i'd like able this player software both . 4 . since i use usb port back my pc longer sync cable would nice . 5 . put built-in wireless good use . slap compact internet explorer allow viewing web pages email ! you don't need keyboard view read-only content like weather , news sports it would really add player value6 . allow zune able buy music , pics video without connect pc . again , make use wireless capability zune . 7 . something zune marketplace - it just needs overhaul . it needs additional music , movies definite bump cool factor . 8 . make it easier customize outside zune . you this additional customizeable faceplates xbox 360 - same this player . if you hadn't noticed - individuality here stay	1

if you looking ipod alarm system this your machine . reviewer comments good sound quality mark . but it one serious design flaw least how i wanted use it i'm returning mine . i thought it dual ipod/radio alarm system , advertised . it not . radio alarm only second alarm , apparently second sleeper . you cannot select two options . tried work around setting second alarm go off first but you can't not set ipod alarm so when it ( or buzzer ) goes off it shuts down radio . can't understand why they couldn't worked around this issue but beware if you want choice flexibility what you wake .	1

i've this keyboard little over month . i'm college student purchased ppc so i carry my notes important dates , information , etc my pocke t.t ypically , keyboard , intention using ppc notebook , necessary . pro pretty much pinxet mentioned , there not much i add . however his cons somewhat ... insulting intelligence hp customers . bt_kb comes off button . same button you use turn it turns it off . further experiment this , if you press it once , establish connection ipaq then press button second time pop-up appear informing you keyboard disconnected . also , if you press button twice then your ipaq search it , it not find i t.t he little lock keep keyboard flat , pinxet mentioned , useless . " / " button ( also " ? " ) curiously placed right shift ( normal qwerty keyboard it left shift ) . so if you use forward-slash or question mark frequently you adjust your writing get used unusual position key . ( where " / " would normally you fingers type up-arrow key . so what ultimately ends up happening , when you want type question mark , you hold down shift , press up , highligh one line text continue typing removing line text . fortunately ipaq word processor comes undo function . ) my only other concern i seem problems connecting keyboard my cell phone . phone identifies keyboard establishes connection , but beyond i can't seem get keyboard type anything . students anyone intending use ppc pc ( perhaps pocket laptop ) , this keyboard priceless . i use it four five times day . ( such , i would highly recommend purchasing two pairs rechargable batteries it . next time maybe hp built lithium battery , like all other accessories electronics	1

average going price this product $50 . -$60 . price quoted herein $600 . so far beyond what might considerable reasonable it ludicrous . doesn't amazon any standards their third party vendors ? whether or not you disclaim responsibility third party suppliers , they appear amazon web site , nothing prevent amazon associated such chicanery . allowing such postings unworthy amazon . number years i held equity position amazon , fully understand , generally approve using additional sources products your customers want , i understand meaning caveat emptor , but this embarrassment	-1

i've my pmc-120 little over 1 month am pretty happy it . there few features microsoft could improved : user customizeable eq , more than one playlist created device , last playlist recall when returning music ( video or tv ) . overall unit functions well great taking all my media road me . once windows media player configured my pc , all my synchronized recorded tv content converted background before i wake up morning . before i leave , i just plug sync minute or so i'm good go . only other nit-pick i would processor or i/o performance seems issue when loading album cover tracks . example , if i change next track increase volume , volume response take 2 - 3 seconds while album cover loaded . this little irritating sometimes when i want skip through several tracks . spite this , i like unit i'm happy it . maybe ms/iriver provide firmware update address lack features above	1

i just needed small inexpensive radio good stereo headphone jack listen work better reception than my iriver music player this guy fit bill perfectly . amazon carries suprisingly few compact fm radios digital tuning aren't garbage . no matter , this exactly what i needed . reception far better than my music player , even antenna unextended , battery life phenomenal . i've this few months , listening it average few hours week i am still my first pair batteries . my only complaint it others noted , tuner volume knobs hyper-sensitive . full range volume barely audible too loud occurs over like eighth rotation knob . fine tuning stations chore because it go 101.10 mhz 101.15 mhz pretty much just breathing it ( it 0.05 mhz digital tuning resolution ) . since tuning knob side , it gets budged slighly every time you remove it included sleeve so you need re-fine-tune it receive your station everytime you take it sleeve which gets kind frustrating . overall quality radio many features belie its low price . four stars based its fm tuner capability alone	1

this amazing value . i all set purchase same system ebay when i checked amazon . not only price low any listing auction site , but it included shipping no cos t.t he system very well packed . someone put lot thought into getting this product china my house without damage . setup breeze . no need get your kids show you how connect speakers . well thought out . calibration process using enclosed microphone positively excellen t.t he sound overall very good . probably not up bose , but then consider cost differential . my one complaint disk changer . loading more than one disk verrrry slow . so slow i thought system defective . drag out kid figure it out . this why i gave it 4 stars instead 5 . cocolalla , idah	1

when shopping external storage , i wanted something not only provided lot gb my dollar , but would also provide redundancy . after all , external hard drive no more reliable than internal drive your computer , i've far too many hard drive crashes lost data it happen again . this device perfect combination . raid 1 configuration , each unit two disk drives contains exact copy data , so if one fails you need only replace one drive rest easy , because data safely stored secondary disk . i also read western digital send out replacement drive so you replace it yourself , eliminating need send your precious remaining drive some factory somewhere . just keep mind this configuration , you only 500 gb storage since both disks contain same data . i also wanted triple interface . i couple macs firewire 400 ports , i pc usb 2.0 . someday if i buy newer mac it may firewire 800 , this external drive ready them all . it took only minute install software my mac book pro , most time spent doing reboot ( unfortunate drawback , first time i've ever reboot after installing new software ) . noise : there lot negative comments noise , but considering all benefits i went ahead took plunge . boy am i pleased decision ! there brief power-up fan noise when device first connected power , but after it whisper quiet . i type this review , i'm middle moving 20 gb old files drive there no noise whatsoever . there few drawbacks too . marketing literature promotes unit capacity meter built into led indicator . you must drive connected computer driver installed this feature work , making it mostly worthless my case ( where i connect multiple computers , some no drivers installed ) . sometimes drive goes sleep upon long period inactivity , takes 5-10 seconds wake again . this minor annoyance , but nowhere near deal breaker . here my positives negatives : pros- great amount storage price- raid 1 means no more lost data- wd offers advance replacement failed disks- triple interface offers excellent flexibility- whisper quiet , aside brief power-on fan noisecons- capacity meter mostly useless- drive sleeps long inactivity wakes slowlyconclusionoverall i would highly recommend this drive anyone looking external storage built redundancy great price . i feel 100% confident knowing my data properly mirrored digital content ( which i invested money ) also safe years come	1

i just took over 500 pictures this camera while i trip europe . i learned lot it process . it some nice features : it lightweight , durable , easy plug remove zaurus , it really impresses people . you store thousands pictures 480x320 resolution , or ten thousand 128mb sd card . downside , it drains battery quickly , picture quality varies so-so fairly bad . camera unusually picky lighting level - it poorly low light , also poorly mixed bright/dark lighting . if you get lighting right , it take " acceptable " pictures . if you're kind person cares picture quality , you're not going like output much . if you're like me , just taking [ inexpensive ] pictures stick your homepage , it works like charm . i'm glad i bought it	1
