first game we played gamecube spongebob , battle bikini bottom . we absolutely loved it my daughter plays it over over . thinking shrek 2 would similar , we rented it . it very hard control c-stick it kept zooming out wouldn't rotate camera except certain times . charactors very distant even if we used c-stick zoom , it still wasn't close enough . it same feeling needing put eyeglasses see something more clearly ! aspect we didn't like four charactors always together you would lose track which one main charactor . maybe we're spoiled because c-stick spongebob allowed you rotate every direction see what around you graphics so good you could see facial expressions . it surprising all reviews so good because our impression completely opposite .	-1
then this not work your console . but if you huge old ps2 console then this work you console . if you slim console then you should get game shark	-1
my friends i high hopes this game . we played cod2 multiplayer every week excited new shooter . after playing cod3 few rounds we decided put 2 back . graphics great , but we found lot bugs . there some shading problems helmets made them turn white certain distance . that fine if you want un soldier , but not if you're trying sneak up somebody . muzzle flashes almost none existent . no blood splash like cod2 . single player game isn't too bad so far , but if you plan multiplayer i would recommend renting it first . we opinion game rushed , maybe they'll patch it	-1
if you need remote turn tele run 360 , this . but it won't operate dvr , dvd , vcr or cable box . if you're really keen it , i'll sell you mine .	-1
this remote awful quality ; i've through two them past year . i wouldn't complain so much if it didn't cost $30 ! it worth ten , most . most people would better off buying cheap dvd player , rather than using xbox	-1
everyone seemed really excited this game ; supposed great launch title , etc . turns out red steel fails deliver like dominoes during hurricane . graphics meh ( ubisoft could way better ) , controls bit awkward . this isn't because wii controller itself ... played zelda wii sports , i say controller works very very well . so i am inclined think bulkiness shooting red steel , fact using your sword more like clubbing baby seal then fighting grace master samurai , game design , not any fault controller . storyline isn't amazing either . pretty straight-forward neverending quest save your girlfriend ( brownie points if you got pop culture reference ! ) , shoot lot japanese people process . nothing innovative see here , move now . it could lot better . i'm selling this one back ebgames getting trauma center instead . disappointing launch title .	-1
amazon . ca --------- action replay max more than just video game enhancer ( vge ) .... or least it claims . my version quite old yet but it claims include region-free dvd player memory card compression utility ( squeeze more saves onto your memory card ) . i not used either these features personally , but i heard horror stories memory manager corrupting gamesaves whole memory cards ; some reusable , some permanently damaged . this fact you must load up action replay software access saves use memory manager turned me off using it . however , real reason i bought armax its codes i'll get those second . armax , like newer gamesharks , loads its software cd . this major annoyance me . every time you load game you must insert armax memory card ( which i don't know what ) cd , go sit couch wait software load , choose your codes , then get up put actual game dvd wait it load . you can't simply turn your ps2 go sit down . old days cartridge gaming you would snap vge game console so you could turn console go sit down . early generation gamesharks little box would attach expansion slot ps1 or n64 it . if you wanted it load before game , you turned its switch . even if armax perfect every other way ( it not , btw ) , it would get maximum 4 stars long you boot it cd first . i mean , why can't memory card part it least hold codes even just current game you're playing after system shut off or reset so you don't load software every @mn time . ok , rant over . codes . user interface armax better than gameshark . functionally , they very similar course , but armax just feels cleaner easier use . it offers beginner interface includes descriptions code functions ( not user-entered ones though , if i remember right ) , more robust expert mode . big advantage , theory , armax over gameshark its ability update itself using your ps2 broadband connection . upshot you download new codes your favorite games fairly quickly instead manually typing them all using controller . dark cloud go this silver lining you no control over which codes you download ; its all or nothing . since these updates stored your memory card ( not armax one ) , it quickly fill up codes gamesaves games 99% which you never play ! no wonder armax option come 16 or 32mb space its memory card . it store all useless codes ! any entered codes you choose apply either work , nothing , or lock up game . i come across all , though armax credit , mostly former . absurd choice forcing you download save updates every game ps2 library , when you may want just one , loses armax star . note manually entering codes : sub-headings folders game their own codes must entered if you want them show up game code list . finally , mentioned reviews bret morris glenn nichols ( amazon.ca ) , armax initially not work new revision fat ps2 couple years ago all . this happened me well . i returned three ps2s two armaxes before i realized it defect all current versions ( time ) armax . i send away get new disc direct intec which now works well expected . since armax shelves several years since i bought mine , i assume any bought today would not this problem . however , time there no way find out this problem without contacting intec personally . retailers not aware problem no notices posted codejunkies web site . this inadequate treatment widespread problem drops armax down two stars . my opinion , if you're market vge , both armax gameshark their pros cons . i would assume both released newer versions newer features than ones i . looks specs , assume nothing , don't afraid e-mail companies requesting details regarding any features you questions . i apologize length this review , but i find there very few in-depth reviews vges web or print . maybe reviewers feel they above using vges , i don't know .	-1
this product not designed 360 team , really most products aren't aren't very good your 360 . this no exception , it known actually damage , destroy your 360 . statement 360 representative not but this product , it caused numerous problems lot people . mainly because it actually draws power 360 , that not good , leads lot other problems .	-1
i agree other reviewers graphics vocals good , but i find gameplay itself less than stellar . starters , i've always irritated games don't let you save your status whenever you want . sometimes i just want get quick dose gameplay , but that not possible these games require you play through entire section before allowed save . contributes repetitive , tedious nature some sections . if you get stuck getting through certain bit game , you're doomed replay much what led up it over over again . i realize tricky camera angles some challenges supposed exist this game . more than earlier versions , however , i trouble getting myself lined up whatever task . tedious element . i found this game more test my endurance patience than actual fun	-1

i try keep this brief ... way i'm only 10 hrs thru ... only just got out city #1 rabernastre , dalmasca now city #2 bahjerba ( sp ? ) : quickly , my first impressions game strange ... i like " meh i dunno if i want keep playing ... " but after maybe 20 min getting ' wierdness ' it really sucks you . ughh i really wish i didn't midterms coming up so i could go home play ! pros : - love battle system ! it still strategy but it doesn't require you random battles ... ughh i'd hate " whzzzhhh " starting random battles ... i still feel control but doing less actual work . - like everyone else says , cg always good . - story ... though not much character development/focus previous ones , i like whole war/polity centered plot . it follow fft tradition . - i actually like license board ... some people said it pain beginning , but so far it hasn't case me ... granted i very early game decide level up vaan bit ( ~ 40 min or so ) . you really just need know only use board when you really need ... don't randomly buy spots board just things become available its difficult one person learn everything . plan , plan , plan . ( right now way i'm constructing my chars way game hints ... its only one way it , but first time around i'll follow it ... already licensed equipment/abilities hint what they'll good . )- huge game . lots stuff see ... quite beautiful . - character design ... course there always someone love ... ( har har har ... fangirl i must say i love basch :d lol ... tho i love babyface earlier ff characters i think vaan too babyfaced . he looks like kid . -- haha i'm college student such fangirl ... haha ... sad isn't it ? -- if i guy , i'd say i'd like fran most ... this course subject personal opinion . )- i like subs i like how they not bland ... they fancy font this time :d . ( kinda reminds me nochnoi dozor . ) makes game really movie-ish . - widescreen capability ... ( looks sweet my widescreen pc monitor . )- course everyone always talks realism selling pelts what not ... i also like . - free-moving camera ... thank heaven . i love it . i hated still camera immensely ffx . - cute monsters ... lol love cactuar like monster rogue tomato ! - also love how you avoid some boss moves skillfully moving around them . cons : - huge game ... ( yes also con ) ... lots time running around . good thing all characters don't run painstakingly slow tidus ffx . meh ... neutral : - voices - i dunno what up people liking previous ff voice actors but anyhoo i thought this time there better ones . prev . ff voice actors okay but not great . here voice actors really good , but choice some them seems strange ... like i problem fran voice ... it strange choice strange voice . also balthier voice doesn't seem go his look , but i really like voice acting itself . ( sum , some voices , though really well acted , didn't seem fit actor look ... however , i favor good actors mismatched roles over okay actors well-matched roles so i give voice acting mild thumbs up . ) after reading review which mentioned mispronunciations , i feel i must also address ... someone who speaks some french i twitch when i heard " marquis " pronounced both " markus " " marquis " rather than " markee . " i also twitch when they pronounced " fete " " feet " rather than " feh-t . " - soundtrack - i liked all music ( there lot ) taken fft ... esp battle music estersand , i think it ... totally taken fft ( obviously both take place same world ) ... i enjoy non-midi renditions themes ... but rest new guy music just ' meh ' ... wasn't particularly bad , but it didn't really stand out much either	1

this game mysteriously hilarious always fun play . you don't exactly " finish " it , like other video games , but always trying beat your fastest time , so it doesn't get old fast . matter fact , we wore out our last copy this our second . i love it i'm parent ! my kids i play it together cheer each other . only thing i would change make two-player part funner stop giant messages pop up cover whole screen occassionally . i would keep them corner instead . overall , highly recommend this game . more than your money worth	1

i throughly enjoyed this game . voice acting may not greatest , but i think gameplay really well atmospheres fantastic . controls take some getting used too not everyone . they problem could better control , surprisenly i it very well . major problem i game progresses it gives you less times save , so you go through almost entire level ( though short ) complete it without saving once . so stupid because if you die end you entire level over again , dumbest thing ever video game . i just feel it unfair game makers make fairly difficult level then make you it over over if you slip die toward end . stupid , stupid , stupid . levels bit difficult if you're not one quick trigger . much i gripe camera angles , they're useful stopping max end hall , swing camera around see if enemy around corner , waiting steps , right inside next room , etc . it gives you heads up makes it easier stay alive . however , i still really liked it . i didn't enjoy mp2 much , but mp3 ( which should end series i think ) should , ( re : should ) much better . i'm looking forward it .	1
i always loved mario , when i purchased my new nintendo ds lite , i bought this it . this game absolutely amazingly fun ! graphics , sound , game itself incredible . this game good any adult or child . although younger child , it might bit more difficult possibly frustrating . ;) this game you try some harder levels over again , possibly again after . but every time you try again , you understand something new level , it really fun . there also features becoming mega mario mini mario which mixes things up every once while . this game wonderful , definitely great buy .	1
yeah this game really fun , just gets extremely hard times towards end . little over 10 hours into it , kind short i guess , but each mission might take you few tries complete . plus fact you might spend 30 tries some like i . i'd say it easily one best games out ds though . one everyone should their ds collection .	1
amazon.com listed this " king quest compilation " instead " king quest collection " which clearly printed my box game , well picture website . i don't know why . game itself , i remember loving king quest games when i younger . i bought this game mostly " king quest vi " which so far seemed work fine , exception one time when game kicked me out no apparent reason . this particular version " king quest vi " also seems draw it graphics original release game not cd release later , so also somewhat disappointing . captain saladin no longer looks like lassie . overall , it nice access these games nostalgia	1
what better than game made adults or kids ? sly , sneaky humor only adults understand greatest toy ever created legos ! all theme best star wars movies !! many games put ' replayability ' allowing you go through game or missions second or third time different character , but lego star wars this fashion totally fun . it not simple regurgitation map different character ( wihoo replayable ... ) but rather ingenious method rewards you additional pieces building well secret areas previously unobtainable . instance , you might need stormtrooper ( or uniform ) , jedi ( dark or light ) , or even bounty hunter enter specific areas . droids often used access areas well , but you usually them during missions . using ' free play ' mode , you go back through missions character you created , or any other character you unlocked . during mission , you cycle through your characters use their abilities . this allows you go back unlock new areas find additional bricks etc . fact there new abilities characters you find later well new areas explore really makes replayability fun worthwhile . aspect this game i absolutely love cooperative play . this great adults able play kids , or even spouses . my wife doesn't play lot xbox titles , but she loves playing this game we blast going through missions together . i'm surprised more games don't actually give you coop play like this . seems it enough toss death match label game ' multiplayer ' . my only complaint camera , both single cooperative mode . often times camera shift based one players force other player back towards center screen . more than one occasion , this caused death characters or when we get stuck forces one players swap characters midstream . sometimes this isn't obvious player . it would really nice option split screen , especially real estate hdtv provides . all all , i would highly recommend this game . especially if you kids want spend some quality time them . great game	1
third installment since rebirth classic series presumably final chapter " sands time " saga , " two thrones " takes best elements " sands time " ( game one ) " warrior within " ( its sequel ) caps franchise style , finesse , gameplay sharp scimitar blade . you once again assume mantle nameless prince persia . returning home babylon long last find it ruins its people war army sand monsters , prince also finds himself company old friends ... old enemies . cursed , he comes find his body soul split two , periodically his wicked self , known dark prince , rises forth wreak havoc take control prince body . storyline entertaining , its characters more developed than most video games , it strikes nice balance darkness light-heartedness ... something " warrior within " failed achieve . essence , it what you would get if you took tone presentation games one two rolled them together . mentioned before , gameplay not far either . while " sands time " set tone its acrobatic platforming , which remains pretty much tact , " warrior within " took game weak combat mechanics fleshed them out into something little more interesting . happily , both elements retained improved upon this new installment . what more , " tenchu " -like stealth kills now available . while they're far perfectly executed ( sometimes they seem unresponsive ) , they nonetheless offer fresh twist opportunity avoid hand-to-hand combat many circumstances . dark prince significant addition . regularly , throughout course game , prince transforms into this alter-ego - sand monster version himself able use weapon called daggertail . this weapon functions much like belmont whip " castelvania " game , allowing dark prince attack his enemies also swing poles light fixtures access new areas prince couldn't hope reach . while stronger than prince combat , unfortunately dark prince he must sustain himself constant supply sand power or succumb death when it all used up . makes these portions game more intense , , rare occasions , little more frustrating . also new series chariot trials , sequences during which prince must escape via horse-drawn wagons through hazardous environments full speed ahead . while they provide nice change pace when they actually occur , they relatively few trial error nature them lead irritation . there only few glaring flaws " thrones . " sound effects ambient music retain their inconsistent , buggy feel . too often dialogue sputters repeats like broken record , music kind fades departs little rhyme or reason . well , graphics suffer some pretty blatant clipping problems . engine aged pretty gracefully , but it aged - least character designs architecture go long way keep you distracted occasional failings visuals . " prince persia : two thrones " , many respects , very similar game two come before it . therefore it not novel first game longtime followers , but it doesn't feel long tooth it might this stage thanks new gameplay additions entertaining continuation story . it certainly better game than " warrior within , " more welcoming almost every way . this series lot life it , " two thrones " well worth your time effort .	1
this game really good , but i don't think they tested it enough figure out loading times way too long . so if you not lot patience , good luck this game :	1
i know i'm little late , but what heck ? i felt like writing review this game . final fantasy just fantastic game . simple . its extremely deep , fantastic story , great characters , great battle system , it perfect length rpg ( 45-55 hours ) . not everyone likes tidus , he honestly doesn't bother me , i think he interesting character . rest cast well developed , they all interesting personalities distinct this universe . cast very memorable , you'll remember them years come , i think speaks volumes how good this game . its enhanced usual good voice acting square known , so doesn't disapoin t.t he gameplay extremely fun , its actually one my favorite battle systems . battle system make or break rpg , this one doesn't disappoint . its fast paced , so it doesn't get bogged down long battles . you also swap characters mid battle , thats awesome feature . gameplay also incredibly deep , i've heard people literally pouring hundreds hours into this game . so if thats your thing , i'm sure you've probably already played this game . if some reason you not played this game your into rpg , don't hesitate pick this game up , its cheap now , its one best most balanced rpg i've ever played	1

this kit not just card . previous review indicated bestbuy.com selling this $49.99 . not correct . they selling card $49.99 . this kit comes card plus several other components , thus making it $20 more . you may find this kit cheaper elsewhere , but not significantly . it what it intends .	1
pros : 1 . storyline very detailed . there lot twists turns . i'm not going spoil it ... find out yourself :) 2 . weapons very nice . everything classic crowbar ( yay ! ) gravity gun preform very well . you damage just anything environment use it your advantage . 3 . physics amazing . water rippling things flying through air all very well . makes you get real sense game . 4 . a.i. challenging varified . also different weapons work better some than others so it fun experiment . 5 . there no really specific road follow this game . you explore find secret compartments stuff . 6 . there actually bunch little thinkers this game . order get somewhere , like sewage tunnel or over fence , you may something first , such flip switch or put something somewhere . gives you challenge . 7 . saving nice . you save anywhere game . so if you lose , you'll just go back you last checkpoint . cons : 1 . it loads lot . if you xbox w/ lot games it it might load slower . i'm not positive though . it runs pretty good mine but yeah , there quite lot point loading . ( but game itself makes up it ) i rated half-life 2 4/5 stars b/c it very good game . it very accurate it gameplay , making it challenging fun . plus who can't resist playing baseball headcrabs .	1
early game you use pistol rifle take down some stormtroopers new republic you explore their base , no force powers . but events make turn worse you go luke request your lightsaber back . then you begin discover force powers you search out dark jedi/killer your girlfriend rest game . amazing graphics increddible duels , this game simply magnificent . plus multiplayer awesome ( especially when you play ctf give other team boat load storm troopers you your friend rebels one bot helping you against twenty or so stormtroopers makes game game you'll never want trade ! plus duels fun play again again . i would five stars but game two or three puzzles quite difficult . all all great game any starwars fan must own , any shooter fan really , if you like both , oooh you need it really bad	1
i love this game ! it not too hard kids play ( my 10 year old beat it max points finds all secrets ) it not trashy so parents let their kids play it , they keep it clean kids some adult humor but nothing raunchy , it also cool so us adults play well ! i love creating skaters parks kids love secret skaters like jesse james jester etc . graphics better this game than others my opinion also .	1
while i think some reviews xenosaga ii little harsh , they hit few good points . terms plot , first thing really let me down kos-mos . don't let her face covering cover game fool you . while one main characters first game , she hardly anything this game until end , which seems less like plot point more creators obliging her . same said shion well . this shift center stage hurts these characters , it really disappointing . instead , jr. takes center stage . instead shedding light events first game , it opens up whole knew set issues really don't get resolved . if you're looking story pull first game , it'll hard find this game . jr. character i personally don't care much , but if you fan him , then you'll enjoy this game , you learn lot his past u.r.t.v.a new character introduced shion brother , jin uzuki . personally , i liked jin , but you don't get use him much game . him , shion , jr. albedo , there underlying theme " brothers " or " siblings " story , although don't look much elaboration jin shion . although some people aren't pleased battle system this game , i actually enjoyed it . i caught into it quicker than first game system . you also acquire skill points out enemies ' weak zones , which i found very useful . i also liked able build up attacks , then boost really slam enemy . overall , it game i really enjoyed . game some replay value it , there certain things you actually can't accomplish until you've beaten game once . times , re-watching certain scenes over over again gets boring . yet i would recommend this series , if nothing else , it serves bridge first game upcoming third game .	1
i love final fantasy games . they reason i still my nes snes . this really take me back early days square . admittedly , i've gotten older my tastes changed past 15 years ( i think its long since ff1 released ) , but this game just makes me smile . completing chocobo side quests , making sure mognet gets back online , defeating hades ozma , power leveling like mad man , laughing zidane bad ladies i am . all all , important parts game what kept me playing . now , i say there few annoying parts . you should never sell any equipment . synth shop wonderful idea , but some items end game , you need weapons you got beginning disc 1 . also some weapons disappear face planet you switch discs . little fact causes quite annoying problem those us who like see every ability fully mastered every character ( if you cant tell , i kid spent 3 months downed shin-ra plane getting everyone 255 stat points ) . overall this outstanding game . it keeps me wanting play , it makes my chronic insomnia relapse , i love just watching vivi dance during fights watching zidane get shot down over over interim . graphics this game simply beautiful . its not something ooooo ahhhh you , but if you give them second look ( after you get over cartoon-like feel ) you'll notice they someone took their time this production . someone made sure every single detail perfect . ffvii felt 2d while you knew scenery 3d endeavor , it felt like 2d isometric drawing rather than fully 3d rendered scene . when you look ffix you know you looking fully 3d environment . it really great thing see especially psx ( even though xbox 360 now out ) . characters ... what i say characters . i love them . they all make me smile . i relate completely zidane social life , then his story took me off guard first time i heard it ( i wasn't expecting it , it made me want play longer ) . garnet interesting . she naive girl we all knew high school . it just seems every character their own story it pretty well explored ( really , what you know yuffie , zell , quistis irvine ) . you ever wonder how reeve controlled cait sith while he talking scarlet heidegger ? i really not lot unanswered questions like ffix , just some things could elaborated ( like summoner village ) , but all-in-all i think story pretty perfect . my only big complaint length game . there lot stuff , but end game reached under 12 hours ( 4 months work get certain sword .... stay ragnarok if you reading this ... saying " i got excalibur ii " not worth heartache ) . this game gets 4 stars because while it good game , i just wish there more it . there plenty side quest stuff , just not enough story time . 12 hours story just long aeris stays breathing ff7 . hope this makes your purchasing decision little easier . its definitely great game heck , if worse comes worse , it good time killer rainy weekend	1
i've this game since day it came out some cutscenes my opinion better than lot games out today . this games unique gameplay i think adds its satisfactory . i love everything this game example : music : this games music unreal compared practically every other ps1 game out there . if you take time listen it your not one those gamers like i used before i actually listened any games music , than u not disappointed . gameplay : i absolutely love this games gameplay because its unique style . even though u cant really tell how much you leveled up , you still get idea when it gives u new star so you learn new moves more slots more space new put more skills . charater attack system : there 40 characters this game which i think all promote there own indivituality others . some them may same same type sometimes same basic idea move , but each character uniqely different looking than others , lot them use different weapons , armor . but one i like most all way your special moves each character get cooler looking much stronger you gain stars or levels . some people say getting so much more powerful attacks every level contributes make this games battle system easy . i dont think all because types people advantages over others so u know . but even if you , enemies heal more than you , some enemies you run because their so hard . so i dont think its simple . challenge level : i think overall this game very challenging because battle system because there countless # puzzles figure out game definetly add games difficulty . i also think games length adds its challenge meter , because there so many different paths you take game change story line , so you get different characters . so if you dont get some first time you play , you start game same data everything game before . so i think this game game you can't beat so easily one day . i would recommend this game anyone whos looking inexpensive rpg thats lengthy unique battle style amazing everything else makes this ps1 game one best games ever created date .	1
nintendo dominated handheld industry since gameboy came out . now sony stepped , some predicted their hold might finally breaking . not so , there no better proof than ds lite . lite evolutionary step over original ds , similar gameboy advance sp . it more compact form factor , brighter screens , side-mounted power button , weighs less , longer battery life , simply looks more fashionable . basic functionality ds still here- same buttons general button layout , wi-fi , gba compatibility , etc . this worth buying if you already ds ? maybe , if you've got some spare cash . this worth buying if you don't own ds ? definitely . design far superior old ds . no ds review would complete without further mention psp . while psp undoubtedly more capable device , it significant weaknesses compared ds . particularly , psp games tend far longer load times , it much shorter battery life , hardware itself more fragile . oh , course , there cost . most critical factor , however , library games available . now , ds games more better , there simply no contest when it comes which more offer this department . games what really make or break console , wide variety excellent casual immersive ds titles make it clearcut winner .	1
i am fan arena football . i enjoy watching it because it exciting , but this game doesn't live up real game . game very similiar nfl blitz except nfl blitz better . what makes unleashed worse there less teams pick all you pass . most action comes after play over when players jump each other beat each other up . if you thinking buying this game , rent it first see if it really worth money	1

i've never taken time write review before , but all negative comments made me feel obligated defend this game . number negative reviews point out many aspects game far simpler railroads compared rrt3 , which absolutely correct . if you seeking complex simulation , railroads not game you . if , however , you wanting fun easy grasp game trains , then i wholeheartedly recommend railroads . it one my favorite games all time	1
this game took my 9 year old son 2 days complete . it disappointment since i paid $30 it , but action adventure games make younger kids make wiser decisions . overall this game deserves a+ . not adult type game but fun kids .	1
i bought this my husband ... um yep he still it .. he never touched video game until i got him gt2 then 3 came out he showed little more interest .. now 4 well lets just say he it when ever he gets time . cars , lots cars . tracts challege even toughest driver . so much offer little cd package . image quality so realistic times you make yourself remember they not real . places you see roads you travel ... wow all i think knowing it hardly touches beauty you we see . going how often i hear my hubby yell other drivers field shows me just how it draws you into its reality ... well worth price i think ... wonder if its my turn play now ....	1
i love final fantasy games . they reason i still my nes snes . this really take me back early days square . admittedly , i've gotten older my tastes changed past 15 years ( i think its long since ff1 released ) , but this game just makes me smile . completing chocobo side quests , making sure mognet gets back online , defeating hades ozma , power leveling like mad man , laughing zidane bad ladies i am . all all , important parts game what kept me playing . now , i say there few annoying parts . you should never sell any equipment . synth shop wonderful idea , but some items end game , you need weapons you got beginning disc 1 . also some weapons disappear face planet you switch discs . little fact causes quite annoying problem those us who like see every ability fully mastered every character ( if you cant tell , i kid spent 3 months downed shin-ra plane getting everyone 255 stat points ) . overall this outstanding game . it keeps me wanting play , it makes my chronic insomnia relapse , i love just watching vivi dance during fights watching zidane get shot down over over interim . graphics this game simply beautiful . its not something ooooo ahhhh you , but if you give them second look ( after you get over cartoon-like feel ) you'll notice they someone took their time this production . someone made sure every single detail perfect . ffvii felt 2d while you knew scenery 3d endeavor , it felt like 2d isometric drawing rather than fully 3d rendered scene . when you look ffix you know you looking fully 3d environment . it really great thing see especially psx ( even though xbox 360 now out ) . characters ... what i say characters . i love them . they all make me smile . i relate completely zidane social life , then his story took me off guard first time i heard it ( i wasn't expecting it , it made me want play longer ) . garnet interesting . she naive girl we all knew high school . it just seems every character their own story it pretty well explored ( really , what you know yuffie , zell , quistis irvine ) . you ever wonder how reeve controlled cait sith while he talking scarlet heidegger ? i really not lot unanswered questions like ffix , just some things could elaborated ( like summoner village ) , but all-in-all i think story pretty perfect . my only big complaint length game . there lot stuff , but end game reached under 12 hours ( 4 months work get certain sword .... stay ragnarok if you reading this ... saying " i got excalibur ii " not worth heartache ) . this game gets 4 stars because while it good game , i just wish there more it . there plenty side quest stuff , just not enough story time . 12 hours story just long aeris stays breathing ff7 . hope this makes your purchasing decision little easier . its definitely great game heck , if worse comes worse , it good time killer rainy weekend	1
when ever i go lan parties , everyone there prefers this controller . theres only one person who used bulky , original , " duke " controller . when he , it often dissconnects him no reason . controller lot better my perspective . its what i've always used what majority population uses . they should just call it xbox controller , without suffix	1
my 8 10 year old love this . i highly recommed it anyone . it helps teach kids how sing pitches tones . kids love dress up their characters . even boys neighborhood get invovled . i see this lasting years come .	1
my kids ( 11 7 , 2nd 6th graders ) first played this game friend house . they both begged it . they not stopped playing it . thing we live texas sometimes it just way too hot play outside . there always news reports kids just sitting around . this game makes you move !!! they played so hard first day they got it they both so sore next day . i recommend this toy several people . first , if you need get your kid moving , this great . if you hyper children need outlet , this great . if you need exercise more , this great . if weather doesn't permit your active kid go outsice this toy great . if your kid wants see him or herself tv this great ! if your kid afraid try new things front others , this great . this toy got my boy sign up little league . both my kids already active , so they play hard , but it irresistable temptation even inactive kids . everyone neighborhood loves it	1
i now played " vp2 " few days now , i say i like it . it its problems , but overall , it very fun game . " vp2 " takes place 100 or so years before original " vp " . i won't spoil any plot , except say many ruins visited original game appear beautiful cities " vp2 " , one gets sense we see why these cities became ruins course game . graphically , game beautiful . movies nice , if stiff times , sound great . mechanically , however , there some issues . " vp2 " attempts keep essence battle system original intact , while adding 3-d wrinkle . unfortunately , controls so gummy times you frustrated often you pleased results new system . all all , though , game excellent . i drop it star because control issues ..	1
katamari damacy breath fresh air increasingly stale gaming world . it title you likely never get tired , it odd but simple gameplay draws you back again again . music background especially catchy fun listen , makes me smile whenever i hear it . entire game experience not unlike pleasant feelings you experience after hours prolonged zen meditation , i would recommend game anyone looking something new . game only flaw it little short ; i wish it twice or three times long it .	1
story ( 10/10 ): star wars : knights old republic puts you world complete bliss utterly fantastic awe . this not just shoot-em-up game , within millions pixelated characters lies story . story jaw-dropping , mind-blowing twists turns conclusions awaiting . choose your path , first time , you choose your own destiny rather than creators . this game not just one plot , nor it mindless adventure trekking whereabouts middle nowhere looking purpose . no , this game many quests riddles , illusions games inside keep gamers their tippy-toes all times . starting out mysterious rebel who not know his/her own past , fight or peacefully sneak your way through depths several planets , each carrying many people many stories . you may help these people , you may there savior deny reward , or you may bash their helpless heads into their skulls create your path dark side . all while making venture across native lands toward beoming jedi , encounter friends , enounter foes convert them friends if you ever so wish . it doesn't matter , because end it only you facing evil sith lord , toe toe , lightsaber lightsaber . gameplay ( 9/10 ): fighting system somewhat random , but not entirely , you choose create concrete combat fighter or wizard casting spells such lighting , wind , life draining , lightsaber throwing , etc . many different various skills such stealth , persuasion , even computer hacking lockpicking ( sort ) . you stay close using lightsabers , one each hand or double-bladed one . or you stray afar using blaster rifles pistols . you many compainions , droids , jedis , dark side mercenaries wookies , each charming , dramatic , or brutal life story , which only concluded game furthers . very impressive dialogue screenwriting , graphics realism also mediocre . i guarantee , low $20 price , this game give you hours fun , each day , least month . trust me , when month up , you not want get rid it , you get urge play it again because once you start this game you hooked long-term engagement . only thing i find wrong this game it sequel . pros : ~ excellent sound , effects , dialogue , screenplay , scenery , designing story writing . ~ hundreds weapons , armor , belts , gloves , arm bands , implants masks further increase skills . ~ hundreds side quests extravagant rewards conclusions keep you awe all day long . ~ no wondering world world search plots , they usually easy find but challenging ( not boring ) accomplish . ~ no matter what , you always play game different way , so you would just beginning your quest soon you beat game . ~ neat little area xbox live downloadable content , which open up plot give you very nice weapons two new lightsaber colors . ( turquoise , orange) ~ you change overall game difficulty , it default setting medium . cons : ~ no type multiplayer games any circumstance . it surprising they didn't make o-o perative option . ~ sometimes annoying loading transitions , take maybe 10-15 seconds most . i'd advise some music handy if it your 2nd or 3rd time through game	1
i am fan arena football . i enjoy watching it because it exciting , but this game doesn't live up real game . game very similiar nfl blitz except nfl blitz better . what makes unleashed worse there less teams pick all you pass . most action comes after play over when players jump each other beat each other up . if you thinking buying this game , rent it first see if it really worth money	1
one best ds games i ever . it not take lawyer get fully satisfied this game . although this heavily text-based game ( i mean really heavy ! ) , you won't get tired reading storylines following details . i know you won't find this any stores nowadays so try order here amazon . this game one best	1
yes , xbox best video game system i ever bought . i own , also , gamecube , me big mario fan ( sierously , who isnt ? ) . i've my xbox , oh , two years . but recently , it died . i'm not sure what went wrong . cords fine . i've even bought replacement cords , but it just wont come life . i thinking buying xbox 360 , until i read all bad reviews . apperently , 360 some kinks it . so , i plan buying xbox . if i you , i would purchase xbox , not 360 . ups : -great graphics . -sound = awesome . -game genre awesome ! -no need " memory cards " . -you use consol dvd player , music player ! downs : -controllers bit bulkish . -a bit faulty . obviously , more ups than downs !	1

i hearing reading all rave over this game , i finally got it myself . you tell my giving it high " star " rating , i really like it , so i'm raver now . however , if you've not played it but used first person shooter ( fps ) games , you may find this one somewhat unique . main difference far cry other popular fps games like halo doom series , this game not fast paced . far cry requires more sneaking around , use cover , diversions , etc . all all , it requires more tactical approach , rather than " bust room mow ' em down shotgun " approach . but still , there certainly intense moments just every stage where action hot . technical side : this game very robust requires array strong computing components run it . install requires 4gb . i dell w/a 2.6 ghz processor , 512 mb ram , 64 mb geforce 4 mx video card . it runs game no problem , but i one little code modification regarding directx 9.0 , but easy . i would highly recommend 128 mb video card so you run game richer graphic settings . if you like me , you prefer using game pad rather than keyboard mouse , you're out luck . there just no option any other method control . however , much i prefer my logitech rumble pad , i've found keyboard/mouse just fine this game , actually precision good mouse probably preferable . so , if you haven't got it yet , check it out !	1
ncaa football 2006 captures college atmosphere extremely well . game loads fun . load times decent , dynasty mode adds tremendous replay value , quest heisman pseudo-ripoff nfl 2k series crib feature . i still love this game . i even like music . it doesn't bother me lee corso kirk herbstreit commentary repetitive . only thing i take issue every year ea brags strength ai yet you run option successfully hundreds times while computer controlled team struggles find defense capable stopping you . maybe why some people prefer play online opponents . let me wrap up . this great game . graphics impressive ea wonderful job here . buy it your son , buy it your daughter , or buy yourself . you love it . i wish i could provide more helpful review . head over [ ... ] read wonderful review they gave this game . more helpful than anything i contribute	1

i bought this game because i thought it would fun play story like sims2 ds . beginning went well , operations fun . story drags little goes too slow , i actually skipped part story just operations . operations get your heart pumping somewhat stressful . i am stuck 6th one . i trying complete it few weeks now , but continuously fail . unfortunetly you cannot go any further until you complete them order . i dont know if i able play this game any further	1
king quest games classic , but why they not including king quest 8 : mask eternity ? i know it not well received when it came out ( i personally liked it ) . but just because it not well received , they won't include it . it part series , should included well	1
i played call duty 2 through through . i unlocked all achievements now i feel kind sad . i want more . this game simply fantastic , graphics gameplay . i actually felt like i thrown back time fight nazi . fire fights intense , since enemy units not retarded . they use cover effectivly even try get better postioning you . it may seem like no big deal but game developers promising smart ai years never deleviring until now . i unfortunitly not ability play xbox live so muliplayer very limited me ... what i play fantastic . its not ground breaking lack vehicles kind crappy ... but no big deal . okay ... if you xbox 360 you might well get this game . its best i played so far	1
this game masterpiece dragonball name . graphics nice , certain fighting sequences show some really detailed animation looks like they took it show itself ( they didn't really ) . you option just playing fusion characters doing fusion you don't any time limit all or you just select character itself . this goes transformations well , giant ape characters , super sayian levels ( not 4 they put goku vegeta ss4 seperate characters ) some bad parts first game don't exist this game . some characters didn't best moves list first game , like ss4 goku which he full power energy balls , super explosive wave , his ultimate 10x kamehameha wave . it also nice put some lesser known characters dragon ball universe game well ( garlic jr , turles , slug , jenemba first form , pikkon , pan , ubb etc . ) . however not every single character this game , which makes it look horrible when you play story mode . following characters not this game : gt goku ( little ) his super sayian formsdr . wheelo ( worlds strongest)gt trunks ssgt goten ssgt gohan ssgt vegeta his ss formsbio broly ( maybe we're better off not him this because i'm sure he wasn't very popular anyway)the 6 other dragonsgeneral rildo ( early part baby saga when gang m2)goku jrvegeta jrthis game half tenkaichi 1/3 each budokai games : 1 . dragon universe back but much better2 . some things exclusive game . ( first budokai , cell accidently swallows krillin instead 18 made little story ) every sayian character who armor tail ( like raditz instance ) transorm into giant ape . 3 . like budokai 2 when you first started dragon world , you selection goku , adult gohan so forth . adventure mode this game , some later chapters , they used ultimate gohan gt gohan trunks sword make it look like your playing gt trunks . this one cheesist things ever any game . this most impressive game series last dragonball game appear ps2 we heading toward next generation consoles . wii version coming out too .	1
fans this game genre always looking great fighter their console , because their comparatively far less fighting games , it quite rare find trully impressive one . tekken , however , always taken cake when it comes deep , fun , proffesional fighting experience , tekken 5 all these great qualities ? definetly . whether you're hardcore gamer or just want some fun your buddies , you've found perfect title . namco extremely fluid job breaking all barriers fighting game entertainment . there so much veriety , so much , unlock , enjoy , whether you like these types game or not , you hooked . take me , im critic , tough one matter , i can't find single thing wrong this game , other then fact online mode wasn't included . but how much it matter when you rich , deep gameplay system , extrodinary visuals , outstanding replay value , 30 , count them , 30 intruiging playable character battle master ? i say this without studder , this you playing hours upon hours friend or relative , becuase this one those games where there little more ask . 5/	1

it just like cartoon series . my brother ( 7 yrs . old ) play this game hours . i play it ( 18 yrs . old ) find it enjoyable . it gives you something those slow days . there mini missions you complete . you're given awards extras game after each completion . i'd say it 100 hours complete whole game . ( i've 60% one day ... but could just me . i normally devour any game i get . ) graphics great ; story great ; it amusing ; little too colorful but you get used it .	1
even though it costs most memory cards might seem over priced , this wonderful memory card . i don't huge collection gcn games because i prefer ps2 but i remember older model memory cards i delete old saves make room newer games . this memory card you most likely hold saves every game you own more space should left new games come ! only complaint i this memory card it only comes one color doesn't match any gamecubes market	1
i playing madden series since i kid this game really good . games just keep getting better better each year passes . everything this game worth money i strongly reccommend it	1
since there already several well written reviews already posted , i just wanted add one huge thing they've failed mention . this new version option you select swap out different players your party . this never available any other version . much like final fantasy iii ( ff6 japan ) where you comprised your team pool characters , final fantasy iv advance lets you take palom , poram , cid , yang fight moon if you'd like!there also new dungeon ( cave trials ) mt . ordeals requires you take each those characters face boss order unlock their powerful end-game weapons . each these weapons ( specific each character . i.e. you can't equip rydia palom dagger even though they're both black mages ) ultra powerful instantly makes them worthy addition your party ( especially yang ) , well maybe not edward . lolanyway , i'm sure vast majority you who buy this game played previous versions let me tell you you not dissappointed . new fight scene/magic graphics , better music , reworked dialogue unique this version , new areas make you feel like you're playing classic first time ! ps- playing this ds lit	1
i still remember getting this game 9/9/99 , day it came out . i love this game because it junction system some other cool features this game . unfortunatly , all people i knew , people either hated game ( most those people this side love/hate group ) few people loved it ( extremly hardcore rpg fans seem love it . ) . i love game but this final fantasy game whole lot people just can't stand . it long game , especially if you get stuck , so guide ( internet or actual guide i don't care ) really help . it easiest game literally reach level 100 because every 1000 exp gets you level up but using junction system also important role game because it raise your stats well . this game you play yourself . before you agree haters , give it spin , please	1
when blinx first came out , all reviews didn't really know what make it . they said this one most innovative titles come out past few years , but then they started going how hard it how it gets repetitive you go through each stage , clearing enemies proceed . well , what game isn't repetitive ? you could just easily say " all you tetris line up blocks " or " all you mario 64 collect stars " . reading time controls sounded so confusing . i didn't think i'd able handle 10 minute time limit each level while controlling time . so just week ago , i got blinx couldn't wait see how it played after countless " love it or hate it " reviews numerous people . after watching cool little intro breezing through first 2 worlds night , i saw -nothing- wrong this game . only people much trouble this those who only play rpgs or sports games , don't give platformers try . time control nothing worry either , it very simple understand , actually , you don't use time controls often . main story blinx short point . which good because i'm really sick games spending 15 minutes intros just tell you " this what going " pointless fmv . blinx quick 3-5 minute intro showing you he part millions time sweepers , time custodians clean up any problems time different planets . but suddenly , something goes wrong one them , princess kidnapped . blinx sees her gets determined save her , planet . you go through 9 worlds ( each world except last , there 3 levels , one shop , boss end ) get her back . each level , you collect time crystals gain time powers sweep ( use your sweeper/vaccum cleaner ) garbage take out all enemies level proceed next . it actually very fun i never got tired it . sweeping up different objects deals different damage enemies . garbage or flower pot won't whole lot , but beat up jaloppy , piano or even 16 ton weight , now there real damage . time crystals all over place , you gain time power collecting 3 or 4 same type . getting 3 one kind 1 any other gets you one power , but getting 4 same time crystal gets you two power . powers you use rewind , fast forward , pause , record slow motion , hearts gain you retry . if you haven't figured it out other reviews yet , it kind obvious when you need use some powers . like if you see bridge fall down , use rewind watch it rebuild itself cross . if you can't walk up river that pushing you back , rewind it so you walk up ease . if there two switches you need activate , record yourself jumping one while you jump other open door(s ) . main ones you'll using though pause slow motion , mostly because these work anything , even bosses . yeah , people go how hard bosses ... i guess they didn't figure out how use time powers . but last boss ... oh man . guy took me least total 9 hours beat . i just beat him this morning 2:59:49 am ( yes , i got exact second ) flipped out . i proud myself . he up there pocky rocky snes last boss . it like developers got mad something put all difficulty into him . because rest game pretty easy until part . side note , i love how ice levels actually ice . not magical non-slippery ice they other games . here , you pretty much skate floor if you go too fast or hit wall , you fall over get back up . it small things like make me love this game even more . graphically , blinx stunning most part . remember 10 years ago when you saw screens donkey kong country impressed models ? that what i got here . blinx himself some best graphics i've ever seen . see how he looks box ? that exactly how he looks in-game . you see fur him when he up close , they got every single detail down perfectly . every level also just much detail , there no bare areas all . there always something going . course , i can't leave out water . everyone seems impressed no matter what they think actual game . try slowing down time running through river/canal . or pausing it see trail left behind . developers fantastic job . unfortunately , some enemies don't much detail blinx . lot them just one colored shapes didn't really require much effort create . but then there some really cool design . so it little mixed bag there . last boss man , i won't even start thing . there no slowdown unless you're blasting tons garbage enemies without stopping . only other slowdown when you make it happen . it appears run 30 frames second , there nothing wrong . i really enjoyed music too , would love get soundtrack . main theme if fun enjoyable , first level contains most magical music i've ever heard . rest game good music , always fitting mood setting . final boss music really puts you mood take ' em out , it full energy concentration . sound effects cartoony , but that not bad thing . when blasting garbage enemy , you get zany little effect sounds like something tom jerry . voices however , i'm confused . they're not bad . fact , blinx great delivery voice acting not much personality ( he platformer character . he doesn't need personality ) . but i could've sworn they spoke japanese beginning . i know fact i translated some words meaning what text screen meant . but end , i didn't understand single thing . i guess they made up their own language here just like they panzer dragoon orta . but there isn't lot language going , just belts blinx most time . though he say some things english once while . i noticed " yay ! " " burned kitty food ! " when he got knocked out into lava pit . keep ear out what pigs say when you hit them garbage whenever they show up level . i swear one you fight most time goes " you suck ! " when he gets hit . it pretty intimidating hear even if you're winning . blinx didn't disappoint me all . it tons replay too . you get rank when you complete level , if you get all a+ or s+ ranks , you get cool treat . plus there cat medals each level add little bonus clips . first few pretty lame , but you get more , they turn out great . going back figuring out new ways beat bosses always fun too . i just can't stress how much i love this game . my shelf , i put this above knights old republic jet set radio future . but right behind panzer dragoon orta . what i've heard , demo sequel ( i'm amazed this thing well enough get sequel ) even better . blinx 2 probably first xbox game i get full price when it comes out . so get this if you're looking little bit " old school " feel superb graphics quality ... course fun . that all matters games , fun	1
this unique game takes keen eye ability remember small details . many times , whether or not you're successful depend how good you finding inconsistencies testimony , or things " just don't sound right " . animation very lo-tech , where each scene just stationary backdrop . if there character you interacting , they cycle through their 5 or so generic facial states it suits dialog . there * lot * reading , unfortunately , some characters love talk . music simple infectious , interface easy navigate either via touch stylus or buttons , you save your state game any time , so you take cases your own pace . it unique game just rewarding it frustrating . characters interesting , if you own ds , this game worth	1
ecellent best game ever . educational but fun . scary enoyable graphics perfect long lasting story line	1
you darkened corner . you watch patrolman descends stairs . you size him up , noticing his ak-47 drawn . you quietly sneak up behind him , when he stops walking , you grab him . you place your silenced pistol up his forehead drag him into darkened corner . guard walks into room . you quickly turn your pistol towards him , shoot , then turn back your hostage . you quickly hit him back neck , knocking him out . this great game . it made ( i believe ) 2001 , yet graphics rival games such halo 2 . physics game amazing , it very well programed . your guns drop shells , which stay ground breifly , bullets leave holes walls . guards notice you if you too loud , if their comrades sniped , they sometimes open fire , even not knowing where you . you knock out , kill , or avoid enemies . graphics , like i said , amazing . fire looks very realistic , lighting perfectly . people look realistic , not quite so much scenery , but even games like halo 2 , people not focus . missions change greatly , environments change them . dialouge isn't great , but it decent , if you dont play too close attention it , it nice backround noise . all all , if you one game buy , buy this one .	1
love this game . great story line . just make sure your computer handle it	1
my opinion , this best game xenosaga series . first game received lot well-deserved praise recognition . however , i believe this third game better just every aspect . battle system new introduces concept break . idea place your opponent state , avoiding it your characters . turn-based battle system also very quick . you don't wait 30 seconds your characters execute their battle moves . playable characters respond attack soon you choose type attack you want perform . previous games , you either fight foot or aboard giant e.s. humanoid machines . item equipment shops back , well ability customize your characters fine level . you won't much options choose first game , but ability very close . best part this game though story . i am forty years old read many novels , watched many great movies , played lots video games . my opinion , story told this game surpasses anything i ever come across . plot good . characters very well-developed seem take life you play game watch plot unfold . there action , drama , revelations just every scene . each main plot previous episodes brought conclusion . this truly masterpiece story-telling . i only hope one day , this very moving , thought-provoking , captivating , uplifting story more accessible people who don't play video games . lot people find it spiritual philosophical . yes , theme very serious dramatic . unlike more common whimsical theme most games . but trust me , you play many hours non-stop just watch plot unfold . concepts destiny , purpose , free , choices , life , afterlife , beliefs , love , despair , consequences constantly present story . central character shion uzuki , designer amazing android kos-mos . allen rest supporting cast back . this time , they out uncover plot vector could put future universe danger . mini-game there case you want take break main story enjoy fun game hackox . ofcourse , you professor , jr. allen lighten things up just bit also .	1
i always loved ea games . i purchased every single madden game since 97 every nba live game since 01 . said i see very little improvement over years . last year nfl 2k5 blew away madden so i figured i would give sega chance . after playin nba 2k6 i trully become addicted . it really sad because i skip work play this wonderful game . however many pros nba 2k6 thier also few cons . pros : wonderful graphics , superb gameplay(realistic very start)cons : learn use directional passing or ball hog because you lot tunovers otherwise . soundtrack horrible but you just put tv mute until you start playing game . dunks also not flashy nba live but you won't care much . bottom line . go get this game now . stop what you doing purchase this game pronto . if you it , get one just case one you now breaks . throw nba live trash or trade it this game . end stroy !!!!!	1
pros : almost unlimited customization your car(s ) , depth tuning ; great fun play sometimes ( when you actually racing ) , some game effects like weather well ; graphics good , but not nearly good gt4 cons : unrealistic ( but i suppose that not point this game , can't some combine realistic driving engine gran turismo customization game like this - possiblities would amazing ); you drive everywhere . i want f***ing race , not spend five minutes driving performance shop graphics shop before driving five minutes actual race ; progress game you need raise your car rating only way get really high ratings put gawding looking crap your car like spinners , massive hood scoops , huge wings make your car look like its attacked ufo ; please , some us actually taste like our cars look tastefully doneoverall : ok arcadish game anyone who likes drive around not racing putting terribly ugly crap your cars probably lot fun , but i think i'll stick gran turismo series	1

advertising this collection led me believe i would getting these 7 games their original formats ... but i disappointed find not original version kq1 , but sci version released 1990 . kq6 voice commentary instead text , but you switch back text if you like -- i haven't found any such option kq5 , so it looks like you're stuck voice ( no supplemental text , either , so it gets annoying fast ) . i haven't look kq4 yet but everything else seems same . i'll glad play these games without wrestle our old tandy , but i wish they didn't get messed . especially disappointed there no text option kq5	1

both final fantasy iv chrono trigger excellent games ( ct could my favorite game all time ) . final fantasy iv excellently restored its original " hardtype " version . story elements dialog restored , which extremely exciting . however , i complaint port . somewhere port , code saving game not optimized playstation but instead uses version works fine solid-state memory ( like cartridge , which these games originally ) but horribly when going cd solid-state . this serious flaw , saves take up half minute complete . why this game gets 3 stars overall	1
difficult learn awkward user interface - besides , this best turn-based strategy game i ever played ! it ideal offline-multiplayer ( serverbased or via pbem ) , since all players take their turns simultaneously , which allows pbem games finished within reasonable time . highly customizable . os independent . disappointed walordsiv , i am now very happy finally found cute , playable , turn-based fantasy strategy game	1

there so much see discover this game . it took me over 70 hours just complete walkthrough i am still working capturing all monsters monster arena . someone who wanted complete all side quests , find all special items , etc . could easily spend more than 100 hours this game never get bored -just incredibly deep gameplay . graphics also outstanding , among best i seen video game . it took me awhile get used sphere grid used increase your characters ' stats . first i didn't find it satisfying typical method " leveling up " . but eventually i began enjoy it it now one my favorite aspects game . only thing i found tiresome how long cutscenes . storyline itself quite good . but i wish it told shorter cutscenes or least gave players option skip through cutscenes . still this minor complaint otherwise excellent game . definitely worth buying !	1
yes , single player mode pretty much more same call duty few additions . graphics game overall definitely amazing . multiplayer mode where game really shines . you should buy this game just multiplayer . it major change cod2 . it definitely one deepest most fun online games come awhile	1

i got this game during summer expecting it great fun . well ... it caught my interest few weeks then i just got bored it . i'd only recomend it people who not get bored easily	1
i guess first thing i'll say i got jedi academy before i got this game . i hugely dissaponted . i really liked jedi academy but this game not great . i cheat codes so i all wepons all amo i undying . there partes this game insainly tought . there way many puzzles - i don't mind puzzles but there simply way many . some them insainly hard . i would recomend you get jedi knight : jedi academy - way better puzzles aren't insain you get choose what you look like .... well i could go but i'll leave it there . if you aredy jedi academy you want star wars game $20 then you sould get battlefront thats anoter great game . just don't get this game .	1
i loved " incredibles , " so i excited play game . i've only playing video games last couple years , only off , so i'm really just beginner . perhaps explains enormous difficulty i've this game . my boyfriend long-time video game player , he able things one or two tries i labored hours over . even using cheat codes not really help me all much . i surprised when i read review said game too easy . i almost cried . lol but seriously , unless you good gamer , you're probably going more frustrated than challenged this game . me , i guess i'll stick action rpgs	-1
i bought this game whim , really liked need speed : hot pursuit 2 . this game needs help . first all , frame rate lower than it should . there slow-down well . even game before this , need speed : underground 2 looked 100 times better . car models most wanted touch nicer-looking there far better selection than underground 2 , but that only plus this game it . you don't race much fly around city barely-controlled frenzy , trying stay ahead computer cars . winning more luck than skill . he or she who hits least obstacles wins . hardly enjoyable way race ! i get too stressed when playing this game , so i put it away while . definitely rent before buying this game .	1

this supposed x-box cleaner , but system not read disc . shoddy product	-1
i want take moment address battle system license system . these systems , while well-conceived , completely ruined game me . example , license system , itself , very good idea : it allows player craft character his liking tastes . problem lies execution . say , example you want learn " steal . " not only you get license it but you also purchase it game . this presents problems . my game , example , my characters possess suite licenses they cannot use because shops don't carry particular item . system gives you flexibility but snatches it away requiring you not only get license but also find item . i can't help but feel hobbled license system . because these items ( which require licenses ) come discrete parts game , developers cunningly shot up difficulty . it doesn't matter i earned license " shield fire " level 4 , i only get it level 20+ when its offered shop ! game very challenging precisely because mechanics prevent characters getting better-than-normal equipment after they earned license . sly , artificial way developers ffxii ramped up difficulty strips away seems almost arbitrary unnecessary . cap three playable characters ( one time ) straw breaks camel back . lastly , battle system , my opinion , isn't fitting console rpg . it feels like i am playing world warcraft or city heroes . enemies always faster than you . it nigh impossible chase them down they always able catch up you . fighting bow exercise futility : enemies catch you because game freezes you place during firing . r2 button , which allows you flee , borders useless outright deadly use . while fleeing , game prevents you interacting objects . so if you flee toward door , you stop , pause , let them hit you , before you escape . my mouth gaped open when i saw reviews game online . this game received astronomical scores , some heralding it best final fantasy ever . shocks me beyond belief . ffxii would better mmorpg even sharper two-player rpg . single-player game , shoddy a.i mechanics , game plays like tumbling rock . perhaps i am just too old school , but this game tastes too much like lollipops bubblegum . your mileage may vary .	1

i'm going start this review saying i came wii lifetime pc-only gamer . i never felt need buy console until wii its fun controller system came out . aspect i most excited controlling first person shooters just precisely intuitively mouse keyboard , together added entertainment using it other motion-activated actions within game ( rowing , throwing grenades , close combat , etc ) . result , after spending night out cold get my console , flushed excitement seeing all merchandise , i grabbed three games : zelda ( no-brainer ) , trauma center , call duty 3 . those three titles , i'm sorry say cod 3 one leave bitter taste my mouth . i stated before , i am pc gamer ; i'm really into my hobby , love satisfaction building pc which manage all latest games . i played cod 1 2 pc , greatly enjoyed both . far biggest problem wii version , however , especially someone accustomed playing computer , graphical shortcomings title . i literally no idea what going . i could barely tell which direction enemies coming only reason why i going right direction because linear construction most levels . added this , i no idea how get rid first german engage me hand hand combat ( much advertised feature , which actually just interactive cut-scene ) . i followed instructions wave my controllers around wildly , although i worked myself into frenzy ( causing my dogs panic think something really attacking me ) inevitable german ( i tried throwing all my grenades into room he hides ) kept clubbing me death . even beyond this setback , i found controls often quite poorly implemented . it also disappointing ( yet speaks volumes ) grenade ' throwing ' function involves you actually ' throwing ' nunchuck ( without letting go , way , unless you've got backup tv ) disabled default ; trying use it usually gets you miss your target/get cut down/ blow yourself up . record , i know wii controller works . i've played many hours other games already ( system conveniently informs you ) . this just seems like shoddy implementation it . i definitely tell you there lot ambition here convey frenzy war , some obvious strong attempts creating absorbing combat scenes . nevertheless , it essentially boils down messy soup blurry pixels which , even my gameplay-over-graphics mentality buying wii , blocks enjoyability this title . honest , it made me think ww2 isn't best-suited area wii . after all , these historical titles tend rely great deal cinematically portraying visceral splendor war , rather then pushing exciting new gameplay elements . my advice fps front : wait wii ' far cry ' game see how turns out . meantime , there countless hours other great titles more suited wii graphics waiting your attention . before leaving you , i'd just like clarify thing : this perspective someone who very little experience consoles . perhaps you're reaction game very different if you come wii straight gamecube instead pc/high definition gaming . oh , if you're still determined buy it , keep eye out my used copy game ; i'm going need money ' banana blitz ' ..	1

main appeal grand theft auto franchise always freedom it gives player explore vast amounts territory cause mayhem he sees fit . san andreas contains far most audacious expansion landmass available you . this time action takes place california inspired locales such los santos , san fierro las vegas inspired las venturas , all within enormous state san andreas . main inspiration this time around fascination ghetto culture so predominant early 90 . this provides great opportunity rockstar take advantage setting implement some new challenges player conquer . new grand theft auto concept territory control , member street gang player opportunity take over every available territory los santos later game . perhaps most notable additions franchise ability customize your character appearance improve his varied skills throughout game . these may seem like rather superficial additions but they surprisingly satisfying when implemented properly . character skill growth happens naturally rarely interferes freeform exploration players come expect series . customization your avatar varies greatly encompasses most fashion styles found during early `90s california . lower tier stores offer usual assortment baggy pants sports jerseys while more expensive stores offer suits , expensive jewelry trendy fashions . your characters appearance varied you want it it not stop just clothes tattoos , his physical fitness also changed . grand theft auto franchise improved almost all aspects each subsequent release this one proves no different . last game series use this outdated engine it pushes it far it go terms graphical prowess . graphics slightly improved over previous installment but they remain sub par standard featured most games released around same time . nonetheless visuals quite effective sunsets fill san andreas orange tint game color palette faithfully replicates feel early nineties california culture . soundtrack aptly replicates time period which san andreas draws its visual style perhaps one complaint this subject would rockstar seems try encompass far too many genres music . expected genres found , such hip-hop alternative rock , both which strong presence early nineties pop scene . however , some stations seem oddly out place game world era . dance music funk each get their own stations yet it hardly seems worth it , although too much choice never bad thing . making welcomed return various radio station djs , who each pepper time tracks hilarious chat amusing observations . those would prefer listen nothing but banter there two radio stations talk radio format , one public station holding discussions day political events light talk shows . either one these stations more than enough keep player amused hours but just case pc version gives you added bonus playing your own mp3 tracks adding them game music library . sound effects themselves seem appropriate but never particularly impressive . there usual banter among pedestrians complaints motorists you pull them out their vehicle run off their ride . all these things add little bit life game large cities voice work varies enough cover all different geographical areas san andreas contains . thick southern accents countryside inhabitants snobbish tone civilians rich neighborhoods all present . gunfire explosions sound average , not much improvement present since vice city . despite controversy seems follow every release series san andreas praiseworthy title itself . engrossing action game continues expand its limits while continuing deliver what fans series come expect	1

after finishing both " half life episode i " " chronicles riddick : escape butcher bay " over few days , i looking fun first person shooter game would let me pass away hour or so day , allow me unwind slaughtering constant flow enemies high powered weapons without resulting actual murder innocent people . i'd heard " far cry " pretty good , so i bought it , installed it got ready blas t.t he first thing i noticed astonishing graphics engine . it without doubt most beautiful environment ever created fps . my jaw floor first few hours , checking out ridiculously high detailed environment . outdoor scenery looks like paradise holiday destination crystal clear blue water lush green jungle . there birdlife , fish general feeling you're running around living , breathing world . one thing very different right start would play major role later missions . there no save game option ! there checkpoints littered around levels , but it occasionally around 10 20 minutes solid game-play them . first this just annoyed me since i found myself reloading over over some harder missions . i couldn't just run into fray , firing my weapon left , right centre anything moves because one headshot would send me back heck long way some instances . i forced change my style play all out assault , stealthy , crawling , breath-holding , sweating , nerve wracking approach . i rediscovered part myself loved " thief : dark project " so very much all those years ago . yet i still got combine approach levels general carnage when it simply unavoidable . i am now firm believer save game option should removed many other ( not all ) first person games out there it raises intensity level dramatically . story itself fairly average dialogue even more so , which really what places " far cry " below likes " half life " . you basically just following instructions entire game , used violent killing machine no real choices . but some reason , i just didn't care i so absorbed surroundings simply surviving it didn't lower my enjoyment . enemies very good ai , flanking me whenever possible generally actually trying avoid shot rather than running straight me . there plenty occasions though where enemy just stand there distance while you shoot them plain sight , but generally all good . weapons fantastic both highly effective satisfying use . sniper rifle always personal favourite this game makes awesome use it , massive maps open ground . while initially i prepared standard " serious sam " type game , " far cry " turned out so much more . some fantastic graphics , inspired level design , forced variations play some fiercely intense gunfights make this game absolute winner . you add value money well since there 20 long missions get through . no save option , those 20 take you long time complete . but you love it ! i sure	1
i really enjoy top down side scrolling shooters , so take this opinion mind . only problem r-type dying sucks . when you die you restart usually bad position without any powerups . once you unlock free-play this make game frustrating when you playing new stages or playing different ship etc . however overall i think it best r-types one better side scrollers out there .	1

my television completely different part my house my high speed internet connection , so while i wasn't thrilled dish out extra money this adapter , i say it completely worth it . since i figured out how set up my home wireless network coordinate 360 , i get very strong connection no problems staying connected . only issue i when i first set up adapter i didn't known enough wireless networks everything clicking together . first 360 would access xbox live , but using other nearby wireless networks because i not give 360 password id access my linksys router . i live center city philadelphia , default adapter picking up using whatever open wireless networks available . range must good , because it would register six or seven other networks varying strengths . once i figured out my linksys router password code ( i think it wep number ) i able punch router id into 360 360 then automatically connected secure wireless router my home . i never single issue since . i don't think this delay optimal setup anyone fault but my own , since i pretty ignorant how wireless networks set up but i feeling it may happen others . all all , i think secure wireless network home what become standard next few years . this adapter works great , small disappears behind console , reduces clutter wires , allows you keep your computer high speed connection separate distinct your television area . it definitely worthy purchase	1

castlevania : curse darkness game even die-hard castlevania fan might not much get into . lament innocence wasn't terrible game , but it wasn't great . curse darkness just goes show when 3d castlevania game marches forth , it problems . sometimes scary problems . like lament innocence , it so much potential good -- this title more so . but it doesn't deliver , that sad revelation admit , especially after so much enjoyment ds smash : dawn sorrow . ever since 1997 all time best , symphony night , so many main characters series like alucard some way . hector curse darkness no exception . he looks little like alucard . but we're not here discuss . hector devil forgemaster , one who given up his powers . dracula dead , but land overun curse monsters world valachia . hector , however , isn't concerned what kind shape world . he more concerned evil devil forgemaster name issac , who killed his beloved . if you couldn't guess , it time revenge . so issac leads hector into place full traps obstacles he must overcome . doing so , hector slowly recover his devil forgemaster skills whatnot . story actually unfolds excellent voice-acting , but there isn't much story . since symphony night we've given this metroid style exploration when it comes castlevania . this marvelous , once again , makes its way into 3d world castlevania . you explore large castle riddled goodies . this includes weapons , subweapons , armor much more . playing game quite fun . most game , you might guessed , spent running through endless hallways defeating monsters . isn't boring you might think . you perform some cool looking combos enemies , but each one must finished button . you also lock onto enemies perform combos . this makes camera go crazy , though , but this forgiveable . battling without locking actually much better , it isn't too hard without . although , if you want steal your enemies , you'll lcok ' em . speaking stealing , it nice you actually . many time monster leave himself open stealing . this usually occurs while it recovers taking damage . again , you must locked it happen . likewise , unlike lament innocence , they actually use level up system . other words , there actually point battling through hordes monsters this time . you also little helper monsters . you compare them familiars found other castlevania games ( like symphony night dawn sorror ) , but better comparison would pokemon . they lend their assistance gain experience defeating enemies , just you . it nice not go it alone , but we castlevania veterans would prefer go it alone . each enemy also drops evolution crystals . collect enough them your monster evolve . you won't grow like them , though . that sad part , they don't really enhance gameplay . monsters special abilities , though . golem like creatures open heavy doors , imps let you bury underground . but you can't help but admit it would nice if your little innocent devils actually characters . also , no evolution crystal same . you take advantage system collecting different types crystals seeing how your little buddies evolve . one nice things devil forger , you make your own weapons ! hector it any time he wants ! that right , no running back some stupid shop it ! monsters often drop raw materials , you use them make new weapons or make your current weapons stronger . you this simply opening menu . i don't know you , but that pretty satisfying me able tha t.t he weapons their own little downside however . exception sword , none them highly helpful combat . you start game off short sword , you'll grow accustomed its fast speed easy use . other weapons just aren't fast enough , enemies aren't weak certain weapon " type " . this makes weapon crafting system little useless some points . unless you're person who likes use " cool " looking weapons opposed swift powerful weapons , you won't much use weapon crafting system , except power up your sword . thus , experimenting weapons garners no fun . it pretty cool , i must say , venturing somewhere isn't dracula castle . instead you actually venture through world valachia . meaning you'll trek through swamps , mountains , valleys lot more . so if you're tired dracula castle , this quite change . problem this " world " you don't see enough it . there not enough detail it . you follow beaten path ( so it isn't really different than dracula castle lament innocence ) , so you can't go off just explore places you're . game also suffers what lament innocence suffered : lack detailed enviroments . you'll no doubt run down same path/hall/corridor several times over . if it weren't map you'd find yourself lost , thinking you must one those " looping " ares , or you took wrong turn ended up running circle . monsters also not so great . what i love 2d castlevania games ( especially new dawn sorrow ) how much variety thrown into monsters . attacks they use you . even if they're same looking monster , they throw some new attack you don't expect . curse darkness ( like lament innocence ) no variety . you'll run into same batch monsters constantly , they'll never something new . later game you'll find yourself fighting nothing but reincarnates different colored monsters nothing new . likewise , all monsters you'll ever see encountered pretty early . moment you run into axe armor , you've run into ' em all ! they'll never change . i sound like i'm picky enemies thing , but i'm not . it takes away challenge game . fact reincarnates don't anything new makes it more true . that not worst part : game overall just isn't challenge . bosses , times , but if you've playing 3d action games , i think you'll find even more challenging bosses no challenge all . early boss battles game fairly easy . later , however , they get start get hard , that when battling them actually becomes fun . again , though , if you're action/adventure pro , you'll probably beat most them your first try . i wish i could say graphics great . hey , hector looks great combat . but enviroments don't enough detail . too many them simple everyday enviroments we've seeing long time now . where detail ? you know ... like ... maybe leaves tree moving ? we're point where there could some kind interation enviroment , instead it seeming like we're running through still-life painting . visually , it doesn't look half bad . it just there could so much more . bosses look cool , framerate doesn't slow down all , but there isn't enough variety , or detail . however , i must say this : music sounds aweseome ! usual , castlevania games some best music there heard gaming ! it better than symphony night ? no , it not . it isn't better than lament innocence either ( which also steller music ) , but it still among best you'll ever hear video game . likewise , voice acting actually really really good ! i just wish i could've heard more it ! curse darkness potential good game . but there lot things keep it down . it fairly fun game play , but it lacks innovation . you won't able separate it other action/adventure 3d games . it got nothing makes it stick out . if you must this game , however , i'd say wait price drop . if you're really looking good castlevania game , i'd suggest getting hold " dawn sorrow " . it much better game . good : +great music ! some best gaming ! +good weapon system+it pretty fun play+you steal enemies ! +great voice acting ! bad-little innovation-lack cutscenes advance story-too much game gets recycled too fas t-t oo easy-the game doesn't look bad , but there little imagination environments-not whole lot different enemies-it too easy-boring level designs ( not enough them)-you just can't help game almost no innovation ! it no different than your average action/adventure 3d gameget dawn sorrow , or one other 2d versions game . they seem fare so much better than this one . even die-hard fan castlevania admit this one rather bland	1

no solo para los rpg fans -------------------------- se que hay muchos que no gustan de los rpg , de hecho yo mismo no soy fan de estos . asi que al empezar jugar oblivion lo hice solo por curiosidad , por probar que tan buenas eran las graficas el gameplay . al principio no me pareci� gran cosa ... pero cuando sales la primera vez campo abierto ... incre�ble ! te quita el aliento . una vez empiezas recorrer todo el reino de tamriel el juego te atrapa cr�anme no puedes esperar el momento de regresar seguir explorando este gigantesco mundo lleno de secretos maravillas . cuando pienses en oblivion , no imagines un juego tipo las final fantasy , o los t�picos rpg japoneses , este es un rpg que apela un publico mucho m�s amplio . aquellos que gustan de juegos como zelda , o aventuras como enclave , incluso los fans de los juegos de sigilo como splinter cell , encontraran aqu� algo para ellos . camino la gloria ---------------------- es4 : oblivion te coloca en el rol de un prisionero , que por alguna raz�n , fuiste parte de un sue�o del emperador uriel septim en el cual tu eras el elegido para salvar tamriel de un oscuro grupo daedra conocido como mythic dawn . de esta forma empiezas vagar por las catacumbas ayudando los guardias proteger al emperador , sin embargo el emperador es asesinado tu eres la unica esperanza de detener este culto cerrar las puertas de oblivion as� detener la invasi�n de los daedra tamriel . es en esta parte donde empiezas la personalizaci�n de tu personaje , que habilidades deseas , cuales ser�n tus fortalezas debilidades . dependiendo te tus elecciones , podr�s ser un guerrero , un mago , un sigiloso ladron asi como pertenecer cualquier raza que desees . conforme avanza el juego debes ir haciendo crecer tus habilidades para poder ganar experiencia . �como hacerlo ? eso depende del tipo de personaje que escogiste , hay toda una gama de habilidades desarrollar . empaca tus cosas --------------------- oblivion posee infinidad de misiones realizar ( aproximadamente 500 horas de juego ) , claro esta , hay una misi�n principal que es encontrar al heredero del emperador cerrar la puertas de oblivion , sin embargo , si as� lo deseas , puedes ignorarla tomar otras b�squedas como unirte la hermandad de los magos � la de los luchadores , pelear en la arena , ganar fama fortuna o simplemente explorar ayudar los diferentes habitantes de tamriel en sus vidas diarias . cuando hablamos de juegos donde puedes hacer lo que quieras , ahora estaremos hablando de oblivion . el reino de tamriel es enorme , hay muchas ciudades que visitar cada una tan diferente de la otra , los personajes parecen tener vida propia , sus problemas , discusiones , mitos , etc . ademas de los pueblos encontraras infinidad de aldeas mazmorras donde , explor�ndolas , descubrir�s toda clase de items que te ayudar�n completar las tareas que hayas escogido . lo bueno , lo malo lo caro ----------------------- en el apartado grafico oblivion realmente te quita el aliento , los paisajes , las monta�as los bosques son simplemente impresionantes . los �rboles se mueven con el viento , igual que el follaje . los atardeceres amaneceres son simplemente espectaculares , esto agregado que puedes explorar cualquier parte de este gigantesco mundo es lo que hace oblivion ser una experiencia sobrecogedora de principio fin ( si es que hay fin ... ) . sin embargo un juego tan gigantesco como este no esta libre de problemas , de vez en cuento encontraras ciertos bugs , como tu caballo flotando misteriosamente sobre una roca , etc . sin embargo son nada ante lo que le juego ofrece . lo caro , todo tiene un precio , si realmente quieres apreciar este juego en toda su magnificencia necesitas una pc relativamente potente . aunque hay un parche para pc no muy potentes . shut jaws oblivion ! --------------------------- oblivion es uno de los principales contendientes para juego del a�o , asi que no te lo pierdas es un juego fant�stico . si estas pensando que hacer estas vacaciones te recomiendo un viaje tamriel cr�anme ser�n unas vacaciones que nunca olvidaras ...	1
might little misleading -- battle mechanics almost exactly same those first game ( heck , most nippon ichi games , though this series , i think , best lot ) . part game absolutely delivers : - great classes . - good monsters , more consistent class sytem them . - excellent assortment items . - good variety levels . however , far story -- area which hour darkness solid -- this game falls its face . writing iffy , plot itself contrived , characters ( while certainly amusing ) predictable , it just leaves so much desired . if you're looking storyline you get involved , go back first game . if you're it gameplay , though , don't miss this one ! some class tweaks few added features , cursed memories worthy addition those who simply want monotonous level-up madness some us thrive . great 2d art mixed fun environments , hilarious quips item descriptions , engaging fights hundreds hours ( literally ) entertainment	1

fable much anticipated rpg promised 40-50 hours gamer action storyline complete control over life protagonist . we waited this game what seemed like lifetime build up game finally arrive almost more than rpg lovers could take , but it live up hype ? no , my fellow gamers . it hurts me so say it . while game promised deliver several hours stoyline play i shocked when i completed main storyline less than 20 hours . now , i'm not one doubt sacred words lionhead studios , so i dedicated 20 hours my life uncover different aspects gameplay , such getting married , changing outfits body types , becoming divinely evil or majestically good ( ect . ) , but it all just so linear ! paths set , storyline already thought out , character chosen , you weren't given enough keep interest going . i later dragged myself back game play storyline through again , though i admit i enjoyed game much more second time through , i just found myself not caring it all . too many options closed darn story just too short !! darker elements game simply addicting such colleseum , prison ( which i played over over over ) , story your sister , but it seems though people charge developing such side stories ( which we all so love !!! ) got little case a.d.d. now , i'm not saying avoid this game . it got just what some gamers may need get into rpg , but those us who expecting game completely pwn morrowind , well , let just move ... or wait better thought our sequal . * crosses fingers	1

i played through first halo really enjoyed single-player campaign . i never played multiplayer game until i bought halo 2 . let get this out way first : halo 2 multiplayer unparalleled . multitude multiplayer games ( capture flag , juggernaut , team vs . team , etc . ) dizzying variety terrains , there plenty keep halo fans busy blowing each other up . addition alien elites playable character spice things up . you also wield two weapons time , one each fist , providing combat option those gunslingers like their battles john woo-style . unfortunately , halo 2 single-player campaign not impressive . whit , alien covenant entire society based idea activating giant rings throughout universe ( known halos ) put them their journey spiritual evolution . reality halo weapon designed destroy flood , infestation aliens who turn human alien alike into vicious zombies . how you keep flood infecting every living thing ? why , utterly destroying every living thing universe course ! play alternates master chief alien elite known arbiter . this gives player both sides story , which interesting ... point . eventually , plot converges enough so two characters should really end up fighting each other . would something , if ai made you play through both battles opposite sides creating enemy uses your own moves . but instead , midway through battle universe , giant plant looks like audrey ii little shop horrors shows up . this planet , speaking jabba-esque guttural tones , rams plot down our throats grabbing arbiter master chief shoving them into opposite plot lines : arbiter ends up working humans , master chief ends up doing alien dirty work . then things really get going , just halo 2 hurtles towards final battle earth ... game ends . i should guessed something up when , during e3 interviews halo 3 , ceo bungee only this say : " you ready finish war ? " what he meant , " you ready finish game you thought you finishing halo 2 ? " you've probably noticed my review second installment pirates caribbean , i really , really , really hate movies games fail provide whole story . it doesn't matter this part two three-part series . writers developers obligation provide full story ; you create story beginning end even though it middle series , evidenced two towers . halo 2 improvement original , but it loses points weak campaign forces you play both sides , then throws talking plant clean up mess .	1
if you always wanted turn based strategy game fantasy setting no limits then dominions ii really only option out there . its not perferct but its darn good . story , if you really call it , world dominions once one god . one day he just wasn't there all sudden everybody their brother decided try apply his job . all these " pretender gods " kill off all other gods put their religions out commision order take over world become true god . start up new game dominions ii you need choose one 17 different empires then pick your pretender god dozens different avatars . you play darn near anything you imagine ordinary , like arch-mage , outrageously exotic , like fountain blood . every pretender god strengths weaknesses some may adept only one or two paths magic while others may learn many ease . you also pick castle set up your own " dominion " which effect your god his followers his religion spreads across world . but isn't all , you still haven't actually started game yet . next you create game picking one nearly dozen huge maps setting all game settings such victory conditions difficulty neutral provinces . lets not forget , you also choose which 17 empires playing if they human or ai players . game itself huge very few limits . your empires unique units may built any province which you built castle but every proince game also its own units may built there inculde many none empires usually access . plus units may equiped different armor weapons such there may well hundreds unique units game maybe even thousands different equipment varaitions . like pretender gods , units come huge array simple , like light infantry , wild , like werewoles vampires . combine fact there hundreds spells game research , hundreds magic items forge find , random events almost every turn , no two games ever end same way game nearly unlimited replyability . combat bit unsual . all units , order move around map or attack , assigned commander . commanders built same way you recruit normal units but they only lead so many men . however , you assign units under commander many squads you like each squad well commander himself issued specific order such casting spells , using ranged weapons or attacking certain foes battle field . downside all this you set up all this before hand during your turn . combat occours turns you no control over battle . its entirely up your units follow plan you laid out them . better or worse this system certainly original . but some things game really bother me . my biggest complaint game computer ai . its not thats its too stupid or too smart . its actually bit like terminator , it allways seems know where you sends wave after wave seemingly endless foes after you . it can't reasoned , it can't bargined it won't stop until one you dead . no diplomacy options units like spys , assassins scouts extremely rare expensive most games aginst ai just deteroiate into massive rushing attacks huge armies killing each other over over gods throwing spells each other turn after turn . problem game manual which huge but contains no information isn't easily available game . its same problem evil genius , manual awful all hints should hae manual hidden games loading screens . i hope you read fast . grapics obviously aren't exactly par half life 2 or doom 3 but they work , however i've got take issue music sound which downright awful . you better get used hearing same three music tracks over over . over all , dominions ii far best turn based fantasy game i've ever played . room improvement obviously here but this game should keep you occupied long time	1
i've fan prince persia series since i little kid . pop 1 great , pop 2 absolutely unreal . pop 3d ehhh .... but then two years ago , came game changed everything . " prince persia sands time , " first game this amazing adventure game trilogy took everyone breath away . gameplay original , flawless , beautiful . storyline sucked you didn't let you go even after you'd beaten it 6 times over . it flawless game . last year , first sequel , " prince persia warrior within , " released . while game contained improvements quality graphics " freeform fighting " techniques , game less pleasing both critics gamers . ubisoft turned humrous , witty , intelligent prince " sands " into angry , nu-metal-rocking , humorlous scoundrel who seemed hellbent ruining everyone time . while story equally engaging " sands , " " warrior " failed because it simply not much fun play . luckily , ubisoft saved best last . " two thrones " easily one greatest games i ever played . concluding one greatet videogame trilogies ever created , ubisoft developed near flawless game . it though they took strengths both games , removed weaknesses second game , created thing pure brilliance . " two thrones " contains all witty , punning elements first game mixes them exciting , more violent elements second game while removing everying ruined prince demeanor second game . original , fun , saracastic prince back , largely because ubisoft also brought back one things made " sands " so great : farrah . farrah perfect foil our hero . she adds humor , power , creativity , definitely sexiness game " warrior " lacking . farrah relationship prince far my favorite relationship i've ever " played " videogame ubisoft deserves big brownie points bringing her back . gameplay " two thrones " amazing . throughout game , gamer occassionally forced play " dark prince " there situations where " normal , " original prince unable get through . other games , playing two characters often appeared more gimmick than actual , integral part story , but " two thrones , " reasoning behind prince frequent changing prince dark prince back again very well explained very important overall story " two thrones telling . " fight scenes epicly fun play . this prince more moves than he two last games combined his battle techniques joy use . new " speed kill " method killing some opponents adds certain amount skill brutality many fights otherwise would seemed boring taken far too long complete . i welcomed addition speed kills once i fully learned how use them . prince still moves acrobatically ever . there still wall-running , jumping , flipping , handsprings , etc .... only real notable movement difference when gamer plays dark prince . dark prince chain/weapon/thing used grab onto bars away or objects would otherwise out reach prince then swing over them . it not different anything prince before but it definitely fun worked well flow game . all all i rate this best new sands pop trilogy . it awesome game should played anyone who ever enjoyed 3rd person adventure game . if you haven't played either one first two games warned : storyline actually rather complex you missing much story if you haven't played first two games . if you played first two games , this story terrific conclusion prince tale , way it wraps around back beginning trilogy floored me when i finished it . buy this game . ( something worth noting ... after you beat game you unlock many videos , chief among these " alternate/real ending " warrior within formerly only available if you beat warrior after collecting all life upgrades .... so if you beat warrior without all life upgrades didn't see " real " ending ... beating this game shows it you video collection )	1

i very much enjoyed this game i think it may my favorite x-box game i own ! i kinda agree person said this game pretty short , but it not make it any less better ! one funny part this game part where you sunny first time game jump each pipe whole time she just sitting there laughing her head off ! i reccomend this game people like games fun , educational , very durable	1
simply put , xenogears + xenosaga 1 absolute best storyline , best role playing experience ps2 date . i strongly believe xenosaga 2 best storyline any rpg i ever , ever played , including final fantasy 7 , xenogears , hundreds others . because rpgs strongly reliant storyline gameplay , i consider this pinnacle role playing ps2 . final fantasy comes close , star ocean , but terms storyline , this game beats them . however , i mark down few other minor flaws . this game highly niche game , only those who enjoy style , sci fi setting . it also very short ..... 20 hours if you play straight through ( no leveling up ) . maybe 38-42 hours if you take up side-quests want strong character . gameplay : first xenosaga highly relied cut scenes narrative . fact , i absolutely could not stand battle system . xenosaga episode 2 still relies heavily upon storytelling through hours cut scenes , but it fixes battle system . battle system , simply put , one most fun turn-based systems i ever experienced . while xenosaga episode 1 battle system seemed slow unwieldy , episode 2 fast paced , action packed , highly challenging battle system . you 3 characters screen just all times , these characters switched off manner much like ffx , but it costs turn this game , causing it more tactical . each turn you many options ; you attack ( more various attacks later ) , stock ( save turn next turn order get combo ) , use ether ( read : magic ) , or change your battle party . if you choose attack , there whole slew options here well . most importantly learning weak points enemy . every enemy , including bosses , certain attack combination most effective against them . when you attack , you press either square , which zone attack , triangle , which zone attack , or circle , which zone attack . certain characters also zone attack , but this only against flying opponents . you must expierament enemies order learn zones they weakest . sometimes , you may required ' stock ' turn order attack enemy its weak zone . " what advantage attacking weak zones ? " you ask . well , it allows large scale , damage pounding comboes absolutely essential this game . once you hit all enemy weak zones , you " break " them . this involves circle button . once character ' broken ' , they tossed into air , or attacked while prone ground . this add up tons damage if you plan your boosting right . boosting integral part combat system . pressing r1 button brings up 3 slot meter which sometimes empty , but it may feature character potraits some your characters . if you press r1 , then button ( square , triangle , or circle ) character potrait , they boost forward , immediately after acting unit taken its turn , this new character turn . enemies , however , take advantage all these systems well . if you not plan well , or randomly attack without comboes , enemy break you , boost ahead several times , easily destroy one your characters one short , brutal assault . countless times my entire party destroyed simple enemies should no problem , merely because i not plan ahead . you get very , very used seeing game over screen . plus side this difficulty you feel real exhiliration when you win , it great accomplishment . note even power levelling , it won't help you much some situations , believe me , i tried . finally , there ether . ether skills basically magic , if you know anything rpgs all , then you know basically what present here , healing ether skills , attack ether skills , nothing big . i forgot mention e.s. units . these basically mechs , called a.g.w.s. episode 1 . many points game involve you using these move around fight , now they independant battle system . it basically same one your characters screen , except you only one attack turn , no comboes or anything like . it just added piece fun already awesome game . there skill system place . after every battle you earn class pointss and/or skill points . these spent getting new ether skills , or new upgrades your characters make them more resilient when you equip them . every character same skill set , this minor flaw slightly brings down gameplay score , but not overall enjoyment least . finally , one other flaw gameplay there no weapons , no armor . both these rpg standard fare , it seems kind odd not either . this may just something developers decided not i disagree , but it still seems little odd . note this really not detract game any way . xenosaga 2 , they also opted add lot more puzzle solving than episode 1 . interesting thing these puzzles , while challenging , don't take away gameplay expierience all . fact , i found many very enjoyable . storyline this game simply incredible . but , keep mind it basically required you beaten xenosaga episode 1 if you want understand it all , or least acquainted story some manner . if you haven't played it , best way get bonus dvd came game , there probably some somewhere around , maybe even ebay , allows you see 4 hours cut scenes original . this substitute those who dont want spend 60-80 hours required xenosaga episode 1 beat it . anyway , i digress , xenosaga 2 storyline more space opera fun . often times i got very emotional , game tug your heartstrings . ending sequence game , spectacular event lasting 15 minutes , i seriously tears . this game you , storyline good . it also filled entrigue , betrayal , new discoveries , new secrets . it truly incredible . i seen certain reviews say storyline doesn't solve everything , it doesn't solve all mysteries . let me tell you something : it not supposed . xenosaga going 4-8 part series , storyline continuous . it makes no sense all story complete only episode ii . i see no reason why anyone could possibly complain it . graphics : graphics xenosaga 2 basically same they episode 1 . no real improvements all . they still great though , cut scenes gorgeous . my one real complaint here lip sync sometimes off ( problem just every rpg voice overs ) , some environments little dull . this made up environments simply breathtaking . sound : soundtrack xenosaga episode 2 godlike . opening theme battle music catchy japanese sounding tunes ring your head forever , this music incredible . voice acting also absolutely superb , i zero complaints , this rarity . sound effects also very appropriate , very well . value : game hurt value department only because its length . put it perspective , first playthrough took me 28 hours , but more like 30 if you count all times i died go back point i got killed . after you win , you use your game clear file access even more goodies like some bonus bosses , dungeons , side quests , this helps make up shorter length . personally , i think its best $50 i ever spen t.t ilt : finally , overall enjoyment . this game simply most enjoyable game i played ps2 . i completed it after several all-night gaming sessions , it most likely keep you up too . role playing experience here superb , storyline possibly best rpg history , battle system incredible depth . there virtually nothing not like . avid rpg gamer , i recommend this game highly possible . however , there few things consider : you handle challenge , you like space opera/anime feel ? if you answered yes both , get this game	1
i find this game very indepth when it comes ability change formations plays just what you see . however , my major disappointment comes graphics . i understand ps2 doesn't not standards xbox360 , but this false advertising showing this very detailed game not showing which system this ran . i just hope when ps3 comes out , madden rerelease game it give xbox360 owners something whine . ea should more infomational giving what things look like consumer rather then just showing best picture they	1
admittedly , i haven't played lot strategy rpgs . i attempted play final fantasy tactics , generally considered classic genre , one point , but i found it really dry i serious problems class system seems really unbalance game making it too easy . i've never really much motivation seek out other examples srpg genre because there nippon-ichi disgaea series , unique it fun . long-lasting too . you spend several hundred hours playing through disgaea : hour darkness disgaea 2 : cursed memories beat all bonus content beyond main campaign . disgaea 2 shines more polished version first disgaea . character sprites more vivid , spell effects more visual flare . music dialogue sharper audio quality . all bonus quests first disgaea expanded such inclusion dark court endless dungeon item world even more stuff dark assembly . however , it also so similar first game it feels almost like expansion pack rather than true sequel . story disgaea 2 similar first one , it highly character driven told quite bit humor . overlord zenon tranformed all residents world veldime into monsters . adell , last remaining human , embacks quest slay overlord rozalin , zenon haughty neglected daughter . way , they meet colorful cast enemies , rivals , allies they attempt crack mystery behind near-immortal zenon . it enjoyable story , if bit meandering . it one major susprise twist end caught me off guard though it probably shouldn't . combat , like most srpgs , takes place series grid-like maps , usually four chapter . characters move around so many squares per turn opportunity attack any enemies falls within their attack range . battlefields littered geo-panels , multicolored pyramids confer penalties bonuses certain areas maps . there dozens classes , both monster human , fashion powerful army out . choose wisely , because grand total 10 deployed any one time . unfortunately , experience points only go character deals final blow so level disparities characters combined steadily increasing difficulty curve make it neccesary replay some maps times . luckily , difficulty curve much more finely tuned this game , so you spend less time leveling up than first game . main campaign disgaea 2 pretty short , i clocked little over 30 hours my first play through , granted i barely touched much sidequests . i also found it little easy side . i didn't die once until i penultimate chapter . i don't know it because game easier or if it just spending over one hundred hours conquering first game . sprgs probably hardest sub-set out rpg genre . disgaea series highly recommended experienced inexperienced players alike . disgaea 2 many different systems enhance playing experience , but unlike many games , doesn't force player learn how work them all . players option playing game face value or learning all complex systems more enriched experience . this very accessable game , this genre definitely needs more games strike balance too hard or too easy .	1
i think this might one my favorites ff series . i think all characters awesome . their overdrives very cool too	1

one thing kotor 2 greatly impressed me how obsidian , taking kotor franchise over bioware , not mess winning formula . they faithfully carried over first game visual style , presentation , atmosphere , which means those who played kotor 1 jump right . just like kotor 1 , game hinges its story rather than fancy gimmicks or better graphics or more features . kotor 2 storyline runs parallel kotor 1 , introduces new protagonist whose only tie first game he/she fought mandalorian wars . again , characters bit flat/stereotypical , most talking throughout game ( you mostly choose how you'll respond others through your dialogue choices ) . main reason why i would actually rate this game higher - yes , higher - than kotor 1 intelligence script . what i mean how game characters challenge you ( both main character person playing game ) think long hard some things regarded " truths . " yes , i'm talking some serious philosophy here . example , kreia , one your allies , challenges you think how random act kindness actually robs person that helped chance struggle , fight , become stronger it . jedi master challenge you think what if cause you believed strongly ends up doing just much harm it prevents . instance game shows dangers both blind allegiance independent thought ( yes , latter also dangers ) . best part all this presented within context game various scenarios , without ever sounding preachy . far gameplay mechanics concerned , obsidian spiced up battle interface new force powers feats , which open up new dimension strategizing outfitting your party . unfortunately it seems all bugs glitches first game carried over well , such " doorway bug " " menu bug . " playing pazaak still just hard . nod those who played first game , obsidian decided insert many references kotor 1 here there . example , kotor 2 recycles two planets first game , dantooine korriban . maps identical ones first game , but this time you explore slightly different parts planets . people game constantly referring mandalorian wars ( war fought five years before kotor 1 timeline ) jedi civil war ( events kotor 1 ) . fact , you'll find jedi civil war casts very large shadow over lives many people you'll encounter game , including most your allies . you'll find played first game certainly enriches this one , although it not crucial . so , summary , if you're suffering post-kotor withdrawal symptoms , your prayer answered - go buy this game now	1
i enjoyed most aspects this game it quickly becaming addicting . there great satisfaction beating people up plenty opportunity fine tune my skills . overall though , this game definately easy side . compared grand theft auto games , which i never able complete , i finished this one just over week . final challenge particularly simple i really expected more . still , i'd recommened this game , however rent it , don't buy	1
xbox version this game way better . one , graphics enhanced , not crappy like ps2 version . second all loading time processing time literally cut half . so dont buy this version , suck it up buy xbox . oh if this game bores you , you either weren't using cheats or u havent played missions atleast through los santos	1
i owned xbox over 3 years now it really best gaming machine last generation . mine worked perfectly , i love music soundtracks where you load your own cds unto hard drive play them instead certian game sountracks . game selection much better xbox graphics . you get halo , project gotham racing 2 , midtown madness 3 ( must fun game ) , xbox live . i used my xbox play dvds media center extender ( purchase $25 kit comes remote ) it works well , no fumbling your controller like ps2 , just simple remote !	1
i recently picked this game up because laptop i purchased college finally computer powerful enough run it . it easily one best computer games i've ever played . playing world massive ( you literally walk any mountain or monument you see distance ) there multiple ways accomplish goal and/or solve mission . basic plot this : you jack carver , who accompanied woman part micronesia undisclosed reasons ( she turns out cia agent ) , before long she kidnapped , you fighting your life against army well-trained mercenaries . it fairly generic shooter plot , but it gets point across ties everything together well . enemy ai unbelievably good . soldiers work together take you down ( all while dropping hilariously bad one-liners like " how you like those apples ?? " , " right eyes , mofo ! " , " i'm gonna tear you new one !! " ) . shootouts result this game blast : you really get good cover strategize your fight . it first shooter i've played makes me feel like i'm actually action movie . vehicles one game biggest highlights . if you want move quicker downstream , you snipe occupants frequent patrol boats water steal their ride . you often obtain rvs atvs ( one point game , forklift reasons unknown ) . these blast you drive right through enemies firing you . one thing i enjoy doing driving full speed enemy bailing out last second . always good fun . game also great challenge . i just completed game medium setting it still almost impossible places . fighting trigens ( small monkey-like creatures claws ) nightmare any diffculty , they outrun outjump you kill you , often , single hit ( i strongly suggest using sniper rifle or powerful machine gun other than m4 them long distance before they really mess you up ! )in short , this best fps i ever played , probably one best computer games ever made overall . highly recommended . ( side note : not it matters me , but i'm personally surprised this game got mature rating ... there barely any blood all , none it sticks floor . when shot rocket launcher , people don't explode like normally mature-rated shooters . this game should rated teen )	1
this particularly good game our younger kids , though our 9 year old able finish entire game weekend . our 7 year old continues enjoy it without same degree frustration he experiences some other games bit too old him . this game great even though kids not seen movie	1
i just bought this game last month , played all way through it , including unlockable side quests . i'm not going write much games story here , there plenty other reviews already . all i'm going write game itself . anyway , after playing all way through game , i say i like it even more than original . script much better , music sounds much better gba . one thing i particularly liked this game all new unlockables ! after beating game , you unlock new dungeon explore , well really cool music player ! if you go down extra select " music player " main menu , you listen all tunes melodies you heard throughout game ! my personal favorites include , hey cid !, rydia , theme love , chocobo-chocobo , dancing calcobrena . unlockable dungeon , lunar ruins , very cool ! fully unlock every room dungeon , you beat zeromus once each character . after , you get some really cool extra tasks each character ! i wont spoil them you , but just them game highly increases overall replay value this game . now pros cons this remake ... pros:it same old game you used love , but some cool upgrades additions game play . new quick save feature allows you save inside dugeons towns . some text old game fixed so now all magic spells aren't abreviated . example : meteo fixed read meteor . new unlockable music player side quest dungeon ! music sounds much sharper gba , you really hear seperate instruments playing unison . this version old , unedited script , which far more convincing durring game play . cons : unlike final fantasy chronicles , this game not include chrono trigger . they changed sound effects some moves , changed names some moves . example , meteor doesnt make screechy noise anymore , ( which i thought sounded cool ) nuke changed flare . battle , there seems lag reaction time when pressing down buttons ... ( you press button , but it takes second register command . ) 50/50 : none graphics upgraded , but if you're like me , doesnt really matter . if you're like me , already played final fantasy ii snes or final fantasy chronicles psone , buy this game ! it well worth price	1
if you " mechassault " xbox live gamer tag try playing me ! i usually play capture flag my gamer tag " minor00 " so if you see me sure challenge me game because this game rocks !!!!!!!!!!!!!!	1
scarface world yours ( vivendi games ) one most hyped videos games 2006 . following success godfather game , people couldn't wait get their hands scarface game especially when some reviewers said it good or better than grand theft auto games . game takes what if scenario , i.e. , what if tony montana didn't die end scarface but instead loses everything rebuild his empire . first i start off important matter -- player control movement . comparison past vivendi/universal games i say player control movement very good . next up weapons . i personally felt like aim shooting ability could vastly improved . according tutorial you press l1 target r1 shoot but they failed mention you must use analog stick aim your weapon . maybe you don't , maybe it just me , this isn't instructions but i found more success when i used analog stick conjunction l1 r1 . game begins you your mansion facing hail gunfire enemies . top your balcony you must shoot enemies . then came my first moment " oh this isn't much free world grand theft auto , " when i tried descend left side staircase i couldn't get down it . it like there invisible forcefield . perhaps you need kill certain amount enemies before you descend down left stairs . i made my kills then descended down right side staircase take remainder enemies . there function named blind rage comes out when you press button controller . this function makes tony temporarily invincible . when he dies , screen it says " you f*cked up . " just one example cursing game . word used so much this game adult i wish there would filter change language setting . i literally play game mute because all foul language . scarface-the world yours fun game if you like violent games . i point out gamer rock star games spoiled us terribly . scarface-the world yours you pretty much stay mission or there isn't much . past five years grand theft auto series given us ability perform street races , visit shooting range , import vehicles , gamble , dance , work out , or just walk around mess things up when we aren't mission . scarface-the world yours you basically stay mission . there isn't too much extra when you aren't mission . sometimes game player i get tired shooting so much just want take break something different . i strongly suggest buying prima games strategy guide . it definitely unlocks full potential game . scarface-the world yours overall fun game , but it still doesn't give game player total free open world experience some gta games . but yeah , get strategy guide , it gives player something look forward .	1
plz stop doing reviews over how bad it few options , cuz it just simply isn't way . yo fire flaming people catapults or let you creature throw flaming guy middle army so middle army willl fire . you just need creative . think like what happen if i teach my creature pick up army guy set him fire than throw middle thightly builded city . this game many options , but you'll create these options . this wasn't really review but comment other reviews who saying boring dull etc . this game you make it fun your imagination	1

i no longer play video games ( though i recently started back computergames ) but i review this great set . you get two games : fianl fantasy 5 , final fantasy 6 . first , let us look ff5 . ff5 never released states officialy but squaresoft ( now called squareenix ) unleashed it upon us all . it story isn't greatest but it not story here ; it all gameplay . this main reason this my favourite series . job class indepth gives you lot options here . this improves upon already great job class ff3 ( not ff6 ) only comes insecond job class system found dragon warrior 3 dragon warrior 7 . i also like size if this game , there three different worlds here they all good size . i also love main villian name , x-death , his final form name , neo x-death . there lot more good things make this game great but i'll let you discover them . ff6 also solid game introduced some things would found later ff games . one thing indepth stories multiple characters play . even though lot fans like say ff7 got best villian series , i many others dissagree . kefka jst pure evil incarnate . i'm not going into details so you yourself find all little things make him such awesome bad guy he . it just great game . if you don't mind 2-d graphics , old games , then yourself favoure get this fine set now	1
this great game which yoiu get caught up action . it almost if " you there "	1

unfortunately xenosaga i - der wille zur macht never come europe . but second xenosaga ( jenseits von gut und bse ) released germany november i very happy . so i played it impressed this cool story gameplay ! i became big xenosaga-fan . after i imported first part series america . now i am playing it i must say , first xenosaga much better than second !!!! it great pity xenosaga episode i never brought out germany europa !! you americans should very happy , so many rpgs come your country ^_	1
parents : content this game seems absolutally fine anyone roughly ten up . only reason i see it rated teen because this game requires good bit hand eye cordination sometimes . aslo hulk roaring might get little kids who still around age where they still come up you middle night check there closets monsters , but basicly if your kids handel action cartoons like ninja turtles justice league they deffinately handel this game . anyways ... i wasn't sure this game when i picked it up . i don't know why , i hadn't heard much it i hadn't played many comic book based games besides spiderman based one playstation . but i didn't see many other games rental store kids could play my xbox so i rented it out see if it okay . it , my opinion , absolutaly great game almost anyone . entire game like digital stress ball me , you get rampage your hearts desire . i spent few hours alone week just ignoring story chapters completely just wrecking huge city desert military bases game takes place . kids would also love it same reason they build lego houses then smash them bits their action figures . story bit odd if you don't know much hulk already it revolves around bruces quest cure order stop second more evil cunning hulk bruce banner discoverted growing inside him appropriatly named devil hulk . big green savage hulk we all know love also doesn't like devil hulk moving banner mind , so it becomes more agreeable suconicous orders banner uses get child-like brute what he wants . meanwhile new baddie called abomination appears after one military general stupidly trys recover one bruce failed " cure " attempts very begining game . all all story okay you go , but you tell they tried stuff several comicbooks basic ideas into game story only excuse callenge you bosses other unique situations . far gameplay goes , it fantasic . more damage you cause , more smash points you earn more moves you buy later too continue your assult just everything . there mini games secrets everywhere earn even more smash points . fact , only thing that missing o-o or two player mode . far replayability goes , it always there . anyway , i would recommended this game a)anyone who kids roughly around ten , ) anyone who likes third person , single player games ) anyone one who stress out work one too many times or feels like throwing temper tantrum :)	1

i'm not going into storyline , becuase it obivously spoil it those who haven't oppurtunity play this excellent game . final fantasy first game final fantasy series released playstation 2 . graphics here sharp crisp , no fuzzness or distortions . voice actors actually good job , doesn't sound like those old kung-fu movies where tone voices ] don't match person appearnace . battle system simple use they offer tutorials within menu case you're still confused . i'm really pleased results i see myself playing this game over over again	1

gameplay overall feel this game screams castlevania . sidescrolling platform action spot , graphics truly push limits ds , variety equipment/soul combinations lend itself perfectly creating gameplay experience perfect your style play . people said past reviews , use touch screen feels tacked . defeat bosses you draw symbols screen , which frustrating if ) you poor penmenship , or ) left-handed ( such yours truly ) scramble take stylus out , switch it your other hand , draw symbol . it neat little addition but , again , it didn't really need there . also , boss battles sometimes little too easy , even later levels . don't get me wrong , there some just downright nasty , but some bosses fire off their special weapon all you look screen go " ... that it ? " overall , this great game nintendo ds . exception clunky touch screen addon , game overall fantastic	1

i've gta fan few years now me , san andreas got best one . first time you swim !! i fell into water accidently discovered this new action character . graphics more real making it kind " funky " controlling game but after awhile you'll get used it . language terrible ( more so this gta version ) so young kids should avoid this like plague .	1
when i first played this game i shocked . just how good stealth game could actually . its realistic its ways you hide shadows use enviroment take out your enemies . its really fun also , suspense one main things happens this game . you only use two guns during whole game , pistol rifle attachments . good stuff . all you need , you take out whole building full enemies . you crouch , move slowly so enemy doesnt see you . very realistic game im happy this series games got released . i highly recommend this game . great storyline , last level hecka hard !	1
most starwars games your jedi but this one your clone . i cool . you lead squad around give them orders like attack somthing , blow something up , or even hack computer . unlike other games where your partners aren't much any help this game your squad helps alot . also you don't everything yourself you tell your squad just anything . it also fun beat more than once , it multi player like halo if you don't xbox live . i'm thirteen	1
main appeal grand theft auto franchise always freedom it gives player explore vast amounts territory cause mayhem he sees fit . san andreas contains far most audacious expansion landmass available you . this time action takes place california inspired locales such los santos , san fierro las vegas inspired las venturas , all within enormous state san andreas . main inspiration this time around fascination ghetto culture so predominant early 90 . this provides great opportunity rockstar take advantage setting implement some new challenges player conquer . new grand theft auto concept territory control , member street gang player opportunity take over every available territory los santos later game . perhaps most notable additions franchise ability customize your character appearance improve his varied skills throughout game . these may seem like rather superficial additions but they surprisingly satisfying when implemented properly . character skill growth happens naturally rarely interferes freeform exploration players come expect series . customization your avatar varies greatly encompasses most fashion styles found during early `90s california . lower tier stores offer usual assortment baggy pants sports jerseys while more expensive stores offer suits , expensive jewelry trendy fashions . your characters appearance varied you want it it not stop just clothes tattoos , his physical fitness also changed . grand theft auto franchise improved almost all aspects each subsequent release this one proves no different . last game series use this outdated engine it pushes it far it go terms graphical prowess . graphics slightly improved over previous installment but they remain sub par standard featured most games released around same time . nonetheless visuals quite effective sunsets fill san andreas orange tint game color palette faithfully replicates feel early nineties california culture . soundtrack aptly replicates time period which san andreas draws its visual style perhaps one complaint this subject would rockstar seems try encompass far too many genres music . expected genres found , such hip-hop alternative rock , both which strong presence early nineties pop scene . however , some stations seem oddly out place game world era . dance music funk each get their own stations yet it hardly seems worth it , although too much choice never bad thing . making welcomed return various radio station djs , who each pepper time tracks hilarious chat amusing observations . those would prefer listen nothing but banter there two radio stations talk radio format , one public station holding discussions day political events light talk shows . either one these stations more than enough keep player amused hours but just case pc version gives you added bonus playing your own mp3 tracks adding them game music library . sound effects themselves seem appropriate but never particularly impressive . there usual banter among pedestrians complaints motorists you pull them out their vehicle run off their ride . all these things add little bit life game large cities voice work varies enough cover all different geographical areas san andreas contains . thick southern accents countryside inhabitants snobbish tone civilians rich neighborhoods all present . gunfire explosions sound average , not much improvement present since vice city . despite controversy seems follow every release series san andreas praiseworthy title itself . engrossing action game continues expand its limits while continuing deliver what fans series come expect	1
basketball aspect this game little more fun than nba live 2006 just because refs not constantly interupt gmaeplay . but graphic-wise , this game worst graphics than any other sprts game since 2003 , i'm talking ps2 version . but close-up graphics very good . my faveorite part game you even fantasy draft play now mode . but if you basketball fan you really should get this , it extremely fun	1
" creature kapu cave " nancy drew hardy boys work together solve mystery surrounding dying pineapple crops hawaii possible relation this top-secret scientific work nearby family who owns vacation excursion center . nancy there working entomologist ( bug scientist ) hardy boys hawaii some detective work family who runs excursion center . locals believe mytholocial creature angered therefore responsible dying crops - they right ? if not , who else could behind it why ? this nd game several new features . first , you go back forth playing both nancy drew hardy boys - each responsible different parts story . also , through use gps you drive wherever you need go . although i thought graphics great , i didn't like fact i couldn't stay any one area very long - once you 1 or 2 things you move place /or identity switch nancy hardy . because this , there wasn't too much explore any one place . overall , i really liked playing " creature kapu cave " - but i would enjoyed it more i able explore each area more wasn't forced move place place so quickly	1
these 2 games probably ( my opinion anyway ) best ones series . i review each game seperatly then make my comments collection itself . ff5 : one previously unreleased ff games ( time anyway ) now america . i really like choosing classes because it raise replay value through roof . i literally trained my characters ( this during beginning middle game ) get level 30 or 40 ( can't remember exactly ) just get my jobs mastered . storyline good well because unlike some other ff games , this one sticks one you need get rid ( x-death ) rather than fighting final battle against someone you no clue what makes character so evil why your fighting him/her instead one who destroying world . bad thing this game lack characters ( there only 5 entire game , you stick 4 , one them dies replaced his granddaughter ) so prepared look same 4 characters screen also not menu change characters . ff6 : i think this best one series . there absolutly no real " main " character this game . those who confused , what i mean , well example , ff7 you 9 characters but leader character cloud ( one you see control fields majority game ) , well this game you 4 different characters your party you ability put any character leader . characters excellent this game , i pretty much like all them ( gau funny , but he doesn't best abilities one secret characters you can't even control them all during battle ) . sabin blitz ability . those you who playing fighting games years pretty good understanding this but sadly when you make move , no matter which direction your facing , you still hae put same command same direction . instance , one moves rlr ( i am talking right left right control pad ) if your character facing right , then you insert command , but if you facing opposite direction , it still same command ( not opposite combination ) . when i first beat game , before beating it , i got all characters level 99 . this game also some best music ff game ( time anyway ) . collection itself : you get music cd , random battle screen like ff7 8 random battle loading screen , ff6 bonus menu looking stats enemies , cgi cinemas , ff5 pretty much like super nes ( or should i say super famicom ) version just exception random battle loading screens psone style opening cinema no extra bonuses because game never released usa square probably wanted people experience it without huge bunch bonus features . overall : if you like snes ff games , this right collection you ( chronicles which includes ff4 ( ff2 usa snes ) chrono trigger	1
i came upon this game demo sony . i downloaded it onto my psp hooked within 5 minutes . i needed full game . don't let child-like voices images steer you clear this game if you older gamer . trust me , you some fun . only thing , i beat it little too fast . still very fun	1

there three things matter me when i sit down play game . ( 1 ) playability , ( 2 ) story , ( 3 ) graphics . this game excelled all three . ease directing my character choosing his moves so prominent felt so natural i just sort fell into my character role . few other rpg games , i didn't doubt second what i supposed move forward . story game deep riveting - but more importantly , sensible . this not just action game annoying , throw-away characters subplots go nowhere . you actually care characters involved you take keen interest what their future holds , even characters you only get see moment . ending especially well , it left me thinking where my character would go next , what he would , what path he would follow . even though i made his decisions throughout entire game , he still his own character - i simply shaped him bit . when i finally put controller down watched credits roll up screen , i heartbroken it over . but then i realized i could simply start all over again completely different character , end up completely different place . whole new experience . if you're anything like me , trust me when i say this game one kind . last , but certainly not least , graphics fantastic times breath-taking . graphics only work bring out story characters make universe game set all more believable . they never fail set tone whatever setting you find yourself . its predecessor , sith lords raised bar role-playing games . role-playing games , such final fantasy , while still enjoyable their own right , tend allow player almost no freedom all . sith lords allows astounding amount freedom . you literally go where you want , you what you want , however you want it . granted , it not grand theft auto , but then , gta not role-playing game . but while i am quick point out great aspects game , i most also point out bad . first major annoyance game continually froze i forced reset system start over . counter this problem , you'll forced save often different slots - game even warns you so . it not really big deal , but it get me little . second major annoyance my inability control all members my party proficiently - ai continally got me into trouble i could avoided . ( this one problems first knights old republic . ) other than , there nothing else worth mentioning . its predecessor , i hold this game highest esteem , eagerly look foward next ( if there one ) installment . enjoy game	1

this game , simply put , not good . i got bored tears playing it , then ended up giving it away because it robbing useful space my desk . it slow-paced , predictable , not suspenseful all . fact , these characteristics probably why it so mainstream , even though it laughable comparison real first-person shooters , which way don't even belong consoles . owning this game means you average player . any true fps gamer knows what childish , pathetic garbage this , while rest just go hype . many successfully deceived themselves into thinking it worth anything all . it isn't	-1
i really wanted like this game .. unfortunately me , it blows . i'd trade it migraine if i could . gameplay pretty horrible , sword scenes reminiscent pc adventure games circa 1992 , where you press " attack " key swing your sword aimlessly bad-guy . run gun part game nothing write home either . it feels like teleported into body cracked-out , 1 legged , drunken monkey . also , i know graphics aren't wii strong-point , but no excuse regress back 8-bit . when you're trying shoot someone across room , it really sucks when you can't tell them apart flower pot ..... or lawn chair ? cut scene obviously supposed look like sin city . i stress word supposed cause they probably strung together some poor intern after development team went into hiding . they look like amateur flash slide-show . kinda like what your local mom pop video editor would put together if your little nephew gotten his way sin city themed bar mitzvah . this game joke . anybody associated it should embarrassed .	-1

i really looking forward this game , i prepared overlook one or two things . every game it own personality , right ? i found instead this game actually doesn't much one all . i didn't mind graphics . not cutting edge sure , but not bad either . little muddy but change cartoony . it hard enjoy closeup views , however , when so many buildings lost their roof zoom . no way toggle feature . camera angles frustrating it very difficult pick anything out mouse accurately . not there much time look scenery . immigrants came . came . came . whether there houses jobs available or not . long city happiness high enough , which meant everyone happy . which they not . because they no houses or jobs . keep city happiness up only way ensure somewhat stable economy . forget planning . forget balancing resources workshops markets . it wasn't clear what balance any case . it would take trial error , you didn't time . you building worshops like mad , trying guess how many citizens would employed each , researching temporary bumps keep your city deserted droves . best income boosts not through sale goods or trade . it through research , maximising tax base development currency so . you hit those early , reached certain population level , you made money . rest time you spent trying keep people leaving . there no stability reaching any level . it quickly became game keep up . there no way control immigration or set pace development . all decorative options , more than similar games out , you really didn't care end what your city looked like , because it just cost time . money too , but really not relevant issue . unless people unhappy . then you could stick few things , quickly , somewhere . you just can't enjoy leisurely pace planning , building finishing it off nudge here there watching it run ... you constantly involved process , staying ahead curve . you don't worry maintenance , such city fires or engineers , but cities cannot not made self-sufficient or self-sustaining this inherent instability built into gameplay . five or ten minutes away screen bring most cities , if not all , screeching halt . while i enjoyed research options , ability move homes i thought great innovation , not ability control flow immigrants city pegging success city happiness makes this game poor economic simulation gameplay ultimately very shallow unsatisfying .	-1
i found only one game out many i tried codes this thing actually work . this action replay basically twenty dollar or more waste plastic cardboard it came . avoid like plague	-1
easy ... boring ... bugs , bugs , bugs , glitches , glitches , glitches ... question ??? this new game , or possible bonus maps cod2 they decided make into new game profit more money ???? hmmmm ??? positive ?? you cook your grenades now . i like mine medium rare ... possibly useful online matches , apposed cod2 where you couldn't it point less throw grenade online matches because you knew where it could just move . but i never know , because i " thankfully " rented damn thing , didn't buy it . wait , i didn't my dad , free rental blockbuster . so they didn't get any my hardly earned money . good me ... also could anyone tell me why i kept getting stuck walls , tanks , people , just everything . i think i stuck air ... if you like this game , you need get f**k out , buy something else play , i so i meet up you beat you ... also , if you don't like my run sentences you .... yep you guess it ... get f**k out .	-1

bought this platinum game much anticipation it doesn't work all . tried download . exe patch nothing top it off half original game forum sites crash too . no one any idea how fix this game all you look dozen patches out first game . if they spent time money build game test it right like blizzard companies like westwood then they would release finished game but decided use everyone gunea pigs test product so they could try patch it work . not buy anything this company or its affiliates i think they alkida implants trying take over western world . if you want play game style then wait until june get " titan quest " which should finally diablo 3 . too bad this company couldn't find capital complete game before release would think anyone wanting buy spellforce 2 should warned upfront make sure you wait 6 months after release buy additional hard drive so you download new patch fixes they probably try smoke screen you they count their money send it iran	-1

karaoke revolution party fantastic game great songs , great easy gameplay perfect party game features . if you've never tried karaoke game , now time play . first , basic setup . you get fully customize your character . we're talking black , white , male , female , heavy , skinny , athletic . then you go hair styles , hair colors , outfits down shoes jewelry . you evey use your eyetoy scan your face onto face character . it simply amazing . then we go onto song list . i own probably every karaoke game out 3 main systems . i love karaoke games . this song list far my favorite song list all time - it true my boyfriend well . there good mix jumping songs , slow romantic songs , rocking songs more . other karaoke games you go through unlocking venues songs . because this party game , they pretty much give you everything up front , few exceptions . you unlock few songs ton characters / outfits you go , keep things interesting . few standouts include elvis outfit cat outfit . addition able sing both single player duet modes , there bunch fun mini-games . you compete against other players , try play note-matching games even set up eye toy so you see your own background game . even better , if you dance pad , you sing dance same time ! this really great building up your vocal powers . many people sing fine if they stand still like stick , but when you sing band you're actually expected move around dance . using dance pad helps you build up your lung power timing so you get those skills . even if you're not band , you see challenges your favorite singers face . this game ton fun both friends party mode , or just singing yourself songs . where some previous versions karaoke sometimes " questionable " versions songs , them obviously different original , these songs great sounding many times i didn't look song bar all sing them . highly , highly recommended !! rating : 5/5note : previous reviewer says this aretha franklin version natural woman . i'm rather sure it carole king version	1
phoenix wright : ace attorney fun game . it simple . graphics ( 4 out 5 ): i would say graphics par most ds games . they could better , but they don't retract all gameplay . they fun same style games like sprung under knife . audio ( 2 out 5 ): audio where most ds games fall short . i am content graphic abilities ds , because quite simply graphics don't make good game . sure they help , but gameplay entertainment truly lies . it knowing this kept nintendo top handheld market . i just wish ds little more power behind it audio sake . i would like speaking characters throughout entire game , especially game like this . music so repetetive , it got so annoying i found myself just turning sound completely off . i guess they best they what they work , but this case , it just not good enough . gameplay ( 5 out 5 ): far gameplay goes , you couldn't ask much better experience . you put role pheonix wright who his first trial defending his best friend who accused murdering his girlfriend . eventually you go work other cases way you required gather evidence use court suppport your defense . characters over top lot fun interact . this text based game i suppose you might fan genre really appreciate it . but it simple pick up play game held my attention beginning end . i really trouble putting it down . while game like sprung got little monotonous came down more memorization then common sense questioning . phoenix stays track area logic plays more part solution cases . i highly reccomend this game !	1
i've my 360 since day one , it worth every dollar . let me start saying there nothing , nothing compares xbox live 360 . microsoft knows online gaming , they know gamer . end month you able download high def movies rent , tv shows free . online community set up help guide you gamers like yourself , people your skill level . sony can't this , ninendo can't this . they try , but xbox doing this years now starting original xbox . so called problems ? all systems them first couple months release , it happenend gamecube , ps2 , we seeing ps3 . i also want mention poster who said not put 360 verticle , not clue . you put it verticle , or horizontal , it works just fine . it turns out , many systems crashing because people got scared rumours , bought nyko cooler . it turn now reported , back pictures , etc . it causing many 360 burn out , it nothing any 360 problems . i personally 360 , soon nintendo wii , i say overall scheme things ... games , online network , options , accessories , etc . you can't beat xbox 360 . not only , sony hype machine wants tell you it graphics better . reality , programmers , 3rd party developers saying they equal graphical power , but you force fed lies hype sony side . not mention much higher price tag . all bs sony , fanboys throw out there . 360 worthy buy ! you really can't go wrong 360 , buy premium , get best game out there ... gears war !	1
i'm 36 years old i played many football video games many different consoles over years i must say this game stands out above all rest ! there " zillion " college teams choose ! stadiums beautifully detailed ! players , coaches , referee models , their animations , superb ! when playing stadium natural grass surface your players get grass mud stains their uniforms ! friend mine my workplace this game longer than i says occasionally player helmet fly off after big hit ! i yet see it happen but i'm looking forward it ! crowds look sound truly alive ! fans celebrate hold up signs ! cheerleaders even teams ' mascot look fantastically detailed their celebrations exciting ! espn college gameday crew , brad nessler , lee corso , kirk herbstreit provide interesting funny game commentary some but not much repetitiveness ! it pretty cool when corso makes his winning pick gameday booth before game he wearing either his picks ' mascot head or teams football helmet he speaking ! overall gameplay great learning curve fairly easy especially if you're familiar madden series ! ncaa 2006 you adjust your game settings , etc . any way you like reset them default touch button!i'm not much into all different options many sports games such creating teams , players , playbooks , making coaching decisions such ( although you all this game ); i play solely visual atmospheric stimulation which this game particular provides ! my opinion ncaa football 2006 blows other football titles out water it total package ! football fans , get this game !!! you feel like you involved actual college football game complete all emotion pageantry ! you become addicted it you want play it over over again !	1
leave it me start into series its ' second , third , or fourth installments . this case , it fourth . course , there good explanation why . i set out looking final fantasy iii : dawn souls my gameboy advance(hey , if you're going collect series , it good thing start beginning ) my local videogame store but they only final fantasy iv advance so i decided get it instead . there isn't much i say hasn't already said other reviewers here final fantasy iv advance . story goes like this .. kingdom baron quest collect all elemental crystals . commander its air force , cecil , dismissed after questioning king motives . help others ; cecil sets out stop growing threat , meantime , uncovers far more dangerous one . it deep story alot twists turns deeply challenging game due active time battle system . i can't recommend this game enough . it one my all-time favorite final fantasy games . although they tweaked graphics , translation whatnot abit , they pretty much made game it originally . i think final fantasy fans well casual rpg gamers really enjoy this one .	1
microsoft created extraordinary machine . crisp graphics so far library games available impressive . only problem i microsoft produced defective product . first few months it played fine only aa couple moments where games would freeze . no biggie . then it died . no problem , sent it repairs under warranty . free charge . cool . got it back it played well me actually beating ghost recon no problems . i stopped playing while but when i tried playing again bam ! ring death . warranty over . $130-140 dollars fix . yay . i think i'm going throw it against wall buy new one . hopefully microsoft found all solutions defects .	1

there two major factions when it comes video games , if you weren't aware their existence i'll happy illucidate you . group 1 , far most numerous , console gamers . group number 2 , one which i subscribe , based pc games . i'll first admit pc gamer i tend view consoles suspicion my experiences they place looks , flash , hefty price tags above gameplay plot . console audience tends younger than pc group , these very aspects which appeal them . so it equal parts hesitation excitement i felt i put this game onto my hard drive . those not know , once upon time , back early days microsoft x-box , there this nifty game called " halo " , my how console gamers snapped it up . i saw commercials tv course , thought it looked pretty good , but felt it too bad it x-box title not one available my trusty ol ' pc . " halo " puts player squarely armored shoes master chief , one kind super-marine engineered bring big guns covenant , consortium deranged religious aliens bent destruction all humanity . no ship allowed go earth it location closely held secret which covenant wishes possess all costs . but earth losing war , precipitating creation new super soldier , spartan-ii . just before spartan used covenant home planet latter launches surprise attack facility destroys all but one ; you . gambit elude pursuit last ship left , pillar autumn , jumps into hyperspace ends up orbit around strange ringworld named halo , but immediately attacked their pursuers , who seem tracked down autumn no time . now , complaint number one i this game stems fact * everything * i just described not taken game itself . it comes game manual . plot this interesting should least included opening scenes . c'mon microsoft , you money , pony it up spruce up introduction . it good plotline , so don't waste it manual , which only kept desk drawer some juvenile next 10 years forgotten until next decade spring cleaning . plot ( first gripe ) now aside , let focus game itself . i refuse judge game it age , too many nowadays ... instance , i still play original half-life think plot gameplay more than make up aged graphics . game looked fine my pc i never experienced anything close screen lag . colors contours alien world ship hallways nicely rendered sound ambient noise above average . music itself nice choral sequences ( such featured menu screen ) downright cheap midi sounding music , which felt out sorts rest game . weapons selection small but surprisingly good , any given situation you'll likely access weapon/s needed surmount it . i particularly like plasma pistol it supercharged shots , well everlasting mainstay fps games , shotgun . ability drive vehicles included game , something separates halo most other fps , it lot fun . particular i loved driving scorpion tank , which demolishes everything it path . you also fly around enemy banshee light fighter , which made getting past couple levels much easier . game plot flows smoothly voice acting pretty good . now gripes . right off bat i say level design single biggest detraction this game . beautiful outdoor environments used this game , but not * nearly * enough . you'll spend most it traversing hallway after hallway , which connect rooms look * identical * one you just left . doing this 2-3 times enough , but when you spread out level runs outwards up 3 hours * same thing * , it gets reaaaally stale . case point , chapter/s which you spend time monitor traveling through library . this section game draining seemed without end . it wasn't fun , just stressful . level which player introduced flood felt much same , although it still lot fun . vehicles fun , but require mouse steer . this obviously remnant x-box , where players steer warthog control toggle-thing , but i found mostly it me skidding against walls occasionally flipping . ghost only vehicle i able use strafe keys assist steering . enemies themselves tend get little stale after while , during my first couple hours playing i wondered what i gotten myself into . grunts , little pointy-backed gnomish aliens , spend most their time running away speaking ewok-accented english . it very distracting considering nature other baddies they seemed little out place . lumbering hunter , who super armored , also incredibly stupid . first i trouble negotiating them , but soon learned employing certain attack patterns i could easily waste one under minute . other aliens tend use good combat tactics i found dealing them more difficult . plot itself , which i classify very good , bordering great , kept me interested . it ain't half-life , but it works well enough my curiousity piqued halo 2 , which i might go ahead buy near future . i'm sure halo released pc first , which what originally intended , it'd left recognizable mark fps shooter platform . so that . very good game one which i look forward continuing storyline master chief , killer extraordinaire !	-1

nfsu capture idea ' building racing cars ' but i think they could go little further into design your so-called ' pimp-mobile ' . only interior you get design trunk , i think they could least seats , or wheel . outside design a-ok . anything sideskirts multi-colored vinyels you make your car fierce . plot-line single player mode really dosen't go deep , your just some guy who wants get his title back . multi-player you race your own cars tracks you already won , but down-side whole graphics two player horrible . it game worth getting , but you might sell it later .	-1

one might suspect gta : san adreas classic anarchist fun insane driving , guns galore lawless protagonist , linear storyline . let honest though ; nobody buys gta just play mission part fact i hard time getting into missions . san andreas there even larger area gameplay few other cities explore once you advanced game ( unless you want cheat ) . clear aspect sets this game apart previous ones depth gameplay . haircuts tattoos available purchase . you various parts your character built up -- fat , hunger , muscle , driving skill , weapon skill etc . obviously when you get fat you need run around eat when hungry . others self explanatory . some new rather interesting vehicles ave added this game . hydra , which harrier type jet , stunt plane , attack helicopter , four wheeler , parachute , my favorite -- jetpack . other than game like each created before it gta 3 . graphics even fairly modern computer still leave much desired . whatever engine they use clearly same gta 3 . animation other hand very natural realistic . music radio stations lackluster , but i believe it possible use your own music instead . computer game san adreas ' controls very least awkward because sheer number actions . worst case scenario -- hydra -- however using keyboard fly plane downright nerveracking . if you want shoot something below you , sure compensate couple seconds , not because it moves fast but because you need time angle nose plane direction . i , myself use xbox controller which adapter use usb port computer . even it not much better you still need d-pad make decent turns . you tell this my biggest qualm game . overall grand theft auto : san andreas lot offer if you don't regular gaming console but compensated clumsy keyboard controls . i would rate it 7 out 10	1
if you enjoy series you love game ... simple . very entertaining . don't miss it	1
let me say yes , this game too violent kids but beyond , it totally awesome ! graphics better than those found san andreas i enjoy robbing stores greatly ! you also notice your health armor decline more rapidly this game than sa . ok , so it not three super detailed cities but it one nearly perfect city ... vice city perfect parody 1980s miami missions seem pretty reflective . storyline what you would expect but voice over acting exceptional videogame . two main characters , tommy lance , sound better than characters most major motion pictures . i started my adventures gta san andreas but fact , i am enjoying this game even more ! anyone who liked either gta iii or san andreas , pick this up way , avoid lib city stories , it just too dull after while	1
this game took my 9 year old son 2 days complete . it disappointment since i paid $30 it , but action adventure games make younger kids make wiser decisions . overall this game deserves a+ . not adult type game but fun kids .	1
i love this game because it beautiful little princesse boy tail who loves princesse i played this game over over still play it more . i don't think i ever get tired it . it so much fun .	1
i unlike lot other people not buy this game when it first came out . my initial thought what squar thinking . i thinking this could nothing more than childs game . it wasnt until i talked number other people , right before kh2 came out i finaly listen all those people spend $20 get game , ( price game then , ) low behold , time i finished watching just opening scene i hooked . i played game what seemed like hours , ( it really only very long weekend . ) but game became so addicting i immediatly went out bought second one day it came out . story line par final fantasy , final fantasy vii , my two favorit games world . i would recomend this game anyone even slightes bit imagination . if you even dare dream you instantly love this game i . it well worth price , my only regret i not buy it sooner	1
don't listen other reviewers . this game great . far beats out sim city 4(and i game ) . it challenging make everybody happy , but if game easy .. it wouldn't fun	1
i believe this best game genre . it gotten more play out me than master magic , heroes might magic , age wonders , warlords , disciples , civilization , alpha centauri , master orion , space empires , or stars . once other posters says they bad support , but that not my experience . i've found their continued support patches good or better than any afore mentioned titles -- not bad 2 man team . there amazing amount variety factions would-be-gods you play , best all it most part solidly based upon mythology -- far superior typically dd derivative fantasy . multiplayer fantastic . it complex game however , not everyone tastes . definitely check out demo first . beware though , it addictive stuff ! also check out fan made maps their website well , some which quite pretty . if you're stuck getting started , try excellent walkthrough bruce geryk , also linked their site	1

castlevania : dawn sorrow first 2d version castlevania , i played long time . well onest , first one since castlevania ii : belmonts quest , came out nes back 80 . i never got play super castlevania , or amazing psx versions(which i should , after playing this game , buying 2 previous gba games ) . this amazing change ot games me . original , it really hard beat , made you frustrated . ii fixed it little , made you search dracula body , then destroy it , but frustrating , you no real direction most weapons tended suck . this however , amazing game . it eases you into game , you lot hp your disposal , regain them(take 1980 games ) quite often , potions , or save point , or souls . souls great thing , am loving it previous game well . they range you not taking much damage , growing tail , shooting lightning or bombs , letting you throw doll , switch places it . i enjoyed this game , determined finish it . i don't currently 100% , but my first time through i got 98% which nice , because i played games through , you finish 48% you completed entire game . touch screen not used often game , but when it used it used well . you only need it destroy few blocks way , input magic seals whihc you need defeat bosses get through certain doors . it plays great , although you cheat not hit points perfect , long your quick(which good thing , most people not perfectionists , or if they , really slow ) . game difficult , but not overbearing like many series past . i loved this game , play it long time , even though i beaten it before . i try julius mode , which more traditional , difficult castlevania game using belmont(finally ) whip , no souls , no potions , it tough , but i enjoy it greatly . if you own ds , you need own this game	-1
xenosaga ii-jenseits von gut und boese came november europe first xenosaga , which released here !!! but we european players never played xenosaga i before , so namco released second xenosaga great " special box " . this box game itself movie-dvd nearly all xenosaga i movies . back topic , my opinion xenosaga ii pretty game cool movies battle system makes fun . music this game composed yuki kajiura movies shinji hosoe rest game . i think kajiuras music really good but shinji hosoe bad job , his elevator music ;o )the graphics okay but i couldn't see anything outstanding . end i must say , xenosaga ii good rpg , even if it not so wonderful than first xenosaga . that reason , why i imported xenosaga i your country ^_ ~ but last most pal-players happy , actually ( my dictionary doesn't give me right english translation " ueberhaupt " ;_; sorry ) xenosaga ii come europe yet !!!! so i look forward third last xenosaga hope , this episode like first !!!! many greets germany ..... viele gruee aus deutschland ^	-1
this probably one my least favorite ff games psone . there some good things some bad things this game . first bad : 1 . squaresoft ( now square enix , goddammit ! ) trying get old roots snes games . me anyway , it doesn't look entirely like those games . 2 . some characters worst ff games ' history ( quina , eiko , garnet . i am not sexist , it just their abilities suck their type combat terrible ) . other characters good , not great , but decent . 3 . i don't care too much character models ( deformation final fantasy 8 graphics mix ) . okay good parts game : 1 . cinemas !!! they look really good psone game , most games cinemas psone don't look great this era gaming even some during era . 2 . ending !! i am not saying anymore . 3 . battle system . it not quite ff8 not quite ff7 but it trance system thingy . after this game , i sadly am seeing series not good it once ( i like final fantasy crystal chronicals can't wait remake ff3 ds ) , final fantasy 10 isn't legendary , ff 11 , which i never never play ( because fees , reminds me too much like phantasy star online ( i like game though ) , not much single player expericence no storyline ) , ff 12 just because it ff11 battle engine , looks like ffcc ff10 mixed together , i just seem not care much newer ff games anymore . so i would recommend any ff game psone ( including psone ports snes games origins ) because they so great even if games don't best graphics world , it gameplay storylines count	1
i'm avid final fantasy ( ff ) fan . when i found out they making game devoted my favorite male character , vincent valentine , i stoked . after pre-ordering this game , waiting forever get it , i expecting usual action-packed fighting detailed storyline seen almost all ff games . sadly , though , i little disappointed . dirge cerberus first person shooter ( just you , armed enemies lotta guns ) based final fantasy vii character , vincent . gameplay pretty decent , multitude different enemies fast-paced gameplay ... times . graphics , however , biiiiiiig let down after initial fmv sequence . guns pretty basic far usage , but equiptment system confusing materia system just plain weird first . i'm not even going start item limits ... game isn't overly difficult or overly easy offers few different modes gameplay , easy-hard , unexperienced veteran players . voice acting pretty decent i personally thought voices matched most characters well . now , story . any ff fan should know how much let down these last few ff vii sequels ( movie games ) . they're not bad sense game development or outward beauty , but sense storyline . dirge cerberus takes story complete tangent . lucrecia vincent past given series cut-scenes chance encounters while new , completely out-of-the-blue characters come make difficult process finding out vincent dark history . though it casual flare any ff storyline , it more so resembles two ff movies its science fiction/wannabe horror elements . old characters brought back , new frustrations raised ( hinted ) love interests nothing ever seem go right planet once again . overall , this game isn't bad . it isn't great , but it isn't bad . avid ( very avid ) fans series should check this out if they wanna know what really happened ( though they should watch carefully things didn't match first game ) . if you're player new series , play ff vii first or you won't get full impact game . if you don't really care just checking this out heck it , don't buy it . your money better spent good first-person shooter like metal gear solid	-1
first glance average person might assume appeal grand theft auto graphic violence , swearing mature content but truth gta series revolutionary technological achievement remains one most impressive experiences you find gaming . first time i ever tried gta : liberty city i absolutely blown away size scope fully realized , living city . it same feeling i got first time i played mario 64 i recognized i witnessing major leap forward . now almost 10 years later rockstar treated us their latest effort , gta : san andreas . liberty city prototypical big east coast city while vice city combination vegas southern florida . san andreas takes gamers west coast shades san francisco , la points . always city gigantic fully realized way true crime series could only dream . fact i noticed billboard san andreas mocking true crime . gta always freedom ; freedom walk , drive or bicycle wherever you want , freedom walk up pop someone mouth if you want . sure it violent but consider it wish fulfillment those us inner anarchist who desires expression without messiness accountability . only other game even approached gta scale mafia but mafia saddled unforgiving law enforcement wouldn't even allow players run red lights . unfortunately , not everything sunshine palm trees san andreas . vehicles extremely difficult control . problem vehicle movement camera angle work independently which means when you make turn using keyboard you quickly swing camera around using mouse realign yourself . even after considerable practice i still found it very challenging awkward . shooting likewise rather challenging perform i just don't remember it this hard two previous games . other surprise how taxing game my pc . i played first two gta significantly weaker machine surprised i couldn't max out all settings san andreas . i pull drawing distance significantly keep frame rate up while using p4 3.0 ghz 1 gig memory ati radeon x600 graphics card . i knock one star off because awkward controls but gta one those games you could spend month never get board . just exploring city worth price admission .	-1

when i think entire series such final fantasy , this game always seems odd one out . ffviii not take medieval or archaic look others series . i hardly agree gamers who not see potential this game . ff8 takes lot unique elements more noticeable than other ff games . one elements very unusual storyline . my opinion , storyline rather impressive . though it overshadows blossoming love 2 main characters , there not lot predictability storyline . no hidden characters no actual villain remains same throughout game . element gameplay . characters able draw distribute elements little more refreshing use than materia junction systems previous ffs . graphics final fantasy 8 very exquisite . cutscenes enough illustrate game without drawing away gameplay . i especially enjoy soundtrack game . i mix all video game music my ipod often am confused which game it comes . ff8 distinguished composition makes it stand out other video games . lot gamers know , ff8 takes series direction other games not take . lack mini-games definitely issue . while triple triad fun addictive take , it hassle reload or restart game if you lose valuable cards . also , trading some these valuable cards items hassle too . i found myself desperate need invincibles use defense against final boss . guardian forces ( almost forgot them ) exciting acquire too . spending numerous time sidequests should not requirement beat game though . also , ff8 spends little interest developing secondary characters but i praise excellence overall dialogue writing . give ff8 shot favor yourself gamers who feel like it definite miss	-1
eye toy play 2 much better than first . while first limits what you could actually , this one very few . there much larger variety games , different activities . such running during baseball game , dodging searchlights while collecting items , chopping pickles smashing tomatoes , defeating three-headed hydra so much more . during multiplayer mode , you get take picture your face which then placed head robot monkey , which hilarious touch . also , during multi-player mode , when tie occurs , players get tie breaker form fun little mini game . downside this , if you want play minigames anytime , you force tie , which pain . downsides eye toy play 2 : some games more frustrating than challenging , instrutions booklet aren't very clear . like most eye toy games , you turn all lights nearby open curtains get decent enough lighting . even when camera set dim room . video messaging terrible . you don't get choose background like original eye toy , image small distorted . playroom difficult find , there limited ammount games , some which make no sense . like , when it asks you put brightly coloured image front camera . it just weird . overall , eye toy play 2 completely worth buy . it hours endless fun , games never seem get old	1

i won't say cooking mama best game i've played recent months . surely , there something more important than cooking - like , killing zombies x360 , example . however , it certainly most innovative , especially when you consider how much you limited dimensions nintendo ds touch screen . cooking mama , you're apprentice fine art cuisine management . your master , certain mama , put you through series saliva-inducing recipes , grill you through preparation each if it only thing you live . you choose practise before hand , but when you go into actual process making particular food , you'll find there no room error . wrong move , mama not hesitate show you her wrath . making food involves several steps . some short , while some may take forever . example , when preparing pan-fried fish , you'll go through coating fish slices , melting butter , actual pan-frying arranging plate . each process turn involves different ways doing things . coating fish slices , example , requires you drag your stylus left-right manner while touching fish . melting butter requires you rapidly drag butter circular motion when it hot plate . pan-frying involves " following command on-screen " mini-game requires you perform whatever mama tells you , so . impressive thing here , even though you're just stroking your stylus throughout game 70+ recipes , you're essentially doing different things . it bit like trauma centre last year , but instead seeing body parts , you're looking food . if you're more adventurous , you even combine recipes form new ones , which adds depth gameplay . game quirky this , it understandable it uses quirky graphics . presentation cooking mama light-hearted , makes hectic process cooking ( me , least ) much more enjoyable . music little weak , even though it some nice variety . but seriously , graphics audios not what you'd buy this game . i mean , who cares these things when you've fried octopus balls make ? its sheer audacity bringing kitchen onto ds , i'd recommend cooking mama every owner ds . don't expect see your ds few weeks , however , if you bought this game , missus house . now , if only my wife learn few tips out this	1
this first time i owned madden football game . i can't compare it other games , but this one rocks ! i love highlight stick hit stick . pros : good graphics , great commentary , very fun cons : if you challenge play , it never gets reversed . it only gets reversed if other team challenges . notice i only 1 con , so this game must get xbox !	1
this one awesome game ... play it online or against computer .. i suggest online more fun long run ... if you really wanna give yourself scare turn out lights turn up volume ... definetely scariest first person shooter out there	1
red dead revolver , far , one best western games i've ever played . game easy learning curve also . after hour or so play you all controls down , you'll hooked or otherwise very interested . it one best story-lines out any other games i know . basically , western tale revenge renegade southern general his colonel . you play red harlow whose father brutally murdered right front him colonel darien , again , general diego right hand man . i wouldn't say this game bad rating makes it . there no actual dismemberment , rating " blood gore " says , use curse words kept minimum . if you've seen any pg-13 rated movies , two could relate . it fun time killing game , if you're bored , great replay value people who don't plan finishing single player modes . there tons characters choose multiplayer mode , both good bad . multiplayer modes numerous also , including things like showdown dueling modes . downfalls this game short story mode overall simpleness it . there aren't many ways you get creative it . but , greatest thing it i believe : sheer hilariousness it ! me friend sat played it more than 4 hours night once , sat holding our sides , crying , because laughter . midget clowns character reactions funny . especially how it sometimes glitches up . once during boss fight very fat character , fat enemy got hung stairwell , because he too big go through it . overall very good game ! you should buy this , if you like this game , you may want purchase gun too . gun copied off red dead revolver most part though . both games very short stories too . if you like good western great replay value , then you certainy love red dead	-1

while shin megami tensei devil summoner : raidou kuzunoha vs soulless army isn't actually smt game , it member franchise . it actually part family spin-off games megaten series just using smt name establish connections different series franchise finally appearing america . while not too many people familiar games past , this one takes series new direction . devil summoner first game megaten franchise moved past traditional or tactical rpg style combat gone straight into action/rpg genre . this game you play young man who just attained title kuzunoha raidou 14th , successor long line devil summoners tasked protection capital city . his ability see control demons , raidou must solve mystery becomes increasingly more more twisted game progresses . story begins player earning raidou name ( essentially this tutorial ) assigned work detective agency capital . one day you get mysterious phonecall girl pleading help wants meet you late night . reluctantly raidou his partner detective agency head out meet her . they find out girl who contacted them odd request ; she asks them kill her . before anyone respond , she kidnapped mysterious men red so sets forth tale demons , evil , curses . essentially game progresses much way you would expect megaten game , you travel different locations via world maps explore different locations larger area maps . while wandering around areas searching clues information , there several random encounters ( franchise known high encounter rates ) allow you opportunities capture new demons aid . more later though . while exploring areas you able demon deployed follow you around ( keep mind normal people can't see it though ) . every demon type special skills used areas such flying reach far items , scouting find hidden items enemy info , even mind reading get some extra information people . these skills essential getting information you need , so it wise keep demon every type often possible . now battles . this where fans series either love game or hate it . gone pressed turn systems used nocturne digital devil saga . instead they replaced real time action battles . you directly control raidou use combinations sword strikes gun shots defeat your enemies . raidou can't use magic , so only way he deal elemental damage using special bullets . luckily him though , he able demon deployed him battle ( but only one ! ) . it typically act its own , but you capable assigning it specific orders or general strategies . using your monsters battle , they grow loyalty you . when their loyalty maxed out , they often give you bonuses then used fusions create new demons . essentailly system get little bit repetitive while it takes while get used , once you it becomes matter knowing what enemies weak which attacks . once you figure out though , it just matter keeping your levels high enough capturing fusing demons keep gaining strength . style capturing brand new well . gone negotiation system used nocturne original smt games . instead it replaced system forces you exploit enemy weaknesses . when you hit enemy element it weak too , it become stunned give you chance capture it repeatedly pressing circle until meter empties out . you must empty meter before creature revives or you not capture it . easiest way this wear down its health ahead time before attempting capture . one note though , you automatically fail capture if enemy higher level than raidou , moon full , or it boss battle . graphics music game little different what seen previous smt releases here north america . it still uses same form cel shading , but they little bit more defined detailed . nothing too major , but it enough really change visuals overall appearance other games . also , this game not dark gritty nocturne or dds . fact it several amusing scenes much brighter more vibrant overall . this greatly illustrated music which often much more lighthearted comprised lot horns brass instruments . not nearly dark brooding other two games . but since this game takes place 1920 japan not post-apocalyptic world this time , it fits quite well . overall , devil summoner new spin old franchise . while it display full action battles aren't well suited style game , atlus able it well enough it still remains fun keeps game enjoyable . lot people who found turn based systems nocturne dds overbearing cumbersome , this could nice way ease into world megaten franchise . while it not nearly epic previous games , it holds its own story alone enough keep fan franchise sated long enough finish game off regardless whether or not they like change style . definately not best game franchise , but nice refreshing change fun none less .	-1
first off i own both nba 2k6 nba live 2006 playing both since they come out . first i thought nba live 2006 better game until i played nba 2k6 more more realized it best simulation basketball game out there . addition shot stick this year game changes way you shoot well play game . game very enjoyable especially friends because some games get very intense . overall game probably best series because it made major improvement over espn 2k5 . pros-graphics best any basketball game ps2 date . -free throws more realistic you must fluid motion if you shooting free throw yourself . -vip very extensive detailed show your stats tendecies which very nice touch those pay attention detail such myself . cons-steals happen way too often . -very challenging get 15+ rebounds . -practice mode still relatively useless other than perfect your timing your shot .	1
yes this game easier fighting game , but that why i like it personally . most marvel fighting games , there so many controls remember activating many different types superpowers it got hard keep em straight . this game only 2 basic fight options all characters it much easier figure out what you doing . course , each character it little extras such flight storm wall climbing spidey , so each character remains unique . but you don't memorize 10 different actions wolverine then memorize 10 different controls venom . i like this game lot i really love they made fighting controls easier	1
only flaw i find this game multiplayer isn't very much fun . playing locally friend means you just shoot him lot while he learns controls . no enemy ais maps	-1

i believe this best game genre . it gotten more play out me than master magic , heroes might magic , age wonders , warlords , disciples , civilization , alpha centauri , master orion , space empires , or stars . once other posters says they bad support , but that not my experience . i've found their continued support patches good or better than any afore mentioned titles -- not bad 2 man team . there amazing amount variety factions would-be-gods you play , best all it most part solidly based upon mythology -- far superior typically dd derivative fantasy . multiplayer fantastic . it complex game however , not everyone tastes . definitely check out demo first . beware though , it addictive stuff ! also check out fan made maps their website well , some which quite pretty . if you're stuck getting started , try excellent walkthrough bruce geryk , also linked their site	1
way , jak 3 more direct sequel chapter two than it continuation storyline established part one . i realize this meant end journey , " coming age " story follows title character through his innocence , his adolescence , finally his ascent into adulthood . bearing mind , it only natural he'd want distance himself people places make him feel like adventuring child , rather than self-assured saver globes . " when i became man , i put away childish things , " after all . where inspiration behind storytelling jak ii unquestionably blade runner , main source direction this final chapter comes largely mel gibson road warrior . outlanders who rescue title-endorsed duo their exile drag them back their own makeshift shanty town textbook definition early ' 80s burly man . they adorn themselves hundreds pointy edges , enormous , hopelessly detailed weapons layer after layer questionably-hemmed leather . they puff out their chests every opportunity , speak like cluster throat cancer survivors . these new characters just overflowing personality , which makes minor cutscenes motivational speeches entertaining , but i couldn't shake feeling they just going through motions attempt mimic successful main cast second game . it like they trying match edge gritty , sullen warriors jak ii , but missing some intangible element kept them reaching full potential . twists turns their storylines somewhat transparent ( i'd figured out major twist damas story within hour meeting him ) , their importance central plot thrown into question fairly early , ( when you return city around three hour mark only occasionally return desert thereafter ) all their gusto , their emotional impact player doesn't hold candle inner-city gangs ran chapter two . " last " game series , ( daxter psp jak : combat racing since released , continuing saga , there rumors new game ps3 ) jak 3 atypical grand finale . lot things didn't happen i expected during " wrap up " cutscene very end , vice-versa ... i caught off guard more than few revelations , including wizard oz-styled reveal just before final boss . first time , i think series found its stride vein comedy it sought since day one . character interactions actually very funny places - i legitimately laughed out loud more than one occasion , which not something i'm known during game . outline place unexpected twists turns counteracting few more obvious revelations , jak 3 story would set stage one greatest final chapters video gaming history - if only it bit longer . jak 3 weighs dozen hours , which less than half length jak ii , results much less rewarding experience than you'd hope final episode . it also wasn't nearly difficult its immediate predecessor , which means less screaming shouting , but also less relief self-assuredness upon reaching final scene . after completing part two , i sense accomplishment , almost pride , finished such elaborate difficult game . i didn't get same sensation upon putting this one bed . one area which jak 3 doesn't disappoint " holy crap " department . it just spoils you these things - you'll control daxter he clings dear life onto speeding missle , ( live freaking missle ! ) you'll leap onto teensy platform while camera leers above you displays dizzying heights below , you'll take down creatures size whale ... just unimaginably cool stuff . it doesn't overload action quite way god war , but it pretty close , last full hour gameplay one those long moments transcends mere video gaming puts player right into middle summer blockbuster . i've long considered last stage original halo one , if not greatest level history gaming , i'd seriously consider closing moments jak 3 least par . so , yeah , very high praise indeed . both grand finale throughout entirety game , there lot variety gameplay . this not just your standard jump , shoot explore adventure game . you'll bump into odd blend flight stages , ddr-style coordination stages , racing levels railed first person shooter segments , addition exploring , jumping , punching , shooting all-around adventuring levels . , while this something i big problem when it shoved into mechanics grand theft auto : san andreas , it doesn't bother me so much here . main reason because jak series always some sort similar variety ingrained within it , but it also bit more admissible here because setup actually works . nothing feels like it needlessly crammed into proceedings , like dance stages or workout levels san andreas ... it all just works together , several parts whole . while basic gameplay model ( its dedication consistently bending genres ) remained mostly intact , there two notable variations functionality jak ii become abundantly clear within first couple hours . first foremost much , much heavier emphasis that placed driving stages , more so than precursor legacy jak ii combined . this third chapter , they're vital completion half game levels , including final boss fight . it almost point i'd call this " action / racing " title , because you'll find yourself spending much time behind wheel you foot . when it successful , vehicle-based gameplay blast , something that never really tried before - sort supercharged platformer wheels . few stages failed , however , wheels felt like gimmicky death trap . incredibly frustrating , like trying shove square peg through round opening . largely , vehicle stages roaring success , however . secondly , there revelation there " light jak " mirror beastial " dark jak " unveiled second game . where jak darker persona brought it variety new attacks offensive maneuvers , his light side focuses more exploratory aids defensive mechanisms . such , it not quite exciting play " light jak " first time it burst into " dark jak " mode near opening jak ii . it just not much fun grow wings casually flutter around room it fire purple lightning out your fingertips fry opposition . these light powers enable few new modes exploration die-hard fan , but generally fairly useless go unused until situation demands you employ them . fas far controls concerned , it pretty tight ship this point series . most infuriating glitches bugs first game ironed out second chapter , third game actually improves upon near-perfection attained second . few jump commands go unrecognized , i some problems touchy collision detection during faster races ( which meant i hit checkpoint dead center or risk doing it all over again ) but those minor gripes best . visually , this could pass jak ii identical twin . characters look almost exactly same previous chapter , all little quirks , cartoony exaggerations background puns gave first two games their identity here living color . it not best looking game i've ever played , i didn't notice much difference upon switching progressive scan , but it near top its genre all same . i'd imagine phrase " ain't broke , don't fix it " could applied jak 3 without hesitationthe voice acting one area that kept fairly high quality throughout series , legacy kept up here . where story falters , voice actors often revive it , vice versa ... it good collaboration . scenes routinely stolen daxter / or villains , who go above beyond their pursuit good reading matches circumstances , while jak kept fairly low-key stoic . it best , too , because few occasions where he decide go all macho tries spit out line like " let go kill us some metal heads , " it doesn't fit he comes across awkward unsure . upon completing second game , i likened it empire strikes back , it took fairly light-hearted series transformed it into more adult-oriented saga , incredible results . what it worth , star wars parallel carries over fairly accurately this third chapter - you'll get lots warm fuzzies end , it not quite weighty or substantial second chapter , but overall it still very entertaining experience cast characters you can't help but love . big action scenes really fabulously , there rarely dull moment , but this game suffers unbelievable quality game immediately preceded it	-1

castlevania series games involving vampires side scrolling combat . dawn sorrows , soma cruz teenager who soul dracula within him . year ago ( game before this one ) he fight off dark powers within him . he won thought his life would normal again . unfortunately , when this game opens , he immediately comes under attack vanquish new set foes . game pixel based side-scroller involves human figures fighting skeletons , werewolves , other monsters . look definitely old school / retro . if example you ran this side side against robots , title i reviewed recently , robots figures crisp detailed , while castlevania characters screens showed granularity . it style difference many people appreciate . you primarily move left right , slashing your sword , throwing bones , performing other styles attacks take out your enemies . there some platforming well , jumping up down ladders get new areas . this works well storyline , so it not like , say , mario where platforming all there game . example , there ' hunter ' who sworn kill dracula . soma knows hunter , understands hunter fight him if he loses control himself dracula . they enemies who truce , who both respect each other , but who know if circumstances change they lock comba t.t here some touch screen aspects game . you find ' seals ' which essence patterns lines . perform certain actions - example finish off boss - you create this seal . this involves drawing pattern perfectly . you're allowed practice , but when time comes , if you don't get seal just right , you could great trouble . it neat idea , but i wish it something little less " perfectionist " oriented . i know many people who just can't draw well or who hands shake bit . if they'd gone memorization game - or logic puzzle or something - it would more real skill / intelligence less " perfectly steady hands " . general i like fun action , i appreciate rpg storyline here . i got drawn into story rather quickly . i think next version i would like see graphics kicked up match ds capabilities , ' seal ' puzzle changed less perfectionist drawing , i'd also like some dialogue less cliche . i loved ' flow ' plot but winced several comments made characters . well recommended	-1

first glance average person might assume appeal grand theft auto graphic violence , swearing mature content but truth gta series revolutionary technological achievement remains one most impressive experiences you find gaming . first time i ever tried gta : liberty city i absolutely blown away size scope fully realized , living city . it same feeling i got first time i played mario 64 i recognized i witnessing major leap forward . now almost 10 years later rockstar treated us their latest effort , gta : san andreas . liberty city prototypical big east coast city while vice city combination vegas southern florida . san andreas takes gamers west coast shades san francisco , la points . always city gigantic fully realized way true crime series could only dream . fact i noticed billboard san andreas mocking true crime . gta always freedom ; freedom walk , drive or bicycle wherever you want , freedom walk up pop someone mouth if you want . sure it violent but consider it wish fulfillment those us inner anarchist who desires expression without messiness accountability . only other game even approached gta scale mafia but mafia saddled unforgiving law enforcement wouldn't even allow players run red lights . unfortunately , not everything sunshine palm trees san andreas . vehicles extremely difficult control . problem vehicle movement camera angle work independently which means when you make turn using keyboard you quickly swing camera around using mouse realign yourself . even after considerable practice i still found it very challenging awkward . shooting likewise rather challenging perform i just don't remember it this hard two previous games . other surprise how taxing game my pc . i played first two gta significantly weaker machine surprised i couldn't max out all settings san andreas . i pull drawing distance significantly keep frame rate up while using p4 3.0 ghz 1 gig memory ati radeon x600 graphics card . i knock one star off because awkward controls but gta one those games you could spend month never get board . just exploring city worth price admission .	-1
only faults i find this otherwise great game horribly long load times how long it takes get decent car race . game very addictive , especially when it comes tuning your hard-won new car . customization your car extremely detailed almost fun racing . computer cars give you real challenge certain types races , but you change difficulty level if you find it little too hard first . scenery gorgeous ! able drive anywhere you want really fun too . i actually prefer this game over ea newer release : most wanted . i would recommend this game , but patience needed your first few hours gameplay	1
graphics : 7/10 . well , we talking ps1 port . so don't expect much here . but new cgs nice , even old ps1 sprites actually pretty nicely animated . super/special moves ( pws ) rather nice , too . sound : 6/10 . dialoguing very annoying first . it very much apparent moment you start up game , when you go through prologue . once you get used it , it not bad . sound effects seem bit primitive too , but again , this rather old game . btw , fans quickly note , game uses same voice actors pokemon . :d gameplay : 7/10it interesting mix platforming , puzzles , turn based real time combat . personally , i not enjoy platforming part . genera never my favorite , psp diagonal insensitivity makes some jumps pain . combat rather fun original . but after mid game , your characters so over-leveled over-equipped , almost all battles except few boss battles become trivial . replay : 8/10there lot here . chances , your first game , you've missed out " " ending , true ending . standard " " ending pretty mundane . there quite few characters game , you probably not get explore all them until you replay game . personally , i'm story driven player , so once i know plot , i little interest replaying game , but i think many players don't mind going through story again- such players , replay value should fairly high . story : 9/10a most excellent story . many characters you come across rather poignant stories , you learn each them , small reflections your main character . plot weaved very nicely , although it somewhat slow beginning . my only negative that keeping this 10/10 , very last scene- it somewhat left me unfulfilled . but i hear that matter opinion	-1
nancy drew : last train blue moon canyon ( 13)-before i begin ... my review spilt up into sections in-depth look topic . if you hate reading medium/long reviews or just don't patience i would not continue reading , but if you want learn most product before you buy it you'll continue . -gameplay interfacethis point-and-click mystery , arrows hands simple easy use . they also made improvement arrows since last game . hands manipulate items or add them your inventory(toolbox ) . when playing game you also panel bottom screen including : inventory(depicted toolbox , which i think should backpack instead ) camera cell phone journal , help menu button ( other games coin purse when money used game ) . main menu pretty simple . however , loading saving game little clunky you can't delete saved games . it also prompts you your decision ; it makes saving/rewriting games take more than one click . this type game interface perfect , but i'll knock off star irritating save/load page . ****-plota fairly used plot this series , finding treasure . but her interactive made this treasure finding story little more interesting . jake hurly , miner owner custom-built train , falls love young french woman named camille way finding gold . camille later dies , jake possibly finds treasure but he nowhere found his now " haunted " train found out out nevada desert engineer dead . many years later , lori girard ( daddy little fame seeking , rich girl ) finds train puts it back into shape trip copper gorge , colorado . she invites infamous guests train find out what happened jake hurley where his mine using clues jake left train . pretty simple treasure story ( this series often uses story but different ways ) now turned into intriguing mystery , good work her interactive . game also some side mysteries like lori getting kidnapped someone throwing emergency brake(both happen publicity stunts ) . but you find who those things only minutes after each event happened . what i didn't like there not really culprit because there no crime committed . very end when crime attempted after you find out who culprit . jake hurley part plot fantastic but sub-plot(s ) weren't very exciting . ****-charactersi loved characters , but you couldn't really interact them much . lori girard one my favorite characters , i loved watching dumb blonde trying get publicity how she always kept forgetting nancy name . since lori hostess she probably main character . tino baldcucci great character well . he private investigator but all he really get such fame right place right time . he conceited lori , you'll probably interact him lot more than john grey . john grey first black male this series , he host ghost hunters , cable show verge cancellation ghosts . he pretty good character but not leading role unfortunately . then there charleena purcell romance novelist introduced nancy drew : secret shadow ranch ( 10 ) , who nice very smart . she process making her book that deadline , who you'll find out used one lori story ideas her latest book without permission . i like her better now then when she nd 10 , bad she no memory game . finally there frank joe hardy . these teenage brothers work american teens against crime ( atac ) who invited because their dad friends lori dad . boys nice enough invite nancy well . i personally liked this addition game because you get play frank short-order cook . they really don't much case , they just good source info . i am looking forward playing them more nancy drew : creature kapu cave ( 15 ) . i really didn't like how there not lot character interaction this game . but when you interact times it really fun . that something add nd 16 beyond . ****-setting graphicsi love train , feel so exciting . seeing scenery pass windows great . cars so detailed beautiful . i think my favorite place train projection car . later you stop copper gorge , little town colorado . there mysterious crypt museum/taffy shop cheesy but enjoyable . crypt small there wasn't much , but i mean real life all you crypts mourn . graphics great . very realistic . its amazing how much graphics this series keeps getting better better . this probably most unique setting series . i personally love trains , boats planes so this made me really happy . *****-puzzles/activitiesthe puzzles fairly easy . i liked how lot puzzles combined into one find where jake mine . what disappointing repetition puzzles . there four or five pipe sets you connect which got little annoying . you also retrieve lot items like gemstones , tools , duct tape , pen other stuff . i don't understand how they made finding gemstones easier than playing almost impossible game tino get simple pen . some puzzles unique , like camille doll sorting puzzle her favorite dance step , playing " camptown races " piano , using metal slugs mathematical way open doors scale . but some these activities needed no skill all like combinations , word search , two memory games . this game variety but also repeated some puzzles well which brought down its score . ***-endingonce you find out where jake mine your sent off there get head start " treasure " . you'd think after all puzzles you went through you would think finding treasure mine would somewhat harder than everything else . you open entrance , memorize couple things , follow some lizards then use info you memorized . not difficult if you smart . then you find " treasure " your so called " culprit " . you wouldn't know this person culprit when he/she finds you mine talks you , but then he/she loses trust you you get caved . then you get out(i thought this fun , felt like roller coaster ) stop " culprit " . i liked ending what treasure but getting through out mine relatively easy . although culprit kind obvious , i liked what culprit plan or goal . overall it good ending yet little easier than i thought it should . ****-overallthis one better nancy drew games out there . definitely one add your shelf . flaws this game don't affect game much they could if setting different . plot pretty good most puzzles fit into it . i enjoyed this game lot after i played it more than two times . i think any game needs played more than two times get full experience . some parts game really exciting compared other parts . repetition some puzzles isn't too bad . this game outstanding but there never going best nancy drew game . it really depends your opinion . add all these up divide 6 ... 4 *' ( gameplay interface)4 *' ( plot)4 *' ( characters)5 *' ( setting graphics)3 *' ( puzzles)4 *' ( ending) = 24 stars divide 6 ( categories ) = 4 starsthanks reading	-1

im quite sure your mom probally her eye ds , especially release ds lite games like brain age your mother would want . but i am also sure your mom may not like white color , well that good , becausse coral pink ds make it more fashionable girls , well maybe even attract few guys well ( no , i am not gay , steorotypical or homophobic ) . i say people who first bashed ds , this what you get talking crap . it might astonishing sony getting their butts kicked , after all , ps2 destroyed gamecube terms sales ( same thing ps n64 ) , but some people just don't get psp . that fine , but i like my psp better , basically because my favorite genre racing . ds dosen't lumines or gta . or locoroco , so so . but then again , ds mario , magnetica , whatever . it all depends what you like best most , but since i am no fanboy or like videogames all far reaches galaxy , i enjoy each every system . now system . you know you not want bored tedious details how everythng better all other stuff you basically don't need , but this system ideal even people who original ds . if you like ds , this system update actuallly worth it . stylus way bigger , it certainly looks better , it easier play , better design , better system general . sure , you could say you don't need it , but that fine . although some people ( especially nintedno fans ) , they just can't live without it would definitly take it . myself included , i got one very soon , also , i give props nintendo making sure enough there go around everybody . i white one , but it still same great system , although you would probally choose which color you want . short , don't feel guilty if you shell out 100 bucks , it really worth it . if you don't it , it worth it , you get all kinds cool stuff this fall , includes web browser . so far though , europe gett ing it before us	1

this great controller . especially after all complaints microsoft got its original controller too bulky(personally speaking i never really problems even ) . but since i got xbox controller , i havent touched big one . this controller gives better grip , buttons softer their positioning better(the overall feel quite good ) . i played rallisport challenge this controller beat whole game . even game like rallisport where precision required accelaration braking successsfully master tracks , i it without any problems using this controller . also vibration feel very good . so if you looking buy xbox controller not able decide which , just go this smaller one , controller without any hesitation . quality hardware	1
