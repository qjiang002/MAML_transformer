one might imagine whole concept vacuuming-flip-mopping progressive some way , but it really not make job cleaning floor easier . especially when product heavy hard maneuver poor pickup . i'd much rather go over floor good vacuum , then follow functional , well-designed good mop ( like old steammop they discontinued ) . these things function better seperate units , which why there no washing machine that also dryer . flip-it very loud machine -- so loud , i didn't hear my phone ring same room . this makes it difficult listen my 3 children , too . it difficult push feels like it gripping floor . it doesn't fit into any tight places or under any low chairs/cabinets it big fat part-vacuum head . , when you're finished , it pain clean out nozzle filter(which you're supposed keep dry somehow ) so you look forward second job once you've finished job cleaning your floors . , because " flip it " back forth design , thing no equilibrium ... it fell floor least 3 times , even when i so careful rest it against something ... once when this happened , " dirty water " recovery tank hit floor , fell off machine spilled dirty water all over my just-cleaned floor . true nightmare . i bought this product because i could no longer buy replacement filters/pads my bissell steammop , i thought i better give latest greatest try , but , sadly , i disappointed . i don't review things often , but i felt responsibility warn others out there who shopping good mop keep their homes clean . this contraption not your answer . side note , i wrote bissell bring back steammop ( what excellent product ) , so i'm hoping they one day	-1

why oh why i buy this useless thing ? i perfectly good cuisipro mesh 13-inch screen , which what it supposed , namely reduce spray grease spewing onto burners , walls , floor . it perfect ? no . but it definitely most job , which what i can't say tovolo . it three fatal flaws . first , working end detachable metal handle proportionally too small securely safely leverage screen off . i use one hand steady metal edge lid -- hot hot hot -- i tried wedge handle under screen lip my other hand . second , count number air holes silicone screen . then , count holes metal mesh cuisipro , or its ilk . purpose screen catch grease , this important part , allow steam escape , otherwise water vapor condenses back onto food . i first tried using tovolo saute ground beef . beef began stew water dripping surface screen . third , too much grease escapes around edge screen because metal rim bows heat . all fairness , mesh type bows also , but not much , possibly because edge thin more pliable . this product , imo , just one more silicone kitchen gadget not work well metal version . save your money buy old fashioned kind .	-1

unique looking soft polypropylene body contrasting chrome ; distinctive attractive item sits plain view kitchen all time . normal bread before lowering , bread sticks almost 1/2 way out toaster , making it very easy remove hot toast , toast smaller items ( plunger go up even further assist ); slots extra wide so , although i not used sandwich cage accessory , i see how there enough room make sandwich toast it cage ( apparently british idea , maybe something worth investigating ) . i am doing normal toast only setting 2 , bagels 3 separate bagel feature they come out perfect !

le creuset manufactures porcelain enameled cast iron cooking vessels well other quality products . enameled cookware cast molten iron formed sand moulds which used only once . this reason , one pan may look like , but each unique its own way . cast iron highly efficient material which absorbs distributes heat efficiently . this reason , it recommended use low medium heat . there few exceptions like boiling water where cooking high heat appropriate okay . otherwise , cooking high heat may cause food stick , discolor enamel coating , or cook food unevenly . remove cast iron heat it not cool off quickly . this helps your food stay warm while serving . beware ; iron tends heavy so these cooking vessels tend heavy well . cast iron effective material cooking so why cover it enamel ? iron tends rust ; iron oxide ( rust ) doesn't add any complimentary flavors your food . if your cast iron cooking vessel not enameled , you would season maintain it . adding porcelain enamel not only looks good , but multiple benefits . enamel , solid coating , one most hygienic surfaces cook , not stain , absorb odors , retain flavors , easy clean . enamel damaged , so limit cooking tools plastic or wood . benefits cooking le creuset cast iron many , but lets get down roasting pan specifically . this pan holds 5 1/4 quarts food , measures 9 3/4 14 3 inches internally , weighs 10.2 pounds . 5 1/4 quarts typically feed 8 - 10 people when it comes casseroles , so consider your recipes when determining size you need . except roasts , roasting pan tends best if least 3/4 full . any less you may overwhelm your food heat evenly dispersed pot . i find cast iron adds crispy texture food may desirable dish like mac-n-cheese , while not so desirable other dishes . add le creuset 9 11 1/2 inch roasting rack roasting chickens pork loins keeping them out grease . some other possibilities this pan include casseroles , pork chops covered cornbread dressing , dinner rolls , baked squash , lasagna , scalloped potatoes , cobblers , pineapple upside down cake , or bread pudding . possibilities almost seem endless your imagination . one feature people tend complain cost . cost seem steep compared other pans made other materials . heck , cast iron doesn't seem like it should expensive when comparing old cast iron pan past generations used cornbread camping . however manufacturing process requires making mould each every pan produced . they then go through enameling process before shipping these heavy pans . if you take what goes into making distributing these high quality cast iron products , cost tends make sense . then consider this pan easily last lifetime when taken care . pros : extremely versatile efficient absorption distribution heat hygienic enamel cooking surface not stain , absorb odors , or retain flavors easy clean when not abused or misused transferred stove top oven table easily last lifetime cons : its heavy , cast iron tends weighing 10.2 pounds	1
many you reading these reviews may wondering how this compares similar items made cast iron . i tell you , while it obviously isn't cast iron reason alone many say it inferior , it still excellent griddle . bottom very heavy it conducts heat well . it fits perfectly over 2 burners one side my gas stove . i've cooked several sandwiches once it well pancakes some eggs , heat seems distribute very evenly . i very impressed this aspect griddle , cast iron known its even heating i wondering how aluminum griddle would hold up ; it definitely fine job . bonus , course , nonstick surface , it good one , not some chintzy teflon coating . good quality construction . handles solid it doesn't feel cheap all when you hold it . take care this griddle ( make sure it doesn't get scratched ) it take care you	1

if you pets constantly dragging out your heavy vacuum cleaner , then you love this one . i bought this vacuum supplement my large ( heavy ) canister vacuum pleasantly surprised its ability pick up pet hair . because small bagless chamber , you empty it frequently , so i wouldn't count this vacuum my only vacuum cleaner . i wanted lightweight vacuum use my hardwood floors area rugs , specifically pick up pet hair , this vacuum exceeded my expectations . i tried shark , similar model made fantom , cordless vacuum not one them worked anywhere near well this one ( stay away fantom cordless - far worst !! ) . i don't think any cordless vacuum enough power pick up pet hair like this one . overall , this vacuum great little vacuum quick clean-ups or maintain pet-hair free area rugs . one suggestion - use carpet setting even bare floors . brushes high enough so they won't scratch bare floors , but cleaning capability much less without rolling brush . i found it just rolled over dog hair without picking it up unless i used carpet setting . only reason i not give it 5 stars because small holding chamber which requires frequent emptying .	-1

this lovely little crockpot whose small size makes it uniquely useful number purposes . i've owned larger crockpots couple decades ( currently 6 quart rival smartcooker my mainstay preparing family-size meals ) , but larger pots take up significant amount counter space aren't all useful heating or re-heating small quantities . this little crockpot , however , perfect heating or re-heating 2-4 servings soup or stew . i originally bought it , however , because it * absolutely perfect * making hot cereal cold mornings , especially those hot cereals require more than few minutes cooking microwave or stovetop , such steel-cut oatmeal ( try nutty goodness traditional steel-cut oatmeal once ( also available here amazon ) you're unlikely ever return instant or " quick cook " oatmeal again ) . there nothing nicer cold winter morning than walking into kitchen knowing healthy , delicious hot breakfast awaiting you . mid-october late-march , virtually every night i prepare my entire family hot breakfast cereal next morning this little crockpot , no more effort than required make single serving instant oatmeal or cream wheat microwave . other uses we've discovered : it perfect making serving hot mulled cider ; keeping hot dips , gravies warm sauces syrups heated buffet ; substitute fondue pot ; heating soup times when hovering over stovetop or near microwave would incovenient ( how nice come inside raking leaves or shoveling snow hot bowl soup ! ) . single people or couples who prefer not cook large quantities or apartment dwellers limited storage space , this crockpot would very acceptable slow cooker , especially if used conjunction rival inexpensive sp100-pdq smart-part module ( also sold amazon date this review ) , which provides same timed-cooking controls integrated many rival larger , more expensive crockpots . energy used minimal , too -- only 80 watts -- stoneware bowl fits easily dishwasher , lid , very convenient clean-up	1

i'm proud celiac chick finland , but i'm also lover homemade donuts . now , those you who don't know what celiacs , we can't eat any wheat or gluten . plain-speak ( no , i'm not implying you're stupid ) , we can't eat flour . it runs lines allergy , although experts gladly look down their noses tell you it not . so how heck i eat donuts when they're made completely flour ? answer my cooking angel , bette hagman , who wrote up donut recipe one her books , more gluten free gourmet . anyway , i use recipe . however , i don't use this donut mold like i'm supposed . no , i don't baked donuts-what donut if you don't indulgent full-fat thing ? i put batter into three molds time , tip it into oil , i deep fat fry those little suckers . god , they good ! so , my ultimate point here this donut mold extremely useful , more ways than one . so grab one -- especially if you're celiac -- put your imagination cooking skills work	1

le creuset manufactures porcelain enameled cast iron cooking vessels well other quality products . these cooking vessels cast molten iron poured sand moulds which used only once . this reason , one pan may look like , but each unique its own way . cast iron highly efficient material which absorbs distributes heat . due this efficiency , it recommended cooking cast iron low medium heat . remove cast iron heat it not cool off quickly . this helps your food stay warm while serving . beware ; iron tends heavy so these cooking vessels tend heavier than other pans made alternate materials . cast iron effective material cooking so why cover it enamel ? iron tends rust ; iron oxide ( rust ) doesn't add any complimentary flavors your food . if your cast iron cooking vessel not enameled , you would season maintain its cooking surface . adding porcelain enamel not only looks good , but multiple benefits . enamel , solid coating , one most hygienic surfaces cook , not stain , absorb odors , retain flavors , easy clean . enamel damaged , so limit contact wood or plastic utensils eliminate scratching scoring porcelain . benefits cooking le creuset cast iron many , but lets get down roasting pan specifically . this pan holds 2 1/2 quarts food , measures 7 3/4 11 1/2 inches internally , weighs 6 1/2 pounds . 2 1/2 quarts not lot space when it comes casseroles , so consider your recipes when determining size you need . this may pan families 2-4 . except roasts , roasting pan tends best if least 3/4 full . any less you may overwhelm your food heat evenly dispersed pot . i find cast iron adds crispy texture food may desirable dish like mac-n-cheese , while not so desirable other dishes . add le creuset 7 1/2 9 inch roasting rack roasting chickens pork loins keeping them out grease . some other possibilities this pan include casseroles , pork chops covered cornbread dressing , dinner rolls , baked squash , scalloped potatoes , cobblers , pineapple upside down cake , or bread pudding . possibilities almost seem endless your imagination . one feature people tend complain cost . cost seem steep compared other pans made other materials . heck , cast iron doesn't seem like it should expensive when comparing old cast iron pan past generations used cornbread camping . however manufacturing process requires making mould each every pan produced . they then go through enameling process before shipping these heavy pans . if you take what goes into making distributing these high quality cast iron products , cost tends make sense . then consider this pan easily last lifetime when taken care . pros : extremely versatile efficient absorption distribution heat hygienic enamel cooking surface not stain , absorb odors , or retain flavors easy clean when not abused or misused transferred stove top oven table easily last lifetime cons : its heavy , cast iron tends weighing 6 1/2 pounds	1

i've gone through number grinders over years am hoping this kitchenaid last longer than others . grind consistent quite adjustable . even glass container , there still static causing cling sides dispersal grinds counter . small price pay fresh ground coffee . because it slower , it quieter . flavor brew better because beans weren't heated when ground . read instruction manual happy results first time . commenter says kitchenaid replace hopper or receptacle later design works better . i'm thinking following up ... beans didn't feed through , but only one time . so i upended it shook beans back down all fine again	1

i waited years buy calphalon cookware because i under false impression its quality . i old set . . waterless cookware made ecko ; ecko set outperformed calphalon every measurement . my thought buying new set ecko cheap , calphalon quality . every thing sticks this set , pork chops even stuck so called non-stick surface pan ; no chops not right fridge , would cause them stick . some pans without non-stick coating dimples metal . box states they dishwasher safe ; however instructions state differently . electric stove one pans developed burn marks bottom pan over medium high heat . list goes , if you contact customer service you get canned answers send cookware them your cost ; they not read mine . oh they tell me i could keep lids , no wonder they not fit ; you move them 1/8 " back forth . not buy !	-1

after conducting research few weeks , visiting amazon , well other coffee aficionado sites , i finally purchased saeco aroma espresso maker using it going two weeks . although this machine may not glitzy appearance compared some machines , it make great espresso . say instance , if francis francis sexy ferrari espresso machines , then aroma would volvo -- boxy ( perhaps considered bland appearance some ) but solid , reliable , well-built machine price . once i got hang using pressurized portafilter , which put tightly obtain correct seal/pressure , i treated rich , flavorful espresso lots crema . i am pleased ease using machine , however , instructions not very detailed i found technical support slow . initially i placed phone call -- where i not reach live person -- but left message . never received call back , but called again next day which time i get live person . honest , she seemed ambivalent downright unhelpful , blaming my problem coffee i using ( despite my best efforts explain problem ) . issue after priming machine installing portafilter , pump would run run , but no espresso would come out . i ended up tightening three little screws bottom portafilter , which seemed help make it fit more snugly achieve pressurized seal . voila ! perfect espresso . if i one complaint this machine , it would portafilter not very substantial , made mostly plastic . aroma steam wand works really well frothing milk . almost too well , i ended up lot foam , but second time using it , i backed off pressure bit , got just right balance milk foam . overall i am pleased performance this machine . it hard find decent machine under $300 . but i would consider this machine mid-level machine entry-level price , especially 15 bars pressure . ( i started out thinking i would buy starbucks barista machine which almost $400 , but after seeing live demo starbucks store , realized it not perform well only 8-12 bars pressure . very little crema ) . good espresso machine should offer minimum 14 bars . two side notes : i urge anyone who purchases espresso machine consider conical burr grinder ( i bought capresso 560.01 infinity burr grinder amazon ) . it crucial fine grind brewing espresso . you'll know when you just right grind because after brewing portafilter basket contain compacted " cake " espresso , rather than soupy mixture water grinds . i not purchase my saeco amazon , but opted instead get it costco website where it $249 ( members or add 5% - or $12.45 - nonmembers ) , including shipping handling . plus it could returned any costco warehouse within 30 days , no questions asked , if not satisfied .	-1

these pillows 6 months , finally drained them threw them out . you don't realize once you fill them water how heavy they ! once they place bed you can't move them ! try lifting them when you change sheets !!! but , you probably bought them due bad back , neck or shoulders now you lift these weights make bed ! what i thinking ? i lucky i didn't wind up traction lifting these things . my husband refused use it after few weeks , said he couldn't get comfortable unable move it easily ( they weigh ton ! ) i hung there longer but wound up using regular pillow top it just able adjust it without get crane lift it . we honestly didn't feel any better sleeping it deal weight them not worth any benefits we might derived . no one mentions this issue their reviews , i wonder if they all maid service	-1

you really can't drink coffee mugs which come this coffeemaker , unless lids off mug ... definite design defect which defeats purpose travel mug . it very simple oversight : there no quot ; ventquot ; hole mug lid , so coffee barely dribbles out sipping hole , even when mug full , even if you tilt mug high if you drinking last drops bottom mug . it very frustrating experience . please also consider two cups may not fill up evenly coffee brews ; one may slightly overflow while other mug not full . then there instruction book . english fine , but it really make sense instruct user heat up mugs first hot water , then instruct user measure cold water into same mug fill reservoir ? course , user figure his way around , but only way use these mugs would drill extra pinhole each mug lid venting , or just use mug around house , without lid . mug comfortable hold , but thermal value not too good , even when preheated boiling water . i regret made this purchase	-1
greetings , i love this stove top espresso maker but there some differences you may find value . 1)- boiler where you put water only filled 25% compared most 70% which means rather large unit relation amount espresso you make . 2)- maintenance more than others because this machine uses more pressure there more seals replace when necessary . these not readily available locally you probably them shipped you extra expense may exceed your sense reasonableness . also .. most these types machines come extra seals . this unit doesn't come any extra seals all . 3)- picture looking through window top machine seeing nice crema farce . only way see nice crema if you carefully follow directions lift lid up wipe condensation off inside always present blocks your view . 4)- realize this unit made aluminum some concerned toxic effects if any gets into your java high acidity content . plusus include - 1)- very nice tasty espresso superior other stove top machines . ( no aluminum taste)2)- really nice crema but only if yor coffee fine grind #1 , or #2 coffee needs freshly ground . if you buy pre-ground coffee packages market you not seeing any crema . i buy fresh coffee ground half pound #1 , or #2 fine grind get really good results . i hope this helpful you . cheers	-1

le creuset manufactures porcelain enameled cast iron cooking vessels well other products . le creuset casts these cooking vessels molten iron poured sand moulds used only once . this reason , one pot may look like , but each unique its own way . cast iron highly efficient material which absorbs distributes heat efficiently . it recommended cooking cast iron low medium heat . however , there exceptions like boiling water where cooking high heat appropriate okay . remove cast iron heat it not cool off quickly . this heat retention helps your food stay warm while serving . beware ; iron tends heavy so these cooking vessels . cast iron effective material cooking so why cover it enamel ? iron tends rust ; iron oxide ( rust ) doesn't add any complimentary flavors your food . if your cast iron cooking vessel not enameled , you would season maintain your cooking vessel . adding porcelain enamel not only looks good , but multiple benefits . enamel , solid coating , one most hygienic surfaces cook , not stain , absorb odors , retain flavors , easy clean . enamel damaged , so limit cooking tools plastic or wood . benefits cooking le creuset cast iron many , but lets get down buffet casserole specifically . buffet casseroles one most versatile pieces le creuset lineup . use this pan saut� pan , roasting pan , poaching , or shallow braiser . 3.5 quart capacity plenty space when it comes casseroles , so consider your recipes when determining size you need . buffet casserole tends best if least three quarters full . any less you may overwhelm your food evenly dispersed heat pot . large flat bottom curves up this pan resembles curved sided saute pan only thing missing would long handle . tight fitting lid mostly flat curved sides . this lid seals heat , moisture , flavors used hold your meat while you making sauce drippings . its shape design makes this extremely versatile pan . i tend use this pot basic dishes like smothered pork chops more than anything else . but once you get past basic functionality lends itself recipes such paella , frittatas , deep dish pizza , casseroles , you really open up possibilities . keep mind this 3.5 quart pan , feeding two out if it ridiculous unless you want leftovers . it probably perfect size family four most cases . try baking pineapple upside down cake or bread pudding when you need please many guests , poaching fish , or mac cheese . possibilities almost seem endless . one feature people tend complain cost . cost seem steep compared other pans made other materials . heck , cast iron doesn't seem like it should expensive when comparing old cast iron pan past generations used cornbread camping . however manufacturing process requires making mould each every pan produced . they then go through enameling process before shipping these heavy pans . if you take what goes into making distributing these high quality cast iron products , cost tends make sense . then consider this pan easily last lifetime when taken care . pros : extremely versatile efficient absorption distribution heat hygienic enamel cooking surface not stain , absorb odors , or retain flavors easy clean when not abused or misused transferred stove top oven table easily last lifetime cons : its heavy , cast iron tends weighing 12.25 pounds	1

bought this toaster after attempting find decent one local . most everything local big boxes basically junk . thought i would try this toaster based my previous good experience krups brand , not disappointed . toasted everything white pumpernickel , pop tarts , bagels , etc ... heat settings bagel/frozen buttons real good job . handle which also raises toast , something i thought just unecessary extra , actually very handy keeps your fingertips out fire . built well , nice job , recomended	1

i'm one those folks who only sleep " white noise " background . i used use big lasko box fans , but cheap plastic blades those would eventually weaken flap around , making roaring sound . plus poorly designed made screws held grills place would eventually weaken cause grill bang against metal box , making tapping sound all night long would wake dead . i little nervous getting this fan i'd only used huge box fans , this one seemed too efficient quiet make real difference air making " white noise " fall asleep . i actually purchased it bed bath beyond ( not amazon ) $100 , so i'm not sure if there lower price out there somewhere . anyway , i wanted try it home see what i thought , thinking if i didn't like it i could return i t.t he fan incredibly easy put together , you make it two different heights ... short near-the-floor height , or " my bedroom so hot i need fan blowing right me i lay bed " height . low , you barely hear fan , however it moves much air big box fan high . when vornado high , it makes pleasing white-noise sound , really moves air around whole room . it easy adjust point it where you want air go . i point it upper corner my room so air bouces off travels everywhere else ... it really works ! grill extremely easy remove ( no screws all ... just four secure clips ) , fan blade slides right off shaft ( no screw there , either ) . this make it simple clean just under faucet sink or bathtub when it inevitably gets dusty dirty . if you looking whole room circulator or white-noise sleep aid , i couldn't recomment any fan higher ! good quality construction well-engineered thought went into every aspect this product . you won't go wrong	1

i am editing this review clarity . no , i am not talking carbon . this one best brita filter systems i've used . i also use large water cooler model offers hot cold dispensing , i've used several pitcher sizes over years . this large dispenser fits almost anywhere holds far more water than pitcher sizes . valve works perfectly closes securely . so , if capacity more important than portability , this great dispenser . because valve , kids use this much easier than they might full , large pitcher . my only problem it mould-like stuff grows mine . no , that not carbon all us brita users used ignoring . it fuzzy stuff grows clumps sticks plastic very hard remove . maybe that because large upper reservoir remains damp closed longer than smaller pitcher system would because it upstairs where my air conditioning doesn't reach . it hot up there most year . because relatively small , but convenient , filler opening , it not easy see into reservoir through it . so , it easier just keep filling without looking into it until filler time . i going discard this , but after realizing nobody household got sick , i decided keep it . i'm leaving one-star rating place because i can't edit it , because i'm tired household members who complain growths . hey , that what faucet . what they think grows there ?	-1

these bit expensive , but turned out fantastic - compact , sturdy not too much eye sore . they hold quite bit so you're not refill them too often keeps food fresh . lids little tricky close . because they angle , they tend not line up w/the grids well , but i don't consider necessarily manufacturing flaw ; perhaps design flaw , but angle makes getting food out easier . i'd buy them again	1

my review male perspective , two weeks ago i not know duvet existed now i know you better get right size . comforter esthetically very nice fluffed up well . i bought one j.c. penny higher cost less fill it ugly , i purchase it because my dog eat my other comforter . i returned it j.c. penny . what it worth after looking these comforters few weeks getting one or two i not happy , this one all i expected . it looks good , fluffed up well fifteen year warranty if you it duvet . my dog not seem like it taste but it hard get him off it , he loves it , important factor me . update : we now some somewhat cool nights texas 30 i am warm toast . well worth price ! if you get some tarp clips sew them into duvet you clip comforter into duvet it works great keeping it where you want it , just observation . i would not hesitate purchase " royal velvet " quality appearance worth price . i keep door closed keep my doberman off if he access other rooms just lot class . he likes quality softness , not mention warmth . go figure . people 1 , doberman 2 . not mention i lowered heat night so comforter cost wise free since i am warm or warmer than before , not bad investment .	1

i asked popcorn popper christmas , got this . i wanted air popper , but maybe i wasn't specific when i asked . anyway , cuisinart product , i thought it must good . also , my cousin oil popper ( different brand ) makes great popcorn , so i thought i'd try it . steam collects lid/bowl making wet popcorn . some popcorn burnt , even spinner device , because popcorn stayed heat plate too long after it popped - it can't all top pile . i still tried eat finished popcorn ( unburnt , less wet pieces ) it terrible texture sort too hard - stale maybe - but it fresh corn . plus , even lots butter salt , it sort strange taste - sort chemically maybe ? manual even said something chemicals needing burn off during first few uses ( i even washed it before i used it because possibility ) . lastly , even though it non-stick , it difficult clean cooked oil off heat plate . this worst product ever so many reasons : flawed design , lack ease cleaning , overall performace , terrible end product ! i ended up feeding popcorn my dog - least she seemed like it . i am seriously shocked poor quality this item . i cannot believe cuisinart let it market . how earth it pass their test kitchens ? i wanted popcorn maker so badly now i am stuck piece junk . compared batch popcorn , i'd rather eat raw kernals straight out bag	-1

nutshell : gold standard price tin openers go - there none better , but fact these available around $10 . last literally forever seems too good true . nevertheless , it true . like many other people , we tried lot different openers , some electric some hand held , but we always come back one always our kitchen -- ' swing-a-way ' . what makes ' swing-a-way opener ' superior other openers ? 3 components contribute synergistically swing-a-way success ; 1]- very durable tempered steel gears cutting edge stays sharp literally forever . 2]- ample leverage provided large chrome-plated steel turn-key assure enough torque into gears open any simply hand turning . 3]- plastic coated steel handles facilitate penetration cutting edges just ordinary hand pressure . why these long lasting super openers so inexpensive ? only several moving parts made easily manufactured components sold huge scale worldwide , it costs very little make this product despite its excellence .

pros : easy use , solid , makes good espressocons : noisy , single insert too smalli bought machine 2 months ago i'm very happy it . i don't use steamer so i can't tell you anything it . i use machine every day make espresso i'm drinking one right now . machine solid well built . it makes very good espresso although i use larger insert double espresso make single shot ( single insert too small me ) . i always get nice rich crema although results vary based brand coffee i use . some reviewers mention coffee comes out cold . i never coffee not warm enough . mine comes out always right temperature ( i use plastic cups usually i wait minute before drinking so i don't burn my tongue ) . make sure you wait orange light go out so right temperature reached . yes , machine somewhat noisy when it operates but i guess that inevitable . making shot takes minute or two subsequent ones made even faster . overall this great product . i use it every day i recommend xp4000	1

this my first waffle maker , so i can't really give good review , but i guess i'm pretty happy it . it beeps ( you kind get used siren-like beeps :)) when pan warmed up it beeps again when waffle . it makes good waffles , but my only complaint it hard spread batter whole entire pan , since batter rises you cook it . my first try i batter overflowing out pan ( pain clean ) , other times i didn't put enough batter ; it takes some practice . i guess if you buy rotating ones batter spread more evenly , but those too expensive my budget . overall i think it good deal money	-1

i read all reviews all dyson models before i decided buying dc 17 model . i 3 dogs i'm always fighting dog hair . much i love my canine buddies , i hate their constant shedding . those who say lab don't shed liars !! i just got my dyson today , like child christmas morning i could not get it out box fast enough . i wish instructions better laid out instead picture form-i like descriptions go pictures . but after while trial error i figured it out . i central canister vacuum system runs through house ( i've hated it beginning ) because my husband thinks that way go . canister out garage he thinks it healthier him not dust house when vacuum emptied . 25 ' hose you drag room room always gets way , i never thought it cleaned well 1st place . it always sore spot . so i decided put it ultimate test . i vacuumed my rugs carpet old relic then came behind dyson . man , [ ... ] came out my so-called " just vacuumed " rugs beyond belief !!! i expected get lot junk , but still amazed how much it actually picked up !!! what everyone else said before me true !!!! fact it hepa filter you clean every 6 months , it appears pretty easy clean pictured instructions , i take bin outside dump it out if he freaks out thinking dust run rampant house when it time empty it . i wanted dyson quite while . i've herd nothing but good things them reviews i read dc 17 model made me finally decide take plunge . i'm sure glad i . i now feel secure knowing when i vacuum floors now they actually clean when i'm !! dyson extended their warrenty 5 years-what other company their vacuum cleaners ? i recommend dyson everyone anyone who listen ! thank you dyson making such outstanding amazing product !!	1

i just received sharpener today henckels santoku . i sharpened half dozen old henckels home found sharpening process very quick . last time i sharpened knives whetstone this process definitely much faster . i get knives sharp manual process . i hoping ' razor ' sharp edge comes brand new knives , but it seems may not achievalble tool . i used new knife benchmark , it not possible me get same degree sharpness . machine provide edges , though , definitely usable , probably better than average person achieve whetstone . much faster . i first followed instructions came sharpener , it quite hard grasp . it asks user hold knife lightly let magnet align knife . what worked me look directly over machine so i see contact knife edge moving abrasive . looking angle trying keep angle consistent , working magnet becomes quite intuitive . trying keep angle constant , hand subconsciously lets magnet align knife . if you pull knife blindly , this process doesn't work quite well ... least beginning , i suppose , since i just started use product . overall i am happy sharpener , would use this over manual sharpening any day . if i sushi chef who whose life depended sharp edge , i would probably not use it , but keep set knives reasonable condition everyday cooking , machine definitely more than adequate	-1

spend extra buy cuisinart . i bought hamilton big mouth november , just time use all extra cooking i through holidays . i didn't money spend cuisinart time , so i thought i'd give hamilton beach try , after looking reviews here . now , this my first time using hamilton beach food processor , i've worked professional kitchens always used cuisinarts , i'm used them work horses plow through any kind food you process . first , things going great -- it survived through thanksgiving 20 , christmas 30 , last thing made large batch gingerbread dough . i put machine away , just brought it out use weekend worth cooking , it dead . we've troubleshooted through everything , but no avail . i guess this product would fine if you only cooked occasionally , but frequent home cook who occasionally also large meals , i'd seriously suggest getting better more sturdy brand .	-1

ff x5 great , well built , makes good espresso good froth . however , ff exclusive service center sucks . it better buy appliance fixed locally . i sen't my x5 because it started trip my circuit breaker . their customer service sucks . after few weeks , i called see what diagnosis , first thing they said they didn't receive unit yet but doesn't mean it not their warehouse yet , sometimes warehouse not report them if machine arrived yet until they time process it . after 2 weeks , i called they said they trying call me but my phone not voice mail . i told them over over call me my office number , but they kept calling my home phone number which i don't answering machine . they my home number because number matches my credit card time original purchase . estimate $205.78 i asked them itemize it me , i called them twice this . they never mentioned part this charge $73.73 ups shipping ( it only $46.40 according ups ) . i approved estimate , machine arrived yesterday ... damaged . francis francis didn't want hear my complain , they just told me deal ups claims . ups pick up machine tomorrow inspection . ff declared value only $300 , go figure ? one more thing , i sent it ff original box , they returned it me box ( some sort warehouse box they use ff machines ) . i strong believe original box better , it heavy styrofoam inserts fitted protect machine shipping damage itself . styrofoam inserts original box supports heavy top x5 . x5 , shipped non-original box arrived collapsed top smashing base , disfiguring base 1 inch , it awefull see this heavy metal baby all sad like this . i think this common problem because part packing material non-original box thick cardboard insert says very descriptivelly this piece cardboard needs bee top base otherwise they won't responsible shipping damage . cardboard there , but it obvious me fitted styrofoam better . conclusion , this machine require periodic maintenance repaired factory , however if factory sucks , get brand instead . unless you willing buy new unit every time yours fail , don't get this machine	-1

this early christmas present my loving wife , i weigh dry ingredients our weekly batch belgian waffles , then perfectly time baking built-in repeatable timer . test scale accuracy , i set 2-cup measuring cup platform before switching it so it would zero out weight cup . i then slowly poured water into cup until display read 8 ounces ( every fan " good eats " food network knows " pint pound whole world ' round , " thus , cup liquid weighs 8 ounces ) . water just kissed 8 ounce marking measuring cup . that more accuracy than anyone needs kitchen . tare button lets you zero out scale after each ingredient so you don't add up total weigh t.t he platform looks small but handle 10 inch dinner plate without obscuring display . like my prized waring pro belgian waffle maker ( also christmas gift my darling cathy ) , scale handsome enough leave display all time	1

ceramic cooktop owner who loves cast iron , i invest some enameled cast iron . ( unenameled cast iron may scratch surface . ) i chose le creuset . i enjoy cooking all le creuset skillets pots i own . i noticed some comments here compelled me write this review . black seen pan not teflon , but black cast iron . cast iron skillets come either seasoned or unseasoned . i ones stick worse than others . i can't explain it , but if surface looks dull gray opposed shiny black , it probably needs some grease added it . i usually just spray cooking oil prior cooking easier cleanup . i'm just guessing . directions may found lodge cast iron website . lodge now offers enameled cast iron line nordic ware , but le creuset seems sale more often offered more places . also avoid cracking porcelain enamel , follow manufacturer instructions allowing pan cook down room temperature . extreme temperature changes may crack glaze . i say these really heavy pans i strategize which shelves they go .	1
tri-ply cookware necessity if you own gas stove . thick bottoms thin sides ( " simply calphalon " line , example ) work fine electric stove , but gas stove heat sides enough scorch your food circle above base , sometimes all way up lid . fully-clad tri-ply cookware heats evenly rim rim , so you not get scorching gas stove . ( personally , i think they cook better electric stoves , too . ) calphalon copper cookware enough copper make noticeable difference how evenly pan heats . pan thickness overall 2.8 mm , outside copper layer 0.8 mm -- respectable thickness . others may claim this copper outer layer " doesn't really " matter , but it * * matter . pans made copper tri-ply simply heat faster more evenly than equivalent pan stainless tri-ply . however , well-made stainless tri-ply pans very , very good , nothing scoff . ( ease cleanup stainless nice , too . ) calphalon tri-ply pans same performance league all-clad . i've used both , thickness overall , balance , design , handle lids calphalon pans excellent , fully all-clad level quality . check out price difference yourself . these pans designed more experienced cooks . you need know how preheat pan proper cooking , but when used good technique , stainless-lined saut� pan stick very little -- most cases , when you saut� , you want least * little * sticking , so you get some caramelized fond your food deglazing sauce reductions . soups , sauces more liquid-based cooking , stainless lining works like charm . this particular pan good size many cooking needs -- big enough cook up four people , but not unwieldy . it deep enough add whole bottle wine braising ( room spare ) but shallow enough use spatula without contortions . rounded corners deglazed whisk . all all , entire calphalon tri-ply line exhibits intelligent , traditional design , thoroughly modern " stay-cool " handles ( very comfortable well-balanced ) flared pouring rims . if you torn copper tri-ply pan very expensive stainless-lined solid copper 2.5 mm pan ( like mauviel , bourgeat or falk ) here quick way help you decide : go upscale kitchen store handle one those fancy french solid copper pans . they weigh ton -- they're least twice heavy tri-ply . they cost least twice much . ( they give you great bragging rights , though ... ) always , watch sales , also bogus mark-up/mark-down pricing ( very common here . ) calphalon company website clearly shows legitimate suggested retail price .	1
my husband i just purchased ceramic top stove . after finding out we could no longer use our old , much loved , revere copper-bottomed pots pans new stove , we began look new cookware . so much what out there terribly expensive i don't like stainless steel handles -- they too long store stuff easily pots pans too heavy . addition , " sets " cookware available left too much out - not enough sauce pans -- too many fry pans . thankfully , we found this 14-piece revere 2000 set here amazon . it absolutely eveything i want cookware set . i like " pistol grip " stay cool handles round lid knobs . everything set easy store ( nice , short handles ! ) , easy use stove top , easy clean . cookware heats up quickly efficiently - i able boil water short time medium heat - never turn stove knob " high " . food stays good hot stove lids stove turned off . i no problem cleaning anything - i just put drop dish detergent warm water let pan soak short while . using " tuffy " plastic scrub pad little bit " barkeepers friend " sponge keeps this cookware looking new . i am very pleased this set plan purchase more accessories this line . set practical , highly useable easy store . plus , it didn't cost fortune ! i'm delighted !	1

i bought this set petsmart $50 my long-haired rottweiler . let get one thing straight here - my rottweiler thick hair , 3 inches long , she completely covered dirt all time . these clippers cut through her hair ( i didn't give her bath , so they cut through her dusty fir ) no problems all ! i got 4 good uses out these , then blades finally went dull . i searched andis website which extremely helpful , they show you list blades fit your clippers you buy them or find store sells what you need . replacement blades $16 horse/dog type ... i admit , i contemplated buying sheep clippers my dog one time . motor runs same when i first bought it regardless all dirt hair gone through it . i say even spending $50 these clippers good deal , since taking dog get groomed $40 or more each time ! kit comes ton clipping guides all sizes , sheers , clipper lubricant , brush . it also comes video which i never watched , so i can't say if it would helpful or not . i definitely recommend this any size dog	1

i also own both salt ball pepper ball disagree previous reviewer ; i find both useful table but very unhelpful when cooking . balls both great when seasoning food , but not work all recipes require exact amounts . opening bottom ball extremely large , attempting direct what coming out into teaspoon or tablespoon worthless- you'll use up all pepper before you get whatever measurement you need . additionally , mine ( ordered amazon.com ) not come stand product claims . therefore , when ball sitting counter , it very susceptible picking up things around it- any sort spilt liquid go up into ball ( especially salt one ) ruin whatever inside . i also agree both balls produce very inconsistent salt pepper- even whole pepper balls come through mine . also , amount pepper inside beginning very limited ( mine only 1/4 full when i got it ) . however , if you able keep them dry don't mind refills , these balls give you freshly ground salt pepper , easy use , make cute addition table . i believe both overpriced what they , you wind up paying $30 set . you might want consider either paying extra $10 more durable effective set or sticking cheaper , non-mill varieties .	-1

we not fence , so petsafe wireless fence unit significantly improved quality life dog us . we adjusted base unit allow forest creatures escape . we weren't able put invisible fence where we planned because chain-link enclosure ( dog " sand box " ) beside our driveway interfered signal . collar uses up specialized batteries quickly , so keep supply hand . check collar daily before using . when battery replaced , collar must reset appropriate shock level . we left boundary flags up 10 days although dog figured it out first day . my dog only experienced one shock ( setting four ) first day ; since then , beep enough keep him within boundaries . petsafe retains control over selling price its products , so there no bargain basement prices any vendor .	1

i almost didn't buy this machine because i worried some negative reveiws i've read it users . however , it only machine its price range really caught our eye , so we went ahead purchased it using it six months . it hands down best machine i've ever owned . it great features , espresso best espresso i've made home , better than most espresso i buy american coffee shops . quick rundown great features . 1 . it looks great . it heats up quickly , it very simple use . 2 . size water resevoir pretty generous . it holds enough water 24 shots . you expect get little less if you steaming lot milk , but if you steaming recommended temperature , machine very water efficient , you shouldn't see dramatic drop . we use it every day make least two drinks ( leeast 4 shots ) , lot more weekends , we refill only once week , roughly . design also makes it quite easy refill , i've middle steaming or pulling shot when i realized reservoir low , refilled whiled pulling shot . this awfully convenient . 3 . machine comes disc you put inside porta filter make sort fake crema whipping coffee , which popular upper-end machines these days . however , if you using good coffee , grind your beans fresh , brew coffee recommended temperature , machine produces wonderful genuine crema without disc . i never get espresso coffee house crema good . ( crema more quality coffee than machine , but cheaper machines pull coffee way too hot never produce good cremas because crazy temperatures . ) 4 . steam wand great job genlty steaming frothing without scalding daylights out your milk . i've heard lot complaints steamer , but my experience it works perfectly , easily . 5 . it come adaption pods , if you're into pods ( blech . ) 6 , i love machine temperature gague allows you control temperature your steam coffee , not just indicator lights . it allows you lot more control over quality your espresso . few things so so , included tamp flimsy useless , get yourself nice heavy one . drip tray feel little light cheap compared rest machine , but it perfectly functional . cup warmer isn't very successful warming cups . but these minor quibbles i it . i'm sure if i willing pay 4 or 5 times much , i'd get better espresso , but price , i couldn't happier this machine . it beats any little starter machines you get , makes better espresso than machines cost twice price , my experience . i'm very happy this machine .	-1

passionate home cook honing her cooking skills last 25 years writes this review . my favorite cookbooks " professional chef " culinary institute " culinary artistry " . i love cook i prepare three meals day most days month . my husband i embarked mostly vegan lifestyle 3 months ago i decided i needed larger salad spinner . i purchased this salad spinner replace smaller one battery operated i using least 15 years . pros : 1 . rubber bottom this spinner keeps it place counter while you using it . this big improvement over standard spinners . 2 . large capacity also very nice if you eat lot vegetation . 3 . pump easy use provided you remember not push all way bottom stroke causes it lock . this takes little getting used , but you get hang it eventually . 4 . pump mechanism should less susceptible breakage than string models . i heard others pull mechanism prone breakage pull models . 5 . it removes much water produce my battery operated salad spinner . cons : 1 . i can't remove center stem basket no matter what i try . i think this design flaw . 2 . spinner little awkward clean center stem place . overall , i think this product middle road , not great but not terrible either . i like extra capacity , but i would much happier if i could get stem out basket facilitate cleaning thing .	-1

i bought this particular filter faucet mount couple reasons . first , i something called chlordane my water ( insecticide ) i wanted it out . secondly , my water very strong chlorine smell it . i looked into getting filter scrubs chlorine , maybe i eventually , but now this particular filter works fine . i bought mount because it just happened sale when i went store buy it . i read lot bad stuff vertical filters how they consistently leaked after few months , but hadn't seen anything like their horizontal mounts . i little disappointed first when i installed my filter because it indeed leak . fortunately , it doesn't leak filter housing , but rather where filter connected tap . eventually , problem went away , though not before spraying water all over my kitchen . i also not happy prospect run my water five minutes clean out filter , but i lived it . really , i may sound negative , but i'm actually quite happy i bought filter . my water tastes better ( though still heavy ) smells better . i feel better now i've removed chemicals what i'm drinking , i well pleased filter . water flow fine , though i've heard it tends slow down it gets older . display let you know when filter needs replacing opposed just guessing nice . it good little filter unless you're looking scrub chlorine your water ( it only removes taste odor ) worth consideration if you just want water tastes better	-1

i bought this my cat few months ago , because he just loves playing laser pointer . whole concept this toy great but they should've expanded their ideas bit more . size toy you would think it would point further out than it . i'm not sure others but most cats i know like run back forth room chasing laser , maybe even jump up wall . opposed bada beam just goes circle , reversing its direction every once awhile . my cat never avoids laser pointer , when he sees red light he jumps right up ! but bada beam , he just sit stare it . whole point so you don't hold it let cats go crazy ! nope ! it one thing me disappointed , but it clear my cat more disappointed .	-1

it seemed work when i first got it , but i'm not really sure anymore . when i first got it , i changed litter put smellkiller right near it . usually after i change litter , i still smell litter , it just smells clean ; this time , i couldn't smell anything . i keep sponge moist it still sits small area where litter box ; most part , i don't notice any smells , but i'm not sure if due smellkiller or because i use ah baking soda kitty litter , 2nd litter crystals , ah litter box deodorizer powder . i suppose it works ok , but i wouldn't buy one , i don't think it works miracles claimed other reviews . also , mine didn't stay wall either ... came crashing down only 1 day after i put it up . now it just sits top litter box	1
christmas morning slow , ongoing leak , which we worked around over last year , finally gave way voila ! hot coffee water grounds all over counter floors . yes , we clean our coffeemaker daily , yes , we know how properly run thing too . ( we gave up water filter soon after purchase -- it kept falling into coffee grounds . ) why two stars ? we wanted love this machine ! we wanted it work ! it handsome machine handsome pedigree ( mr. coffee ! ) . clock nice . thermal carafe lovely . until big leak , we made its daily dribble sputter . but really , after examining unit carefully before its trip trash , we realized how foolish we keeping this fire hazard going long we . that why i've bothered write this review . it not inexpensive machine ; quality isn't there . sorry .	1
i received this blender x-mas last year . it some nice design features ( good heavy base prevent tipping , measuring cup built into cap ) . however , i experienced same problems others here -- blender doesn't well anything thick like milkshakes . it just shoves everything against sides pitcher spins helplessly , forcing you stop manual stir everything back towards blades restart . while it worked ok while , cutter unit mysteriously jammed after 9 months	1

while cute , this little pan difficult use . there no room use spatula , so you'd better like eggs cooked through - you can't flip over easy , egg white too deep sunny-side up . also handle gets hot little plastic egg bit not enough grip , so you use potholder . plus , it so small it won't fit any normal-sized burner - burn risk your fingers	1

i find it more than bit ridiculous pur charges 40 dollars their product 20 - 25 dollars their replacement filters . i owned 3 pur sink mounted water filters every one them ended up garbage within first year use . why ? because they begin leak faucet connection this leak grows progressively worse over time . tightening unit not help fact may make leak worse . removing reinstalling unit not help . i become so frustrated pur water products i never again purchase anything made them . i just installed brita filter my sink couple days ago no problems yet even if any occur brita more reasonably priced up 15 dollars cheaper sink mounted unit . yourself favor avoid this over-priced piece junk all costs	-1

okay , i haven't used this while reading bed yet ... but supplemental light uses areas minimal lighting , it great ! light isn't good areas adequately well-lit , so don't bother use light there . but areas where light dim , light shines . literally . it casts bright light page(s ) you need view . it helped me tremendously get through pages reading . yes , it bit pricey what you get , but it incredibly compact it fits nicely my bag . imagine carrying lamp everywhere you go . power adapter , however , cumbersome brick . limited time which light bulb useful , i can't offer estimate time yet - but so far my bulb running least 15 hours or so- cumulative , not consecutive hours . so , no complaints yet . whenever i saw this light online or store , i used think , " why world would i ever want something like this ? " now , my thoughts : " why didn't i ever think buy this before ?	1

there lot theoretically good ideas fail when executed . this one them . 1/quality:it made cheaply , even before it breaks , it flimsiness not inspire confidence . 2/resistance : levels resistance nothing real progression , anyone who ' seriously ' uses this too strong machine few weeks , ( many unchallenged right beginning ) . standard : if set longer than minute you still strength continue , you need more resistance . 3/compared crunches : there reason why crunches lying down : weight torso supplies fairly heavy resistance , whereas when you crunch uptight position weight torso actually helps effort , you dropping your weight down instead lifting it up . much what makes ab crunch machine ' work ' your weight dropping it , not your muscles working . this little piece plastic doesn't springs strong enough resist your bodyweight strengthen your muscles besides . ( you may achieve isometric contraction some effect , but you get -exactly- this effect , or -better- , without any equipment all ! just tense up seated crunch position minute or so . ) ... course , time product appealing public claiming how supposedly -huge- hassle lying down (??) crunches , we've reached real problem : this thing designed avoid effort . it seems though no one goes broke helping people avoid effort . unfortunately , exercise effort , more you avoid effort , less exercise you get	-1

attachment kitchen faucet very suspect . plastic parts not make sure fit . if you ever run hot water through filter ... forget it . this happened twice my house . if hot water goes through filter , even five seconds , filter ruined . two brand new filters $24/each met this fate . when this happens whole contraption pops off faucet . spend $50-$70 bucks install industrial grade line filter underneath sink . line filter replacements cheaper than small brita filters found ace hardware . i am extremely disapointed brita aquaview product .	-1
i've used this blender 45 times , mostly frozen bananas milk or yogurt . it works . some reviewers problems splashing . instructions say hold lid down . i turn blender one hand hold lid down my other hand . inside lid get splashed . i've never splashes come through lid . once blender running , i let go lid , open little hole , drop frozen bananas into hole while holding outside lid . tiny splashes come though little hole , which i can't see unusual or problematic . i'm very happy	1

worn out capresso machine after daily brewing 4-6 shots espresso making lattes/cappuccinos , etc . i went looking more durable machine . i bought x1 2001/2 when it brand new model ( stainless ) it great : 1 . it heats up quickly . 2 . it brews very consistently . 3 . ese thing best mess-preventer ever . 4 . separate steam-temperature setting great . heats milk much faster than other , cheaper consumer models . 5 . machine capacity steam enough milk least 3 tall lattes before needing quick " refill " water pump switch . 6 . i like simplicity total manual operation . switches aren't labeled , but there only 3 . kind morning meditation me . most important , non-obvious things : 1 . don't leave pod holder move temperature steam setting . when you unhook pod holder , steam instantly blow apart ese pod , which , given it more than boiling hot , hurt , plus dry instantly wall . 2 . use individually wrapped ese pods , unless you use them all within 2-3 hours opening tin . they sour very quickly , even freezer . i am partial starbucks pods , given my household addiction brand , but i think more preference than quality issue . illy tastes fine , but you use them all quickly . 3 . if you serve lot guests , double unit ( x3 ? ) might better . dual-temperature settings , you'll spend lot time running water through unit cool steam setting back down brew next batch espresso . lots refills water container , which bit pain remove back machine . overall , great performer after 4 years daily , multiple use . this thing great machine	1
chrome look this unit quite nice really look like chrome ( doesn't look cheap like some other metallic plastics ) , matching chrome fixtures nicely . but important part this filter really its job . you'll find pur website pur ulitmate nsf certified effectively filter 28 contaminants listed nsf standard 53 , whereas some competing products , including popular disposable model doesn't use cartridges , claim certification less than third those . i'm sure there truly comparable filters out there , but check specs before you buy . flow rate seems reasonable me . i fill up my 12-cup coffee carafe under minute , i don't mind taking couple extra seconds peace mind i'm drinking cleaner , safer water . after all , i won't needing it washing dishes or taking shower . it very easy install , it seems more durable than older generation pur faucet-mount filter i developed leaks after while . this one working almost year no leakage all	1

i bought this my wife who drinks six cups every morning ( finally got her switch mostly decaf ) . i first bought less expensive ( still @$400 ) machine which not automated . took it back when i realized it probably share space counter our current coffee maker using it involved additional tasks three kids we already enough tasks . jura-capresso works great - easy use , easy clean ( really only steam wand simple clean espresso or coffee fills cup ) no extra work . it tells you when empty grounds ( every 10 cups ) , fill water beans . it rinses nozzle automatically when it shuts down ( two hour auto shut down ) tells you rinse it ( pushing button ) when you power it up . i cannot think easier way coffee , espresso , cappuccino or cafe au lait anytime we feel like it . i especially like fact we not tied into using company pods ( paying premium wasting lot paper ) load any bean we desire or use bypass use ground coffee . two wishes - larger water tank ( or ability hook up water supply ) allowing angle steam wand move higher it pain put wand into larger mugs . but those just wishes - not gripes . two months no problems - just got steamer container came free but haven't tried it yet . great buy !!!	1
i keep this unit running throughout day my bedroom shut it off bedtime . ( too noisy me ) . i'm actually sleeping better/less stuffy . i recommend this filter anyone who some difficulty breathing easy night	1
this blender simply just powerful good looking blender so simple i bet even george . bush use it ( no offense republicans , i am one you anyway ) . this thing blend or crush or chop , or anything ( depending settings ) your frozen cranberries sticky gummy bears ( don't ask ) . no matter how many foodstuffs you mix different types or different stages matter it throughly blend them make smooth combo drinks or throughly spread flavored salsa or just knock out lumps pudding or gravy point it would cause french chief weep jealousy . i'm person who hates cleaning honest but simply this blender just easy clean despite what type mess i make blending jar or button counter sticky milkshake greasy gravy . i'm person who when i buy something i don't read instructions , i just try get feel how use it simply all this blender vast settings self-explanatory no instructions needed , so i got feel it no-time	1
i'm sure there cutlery snobs out there who would turn up their nose anything you find local " bedding bathing further " type store ... but this thing wicked . it huge , huge step up generic chefmate set i got while back . i cut tomato half quite literally accident , while old knife would take enough pressure deform poor little fruit or some sort sawing . think this introduction proper knives if you must , but i can't see reason get anything else ... unless it 10 " version ! incidentally , i chose this over wusthof , henkel , etc because handle fit my hand best i like " japanese style " blade no bolster . i'd recommend going brickmortar get feel options before buying	1

-- i've used lot grinders . very badly designed , " custom " thing gimmick sham : it standard rotary grinder . they just added flashing lights extra buttons , made it look bulkier . every day misery dealing this thing : it designed so you no choice but spill grinds all over place when you use it	-1
just got this couple weeks ago . love look quality . price , you can't go wrong	1
works better than other undercoat tools cost much more	1
when i got my gaggia more than several decades ago , it not yet called classic . it called coffee gaggia . 20 years ago , some minor changes made , unit renamed classic . new " coffee gaggia " not same this machine . this machine robust build , high quality parts . its tank heats water quickly , proper temperature , pump powerful enough job properly . i would strongly recommend using filtered water , especially low mineral content , so deposits not build up tank . my version all metal frothing wand , which good job skills operator allow . newer versions " turbo frother , " optional milk frother take guess work out frothing place foamed milk directly into cup . i can't comment these newer features , but perhaps they allow better job those less experience . newer models brushed stainless , while original models appliance enamel finish . since old finish allowed water penetrate under any scratches or imperfections finish , this particular problem near portafilter holder underneath drip tray . new version should retain its finish far longer , although old one still not show any wear places visible machine assembled . minor differences new machine more robust looking steam knob moved side , thermostat light , which indicated unit heating , replaced " ready " light integrated into coffee switch signals opposite . time i've my machine , i've only minor problems it . my steam thermostat needed replaced once , light my power switch stopped working . these larger issues before internet made it easy find parts , these items hard find locally . other problem if unit not used extended periods , tank allowed dry out completely , water used hard , then some parts subject clogging . troubleshooting steps manual not helpful these sorts problems . machine disassembled cleaning somebody who mechanically inclined , but unless you feel comfortable appliance repair , you better off avoiding situation using filtered water , and/or descaling regularly , especially before any long term storage . other " parts " issue gasket filter basket should considered consumable part , should sold every dealer accessory , rather than just repair facilities . machine really should included extra one since this only part definitely wear out regular use . it might take few years or longer , easy replace , but it wear out . overall , this well built machine should last you many decades . although it seemed expensive when i bought it , it averaged out 6 cents day own it , which well worth price , i'll probably get few decades out it . if you used cheaper espresso makers , you appreciate robustness quality this unit . features such three way solenoid controlled valve might transparent user , but lack them become clear when you use cheaper machine . this one just keeps going going .	1
great idea works ! also doubles up individual dipping saucer	1

after burning through several " cheap " vacuums , i bought this product confidence after my trepidation eased great reviews . i bought this 10 months ago now it dead . i live house wood floors only used this clean 4 rooms rugs . suction initially great first use i thought it broken until i discovered trap full ( duh ) . me sold but after last time i cleaned it out , it just died . i'm no dummy fixing things but why i bought " good " vacuum . well , $200 trash	1
these really beautiful glasses , incredibly light . we no dishwashwer , though , i broke one first time i washed it ( putting dishsponge down inside ) - i careful . these really , really delicate . my husband broke one next day . we also got white wine version these glasses , one broken upon arrival - still wrapped its bubble wrap . i no idea why bodum decided make these such incredibly thin glass . they're really beautiful , we love using them , but it ridiculous this careful them - i mean , we other wine glasses i used think delicate , but these bodum ones take cake . we also bought double-walled bodum glasses , those beautiful much sturdier ( although they're not wine ..... )	1
if your knives dull , chances you need sharpen them before you need hone them . get diamond-impregnated steel such this one . this steel quickly sharpen your knives . don't try sharpen your knives honing steels come most knive sets or popularly available or you'll wreck honing steel well waste lot elbow grease . they say use steel least long your knife . i don't any 12quot ; knives , but i like little extra room error ..	1

i adore this coffee maker ! i've read reviews , i've used one ( not mine ) seven months daily ... all no problems . owner machine i am using warned me make sure push filter door until it clicks firmly before assuming it ready brew . she stated she problem filter only once , she smart enough figure it out never problem . if i any complaint this system all it would when it begins cycle 4:30 a.m. , grinder wakes up everyone house . when i know i get up early , i just grind beans myself night before . no big deal . i love this item am here purchase one myself ... i'm buying reconditioned one , because , somebody else couldn't figure it out , sent it back i'm only going pay half price because i'm smart enough know how close filter door ! funny how it manufacturer problem every time consumer too limp read directions . here your sign	1
i bought this after i read it recommended author " cat vs . cat " . i 3 cats - stuck-up prissy female , obese lazy female , psychotic energetic male . i love this thing ! i am so amazed very happy all 3 them love this toy ! my stuck-up cat usually never plays cat toys , only strings , pens , straws . my fat cat just never plays , but obsessed watching out window talking birds . male , however , born feral cat colony , but bottle fed my step-sister . he endless energy . before i even got da bird out its package he excited ( other two sleeping ) . we started playing , soon fat one came downstairs see what going . before long , i my two females playing it , put male room . only thing you might want consider if you cat who over possessive or wild , he/she may destroy feathers before normal cat would . my male cat so nuts over this , he actually tiring himself out point panting . problem when he would actually catch da bird , he not let go growls , so other cats don't want play . really , if you think it , wild cats ( some domestic ) catch birds then take them off eat , but long you don't allow them get aggressive it , you should fine . i definitely recommend this toy . sure you keep this somewhere your cats can't find it when you aren't playing them .	1
i just love my little eureka bagless vacuum- it lightweight , picks up cat hair crumbs easily . no need drag out big heavy one . price easy , compared big ones , many which don't good job !! easily taken upstairs . i heartily reccomend it	1

knives perfect - just what my husband , cook , wanted christmas . they came timely manner perfect condition	1
i've this grinder over two decades it performed well . when i first got my machine , i wondered which setting number would good cappuccino , or any particular grind . manual said since coffee vary variety variety , or even one roast , it matter adjusting each batch beans . perhaps 34 settings , people found helpful , but i found my beans consistent enough adjustments necessary type coffee , but left alone particular type coffee particular variety beans source . time i got machine , i got my beans peet back when they five stores no other distribution channels . although they larger chain now , they still small enough roasting well controlled , they still buy beans single source variety meet needs chain . beans other sources , where roasting variety locations , or beans differing sources , you might need pay more attention adjustments . much bigger issue affects strength everything else dosing . reading other reviews , it not seem changed since i got my unit . top unit filled beans , part over dispensing area fill up remarkably consistent grind . round area divided into six sections , like wheel spokes . five sections get filled grounds . one section empty , above dispenser . each time lever pulled , wheel rotates one position clockwise , one section gets dispensed through empty section . theory , if unit full , amount coffee each section would consistent . chances real life , you would not want fill unit up home use , since grounds would not fresh time you use them . if you grind just enough few cups , then coffee not end up compartments evenly , dosing counting pulls not work . if you lift lower lid , you see where coffee , you likely see small mound back partly filled areas toward front if you grind smaller amounts . you could redistribute things brush , but even way , some areas would end up more compacted than others . or you could merely gain experience know how much dispensed compared how much you need , pull handle accordingly . option gring lower lid off . you watch grinds fall into compartment , you rotate each compartment gets filled , dispensing you go . then you become consistent once you develop good eye it . whether you want consider dispenser poorly designed matter perspective . if you believe this unit designed grind beans two cups coffee , then it would fair conclusion . if you believe this unit designed people who prepare 6-12 cups hour , you might think it just fine . if you believe it designed higher level fairly constant use , you would probably not disappointed . but since this unit most likely home users , it hard claim dispenser ideally suited task . experience let you know how high grounds supposed when you put them filter basket , it not going take you long learn . while this unit not fool proof , chances you not fool , so things work out . me , bottom line once you know correct grind setting your beans , unit more " set it forget it " than what instructions said , least consistent beans , but dispenser lot less " set it forget it " than what literature implies . personally , i prefer unit takes guess work out getting grinds right consistency , since it easy get amount dispensed right eyeballing it . this unit very well respect . i use this conjunction gaggia coffee ( now known gaggia classic ; new gaggia coffee different machine ) two make good pair . learning how much coffee dispense minor part , compared learning how long hold switch espresso machine , or how froth milk perfectly , but ultimately , it boils down knowing how make proper espresso . if you tell when stop water based color coffee coming out , then bit more or less grinder affect how full cup gets rather than taste your brew . you can't automate perfect espresso , but you use correct tools allow you make one experience	1

this pot rack easy assemble included dozen hooks . no need order expensive extra hooks ! rack sturdy functional . despite its compact size , it held 6 pots 5 frying pans ( some which very heavy ) , wire strainer basket , without looking over-crowded . bulk weight held single center screw top . i believe this screw must hit stud , due tremendous weight it bears , so plan center rack stud . i'm not sure anchor through drywall would adequate , unless you plan hang only few pans . two other screws sides hold rack swaying . wire grid makes cute shelf plant . all all , this quick , easy , attractive solution overcrowded kitchen . great value price	1
it beautiful mold , i excited make cake shape sunflower . i am pretty experienced baker , my success rate , even tricky procedures , very high . five attempts use this cake pan , each ime increasing how slavishly i greased floured alleged " non stick " surface , careful remove it per instructions - after cooling 10-15 minutes rack after removing oven , i never got it out one piece . mold detailed corners too sharp cleanly release cake . i even tried letting it fully cool hopes some shrinkage would help get cake out . i own other nordic ware pans better luck them , but this particular mold loser , which very disappointing considering how pretty it could potentially if it worked . if you want use it jello , i'm sure it fine , but cakes , it waste time money .	-1

rival� slicer ( model 1060c ) generally well designed unit . i say generally because there appears , my unqualified opinion , one major design and/or manufacturing flaw associated product . first unit i received broken speed control knob prevented any speed adjustment . this unit exchanged ( thank you amazon making process painlessly easy ) . this second unit also broken speed control knob , failure point identical first . stem speed control knob either woefully under designed or it forced into wrong position ( it detent ) during assembly . this really too bad since unit looks like it would job which it intended quite well . what good this product : - heavy-duty construction ( parts i expected plastic made cast aluminum)- heavy-duty , thick stainless steel blade - removable cleaning- angled slicing surface- tray catch slices what ever- cuts up 5/8 " slices- integrated cutting boardwhat not so good this product : - there rubber suction cups four bottom corners protect surface unit sitting hold it place while it used . this would great feature except suction cups stick surface pull out unit when it lifted up . - speed control knob stated above ( sole reason number 1 rating )	-1

i agree other reviewer , mine become slightly more curved over few months i've it . it not dishwashed , i don't leave it hot pan , rarely left it " face down " counter because i'm weird cross contamination . curve turner more pronounced than it when i bought it , but it still better flipping than my narrow turners . especially my good sized pancakes , no run off sides sagging over edges narrow turner . i still recommend this turner . colors great .	1

this really cool concept , poorly executed . clear sleeve slides up down aluminum cylinder . top cylinder rubber gasket seals sleeve , thus preventing leakage sleeve cylinder . all works fine . problem bottom aluminum cylinder plastic ring larger diameter than cylinder . this ring stops sleeve sliding below top cylinder , also acts foot so you stand measuring cup . unfortunately , ring made fairly hard plastic , which become brittle crack . but it doesn't break away cleanly - so you're left measuring cup won't stand up straight . might fine if you're measuring things dumping them straight into bowl , but if you sit thing down while it full , forget it	1
litter locker great , i keep it next my omega paw litter box which i also highly recommend . i got mine online large chain pet store ... its basically spool inside , each turn wheel wraps bag into this spool . think garden hose ... most folks complain refills not last . hopefully they not tossing them when they empty device . biggest problem " spool " litter become too big spin inside locker , most people may think they empty it totally replace refill . you actually just empty spool once week or every 2 weeks , just not replace bag refill until it actually empties ! simply cut bag toss litter , tie it off then use same refill again until it runs out . i expect get around 6 weeks out each refill this method 1 cat , maybe longer	1

positive : great ! great ! great ! i spent weeks going over reviews comments electric food slicers preparation replacing one i using 25 years . it heavy , clunky would slide around counter when used . i only took it out use when nothing else would work . but it slice . after reading all i could reviews , i decided model 632 seemed best fit my use . cooking hobby not profession so i needed nothing more than good quality , home slicer . i decided keep new slicer counter while so i could try it out . i think it found permanent home . i find i am using it almost every day bread , meat , cheese vegetables . operation smooth caliper dial , very repeatable . it stable not " walk " counter when slicing . it appears well manufactured durable . several reviewers pointed on/off lock switches locations problem . i find just opposite true . their location both logical easy use . though i don't use it often , i found little extra i paid tilt table worth cost . overall , it met and/or exceeded every expectation i prior purchase . negative : if there downside , it would component parts not dishwasher safe . this nothing more very minor annoyance , since unit comes apart very easily requires little or no effort clean .

people who addicted zojirushi may change their mind when they discover how great sanyo ecj models !! i ecj-f50s , pretty much same d55s but thicker titanium coating -- 3.5 mm !! 5.5 cup only 2.5 mm thick titanium coating . it super durable cooks rice perfectly ! we using rice cooker our whole life this best we used so far ! if size doesn't really matter , go 5 cup f50s model , one much better !	1
i've owned several cheaper toaster ovens , they always fizzled out , only good making toast , not baking . i decided buy something high end , i am glad i . i wanted something smaller than my oven bake , this job well , i made pie turned out perfectly baked ( 9 " pie pan fitted perfectly ) , several other baked goods . secret convection baking degrees need lowered 25 . ( i.e. 350 325 ) i've only this oven few days , but i am very impressed satisfied performance power this toaster oven .	1

i went this fryer , ( replacement well loved much used unit ) , two basket feature . this reason first star . true , it take 5 quarts oil but frying 2 baskets one time . problem arose two baskets one time . temperature cranked up max 375 degrees , two one layer baskets chicken wings took over twice amount time needed fry greasy . second batch after waiting full 20 minutes assume maximum recovery those still fried much longer than needed time wise weren't up level old machine got them . clearly one immersion element can't pull off heating much oil . next fries . greasy . very greasy . again i allowed extra time oil temperature recovery . worse part heavy oil smell air . it required whole night leave kitchen made entire family shower immediately after dinner . we all felt like we worked double local rat trap . this unit doesn't replaceable charcoal filters but permanent metal one . it nothing absorb odors . this new oil nothing ' smelly ' cooked . only chicken fries . it returned store next morning after cleaning out , ( thus second star because it easy clean up ) . it traded rival . gave up half fry space but what incredible difference	1

addition all beautiful words said le creuset i want add several things i haven't seen anywhere else . first , oval shape pot this size preferable because it easier lift ( you hold pot closer your body ) . also it fits better oven . 5 pound duck fits perfectly 9 1/2 quarter oval pot just enough room left place some cherries or oranges around . second , le creuset became some sort cult ( i saw couple large french ovens emeril show other day . ) if you into french , cajun or just any rich cooking you just least one . third , price seems high , but then i saw some fifty year old le creuset ovens sold auction list 25% what they would cost new now . think it investment . forth , colors . i disappointed beginning find out they only sell this size white or french blue . but when i received my blue oval oven i loved color . picture catalog doesn't it justice . this large pot red ( my initial choice ) would looked like fire truck . i since added couple more blue pieces those who interested starting their tableware collection , this color coordinates beautifully denby reflex pattern	1
i bought this pot new used it once steam some fresh green beans . i shocked after using it one time , inside bare aluminum . dark grey " hard anodized " finish completely gone . my caphalon hard anodized cookware just gets better use . beware this phony product	-1
this mid-priced line henckel knives , called quot ; classicquot ; company , full-tang , single-piece , three-rivet line sturdy black plastic handles . handles notched end prevent hand sliding off during use . although they not razor sharp right package , their edges sharp enough average cook . according henckel , all knives this line dishwasher safe , but you should expect more rapid dulling under harsh conditions . slicer long straight blade curves up gently two-thirds way toward tip . tip extremely sharp , allowing exact easy puncture begin cutting . this knife balanced evenly blade handle make straight slicing more comfortable . this useful blade kitchen , it great both slicing melon carving meat .	1
.......... i paid too much these knives , though they work well . i should shopped around	1
very well worth cost(imho it worth far more than it cost ) . just wish i would seen knife like this hollowed edged earlier(i don't think amazon it , but it only $8 more different site )	1

after little experimentation water coffee measurement grind , this clever machine delivered rich , intense espresso minimal effort ( including cleanup ) . ( pace atypically disappointed reviewer , it " true " espresso : hot water forced through finely ground coffee high pressure produces , name would imply , espresso , although crema slight or absent , probably because microfilter . i've espressos wide variety machines domestic commercial , including one little eagle top , jerked them living more than once . aeropress not approximation ; it makes delicious espresso . ) components seem sturdy well-machined . i found steel chopstick easier stir than paddle-shaped implement provided aeropress . if you're no-throwaway purist , you may interested know microfilters rinsed reused indefinitely . they're too inexpensive seem worth effort , but it neat feature not mentioned online product descriptions	1
others noted , it not exactly high quality set , but my 6 year old couldn't care less thread count he even said it comfortable . good points : colors brilliant my son thrilled all different characters represented . it looks great his room . bad points : cheap sheets , little rough , but good enough young padawan :o	1

i agree some other reviewers unit runs hot side , but we've ours several years it still working great ! my biggest complaint it so good sucking up dust particles filter quickly clogs won't pick up larger items . then filter needs banged out order restore suction . it great vacuuming stairs cars small things ... but i usually bang out filter 2 or 3 times when doing stairs or car . kind pain , but same time it reassuring know it getting much dust out carpet . i would not use it big jobs , but think it works great small jobs . biggest issue trying track down replacement filters ... when i find them i usually buy couple	1
i purchased one these see if it would better than doing it hand ... boy it ever . it works even better than i'd hoped . clean up easy expected . my only complain would container plastic ; metal or glass would hold chill better , making better foam . but if you want , you use different vessel ( metal or glass ) would work fine , so my complaint pretty minor	1

rice our staple food - no kidding , it really . i all different kinds rice bins my pantry - long grain , brown rice , par boiled rice , sona masuri rice basmati rice . i cook rice everyday i never completely happy any one rice cooker all these years . i tried several different kinds , sanyo , aroma , zojirushi etc ., there always something each these , uneven cooking , big splatters , bottom getting burnt , so so forth . i finally got this one , recommended friend . * perfect brown rice , white rice pulav/pilaf . * absolutely no splatters . i intentionally put 1.5 cups extra water nothing came out - rice overcooked , but different story . * even though lid not detachable , cleaning easy . part it due shape ; fancy looking rectangular ones such pain . i'd say crappy design . * cooking vessel definitely thicker than most cookers out there . never burnt bottom even when left warm several hours . * i don't crank up my big oven baking small cake . this cooker it ! complaints really minor . * weak lcd display . * cannot cancel timer if you change your mind . you go increments all way max then start counting again . * not come bigger sizes .	1
i 90 gallon tank sometimes i don't want perform water change get bottom tank clean . i multi-vac previously . i no issues except over time , pieces won't stay together . i bought sludge extractor ( petco ) i love it . it reaches bottom my tank i didn't drain any water . pressure vacuum more than adequate . i bit relunctant proce , but i'm happy i buy it would recommend it others . just shop around lowest price	1
i expecting this machine cook rice very well based previously owning neuro fuzzy logic rice cooker made zojirushi , which i've worn out after many years use . i'm very happy new induction heating style cooking . it cooks brown rice better . pro's--exceptional rice results , almost foolproof . -- multiple menu settings account most types rice , including gaba brown ( which supposed make brown rice even healthier) -- easy operate . select menu setting , add cups rice bowl ( rinse rice ) , fill applicable mark bowl , hit cook button . -- battery backup . lithium battery means cooker remember its last settings even if you unplug it . if you're creature habit , this feature makes it even easier operate . -- clock timer 2 time settings you set based clock time . like previously stated , cooker remembers timer settings until you change them . i leave my cooker set rice ready 6:30 a.m. ( pack lunch work ) or 5:30 . ( dinner ) . con's--water level markings pan based 6.2 oz cup provided ( ~ 3/4 cup ) . don't lose cup ! -- expensive ( my justification it saves me $5 every time i pack rice lunch instead eating cafeteria) -- takes longer cook rice than equivalent stove method ( baking or stovetop) -- timer military time only ( so when i said timer set 5:30 p.m. , it actually 17:30 )in summary , buy this machine if you want use timer function . if you're type person who only remembers things last minute or don't like plan meals ahead , keep your money get pressure cooker or good pot instead . it fits my needs perfectly , so i give it 5 stars . i also recommend zojirushi lunch jar system if you want use this make rice lunch work . lunch jar keep rice warm moist , so you don't microwave it .	1

i prefer eight-inch knife over ten weight reasons wide series gives lots knuckle-slide area repeated chopping tasks . i've owned wusthof-trident knives since before graduating culinary school over ten years ago . fact , i still own all but one i still use daily ( one stolen ) . knives hold edge better than any other i've used ( i've tried 98% what out there ) , stand up continuous use comfortable enough use all day long . you'll never sorry owning wusthof-trident knives	1
when aeroccino works , it works great . it quick quiet , produces excellent foam . clean up very easy . but , there something inherently unstable aeroccino machines . since august , i managed kill three them i am not sure why . part it nature machine : because it constructed like water kettle , one should not submerge it into water . but because it designed heat milk , manufacturer allows putting it under running water long bottom machine remains dry . if you get bottom wet ( you ) , machine either trips ( heals itself after fully drying ) or dies . i suspect , my first two aeroccinos died such deaths . my third one died today . i frothed milk it , refilled it tried again ( without cleaning ) machine not work . i tried again it worked 20 seconds stopped . i tried again couple hours later it worked 10 seconds stopped . i am not sure why it so , but i suspect it magnetic foaming brushes you must insert into machine make it work . if anyone ideas why this so , let me know . positive side i keep calling company they keep sending me new machines . i really like aeroccino when it works . but i suspect it good old microwave when i finally run out warranty .	-1

i like this knife , i really . however , it truly functional santoku knife , it scalloped edge so your food doesn't stick blade . handle also really light doesn't same heft or balance , say , henckels 5 star series would . small grip somewhat uncomfortable people larger hands it doesn't any texture so it difficult use if hands bit wet . this first knife i grab slicing up meat fact it keeps razor sharp edge nice . however , if you own one knife your kitchen , i would not recommend this .	1

garbage capital ! where begin ??? ok handle , it my own fault getting mad because i read where handle falls off , but , my defense i figured surely people over bissell heard this issue , so time i buy it fixed right ? wrong ! got this because cat litter issue carpet , don't want lug around vacuum , thought this answer . picks up little , but it so amazingly noisy , which if i'm gonna loud , might well get real vacuum cleaner . i am guessing bissell sold out alot old standard companies america moved mexico , this would explain why products sub par , i mean you can't take customer service issue if you don't know language , so bissell , i am here help you out today ! your product mieda , awhile since i lived latin country(miami ) , so please forgive me if i spelled it wrong :	-1
this great tool turning just anything ; company even makes " leftie " version , spatula front angled opposite direction . however , earlier reviewer reported using it nonstick pan without any problems . my teflon-challenged husband used it my favorite nonstick skillet turned it into scratched up , unsalvageable mess . also , i left handle leaning side hot skillet around minute , handle now dent it . otherwise , i am very happy it .	1

i bought this set my significant other christmas . i looked around wusthof , global , few others but liked unique look feel these better . i also figured these would more comfortable easier wield female . end result she really enjoys them . although she fairly large hands woman , handles fit her nicely . knives come very sharp hold their edge long time . it interesting see how well they take professional sharpening . overall , i am happy i purchased this se t.t here one caveat . i also quite bit cooking large hands . after using shuns couple months , i come conclusion wusthof grand prixs fit me better feel sturdier . i cannot really justify two sets expensive knives around house , so we keeping shuns . my advice : go sur la table or williams-sonoma handle knives yourself . feel weight , notice handle shape , decide what fits you best . there so many quality manufacturers cutlery now it hard go wrong any selections	1

i really like my bodum coffee presses - i two sizes , delighted see i could replace beaker separately . but watch out if you order replacement beaker . my small one holds 3 what i think ordinary cups , so i ordered 3 cup replacement beaker mistake . looks like my small one actually 8 cup unit , my big one ( which hold 5 my cups ) 12 cup unit . there no info bodum itself how big it , so if you don't remember , it takes some guesswork figure out whether you " 3 " , " 8 " , or " 12 " cup bodum . study measurements carefully get closest match . oz held easiest way tell , but course if beaker broken you problem .	1

i've made mousse , chopped onion , made smoothie so far . all turned out fine . onion didn't chopped entirely b/c some pieces rubbery , but it certainly didn't turn mush when properly according techniques manual . you also go product website faq see short demonstrations certain techniques you may trouble . helped me out . i hope it lasts i also hope they start selling larger recipe book separately b/c it looks like you only buy conjunction bullet purchase now . it smell like rubber first time , but it brand new . lots blenders , even my $90 cuisinart . like other said , never run it more than 1mn . it only took 15 seconds my smoothie mix crushed ice frozen strawberries , it fully mixed , just used enough liquids you'll good go .	1
i've used this waffle iron 10 times so far - waffles , french toast or grilled sandwiches . it works fine . only thing i don't like it handle lifting top . grooves run front back when lid closed ( top bottom when it up ) . several times i trying lift lid handle slipped my fingers causing lid come crashing down . if grooves ran sideways instead , this wouldn't happen . i'm thinking filing some cross-wise grooves improve grip	1

this mug combines best elements thermos more traditional travel mug . when sealed , it not leak carried like thermos keeps my coffee hot until i'm ready drink it . use it mug easy pushing button top drinking . it doesn't handle , which i find annoying mug . it proportioned well terms dimension , its appearance compact . i've it few weeks , so i don't know how hardy it . most new items include plastic , it slightly creepy smell makes you wonder what exactly entering your body , but smell now dissipated	1

bodum tea infuser wonderful item ! whether you making cup tea or pot tea , infuser easy use , easy clean-up . one big downside company selling infuser not include lid - - it missing shipment . spite this deficiency , infuser itself works great - - since i seldom let my tea sit very long after making cup , lid not essential .. although it would nice view paid it . i find this infuser much better than those " tea eggs " filled , then screwed shut , opened same way dump out after use . carefully crafted stainless steel also sure last years regular use	1

i calibrated outside sensor using supplied probe container ice water . it appeared accurate within degree . default channel 1 interfered cordless phones ; resetting it channel 3 solved problem . if you need full complement remote sensors , this might become serious issue , depending what other equipment you . main unit hangs single screw . it requires use buttons its top look high low temperature records , reset them , switch remote sensors . pressing these buttons tends make unit rotate around screw ; i not yet figured out how solve this problem , unit come down replace batteries	1

while i loved features this timer , especially ability run multiple countdowns once ( i bake lot varying baking times require concurrent timers prevent errors ) , my unit started freezing ( apparently common problem this model ) after 6 months use . buttons indeed flimsy pressing them little hard often would cause unit reset itself , losing any all countdowns already progress . this unit not inexpensive ... i'd rather separate ' single ' timers next time , especially model not know freezing up . i dot not recommend this time	1

purchased these over month ago so far i am very pleased them . although they smaller rooms , two work really well when placed strategically house . money , i don't think you'll find much better . not real impressed ones came them vehicle - course they free ( if there such thing ) , so won't complain . wouldn't buy them separately	1

this board beautiful , perfect size next my sink , so far worn really well . it functions not only cutting board but staging area dishes after eating . i treated it mineral oil when i got it , which brought out grain even more . i highly recommend this one	1
i read lot reviews before i bought this most them weren't very good . i took chance bought it anyway because it easiest brand find store . my oven broken so i needed one these right away . i don't see what problem actually i love this crock pot . i didn't any problems it leaking or lid not fitting . heat seemed appropriate setting . maybe i got lucky ? price , i think this crock pot perfect . i wish they made this size programmable . i'm not really sure why they don't . would my only complaint but i still give it 5 stars because i got what i bought i'm very happy it	1

we received this microwave wedding present , it really good microwave . toasting function handy seemed work well . it bit small inside , but ok since it just my husband now . now we've it 2 years , it starting spark while it running i am scared it going start fire my kitchen ! i know others this problem , i'm actually shocked sharp not recalled this item because it really poses fire hazard . so here what i think : great , but doesn't work long term . price , you would expect keep it longer than 2 years . oh , if you decide cook popcorn , sure take out turntable try cook it bowl or plate . long bag not touch top or sides , it shouldn't burn . i much more success it since i started doing	1
i really like this product , especially affordable price . here positives negatives i've experienced ... pros : 1 . boils water fast it quiet too . perfect office . 2 . great safety features . you really want cordless unit easier/safer filling pouring , auto-shutoff on/off indicator light work exactly described . also , spout mesh shield plastic guard prevent water splashing out while boiling . overall , no need worry accidents . 3 . plastic view-window volume markings both sides unit , so you see water level any angle . 4 . convenient storage : relatively small footprint , cord wrap base , minimize counter clutter . cons : 1 . it takes 2 cups water cover heating element , which less convenient if you just want cup tea . 2 . cord only 3 feet long . fine kitchen counters , but less so if you're using your office wall outlets/power strips . 3 . lid mine sticks one side , so i push snap it into place ( might just mine though ) . overall i really like this kettle quality convenience . you find pricier ones , but money , this one all necessary features then some	1

excellent quality rich color . i tried it skillet , takes while heat up . . . i think this would best oven roasting or saute onions , followed stove-top roasting . very heavy , course , lid , too , heavy enough hold juicy steam . this large piece . you could prepare meal four . you want smart how much you move this around . hand trouble , i've learned use straight wrists carry it close me ( when cool , course ) . then i take water or food piece , cook serve it right off stove . . . cool down , " hug " it sink . i used smaller pieces similar brand smaller meals . care , this should serve you life-time .	1

i just got this iron yesterday linens things using their standard 20% coupon you find all time newspaper . i tried it out cotton shirt got job down five times faster than usual , less work , no wrinkles . shirt looked like i got it back cleaners . i also elna ironpress , which also saves time , but i think i prefer using rowenta steam iron since it steams material while you iron it , it get into more nooks crannies . note rowenta engineers -- it would nice if water tank level indicator let you know how much water it . this would help when you fill it so prevent overfilling . option would removable water tank you could take over sink fill . also , if this typical high quality rowenta product , why only one-year warranty ? why not five or ten years	1

we using this heater over month now , it powerful little heater . i wanted get ceramic heater because i read they safest space heaters you buy . this important because you here lot horror stories space heaters causing fires . heater three settings low , high auto(ranging 900-1500 watts electrical power ) . low setting heater puts out 900 watts . we usually use it auto where you set handy digital thermostat set temp . unit maintains temperature , you either set it unit or using handy included remote control . i surprised see how well this unit heats 220 square foot space . i would recommend this unit confidence , my only issue unit not expect it save you money over other space heaters i.e. oil filled electric radiators . my electric bill seems gone up using this heater over previous oil filled electric unit same manufacturer . i say , this unit heat room much better then previous unit , largely due fan dispersing heat	1

i love these dishes ! proportions , color vibrance , surface wearability chip-resistance can't beat price ! i suggest buying few colors mix match , these dishes come so many great colors ! if you're considering lesser-priced set ( i ) , spend little bit more , extra quality classic style definitely worth it	1
not really , unless you add up what i would paid all coffee i made it , starbuck prices . but it more than paid it'self many , many times over . sure , it small , but people who complain it too small should realized they talking euro sizes , those darn europeans drink out some really tiny cups . microscopic , actually . i carry it me everywhere i go , it perfect size . i lost count how many times i used it , least ten million times ( not really ) . i love little rubber boot , which apparantely not microwaveable according one unfortunate reviewer , comes off so i sit it directly burner bunn coffee maker quick access hot water work . i also love secondary filter lid , once you get your technique down you never grounds your coffee again . this something cannot said other , more expensive brands french press . it well worth money i paid it . i say already ?? hell , price you should buy two case you manage break one , although they tough nails . i guess you could break it , nothing indestructible someone who puts their mind it	1

beriner not perfect mandoline but it more useful , more tasks than large french mandoline i also . it light , easily transportable used more professional kitchen stations than larger metal version . you throw out finger guard moment you get it . like any other tool it requires care . dish towel better finger guard you get bitter end carrot or zuchini . one drawback it not cut thicker than 1/8 inch . you could not push celery root through it or even tough carrot long way(you , but it requires poise ) still it only 30 bucks it lasts forever . outside dense root vegetables , it great . one my favortie tools , my vita prep , cryovac machine immersion circulator	1

this set all quality good looks i expected . there only one problem-it big ! 11quot ; plates so tall my dishwasher they only fit center my kitchenaid dishwasher , so i can't wash more than 4 once , bowls don't slide prongs , but kind lean over , so they take up extra space . i got rio set partly because 16 oz . mugs ( my husband serious coffee drinker ! ) . i love design , but plates bowls really way bigger than any person normal-size appetite needs	1

i've using this machine good month now , i'm very happy it . while i'm no stranger espresso , spent many dollars my local coffee houses , this my first home espresso machine . it only took me few attempts get decent espresso , not much more get hang steaming / frothing milk ( not sure frother attachment , it ok , but i'm sure purists would tell me replace wand high end one ) . if you want real espresso , you can't find better starter machine . most cheaper models " steam " machines , resulting strong coffee reminds you espresso , but not real espresso . this one solidly built , brass grouphead portafilter , strong pump . boiler aluminum , but this advantage it heats fairly quickly . i usually turn it before i take shower , it nicely heated up when i return . if you don't like waiting , after 5 minutes you pull couple blank shots through , which should ensure everything heated well enough make espress o.o ne safety comment , very careful metal drip tray when cleaning it . when unpacking my machine there lot adhesive goo drip tray so i went sink scrub it off . it turns out , edges tray rather sharp i cut my finger it . since then i've bit more careful it haven't any issues , but normally all it takes quick rinse tray plastic tub underneath it get it fairly clean	1
price am not too surprised quirkiness this machine . others mentioned , there tendency it push out lot water one time not great job sucking it back up . this said , however , i've developed few tricks minimize these issues . 1)getting right angle handle takes while but once i get into groove , i find holding handle certain angles helps suction problem . 2 ) if lot water comes out once then i just push around instead trying keep just one small part my floor wet one time . it clean water tank so i don't feel like i'm just pushing around dirty water . then handle trick i'm able suction up water over larger area fairly quick clip . 3 ) if i don't patience or time dealing larger than desired volume water i just fill clean water tank half way get go this seems prevent problem . 4 ) i use murphy oil soap my wood floors . here , trick use fraction amount required bissell recommended cleaner . i use maybe quarter amount if i'm using murphy full tank water . i'll use even smaller amount if i'm using less than full tank water . not use too much murphy's; it oil soap too much causes dirty water tank fill overflow bubbles ( yes , i've learned this experience ) . despite quirks , my wood floors look great after i use this machine price i'm not sure i could expect quirk-free machine . if i space i'd buy heavier duty more costly machine , but my 790 sq ft apartment mostly wood flooring this ok .	1

i received this unit first week november 2006 . valentines day it toast ( no pun intended ) . first it worked fine . i used it warm end our big living room near front door where it almost always cold . i set thermostat 3/4 maximum left it work . it also completely quiet advertised . then , sometime january , i noticed on/off knob turning brown near edges -- if discolored excessive heat . i turned it off investigate . then turned it again . nothing . unit dead . after repeatedly turning it off i noticed sparking underneath switch . after repeatedly spinning switch off/on it would finally come back would stay 2 or 3 days until it failed again . after 10 days this i unplugged it out fear my family safety . now it waits my garage until i take trip dump dispose it . what giant hassle 55 dollar heater ! don't doubt second honeywell counts people not wanting hassle returns . example electronic device made cheaply possible little or no regard quality or safety . it cold day you-know-what before i purchase anything else honeywell . i better find me quality heater soon so day never comes . -30-	-1
i bought this pressure cooker after much thought research i just gone through very bad experience investing expensive pressure cooker [ manttra 5-pc . stainless steel multi-cooker 8-qt ] then it just stopped working all because its whistle went bad after just 3 months !! it heavy bulky complicated unlike presto ! so i simply looking light hassle free cooker which also didn't cost much . i finally found it presto ! its light weight , very roomy . i'm small sized girl [ 5'2 ] i personally needed something which not high narrow me comfortably cook it . presto not high or narrow all , its roomy giving me plenty comfort cooking ! its totally hassle free . i wash it dishwasher comes out just fine clean . don't over fill cooker i.e more than half cooker water which goes all pressure cookers otherwise it burst . also don't leave it unattended very high heat . instead try cook medium heat always . overall i love presto pressure cooker i bought i would recommend this others too . if you looking tension free light weight cooker , which also great bargain price , there it . its definitely worth more than money it costs	1

key keeping your beverage hot ( after you first make it hot , place it surface ) , lid coffee mug . i found coffee cups lids world market ( ala cost plus ) carlsbad , ca . kind chinese use formally , only 5 bucks . i think if someone starts making coffee mugs lids ( perhaps lid lifter like they use beer steins ) , it would sell well . my beverages stay way hot all day platform , long i'm using ceramic lid . thats key folks , use lid least heat stay it gets hotter liquid your cup gets lower . keeps my coworkers warmer , so hopefully less flu go around	1

i very head strong medium size dog who pulled endlessly leash , choking , making terrible nosies hurting my arm . i really don't know how train dogs either , but i love them . my vet wife suggested this leader it makes all difference world . i can't say my dog loves it ( he didn't like leash either ) , but he gets go out we fun result using it . he can't pull me , so my arm shoulder don't hurt he gets go out much more often , since it pleasure me instead fight chore . i don't know why " animal trainer " said this cruelty -- he doesn't seem suffer all -- he just doesn't get yank me around . if you don't take your dog out because he pulls , this answer you . so i give it 5 stars	1
this oven gets soooooo hot outside if anything touching it or near it it affected . especially careful cord itself ( slack ) not touching back it or you could electrical fire your hands . we phone cord touched back it melted itself it , luckily phone line shorted out whole system alerted us problem before fire broke out . also , since there no timer it easy forget something cooking . spend little more better insulation timer	-1
i bought this set glasses gift my boyfriend , who loves drink port . i thought glasses might disappointing after reading reviews posted here , but luckily it isn't case ! imho quality excellent , but not so delicate we're afraid use them . i like how they came set 6 , so accidently breaking one or two isn't so bad . my boyfriend loves them , even his fellow port drinkers impressed . maybe if you're wine expert highest rank , you right look down riedel vinum line port glasses , but i can't imagine glassware much nicer while so functional	1

we lot fun this fountain couple parties . it little noisy , but you won't notice it if it larger party . everyone loved it asked where i got it . i bought it bed bath beyond $40 using one their 20% off coupons come mail almost every week . i used semi-sweet chocolate chips ( tried nestle ghiradelli ) generic canola oil . i let fountain run 5 hours without problem . i noticed i add little extra oil when i first started get it flow smoothly . you also make sure it completely level . you make sure chocolate smooth before you put it otherwise it won't work . i overcooked some white chocolate chips when trying melt them . they wouldn't work . if there couple clumps still your chocolate after taking it out microwave , just continue stir until completely melted rather than keep putting it back microwave . that how i overcooked white chocolate . we used wooden skewer sticks many items . we tried marshmallows , oreos , nutter butters , dried apples chips , pretzels , fresh pineapple , kiwi , strawberries , peaches , marshiano cherries , piroette cookies , regular pringles . home we tried something fun - banana slices , strawberries cherries dipped fountain then used canned whipped cream - banana split . lots fun ! you really get creative	1
i got this replace oster blender whose motor burned out . i ordered it without consulting my wife . initially she not happy because this one doesn't all kinds buttons etc . it also extremely noisy , you hold onto it when using it or it migrate off counter , it heavy , takes up lot space , it pricey , it draw 12 amps ( don't put it same circuit microwave ! ) however , these drawbacks inconsequential if your principal concern product actually its job quickly efficiently . throw ingredients , put your hearing protectors , turn it , hold it down , after 30 seconds or less , you . i suppose pulse switch useful some situations but i yet need it . plastic jar also easier clean than our old one , which removable blades . my wife now believer even though she hates admit i right ! if you don't hearing protectors i strongly urge you order some this blender . i measured sound 92 db one foot away when making particularly thick smoothie	1

i've always curious this product , despite owning no longer manufactured bissell steam mop , when this went sale target , it magically jumped into my shopping cart . i 3 very active little children who like dump dish detergent floor then squeeze ketchup into mess . we two dogs cat , all which enjoy shedding amazing amounts hair . my house constant state chaos . anything enable me clean up sticky , gooey , dried bananas mountains pet hair more quickly ? i'm intrigued . we approximately 1800 hard flooring main level our home . some it tile , some it sealed bamboo ( like hard wood ) . all it quite regularly smeared yogurt . i own dyson which spoiled me other vacuums forever , so i highly skeptical vacuum feature this product . but i surprised . dry vac decent job . i tilt it back get it eat cheerios bits dry noodles , but it certainly picked up debris pet hair . it not get into corners up against cabinets furniture very well , but it fit under my cabinets which my dyson no t.t he vacuum quite noisy . encouraged dry vac results , i followed directions , mixed cleaner filled tank . i emptied canister collected dry stuff clicked over wet vac section . it just noisy , course . i started my laundry room . very short time i reached front my kitchen sink ( not even 1/8th way through my hard flooring ) , tank empty . well , that inconvenient . i refilled it wondering if i squeezing lever releases cleaning solution too frequently . i wondered if i could least get through rest my kitchen casual dining room ( all tile ) before reaching great room where bamboo flooring started this second tank . no go . i out water again time i hit dining room table . it took me three times long not even complete job normally takes me 30 minutes broom my bissel steam mop . hoover floormate least no effort push around , but i go quite slow , go over over over areas bissel could blow through seconds , since directions encourage you go over sections again ( without squeezing lever ) squeegie extra water up aid drying , it just took ridiculous amount time . it okay job cleaning , i guess . i think this product would ideal if you live home without ton hard flooring maybe without such active ( read : messy ) household mine . i'm thinking my mother would like this . overall : pros : - very easy push around , takes almost no effort . easy back . - okay job cleaning . not so great tough stuff like dried banana or apple sauce ( yay flung baby food ) . - low profile , fits under cabinets . - light weight . cons : - way noisy . wouldn't dare use this hallway while kids napping or asleep . - water tank too small or lever releases more solution than really necessary ? my bissell steam mop reservoir seems much smaller but i get entire main level tank half . - slow process . you go quite slowly get it clean really well . - no little side brushes like dyson so it misses crumbs pet hair up against wall or cabinetry . - obnoxious clean/empty reservoirs . maybe bissell ( i can't stop mentioning it ! bissell ! bissell ! ) spoiled me , but no extra solutions , no holding tanks clean . - my steam mop cleaned better , i finished job steam mop tired amount time it taking mixing expensive solution ( i realize others said i use other cleaning solutions ) .	1

my mom gave me this popper several years back ( i'm talking , several , when microwaves still novelty ) i still use it . i normally don't leave reviews , but i'm grad school now , without microwave oven , looking air popper saw some folks not given this popper love it deserves , so i must point out it beauty . let me start telling you i use zero oil , so concentrators , i bought two little bags ten ( they couple bucks each ) i've only ever used three them . long they're clean dry ( no oil ) you use them over over again . its bowl shape allows easy storage . pop concentrator disk out , dust it off , wash bowl dry it , store disk back bowl you even stack other bowls inside it . nice ! i also tell ya i hate plastics -- i won't drink plastic water bottles , i don't store my food plastic containers , etc , but this dry product , very little condensation lid make popcorn soggy . all , i find this thing absoluetly great ! it easy clean , lasts forever , if you get pack or two disks you'll probably never run out . ( i used one disk maybe 30 times)one downside : you need microwave that above 500 watts little dinky ones -- if you call your oven " medium " sized , then it work . i one those low low wattage ones it never could pop corn . worth every dime . healthy popcorn too -- no oil/fats/butter etc . takes 2:50 my oven -- there never old maid !	1

i went local bed bath beyond find silent or near silent humidifier . salesman introduced this air-o-swiss best machine market . he added venta-sonic same job but costs $50 less , all other brands can't compare . i bought both units compare . air-o-swiss clear winner , hands down . two machines sat side-by-side . it clear immediately everyone air-o-swiss quieter . even highest setting , air-o-swiss ' noise level frequency lower than venta-sonic , they blend nicely into background . they don't give me headaches venta-sonic . lower settings , air-o-swiss virtually silent . air-o-swiss , i slept very well . next night venta night . unfortunately , base machine noise just bad first unit i returned earlier noise problems . i tried go sleep it but after few hours , headaches agitation noise made me shut it off switch air-o-swiss slept through afterwards . i kept alternating units days nights observe results continued operation . after three days , venta-sonic unit began add strange squeeking noise . air-o-swiss gave consistent good near silent performance ... going strong still . just based noise-level alone , i return venta-sonic even though air-o-swiss costs $50 more . but extra costs further justified following : 1 . consistent performance - i put air-o-swiss automatic mode preset humidity level before i go sleep , when i wake up , my bedside humidity reader ( far away machine ) within 1% margin error preset desired level . venta-sonic however , i put it max settings , i get only around 32% sometimes other times anywhere below 50% . 2 . greater output capacity - my bedroom 300 square feet+ , half 600 both machines claim cover . air-o-swiss comfortably reaches my desired level ( b/w 40% 50%) lower settings ( it go high 75% , i only set it up 50%) . venta-sonic labors over 8 hours max settings gets me less humidity ! it won't get me above 50% . 3 . ease use digital control - i like air-o-swiss ' auto mode desired humidity setting . machine adjusts output automatically . venta-sonic only two dials , you'll experiment while find optimal settings . soon atmospheric humidity changes , which daily or few hours , you'd re-adjust again ... that like shooting darts dark all time , you get close if lucky but never target . 4 . better mist venting notch design - i put both machines 3-fee t-t all dresser . air-o-swiss ' notch tilted higher than venta . this means when operating cold mist , air-o-swiss disappears into air vs . some venta still hit floor - not enough form condensation but less efficient humidifying - perhaps contributes venta lower output previously mentioned . 5 . better craftsmanship - venta-sonic notch below air-o-swiss , appears made simpler cheaper . filter changes clean up similar . venta needs change filter cup . air-o-swiss needs filter cup once-a-year silver stick change . both fool proof . venta filters more expensive but air-o-swill extra silver stick . cost-wise it similar . i like air-o-swiss option replacing resins - just dump old resin filter cup put new packet you get new filter - this cuts cost almost 65% less trash environment . water tank design similar . both fills water upside down . i still prefer air-o-swiss because top more leveled , easier sit sink or bath tub than venta tilted top . when moving venta-sonic , water spilled base tank . i no problem air-o-swiss . anything air-o-swiss improve ? sure ! humidity reader machine adjusted 13% lower than actual average room humidity . they probably it ensure average humidity far away unit reaches target , but i think they so internally without show it . it would mistake read room humidity off machine . after i got machines , i googled both . there one review elsewhere saying venta-sonic broke after month half , out store 30-day warranty owner took loss . air-o-swiss 3 year warranty , if i remember correctly , venta 1 year . trouble i went through worth finding right humidifier me . hope this helps those similar concerns !	1

le creuset manufactures porcelain enameled cast iron cooking vessels well other products . le creuset casts these cooking vessels molten iron poured sand moulds used only once . this reason , one pot may look like , but each unique its own way . cast iron highly efficient material which absorbs distributes heat efficiently . it recommended cooking cast iron low medium heat . however , there exceptions like boiling water where cooking high heat appropriate okay . remove cast iron heat it not cool off quickly . this heat retention helps your food stay warm while serving . beware ; iron tends heavy so these cooking vessels . cast iron effective material cooking so why cover it enamel ? iron tends rust ; iron oxide ( rust ) doesn't add any complimentary flavors your food . if your cast iron cooking vessel not enameled , you would season maintain your cooking vessel . adding porcelain enamel not only looks good , but multiple benefits . enamel , solid coating , one most hygienic surfaces cook , not stain , absorb odors , retain flavors , easy clean . enamel damaged , so limit cooking tools plastic or wood . benefits cooking le creuset cast iron many , but lets get down buffet casserole specifically . buffet casseroles one most versatile pieces le creuset lineup . use this pan saut� pan , roasting pan , poaching , or shallow braiser . 3.5 quart capacity plenty space when it comes casseroles , so consider your recipes when determining size you need . buffet casserole tends best if least three quarters full . any less you may overwhelm your food evenly dispersed heat pot . large flat bottom curves up this pan resembles curved sided saute pan only thing missing would long handle . tight fitting lid mostly flat curved sides . this lid seals heat , moisture , flavors used hold your meat while you making sauce drippings . its shape design makes this extremely versatile pan . i tend use this pot basic dishes like smothered pork chops more than anything else . but once you get past basic functionality lends itself recipes such paella , frittatas , deep dish pizza , casseroles , you really open up possibilities . keep mind this 3.5 quart pan , feeding two out if it ridiculous unless you want leftovers . it probably perfect size family four most cases . try baking pineapple upside down cake or bread pudding when you need please many guests , poaching fish , or mac cheese . possibilities almost seem endless . one feature people tend complain cost . cost seem steep compared other pans made other materials . heck , cast iron doesn't seem like it should expensive when comparing old cast iron pan past generations used cornbread camping . however manufacturing process requires making mould each every pan produced . they then go through enameling process before shipping these heavy pans . if you take what goes into making distributing these high quality cast iron products , cost tends make sense . then consider this pan easily last lifetime when taken care . pros : extremely versatile efficient absorption distribution heat hygienic enamel cooking surface not stain , absorb odors , or retain flavors easy clean when not abused or misused transferred stove top oven table easily last lifetime cons : its heavy , cast iron tends weighing 12.25 pounds	1
. . . this glass , course , good tequila . resident mexico four years tequila obsessive , i tasted over 70 different tequilas ranging $5 $175 per bottle . riedel only glass allowed me fully smell , taste , enjoy tequila , only glass recognized consejo regulador de tequila , mexico fda tequila industry . my quest enjoy best tequilas lowest prices , i purchased cheaper wine flutes just every other glass i able find resembles riedel shape ; all , however , no avail : this glass singular construction unmatched tequila . unfortunately , these glasses not created equal : i owned 16 these glasses , , time time , i come across poorly finished glass -- unsightly stem seam , rough lip . moreover , this glass confounds all attempts describing color tequila . finally , these glasses not cheap , nor they very strong -- my two-year-old son i managed break twelve already . nevertheless , this , least moment , only way drink tequila . those search perfect tequila , i would like share some recommendations after spent thousands dollars my own search . but before i begin , i wish urge all tequila drinkers give serious consideration boycotting cuervo sauza . these u . . -owned megacompanies bought up huge amount agave mexico consequently inordinate influence production price agave , cuervo especially destructive . competition become very difficult other , less financially powerful producers , who going out business/selling off . depressing me cuervo recent acquisition don julio , whose 1942 among my favorite tequilas . before you buy these behemoths , consider what they mexican farmers , smaller tequila producers , ever-rising price tequila . now , few recommendations . keep mind price object me , i most my tasting mexico , so i not able try some very expensive tequilas or tequilas export only . also , note i not included tequilas impossible find u.s. no particular order , then , my recommendations : 1 . azulejos anejo ($90 per bottle ? difficult find , but worth searching out , this tequila among most flavorful best-balanced ( i.e. , agave oak ) anejos i tried . 2 . don julio 1942 anejo ($100 per bottle . okay , it owned cuervo now , it bit overpriced , its flavor strays agave , but exceptional complexity mind-blowing ) . 3 . el tesoro de don felipe anejo ( $36-40 , strikingly pure- full-flavored anejo , this tequila more readily available u.s. than mexico ) . 4 . chinaco reposado ( around $40 per bottle , solid , pure tequila , arguably better than over-the-top oaky anejo ; this tequila artesanal flavor ) . 5 . casa noble reposado ( i able buy this around $40-$50 mexico until , like increasing number tequilas , it apparently became available only export no longer mexico ; this tequila sells around $60 u.s. this tequila probably best nose any i've sniffed ; unfortunately , however , this tequila one those house flavors permeates every tequila its fabrica , la cofradia , makes , not everyone necessarily like ) . 6 . corazon anejo ( apparently export-only , selling u.s. anywhere $47-60 . this one better middle-priced tequilas , notable its balanced complex flavor , which edges out don felipe ) . n.b. perfidio back production . i bought bottle $120 mexico . some call this best tequila ever made , but i found it so carmelized , delicious it , it ceased seeming tequila . it , however , worth trying . enjoy	1

i'm using this unit my bedroom , which getting very dry some colder days this winter . it works very well . morning , before leaving work , i set fan low , humidistat 40 . when i get home , i raise humidistat 50 . when we go sleep , i turn it off . this because our bedroom very small even low , it bothers my wife . please note we both agree it very quiet low we able sleep it turned past . it could when it set humidistat , cycling fan ( off ) interrupts our sleep . days which not so cold , we don't run humidifier . while i personally don't notice variations humidity , my wife feels difference right away says air feels much better when it running hour or so . we've this unit little over one month it works like champ . water supply not 11 gallons i think -- would huge unit . but it plenty our usage . we fill every 2 3 days . buy extra filters protec pc-1 cartridges . there warm spell week half , during which we not use humidifier . it still winter , i not pack unit away or drain water . i checked filter before using it again found three pea-sized areas where mold just started . my opinion , this extremely good - i expect bath towels left this situation would entirely covered mold mildew . me , it means filter acts advertised -- microbial protection doing its job . since i extra filters , i decided replace old one anyway . paranoia set because we hadn't swept or mopped bedroom over three weeks because way air drawn into unit , i'm sure some dust near floor pulled caught filter . don't get me wrong - problem not design unit , problem we've negligent cleaning our bedroom . air drawn 6 7 inches above floor when assembled included caster wheels , which definitely high enough areas simply moderately clean . this unit meant much larger space ( our bedroom 12x12 ) it pump out lot moisture quickly quietly . all all , this excellent unit : high capacityvery quiethigh outputhumidistatinitial investment cost effectivereplaceable items inexpensiveblows moisture 270 degrees direction , not uni-directionallong electric cord	1

using frozen fruit make up 4 smoothies every day , our family hard blenders . after more than year daily experience waring pro ( both mbb * pbb * models ) i cannot recommend them serious smoothing making . here why : both glass- stainless-jug models use same blade assembly . this blade assembly wears poorly when asked blend frozen fruit . it fails often , must rebuilt or replaced . parts easily purchased if you're handy correct tools . details : assembly screws together , threaded tighten under use rather than loosen fall apart . but this tightening action so great when blade contacts frozen fruit , it bends metal washer below blade . assembly eventually becomes so tight shaft cannot turn . waring pro all blender than many people need , but not sufficient daily maker multiple smoothies	-1

( i change mine twice week just my cat comfort . ) it also good idea scoop out any " kitty remains " every other day or so . very certain not flush any " kitty presents " down toilet manufacturer warns against this . i suppose it could clog toilet pipes . moreover , you may suspect , any " kitty leftovers " could some nasty germs we don't want so wash your hands really carefully after you clean box or even after you just remove any " kitty presents " scooper . fact this clay litter helps because you use very inexpensive litter scooper remove any " kitty presents , " thus reducing number times you need change entire kitty litter box . nevertheless , i recommend changing entire litter box least once week . place contents used litter box into trash bag discard you would any other garbage . short , this great cat litter product great price . contents bag last long time , especially if , like me , you only one cat . manufacturer also offers customers ( us , not cats ) " awards " program points you accumulate your " account " company company internet website . nice plus ! ok , fresh step -- i thank you ; my father mother thank you ; , most importantly , my cat says thank you !!! smiles	1

this extra chime you purchase if you already receiver . i am purchasing one because it working so well . i am professional dog trainer , all i say product great , but owners who not know how teach something their dogs probably should call dog trainer help this if you unsure how proceed . professional dog trainer , i still live my family members who decidedly not dog trainers . our toy poodle essentially house-trained when i home , but because my teenagers husband oblivious her subtle signals she needed go out , she ended up peeing front door , because nobody letting her out . so , i got lentek door chime , taught my dog use it , now no more accidents because she signaling way everybody hear . we also put pad outside so she signal come back . everybody happy . now i'm getting pad upstairs , because we still oblivious teens hubby .... so , great product , but sure you * both * parts product , give good trainer call help you get started .	1

this my first time use electric krumkake baker i previously old type you use over stove . i feel baker doesn't bake evenly both sides ........ top krumkake cookie nice but bottom remains soggy side which leads me believe heat uneven . also there no indicator light let you know when cookie . therefore you really pay attention your time . usually it took only 55 seconds minute . also hard get two cookies commpletely round ..... batter ran into each other . perhaps my batter too runny but used this recipe before old iron without trouble . i'm point perhaps single baker would better than double . hope find person could demonstrate two cookie krumkake maker ...... perhaps would help . trying open-minded !	-1

we actually purchased 4 piece set ( unfortunately leaving review not option there . ) it indeed hardwood frame , beautiful suede-like microfiber cusions zip-off covers . color definitely more lines hot chocolate color rather than creamy chai color screen- but still blends beautifully into neutral palette . #60 ; br / #62 ; #60 ; br / #62 ; assembly bit challenging- you may need third or fourth hand . instructions certainly aren't complete enough- they more like general pictures , so there bit guesswork involved . upholstered side panels take bit quot ; elbow greasequot ; fit into frame properly . took us hour put together few o-o ver adjustments precision . #60 ; br / #62 ; #60 ; br / #62 ; i love back cushions velcro hold them place . cushions also surprizingly firm , but because seat longer than average legs , you tendancy lounge . i'm not sure what weight restrictions , but we 700 lbs couch it remained one piece ( can't say all couches we've ! ) overall very impressive package price ! we received free shipping used 10% off online coupon code so it great deal . i also highly suggest matching table set	1

i am firm believer use this stemware burgundies pinots distinction . but beware - this glass make lesser wines unravel seams . example , i recently discovered $15 oregon pinot i found quite pleasant . after sampling this wine bordeaux/cabernet wine glasses friend house , i found this wine quite nice decided buy several bottles . however , after trying it burgundy glass , which wider bowl which allows more aromas escape , well more narrow lip traps concentrates bouquet , wine smelled alcoholic , acidic , medicinal . moral story : use this your premier cru grand gru burgundies other well-crafted pinots , which infinite layers aroma complexity discover . avoid lesser burgundies pinots out this glass try them something more forgiving	1

2 these units screwed interior our shop door . each one holds 6 sets professional stripping crimping pliers . even dozen busy engineers opening closing this door all day long , our pliers stay just where we leave them until they're needed . i use one 20 " models my workbench : when i've stripped wire or crimped connector , i slap tool back onto magnet forget it . any given time , there 3-4 plier sets half-dozen screwdrivers perfectly poised use my hands . cosmetics not big factor this purchase , utility carried day . i say they looked pretty when i took them out box , but they've covered black multi-ply steel ever since .	1

i always standard flatware my everyday use , nothing too expensive but not cheapy stuff either . i no idea what i missing until i purchased this . this set not only unusual attractive but it really top quality which evident appearance heft/feel . it beautiful shine each piece sturdy heavy good balance which you notice immediately when you pick them up . odd shape no effect performance , fork stabs well , knife cuts well , actually , squared off spoons work well if not better than standard shaped spoon . i am so pleased i took plunge replaced my old silverware this ! one word warning , i purchased " chest " wooden tray both sets came reasonably busted up tray . i since glued it back place ( all dividers out place loose ) but this not great quality item isn't worth paying any extra if you thinking it bonus receive this . if you better not buying flatware without tray , so then go buy good tray somewhere if you still need one	1

these sheets indeed much more wrinkle resistant than my old 100% cotton 400-thread count ( very expensive ) sheets , but much thinner , surprisingly , suggesting more delicate threads . this fact borne out when less than month after starting use them , one my cats " kneaded " bed his claws , sheet irreparably shredded . this never happened before any sheets i owned 40 years multiple cat owning . sure , i've gotten thread pulls tiny little holes other sheets , but not knife-like cuts appeared these sheets , after just one kneading session . it really looked like someone taken pair scissors stabbed sheet repeatedly . despite high thread count , this cotton thin delicate . so beware if you pet-owner . you get what you pay these inexpensive sheets	-1

i used sell dishwashers sears . i've owned several built full sized dishwashers , even stainless steel bosch . this first one i am ' giddy ' over . i recently downsized move manhattan , which meant getting small kitchen no dishwasher . after months sink washing , i broke down bought this ( actually , house guest felt sorry me , got it me after i mentioned i buy it ) . but not without reading all specs reviews . i bought it etronics ( i've bought them before ) pleased customer service ( so far ) . they best price ( no delivery charge , they local store too ) . after unpacking inspection , i concluded it built same specs top line kenmore ( which i used sell ) . it form fitting stainless steel interior , mechanical controls ( which , imo , better than electronic machine gets wet alot ) , well fitting seals , stable casters . interior full size depth height , just 6 inches narrower width ( brand , which i viewed spot , not nearly deep , rickety trays ) . upper tray two height settings , but i found lower setting not suitable standard size dishes fit below . trays fit well , perhaps bit too snug , but we'll see if they loosen up use . tines spaced bit close together my taste , but after washing , it appears 1805 handle dishes so close together . there lower spray arm , middle spray arm top sprayer ( non-spinning ) . food filters heating element base sturdy well made . complaint : hose hook-up 6 feet long ( apparently measured inside back where they connect machine , they seemed too short 1805 must right up against sink counter hook-up . i've never portable before , ( exception my dear grandmother ) always looked down them . this one looks solid clean lines any kitchen . rear panel , however , you see few ( covered ) rivets seams , black-plastic lined hose receptable , serial tags . unless you store it against wall , you see these protrusions . it should fit all your other appliances without standing ou t.t he standard load time took 45 minutes run . machine attaches easily your faucet , though you replace your areator adapter produces narrower stream water faucet when dw not use . i've only used " economy " cycle , which worked great , but there also pots pans , delicate , rinse only cycles . additionally , delicate cycle no heat option , pots pans extra boost option . it heats water steaming hot . very quiet . though not quiet bosch i owned ( which i think quieter than meile ) , it quiet my kitchen aid . it definitely quieter than all plastic tub models out there . though hardly used , i experienced no leaks . this even operated non-level floor . my building 110 years old floors very slanted swelled . this my biggest concern . after each cycle , i took my flashlight looked underneath any signs water .... none . ( my neighbors below would not appreciate un-requested shower ) . i am penny-pincher , stressed over purchase . not because price , but because value price . i couldn't believe such inexpensive dishwasher could deliver like this one . i seriously say this dishwasher outperforms dishwashers twice its price . it carries in-home 1 year warranty , but i always like stores like sears where if you complain enough they take it back without any questions . so this bit leap , danby relies authorized service centers ( which i hope i never use )	1
i am very happy this product . it solid base i like it so easy adjust . i wish it dimming option .	1

i purchased both hencle pro sabatier grand chefs amazon . after two weeks using testing both sets knives , i decided return sabatiers keep pro . both sets good quality , even thought i notice scratches handles both sets . but i purchase knives use abuse , rather than hanging them decorations so minor scratches don't bother me too much . what matter me performance more importantly feel . i gotta say henckels just felt more solid me seemed sharper , cutting thru pretty much anything like butter . sabatiers other hand seemed little dull straight out box . factor i considered accessibility far warranties servicing concerned . i yet see any stores my area carry sabatiers lifetime warranty henckel i pretty much go my local retailer swap out any individual knives if needed . basically , i think it just comes down individual preference , mine happens henckle pro !!	1

this little toaster oven gets job me . i think quality little bit better , it little deeper making it little bigger tempeture more consistant than other units it price range . i am still looking right setting tempeture once i find it i most likely leave it there . i think it end up somewhere 350 400 . below takes long above setting food tends get little over cooked outside . one thing concerned me safety instructions , which i always read . they not want you use aluminum foil or any non proctor silex cooking trays this unit . i always use aluminum foil it not seem cause any problem . perhaps they just covering themselves case something goes wrong because you never know what sort crazy stuff people going put into their ovens . this only thing concerns me . otherwise little oven working out real good . i think it last us quite while . usually we get rid them because they get dirty or get little old looking more then it problem they wear out or break . last one cost us $10 lasted almost year . this one cost little more but i am sure it last longer . we expensive confection ovens cost well over $100 but i decided save my money because this one gets job what we need it . esp extra 2 inches depth this nice sized little unit .	1

i bought one these amazon 2 weeks ago , extra filters half what i would paid retail . first my boyfriend nixed fountain , it very loud . luckily , i remembered reviewer mentioned unit could noisy if water level low . once i filled it up almost rim , we could barely hear it . cats adore it , haven't sink or toilet ( well , maybe once or twice ! ) since we bought it . i give it 4 stars only because it rather difficult clean . it great deal really good product	1
one reviewer mentioned rust spots occurred . same thing happened us even though it just sits our kitchen . also , foot pedal broke it after 10 months . why bother paying all money if it just going break look awful ? you might well just get $15 one walmart - it last same amount time . closing machanism quiet however it easy remove bags	-1
other reviews go into details how easy this machine use how awesome shaved ice drinks , so i won't duplicate . but i say , pina colada connoisseur , this thing makes better drinks than most restaurants bars ! i am thrilled it ! i bought it big margarita party i throwing it quite conversation piece ! it certainly splurge , but so well made i know i using it years come .	1

3 quart saucepan great piece . lid perforated holes allow either steam excape , or when cooking pasta , elimination using colander . lip nice touch much appreciated larger saucepan , whose use extends beyond reduction sauces , gravies , hot beverages . good boil potatos pasta . probably deep enough use double boiler small amount melting , but not tried yet . coated withstand metal utensils , but it safer use silicone . easy clean up , but you must buy hard anodized cookware cleaner or expect stains . nice versatile sized item	1

this pretty much same review i wrote 8 " chef . i liked knife well enough i'm considering buying block set , though i don't know if handle design work well smaller knives . i'd give set five stars because it includes no knives too stupid or too specialized ( like boning knives bread knives slicers ) basic knife kit ( especially home cooks ) but inclusion laughably dubious kitchen scissors drags it down bit . 6 " chef probably marginally more useful than 6 " utility , but it nice least one knife you're willing hand your less skilled friends . set also includess diamond hone , which actually sharpen knives , not just align their edges ( though i use dmt diamond hone sharpening . ) here body other review . since i planning spend few days commercial kitchen , my 6 " henckels knives both embarrassingly small serious work embarrassingly dull because i'm too lame sharpen them , i decided grab 8 " chef knife ( bed , bath beyond , 20% off coupon . ) it worked extremely well all tasks i set it today , including mincing parsley chiffonading mint well usual cutting tasks . despite its shallow curve ( i strongly prefer knives whose edges mostly straight , rather than curved french style ) blade rocked very well mincing , flat enough cut completely through rolled mint leaves one short stroke . furthermore , sharpness impressed other people who used it , though we shall see if it resharpened same degree . handle design clearly not everyone , but i found it very comfortable when i held knife many cooks , back end blade pinched thumb forefinger(s ) . particular , most knife handles/bolsters seem designed people who grip knives solely their handles but integrated bolster made it feel * right * grip knife blade . handle * seems * just right weight balance blade , but i'll reserve judgment whether it actually well-balanced until i've spent more than few hours using it . i no idea if i'll continue like this knife it enters daily use . i hope amazon let me revise my rating later if it turns out overly optimistic , but based this one afternoon use ( since they force me rate it ) i gave 8 " chef five stars	1
simply put , awesome churn home-made ice cream . i old hand-crank i always used make best ice cream , but it lot work - churning fast beginning then slowing down cream transformed . this churn , motor variable its speed churns excellent fast speed begin ; then , cream solidifies freezes , motor changes pitch slows down give you wonderfully whipped smooth cream . i even made ice cream using just whole milk peppermint sticks it still turned out great . highly recommended much better than any other electric churn you buy . i've two other electric churns - neither them could hold candle white mountain	1

idea great , when this attractive mister worked , it excellent . however , it frequently emitted olive oil ( we never used it anything else ) thin stream instead mist . when happened , i tried clean spray valve no avail , then suddently it would mist again . pump mechanism ( manual ) somewhat difficult create adequate pressure , we suspect persons arthritic hands would not able use it . after somewhat satisfactory use five years , it failed completely . so maybe we get our money worth all things considered . am now looking better model replacement	-1

although it effective any similar heater , it some annoying design features . display only stays few seconds after changing setting . i don't know why it can't stay all time . like it isn't running batteries after all . its bright red pilot light stays long it plugged but there no indicators tell you if it , off , or thermostat . you would walk over it , bend down , attempt read dark display figure out ( you might need flashlight ) . they foolishly use same button start oscillation turn it off . turn it off you hold button down several seconds ( short tap starts it oscillating ) . fortunately i found quicker way turn it off . i just tip it enough engage tip-over safety switch it goes right off . much quicker than holding down stupid button . if you're not easily annoyed , you might like this heater	-1

others noted , outer case gets very hot . i decided take it apart understand why . removable stoneware sits inner aluminum pot surrounded outer metal case . pot case held together screw , spacer , washers , nuts through bottom pot . lip around top pot wraps around top edge case , 3 legs under pot contact bottom case . heating element wraps around bottom sides pot . handles temp control attached outer housing . there several metal-to-metal contact points pot outer housing . screw , legs pot , upper lip conduct heat pot outer housing . since base metal not insulated feet , i recommend placing unit heat-resistant surface away combustables , flammables , exposed skin when use . handles control knob feel sturdy , but time tell whether they crack heat . switch body also plastic mounted very close heating element . inner wiring wrapped insulated fabric sleeves , but they contact housing . 3ft power cord permanently attached unusually stiff . i form it into shape before plugging it , i don't coil it up uses . package i received amazon not include 200 page recipe book . there some recipes owner guide couple recipes box . 4-page slow cooker accessory catalog included showing cookbooks , travel bags , bread/cake bake pan , meat rack , dust cover , liner bags sale . update : outer case recalled manufacturer because several cases cracked handles . i cut plug off end cord return it . they sent me new case reimbursed me shipping	-1

i just purchased oster 6290 this week retail store new york city . it my first toaster oven . so far , i not any problems . i baked calamari scallops . i toasted hamburger buns . i broiled veggie burgers . these all come out well even though my own cooking skills mediocre . when doing my research sites such this one prior buying toaster oven , i noticed many models least one review said oven broke down reason within first three six months . i decided best way avoid this potential problem buy store gives one option buy peace mind via 1-2 year product replacement plan . 2 year plan oster 6290 cost additional $8.99 plus tax best buy . this my first toaster oven , i decided buy model $50-60 price range . i always buy one more bells whistles costs more down road if i find i enjoy toaster oven experience . also , buying product replacement plan insurance , there no need spend extra $50 $100 better-reviewed cuisinart or krups just make sure oven wouldn't fall apart after first few weeks	1

ok - negative reviews this pretty out there ; they either complaining non-existant issues ( um , 1 star someone who didn't even buy it ? becuase it supposedly doesn't come 110 ? that wacky ) , or wrong expectations what this machine . bottom line this espresso maker it guts their more expensive models ( minus 3 way solenoid , which no effect how espresso made ) if you know what you doing make espresso well pretty much any model out there . over-simplify , espresso makers come one 2 basic types portafilter ( that thing handle you put espresso grounds ) . pressurized or non-pressurized . former basically pulls same shots no matter what you , long your beans fresh your grinder good . latter requires bit more art science . tamp ( compacting grinds into portafilter ) critical , you vary way shot pulled different grind size , tamp preassure tamper type . this , while harder consistently , only way properly hunt elusive " god shot " . so - onto this machine : using " perfect crema " disc just silly , frankly . fact , i don't even think there one my box . i know what it , which basically convert traditional espresso maker into pressurized one . but hey , if that what you want then buy pressurized one one myriad manufacturers out there . however , if you want model let you explore your inner barista , you need buy non-pressurized portafilter unit . money , there no way you going get better deal than gaggia . fact , there number different models gaggia line , all which basically same until you get $500 one , which comes aforementioned 3 way solenoid . sure , there different designs , some changes type frother ( don't bother auto-frothers ) but guts same , right down brass portafilter . i chose this particular one because its water capacity size drip tray , which beleive it or not pretty big deal when you pull lot shots day , i . fact , this machine beauty . get good it you'll pull shots good any machine out there , if you total tweek-head , you even pid this bad boy ( look it up ... ) . but you want more ? go check out coffeegeeek dot com read read read . synopsis : want machine keep up your growing barista skills ? buy this now . don't care art , just want quick fast espresso ? go elsewhere pick pressurized portafilter unit . oh , either way you go , you need good grinder ( gaggia mdf rocks reasonably priced $200 ) , you want fresh beans - order online one many fresh roasters out there ; it makes incredible difference	1

i given this dish ( request ) my birthday it barely gotten rest since ! it works wonderfully pies tarts , but even better baked appetizer dishes or nachos . dish washes well dishwasher stacks nicely cabinets . i wish it little handles edges better gripping when it comes out oven ( it rim good hold onto , but clumsy chefs , something more might better ) . other than , i love this dish keep finding more more uses it	1
price , it amazing this steamer anything , which accounts all rave reviews . this little number not real powerful , so you don't get effortless , quick steamer results most us seek . steam output low , so you go over over garment , little improvement . forget using it linen . even thin cotton , it creates tiny spider wrinkles . you hold hose vertically prevent water spurting , which awkward dangerous , hose gets hot . you door near electrical outlet . then hook doesn't fit over thickness door , nor hose reach item hanging it . it much work ironing , but ironing , you eventually achieve desired result . steamer compact , heats quickly doesn't take up much room . i returned mine , but there may few people who like this steamer	-1
i bought this since it 14.4 i figured all stick vacs , it would best pickup , it . however , i've found you extremely proactive it work maximum effiency . previous reviewer stated she cleans " dust bin " after each use . you , plus i : 1 . clean disposable filter , one they sell replacements for2 . clean permanent filter . this one gets really dusty when it it really effects pickup . you just clean them shaking them out , but i've cleaned permanant filter my sink using dish brush . let it dry it good new :-) this kind care i no problem this my only upright vacuum 1100 sq ft house w/ 2 people 2 cats . i love cordless freedom , it makes it worth all this cleaning business !	1

global 10quot ; great knife comes very sharp edge . it rather light ( least 10quot ; knife ) well balanced . it well situated both slicing meats cutting dicing vegetables , it easy hold knife forward towards its blade quick balanced wrist action . only reason i gave this knife 4 stars not five due handle . while it dimpled it still get slippery when cutting fatty meat . i would prefer synthetic handle covering , but otherwise this well designed tool -- perhaps best chef knife available now	1

i bought this chocolate i tempered chocolate before using double boiler this seemed easier . when melting it says it melt up pound chocolate but you only supposed fill bowl certain line when it melts you third bowl chocolate not full bowl picture shows . it formed tiny lumps before it melted after it cooled 85 i poured into molds . it never set fully , most stuck molds others went crumbley . instructions you melt cool 85 only , nothing cooling then reheating 85 it says this site . i also melted some yogurt coating which worked fine other than fact you could only fill certain line although you could keep adding it melted . good kids maybe or just coatings but not temper real chocolate	-1

without purist , ( i'm wisconsin , after all ) , this very nice sashimi knife , considering price . those you who work sushi bars scoff , but this isn't $600 hocho either , not all us wish spend so much . no saya came my knife . after many sharpenings , back must leveled , very much like good japanese chisel , hollowed part comes closer edge , but this true all knives this type . money well burned , if you cut lot fish into tiny bits . it good many other things , gets lot use my house . btw - if you just fooling around or learning , get one $30 knives - they plenty good , , if you find you don't like using this type , you haven't blown bunch cash you could spent ahi or mahimahi . . .	1

i got this out frustration trying find places charge all our gadgets . we cords gadgets everywhere ! ( two pdas , two cell phones , ipod , bluetooth earpiece . ) this item helped us get organized tremedously . pros : nice sturdy wood velvet trim . door back holes each end you choose which side you want power strip cord come out . two extra slots door allow cords come through well . also comes two plug extenders allow you plug those chunky transformer-type chargers . cons : almost all my chargers those chunky transformer-type chargers , so i plug one charger into regular outlet run cord through slots . i could used probably 3 more those plug extenders b/c transformers cover up plugs power strip . maybe you find some electronic store solve this problem . it also little cumbersome set up , but long run it pays off everything hidden organized . i would highly recommend this product	1
i'm amalfi girl . i this pan it works great- most importantly , lid heavy enough weigh down sandwiches .

i've mine years it outshines every other decanter i've ever owned or used - performance well beauty table . most decanters fairly easy fill but very hard pour . guests often reluctant tip traditional , bell-bottomed decanter far enough pour it . before first trickle wine comes out , it feels like they're holding it upside down dump it all over table . traditional decanters also require some strength lift high enough twist far enough begin pouring , especially when reaching across table . i've often seen people start , put down decanter stand up get safer grip . this awkward say leas t.t he " duck " much better every count . long handle balances perfectly hand ; pouring minimum effort still stable enough pass down dining table confidence . low , elongated body decanter doesn't picked up nearly far off table or tipped nearly so dramatically fill glass . size handle makes reaching , pouring passing simple matter . notes wine purists : unlike traditional shape , you'll never need funnel fill " duck " without splashing . surface area wine duck easily comparable best traditional decanters , giving big young wines enough oxygen soften nicely table . long neck just enough " edge " bottom trap sediments . long spout allows you spot any trace sediment well before it reaches glass , gentle slope lets you pull back softly without inducing turbulence stirs sediment back into remaining wine - helping salvage final half-glass . pour control simply unmatched . crystal hand-blown sparkles like fine stemware , shape looks much more elegant table than photo any web page possibly convey . spend money . it worth every cent	1

pros : professional smoothies ( exactly like jamba juice)very easy cleanpolycarbonate carafequick ( its business very quickly)cons : expensive ( not everyone spends $400 blender)loud ( not appropriate apartment living)bulky ( its significantly larger than normal blender)when i unpacked this blender i knew right away it very serious machine . base very large heavy duty two large switches . one pulse other high low speeds . engine rated 3 horsepower power cord very think similar cord used high power drill or garage tool . unit itself geared metal socket matches toothed metal gear built into carafe . no plastic clutch break . lightweight polycarbonate carafe sits four posts , but need you hold it down your hand top it work correctly . blade four prong item splayed out broad flat blade each tooth . idea here super sharp blade isint necessary this thing spins very very fast . i quite startled when i hit pulse . this thing spins up instantly very loud . i would almost say twice loud conventional blender . said it also very high speed pulverizes frozen items impunity . i put frozen strawberries this pulverized them so well seeds not evident . ice doesn't stand chance all . this device appears more powerful than pro blenders used local smoothie place or gym . it every bit professional i would challenge anyone break this ice or other items short metal carafe . cleanup snap everything plastic or rubber . gunk under blades also not issue you just fill carafe some water quick half second pulse cleans everything base . i would caution people while this may last blender you ever buy , it not really consumer appliance . this machine much common standard blender chainsaw hair clipper . i really like it but my neighbors hate it . five stars because it lamborghini blenders smoothies amazing . but like exotic car , it not everyone .	1

i just got mine mail other day . little research word-of-mouth told me it made great coffee , guess what ? it ! first pot we brewed ( after running some plain water through it once ) best pot drip coffee i've ever made home . we took pot out soon it stopped brewing suggested other reviwes . coffee just little too hot drink black immediately stayed warm fresh 3 or 4 hours . we also able pour full caraf without spilling anything . we tried automatic timer , it worked flawlessly . smell coffee woke me up before alarm . one important note : if you concerned some reviews where people said caraf broke , don't worry . if you get " stainless " version ( select " stainless " color ) it comes all-stainless-unbreakable caraf no glass liner . it few dollars more , but it very nice unit . we ordered it amazon thru " finejewelry_4u " they included free gold filter helped offset extra cost . couple minor notes : threaded cap caraf takes bit getting used if you unsteady hands . unit also taller than your average coffee pot ( or least our previous pot ) , so we pull it out under our cabinet pour water . otherwise , no complaints here , thus far .	1

i've using tefal ' maxifry ' dry fryer some time but it two ' problems ' prompted me look alternative : it difficult clean lowest temperature setting 302�f . i like blanch potato fries low temperature before i crisp them up high temperature - purely matter personal taste . this not possible tefal it could not set lower temperatures . after reading various product descriptions reviews it quickly became apparent waring apparently best products - albeit cost . i looked df200 df250 but nowhere could i find explanation differences them so i opted df250 it only one mentioned waring website so i assumed it would later model . price i paid ( 6 times what i paid tefal ) my expectations high - it seemed what i looking : easy clean dishwasher operation down 175�f . unfortunately i disappointed this product following reasons : 1 . amazon clearly states their website df 250 food capacity 3.75 pounds ( it even says this image below box i'm typing ) but waring packing manual lists this only 2.2 pounds - significantly less than advertised . 2 . i sold idea immersion heater heat oil i thought this would more efficient than external heater . unfortunately because this heater occupies so much space inside oil vat , twice much oil required , thus this potential benefit immersion heater lost . it also means cost replacing oil effectively doubled . 3 . temperature control awful seems swing over 50�f range - one moment food cooking too fast next it seems cold . i've seen it turn off 45 minutes once it reached temperature ! i don't know if it really designed this way or there fault thermostat this unit . effect , i'm back manual control ( flicking switch off ) i use tefal maintain temperature 260�f . 4 . basket handle sticks out unit ( out counter top ) so it would very easy catch this someone walked . i would very concerned young children around this unit when oil 375�f . ihe tefal nice safe fold-away handle . 5 . next issue may seem bit trivial but it annoyed me . large lid df250 removable . fact it needs removed order practice safe cooking techniques ( like slowly immersing fries into hot oil ) . so where should very hot big lid safely put down ? you need some extra space around this unit operate it something put lid not damaged hot metal . tefal , lid hinged up . stated above , unit cook food nicely - it shame i stand guard over it continually adjust it while use . this price i expected better . my old tefal looks good comparison .	-1

professional like sharpening home good price . i love this sharpener trust it performance good knives . magnetic guides make sure you sharpen knife correctly so go ahead , run your expensive knives through it ; it great job	1
i thrilled when i first began use this project - it very sharp very strong , crunching through small bones ease . however , safety lock bad place - it small easily engaged , quite few occasions now , mere action cutting - when lock gets sideswiped chicken itself - engage lock , then i manually open it up again . it extremely irritating - i would call it major design flaw . if it weren't lock , i'd reccomend these shears anyone - but i'd hesitate recommend them now . i deal them , i'm sure there way learn live them well ( after all , they cut beautifully , so long you avoid activating lock ) - but i don't feel there should need " break-in " period new pair poultry shears	-1

i purchased this set my mother who falls drops things regularly due disability . i wanted dish set her would difficult break . so far , these held up well . fact , they're deceptively durable , they look nice . however , complain ( i like complain ) , i would say this dishware too costly . i've recently seen ads similar dishware more reasonably priced . these also too light my mother taste . they slide around her table very easily ( though it nothing place-mat can't fix ) . oh yeah , they took long time delivered	1
i bought this because it looked great , but it turns out it very functional also . it looks great counter since it stainless steel , it quite heavy there no danger tipping . i worried lids weren't tight enough because they just pop , but i cereal it over month still fresh . bigger cereals come out little more difficulty then smaller cereals , but they don't come out crushed . bins big enough so entire box cereal fits it once . mine didn't smell bad like some reviewers said after putting couple pieces together it ready go	1
i , like few others , am shocked good reviews some folks given this machine - if they pets , they obviously light carpet can't see pet hair this machine doesn't pick up . i two large dogs ( german shepherd shepherd mix ) house . we dark green carpet throughout our living room , dining room , stairs , light carpet other areas our home . we previously bought inexpensive eureka boss machines worked great year , but because we vacuum least hour day , we replacing vacuums every 1-2 years . i bought this machine few months ago extremely unhappy it ( threw box away could not return it store or it would gone ! ) . i spend least 2-3 times longer vacuuming , trying get hair out our dark green carpet . you can't really see it light carpet their always lot hair dirt canister , so it seems work just fine . attachments real pain use , so much so i don't even bother any more . i only wish i gone consumer reports first , they also not rate this machine very well , especially picking up pet hair . buyer beware !! ( ... or least keep box try it out first , so you return it !! )	-1
i received this machine christmas because my wife knows i usually get one cup coffee middle day work . this machine easy use works great . it works using home cafe pods well , but i tried melitta java pods , i got brown water . melitta pods state they designed exclusively use " one : one coffee maker " you get most coffee flavors using home cafe pods though . pods may not most cost effective way make coffee , but it sure easy	1

i owned overgrown set these knives 4 years now waited until i significant use comparison write this review . i also own similar knives wusthof classic compare directly . this review copied other henckels international classic reviews i wrote modified slightly particular item reviewed although i left comments other knives . disclaimer : i enjoy sharpening knives so edge retention rarely issue me i probably sharpen even my best knives too much . besides stone sharpening every 6 months or so , i also steel my knives just every time i use them . bottome line : i really love this set knives ( although i got one dud bunch ; only reason i am not giving this line 5 rating ) . edges almost if not just good more expensive knives but finish lacking ( although only somewhat ) . relatively great value . i not feel like these knives very sharp out box but they take scary edge quite easily keep it long time ( many , many months regular steeling home use ) . 8 inch chef : this very nice knife if you get over fact finish not nice higher end stuff . this i mean edges handle bolster sharper than they my wusthof classic . it takes holds edge well . i also own wusthof 8 inch chefs knife feel like this one takes just sharp edge . i yet determine difference edge retention two lines , so means they least comparible . much i thought i would enamored wusthof , i really don't believe additional cost worth small amount performance gain you might get buying wusthof . truth , i still enjoy using henckels international chef knife just much wusthof . heft wonderful curvature blade ideal chopping . i really like how point taperd very thin blade . finish aside , this right up there best them allows user slice point quite effectively . 6 inch chef : my wife swears this knife it consistantly one sharpest we own . some reason ( perhaps thinner blade ) , it holds its edge like sharp little devil it . this knife true pleasure own use . it very effective feels wonderful my hand . i may becoming knife snob , but i see no reason buy any other 6 inch chef knife , all you would getting fancier name smoother edges handle bolster . we reach this one multiple times each day it retains its edge far better than expected price . 4 inch parer : i don't like this one much my wusthof parers but my wife likes it much better . it always one she reaches ( many times per day ) . i personaly prefer thinness flexibility wusthof parer blades . this one quite rigid although it very sharp , it not seem sharp thinner wusthof parers , nor it hold its edge long . other hand , its size perfect parer , coming sweet spot 3.5 inch wusthof 4.5 inch wusthof parers i compare it . i would love own 4 inch wusthof parer . aditionally , diminished depth blade probably preferable deeper wusthof parer blades tasks such peeling toward you . i bought one these my mother it good test edge retention she rarely sharpens never steels . [ ... ] . 6 inch utility : i not use this knife much . it seems quite redundant my 4.5 inch wusthof parer ( which also not see much use ) or my favorite boning knife ( beat up resurected chicago cutlery 5 inch utility scary sharp joy use ) . truth , almost every task my kitchen quite well either parer or chef knife . i really don't see much use 6 inch utility . said , this knife sharp pleasureable use . still , this one , i would prefer thinner perhaps more flexible blade . it quite rigid makes me not want use it much . sandwiches , cheese , tomatoes , etc . it quite appropriate , but i would still probably prefer my 6 inch or even 8 inch chefs knives such tasks they thinner edge therefore seem much sharper . bread knife : aside fact this would benefit longer blade , this effective any other we tried . you don't bread knife this nice , but this one certainly job well . boning knife : i honestly never used this knife more than trial basis . it just not stack up my older chicago cutlery boning/utility knife . you can't really compare two , however , since one very flexible thin(cc ) other very rigid thick(hic ) . i strongly prefer thin , flexible boning knife . finish this knife horrible my particular set . it rounded ( not supposed ) end blade not sharpened point , leaving rounded blunt tip ( exactly opposite what you want good boning knife ) . i never able get point where i want it . i am certain i just lemon try return it if possible . so overall , i love these knives . myself my wife , they get just much use my wusthof classics . unless finish critical you or you like other people know you spent lot money , your pocketbook favor . i think these knives just good much less money	1
i bought set these glasses . i happy thick bottoms thought they would good sturdy glasses . they not last year . bottoms never broke , but they all cracked top . i would not recommend these if you children or teens aren't careful placing glasses sink or dishwasher .	-1
best part this fryer it ease cleanup oil easilly drained , pan holds oil comes out . also element disconnects so you really clean this thing . unit not turn if heating element isn't attached properly which nice safety feature . outside doesn't get hot i thought it would though i'm sure you could still burn yourself if you touched it any long period time .	1

if you like product light weight , sturdy aesthetically pleasing , then this measuring cup you . difference use this item normal pyrex quite pronounced ; it pours better , handles better because it so lightweight . you also won't spill things readily , because there enough'slosh'room allowed after you fill it top , 1/4 cup . just don't bang it around , it won't take much abuse pyrex , but small price pay	1
i feed my cat small amount dry food twice day . this only automatic feeder allows you control portion ( least small amounts ) reasonable capacity ( 6 holes ) . this second one these i've purchased ( amazon price ($40-50 or so ) significantly less than first one i bought ($60-70 ) , i got first one cheapest price available -- time it wasn't offered amazon ) . anyway , i bought second one so we could leave cat home alone longer 3 max days time . second feeder allows us go out town few days longer peace mind he'll continue fed properly time.it easy use , easy clean , relatively solid construction . my cat tried figure out ways trick it open , so far it hasn't happened ( unless it low batteries -- see below ) . although this best auto feeder market moment , there some things would improve it greatly . we've using original feeder couple years now , but motor/middle section doesn't seem reliable mechanism i wouldn't surprised if it up died one day . same time , it going almost every day past 2 years pretty reliable . we remove button advancing feeder couple months , since it got stuck top turning continuously . now we just use pen or stick finger into hole press button . not big deal , but little ghetto.it drains batteries little quicker than i'd prefer , but it not terrible . when battery running low , it malfunctions different ways . sometimes it'll only turn halfway . other times it'll turn partially then reverse itself -- these instances my poor cat couldn't access his meal . other times , it'll turn when it not supposed -- these instances my cat got more food than he supposed quite happy . also , clear plastic flap covering middle controls broken off -- part my cat attempts trick system . again , just superficial thing since it hasn't affected functioning so far . digital control more options low-battery indicator would improve this feeder greatly . ultimate feeder would like petmate le bistro feeder but could dispense small amounts not allow pets figure out how pull out food themselves . my cat would figure one out so quick probably get so fat . so this feeder still much better than anything out there moment . i would still recommend it	1
it soft medium-sized . didn't pay too much them so didn't feel too bad when friends would come over ask if they could take one . now i don't any left , but they're interseting little soft " stuffed animal " kind thing . no real practical purpose probably - i heard it horror if it ever opens/spills its contents . it kind funny - thing itself soft - but it comes huge box tons air pillows ( when you order it amazon least ) . so if you're moving need packing material , then here 2-for-1 special .	1
this set wonderful it includes everything you really need cutlery set . most commercial stamped sets include upwards twenty knives , but you'll end up using five or six regular basis . quality these forged blades stunning edges razor sharp . proper honing , using steel included set , these blades keep their edge over year daily use . i would recommend finding local bladesmith edge sharpened professionally . it isn't expensive maximize performance . handle itself comfortable balance feels natural . although manufacturer says these dishwasher safe , i would suggest immediate hand washing after use complete drying before returning it block .	1

" bristles " this brush pretty odd ; they're wide flat made silicone . they really don't look very effective , yet they're surprisingly useful . they trap liquids them quite well . this means more what you're brushing onto your food goes onto your food instead dripping all over place . better than , you won't any more bristles getting shed into your food . i'd almost given up traditional pastry brushes because phenomenon . you also fit this brush into your dishwasher , which means--gasp!--it'll come clean ! normal pastry brushes such total pain clean this alone makes this brush worth i t.t he handle -- which screws apart head -- ergonomically shaped pliable , making it easy hands . it also hollow , allowing you fill it basting liquid ( or other liquid you want brush onto something , such melted butter pastry ) , dripless valve head helps keep basting liquid coming out when you don't want it . since brush handle translucent you even see how much basting liquid you lef t.t hen there brush stand . normally when using pastry brush i lie it flat paper towel or plate or prop it awkwardly against something . cuisipro brush you just tuck it vertically into its stand . it nice , flat base keep it upright , it contains any mess , leaving you only stand wash -- which just go into dishwasher rest brush parts . brush separates into three parts -- handle , head stand -- washing . it would pretty tough wash thoroughly hand , so it really helps able put it through dishwasher . you should tuck it into utensil cage or something similar , however , because head small potentially easy lose . all all , i no reservations recommending this pastry brush , expect get much use out mine	1
if you're looking inexpesive racking large capacity cellar you're creating , this it . if you're looking decorative rack your dining room , look elsewhere . think this more kit than rack . $65 i paid it , if they only included 2 plastic coated steel grids it would well worth money . you use these few extra pieces wood make almost any kind rack you imagine . you use it upright ( 66 " tall ) or sideways ( 29 " tall ) , or good pair bolt cutters , you cut through 1/4 " rods make fit odd sized or shaped areas . again , price you aren't losing much if you throw away few pieces . it comes backets mount it up against wall , if you take approach , wall necessary becomes part rack . brackets place grids 5.5 " apart which designed support straight barrel part bottle . plastic coating racks makes them very slippery when contact glass bottles , so if front rear grids level , vibration over time might cause bottles fall out . becuase this , brackets designed hold front grid 1/4 " higher than rear grid . this means bottles slide back where wall stop them . that why wall important ! i put my rack basement where i didn't wall mount it . so i built couple wooden ends it few wood braces middle keep grids correct distance . i also placed grids 7 " apart instead 5.5 " brackets dictated , front grid same height rear grid . this allowed me store bottles bottom main barrel resting rear grid neck resting front grid . this position , part bottle hangs below grid wires so it can't slide forward or backward . it also places bottles slightly cork-down which some may argue better or worse than level or slightly cork up . i used pressure treated wood stailess steel deck screws stand up years humid cellar . i used nylon 1/4 " cable clamps attach grids wooden ends . i just cut some 1/4 " slots 7 " apart few pieces wood support middle keep grids right distance . any case , its great rack you make into just anything few pieces wood couple hours work . it won't hold larger bottles previous reviewer mentioned , but i plan just get smaller rack hold few bottles won't fit this one . it hard better this price	1

like much le creuset line , these dishwasher safe round silicone hot pads multiple uses . covered ridges they make excellent trivets resting hot pots pans while allowing air flow . ridges also make these perfect set eggs so they don't roll off counter . they firm enough use fan when little air movement would come handy . combined ridges , they flexible enough opening jars bending/gripping around medium large handles . only drawback they don't work well smaller sized handles . this makes using these pads other le creuset product like pate terrine or au gratins pretty much useless when it comes grabbing moving them . pros : useful versatile sturdy heat resistant dishwasher safe cons : cannot effectively grab smaller sized handle	1

over years , my wife i tried all sorts cookware . we good set calphalon stainless-steel cookware , but we've never mastered art cooking sticky dishes such eggs without non-stick pan . we've tried every type non-stick pan we've encountered . some non-stick short time only before surface gets mucked up . our best teflon pans , such those calphalon , seem remain non-stick very long time careful cleaning , but recently we've learned when heated , teflon ( pfoa ) cookware outgases chemicals definitely not good you . ( advisory committee recommended epa classify pfoa possible carcinogen . ) swiss diamond pfoa-free fantastically non-stick . we've used our two skillets extensively cook eggs brown meat , they look work like new . nothing sticks . omelets easy prepare . cleanup breeze . lids vents opened or closed , useful feature . manufacturer says you use metal utensils , but we've stuck plastic , so i can't say how they'll hold up contact metal . i can't recommend swiss diamond cookware too highly . it stuff i've looking decades	1
