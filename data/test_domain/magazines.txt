friend mine got me subscription this magazine because i like cooks illustrated . this magazine nothing but ads snazzy expensive foods restaurants . there so few recipies it i wouldn't call it ' cooking ' magazine . what few recipies they don't explain why they chose ingredients used or give much detail all . if you consider yourself ' foodie ' who likes go fancy restaurants likes know what hip latest gourmet food wine , then this magazine might you . if , however , you like cook know what you doing why you doing it , try cooks illustrated instead .	-1
child i remember finding this magazine my doctor office reading it because it only thing available . it not changed much . there no redeeming features make up dated patronizing content . this magazine neither stretch your child mind nor keep him entertained . it only teaches child what he already knows feeds him what he already seen . coming era global connection , children must become aware other parts world lifestyles alien them . only telling them what already common their everyday lives helps foster racism xenophobia	-1
i reading this magazine work , i consider it trashy magazine . it only focuses sexual part women , like if sex best thing world , because they this article which girl riding taxi , she thought taxi guy fine , so she unbutton her shirt told taxi guy touch her breasts . then she says it * best experience she ever . i just cant believe they publish garbage like , giving message women its ok undress yourself total stranger , who you dont even know . i prefer read things focus more inner heart , emotional , spiritual side things . read books help me better person right now future , throw away garbage this society	-1

i am utterly disappointed direction gamepro taken over past two years . i actually stopped my subscription 1 year , but came back 20 issues $10 their ( 10 ? ) year anniversary . i forget . but magazine really bad . one thing i laugh , retro corner . they info issues 5 10 years before , they always announce number pages 10 years ago . i think most recent issue , they said : 140 pages ? huh ? i think my last issue around 100 . don't try tell me they've lost 40 pages advertising . too bad on-line reviews websites , taking over subscriptions hardcopy magazines . i'll stick hardcopy until end my life . or until quality these types magazines gets so low , i can't stand it anymore . or until my subscription runs out this craptacular effort . you guys pretty good 5 years ago , but you've gone pot these past two years ! i'm talkin ' you watchdawg !!! you guys suckin ' lately !!! mc white said : you guys suckin'!!	-1

i got free one year sub . gaming mag . purchase game gamestop . after it ended , 6 months later , i started receiving this magazine , i thought it same one , some kind mix-up . but i didn't get magazine every month . it skipped few . finally i went their site complain , they promised send extra issues make up it . i told them there must mixup ... then i cancelled my supposed " subscription " , only receive e-mail saying now they wouldn't sending me anything , even extra issues promised . stay away these people ! these people extremely unprofessional . try playstation mag instead if you ps - i just reccommended it	-1
i admit , they some good recipes , but most them not simple very time-consuming . there always million ingredients each little recipe . if you stay-at-home housewife absolutely love cook , buy this , but if you just normal , you won't find many recipes here you . i suggest you consider ' cuisine home ' before you buy this one	-1
i would agree previous reviewers , burgeoning ads this magazine over past decade made magazine chore read . number ads now easily exceed number pages devoted articles . it also quite disturbing note many those ads ( possibly 50% or higher ) pitch ultra high end products , such viking ranges , bmw , oceanna cruises , trips bora bora ... wtf ? although i enjoy i luxury meal , i don't want go into massive credit card debt purchasing products this magazine selling . ocassionally , behind clutter , i find useful recipe ; i rarely find interesting article . i am going let my subscription expire end current period	-1
articles weren't anything new . mostly fluff cosmetic/clothes ads . better info exercises oxygen women mf .	-1
i reader businessweek over 10 years . i noticed it significant change focus over last year . while there more articles " personal business " , hard-core articles gone way newsweek , u.s. news world reports . nature articles lightweight not reflect issues important decision makers today . like many others , i noticed political slant or agenda over last year . specifically , their commentaries economic analysis trend left . bob kuttner co-editor american prospect contributor boston globe . every one his articles begins premise president policies bad then followed tortuous rational thesis , include discussion days gold backed currency . andrea d'andrea tyson better , but former clinton advisor , not objective her analysis . alternative economic opinions far few what opinions they tout , not agree numbers stated their own figures week . while bw potential great reporting based their resources , they let their editorial priorities get way serious business reporting . serious business readers students , i recommend going alternative sources . yes , i let my subscription lapse this year .	-1
i ordered this magazine without really knowing anything it . i very disappointed . not enough recipes . recipes included not really ones i would use .	-1
i yet see pw review anything not vetted pc police , not mention utterly stupid . when they want pan book , they apparently list criticisms they pick random , such " non sequitur " or " murky argument " or " reductionist " . they pick them throwing darts list writing down whatever phrases darts hit , ways prove they don't actually any understanding what terms mean . it especially annoying because even when it book i like , i easily see criticisms someone different worldview could make would valid , but they don't make them ; would require work . reviews so shoddy wildly inaccurate i thought asking amazon.com stop using them product info pages , but then it occurred me any book pw pans guaranteed good , so they useful backwards way . anytime pw praises book , i don't bother it , but if they attack it , i know it going great	-1
this magazine used very thorough , it used very good providing me tons deals tips i never would found my own . it great , very opinionated . but last year sometime , they changed look it now there lot less text . it much more style magazine now , that not what i want travel magazine i bought tell me money saving ! worse , except 40 best vacation bargains , which still okay , most articles forget incluce lot money-saving tips instead they too often suggest i expensive things . since when $225 night hotel considered budget ?? headlines captions expecially smart-aalecky . it not good expert advice it used ! i noticed arthur frommer isn't editing it anymore which maybe why -- bring him back ! my search true money-saving travel magazine unfortunately resumed again	-1
i subscribed forbes magazine year or two , general content good , but i cancelled my subscription 3 reasons .

laptop mag best described negatively : it not really serious computer magazine . it more or less like consumer guide , which basically paid advertising . this means you can't really trust article here because you don't know if they not written unbiased writers . end , i feel this waste money . besides , you get all info free web , cnet or zdnet , anyway	-1
i've read many positive reviews this magazine i receive , several months ago , trial issue . after sending subscription fee , i billed again . i wrote note letting them know check endorsed deposited . yesterday , i got notice telling me my subscription expired after one issue . i give up . it might good , but customer service really lousy . what disappointment .	-1
[ ... ] i got choice free subscription either parents or child magazine . since i already got parents , i chose child . i not renewing when my free subscription up . magazine boring , articles irrelevant there too many kids fashion pages . if you want magazine parenting/kids , go parents .	-1
magazine broad range patterns . out 1 year there 10 things i want make . or i should say i wanted make- until i started first one . they high percentage errors patterns . one issue 13 out 30 corrections . worst part , they don't seem post corrections until reader tried knit item told them what wrong . which means unless you want lot counting , calculating , ripping reknitting , you wait until issue out 6 months other readers found errors . i'm working cardigan i plan give someone christmas , found 2 major errors so far . no idea if i get this time when i get if i'll cardigan or layette ! one more error causes me rip it out start over i'll find new pattern or make my own . after spending $130 angora yarn make this gift , i'm not going give up , but renewal notices i get magazine promptly thrown out . update- still working cardigan , pretty much start over redesign pattern my own . still no correction online , but they added many other corrections other patterns this issue . corrections sometimes little , simple ones , but some corrections total rewriting instructions or charts ! i thrown out all magazines so i don't get tempted try pattern them	-1
i cook almost everything scratch , so i figured home cooking would people like me , who make effort make good quality home cooking without silly ingredients you see some those gourmet magazines . instead , recipes consist packaged dough , bottled sauces , etc . i don't need read magazine figure out i put jar spaghetti sauce some pasta add velveeta make casserole !	-1
truth-be-told , i hated " " give this magazine even one star , but least i could via this rating system . this magazine some good writers but needs new editor . mr. shoaf very bad his job , clearly , seems use reuse " buddy system " using writers . perhaps he gets kickback ? any rate , this , overall , cruddy example journalism . my facts tell me it should fall under fiction rather than nonfiction many issues . i am it . get new editor perhaps i reinvestigate publication . until then , so long . i no time absolute rubbish	-1
this just like english version but spanish . content not reflect culture or morals general latino people . nearly all models ( especially cover ) white and/or american very thin tall . they try use photos american celebrities when they brown hair , example christina aguilera , mandy moore , angelina jolie or just natural brunettes like catherine zeta-jones . maybe cosmo thinks we're too ignorant easily fooled dark hair dye job or computer generated tans . there tons beautiful succesful latinas could easily placed covers but i think they'd rather just use same photos they already took their english-version magazines . ads also high-end american european products . i've bought this magazine mexico while it still same problems least they feature real mexicans mexican products some ads . if you want magazine more reflects latino culture , although it mostly english , get latina magazine . they use lots latina models it more relevant latin-american women people interested latino culture	-1

this magazine i frequently get confused foreign affairs magazine . primary difference longer well-written essays leading experts affairs whereas foreign policy more frequently published , more up date more direct version other . it would great both since policy keeps you more current high degree professionalism while other gives you deeper detail . if you don't lot time read , policy one you'll need enjoy .	1

cooking school instructor , i believe there only four pieces reading material home cook needs : quot ; fine cookingquot ; , corriher quot ; cookwisequot ; , quot ; food lover companionquot ; , goldstein quot ; wine lover cookbookquot ; . your magazine it all : excellent cooking tips ; first-rate articles rating various appliances cooking tools ; excellent pictures detailing procedures ; recipes error-free ingredients listed order which they used instructions ( pet peeve mine ! ) . i agree recent review stating level difficulty your recipes encourages stretching one cooking abilities but not poit giving up . past years i really liked you highlighted small grower or breeder back cover -- one goat cheese apples come mind . all editors contributors : keep up wonderful work	1
printed daily newspapers , wsj easily superior just every aspect really matters . nyt lot more better photographs , but they best viewed computer screen . there not much argue ( regarding relatively conservative editorial page ) this review hasn't already written ; one more center-right midwesterner recommendation not going much incremental value . however , investor consumer i state wsj its website primary source credible information businesses , law , finance consumer products . anybody works living , mortgage or long-term savings plan would benefit reading wsj often possible . there simply no substitute	1

i'm subscriber road track , car driver , motor trend . simply put , rt one i look forward most each month . if you're looking well-rounded auto magazine , this it . rt you'll find : -road tests first drives . -an excellent " ampersand " monthly feature all latest info future cars prototypes . -news latest races drivers . -top-notch photography art . -witty columnists . ( see side glances peter egan)-the occasional technology-related feature . -classic cars , classic drivers , classic tracks . best historical content business . -very little content suvs . ( positive my book)the competitors : car driver substantially more road tests previews , some good specialty features pretty regular basis , but hardly anything racing history . frankly , motor trend isn't anything write home . articles shorter less captivating , they can't seem settle design theme , they also lack racing historical content . if i pick just one , road track would definitely my choice .	1
under radar filter only music magazines i come near . i hear mojo just informative , renovative , enjoyable , but i'm little too close-minded care other genres i ... don't care much . fans rock/pop/what kids calling " indie " /alternative/punk/post-punk/folk/ !!!!, take gander this . covers slick durable . they don't look out place sitting coffee table	1
harper , like atlantic new yorker written those looking more in-depth analysis coverage political cultural affairs sampling serious literary prose . personally i prefer atlantic , which i read regularly , only picking up harper when i time something it interests me , which usually two or three times year . just looking cover pages inside convey harper serious tome , perhaps too serious casual reader , especially compared more colorful pages atlantic playful new yorker cartoons . nevertheless , harper american icon it genre published many articles great names since it inception 1850 . number reviewers complain it left leaning stance clearly sprouts now recently departed editor lewis lapham , who outspoken critic current administration . mr. lapham shares his views two page opinion piece full page listing various " fun facts " known harper index . serious readers able get beyond this simply " viewpoint " see entire magazine serious writing it . i would contend this represents best " critical analysis " rather than bias . i would also simply suggest you view other reviews made people espousing this periodical overly biased . instance , least one those claiming liberal bias here also praising ann coulter book . so if you feel underwhelmed typical content you get even 60 minute broadcast or political round table free-for-all you're interested enough this magazine read it reviews , you should probably pick up copy it two or three months give it try . i recommend you also check out new yorker atlantic compare	1

when it comes music , culture , overall coverage meaningful entertainment , paste where it . fairly new publication ( starting july 2002 ) , magazine soared popularity holds its own marketplace saturated bland repetitive articles . if you're sick reading magazines only focus mainstream trends , surface culture , next teenage sensation , then this your magazine . publication focuses wide array music , but emphasizes folk , indie-rock , alternative genres . its pages you'll find very useful album reviews , articles array films ( especially indie ones , which hard come these days ) , well book suggestions . but far best part magazine every issue includes sampler cd , which include anything short films , new music , and/or documentaries . paste prides itself catering its consumer perfect reading material anyone who still enjoys stumbling onto new music , learning growing their song crafting , keeping up good quality ... not quantity . magazine blatantly states it looks " signs life music , film , culture ...

i'm 25 years old new atlantic [ monthly ] . not read publication some twenty-odd decades like rest reviewers , my opinion this : magazine wonderful . it infinitely more literate illuminating than most other periodicals . i'm letting my subscription time run out ( talk " also-ran " ... ) . some what other reviewers said true : there seem awful lot stories war/armed forces , times i would concede slight liberal bend . but neither enough dissuade me continuing my subscription . so " younger " readers , my advice switch off tv , throw out your news weeklies , subscribe .

nyrb atlantic monthly among my favorite subscriptions ; terms sheer intellectual depth range , it very tough beat nyrb . while i not read nyrb cover cover , i end up spending least 5 hrs each issue . main strength this magazine fact typical article written expert deep knowledge subject ( some times opinionated ; but always intelligent engaging ) . while article typically draws more than single book , i like fact article typically written commentary around theme more than summary books under review .	1
i just received my first order , i love it ! this magazine covers broad range topics includes designer techniques , current trends , period styles so much more . it tons vibrant pictures illustrate articles . i think this magazine would ideal someone just starting out design gain basic understanding wide range topics , also experienced designer keep up current trends fill gaps knowledgeable tidbits	1
there seems great deal psuedo business magazines . i like business week hard hitting , features excellent articles . i always several articles week this publication worth my time read . many publications dummy down business make it too simple leaving out important details , nuiances important , just assume reader isn't intelligent . articles written concise , generally filled data support their conclusions . i found this magazine invaluable business school because it kept me up date , often ahead my classmates . business world i find this magazine one few keep me informed well rounded aspects business i am not familiar . i really feel this worthwhile publication if you looking stay top what current important business world .	1
before i begin , there one thing you need know : i can't cook . i skills can't beaten when it comes heating stuff microwave , i use toaster oven , uh , toast things , but that it . no whipping up any fancy 30-minute meals me , which probably makes me only person who can't cook who actually buys this magazine . this should say great deal just how entertaining every day rachael ray actually . course , you might expect , i like rachael ray . it really would weird someone buy this magazine if they didn't cook they also hated rachael , i'm not weird ! however , although this ostensibly cooking-centric magazine , i'd argue it really reflects rachael attitude personality . her enthusiasm , love wide variety food , adventurous spirit shine through every page . all reports , rachael very hands-on developing this magazine , it shows . those who ask why they need read rachael ray magazine , since rachael all over television these days ( most recently her own syndicated daytime talk show ) , chew this : rachael isn't taking over world accident . she obviously doing something right dominating both food network daily schedule bestseller lists ( her ever-increasing line cookbooks ) . people just can't get their fill her ! so , what exactly her secret ? i think it boils down these factors : combination approachability charisma , which key ingredients superstardom ( think talented-yet-friendly stars such tom hanks or shakira ) . add dash optimism mixed spirit adventure , witnessed my favorite ray show , " $40 day , " which she explores new tourist destination each week , trying eat well insanely low budget . but what rachael ray magazine form , you're wondering ? well , my opinion , every day rachael ray appeals all tastes brilliantly translating her unique appeal tv screen printed page . i mentioned earlier , i probably won't cooking anything many recipes included each issue , but i still like checking them out . each recipe includes picture finished product , recipes lots variety creativity ... yum-o ! some so simple , like sandwiches or salads , i get feeling i might actually able attempt them if i really wanted ( see ? rachael " can-do " attitude even gets through kitchen-incompetent ! ) travel articles short pieces ( wide range topics such buying cheese , making mistakes kitchen , etc . ) also fun . but , rachael fan , i especially enjoy parts magazine written , or , rachael . one nice feature which readers send questions rachael which she personally answers . someone who participated lot " celebrity a " online past , i love these chances get know more someone famous who you may never meet person . fact , only reason i haven't rated every day rachael ray " five stars " because i'd like see even more rachael-related photos articles each issue ... how cool would ?! also , i'm hungry more interactivity : perhaps some food-themed sudoku , or some search-a-words . but fair , this relatively new magazine , all great magazines need time sort out what doesn't work . so far , every day rachael ray hit ground running off great start . i actually first person buy very first issue my local bookstore when it came out ( i got lucky happened there they set up display ) , i've looked forward each new issue ever since day . if you like rachael ray , you can't go wrong here ... start spending every day rachael ray " take bite outta life .

although i'm casey democrat , meaning social conservative fiscal progressive , i enjoy weekly standard probably best neo-conservative magazine market . i find it timely , informative , provocative in-depth terms its coverage issues . i particularly like their " week review " feature , whereby they review events week provide some pointed commentary . but where i particularly came appreciate weekly standard debate over moral issues -- they offered innovative clear arguments favor traditional family values , using solid research up-to-date statistics numerous different disciplines , while avoiding usual worn rhetoric family values crowd ( among which i include myself casey democrat . )	1

i'm one those people who always looks up product reviews before buying anything , so it leap faith i bought natural health magazine without reading anything it . friend suggested it , since this particular friend never led me wrong before , i caved bought july/august 2005 copy immediately . let me start off saying i'm extremely picky person . i extremely high standards every purchase i make , i absolutely not cut manufacturer any slack if i find fault . now i've gotten out way , i mention i thoroughly impressed natural health . long ago , i subscribed new age magazine ( now known body soul , which i not care ) . it among my favorites solely due its wide variety content true-to-focus natural lifestyle tips advice . i cannot stand redundancy , incorrect information excessive advertising . i found natural health much more long lines former new age magazine , filled dozens little gems make it worth much more than $3.95 i paid . give you idea what magazine includes , here small sampling articles i found july/august issue : small articles include : - " bee or not bee " , breakdown aromatherapy ingredients include bee pollen , royal jelly , propolis , honey , stating just how effective natural these ingredients . - " how i get relief pms ? " experts ( including naturopath , gynecologist dietitian ) answer this question excellent responses . - " medicine cabinet : attack weekend warrior " natural remedies aids those like myself who love weekend warriors . - " clothes pose " great yoga gear ! - " medical breakthroughs " - " healing supplements : 8 ways beat anxiety " - " fitness fix - knee savers " longer articles include : - " healthy appetites : savvy strategies eating well " delicious , healthy recipes tips . - " good medicine : clean , healthy mouth " well-researched article " mercury fillings , fluoride toothpaste best at-home remedies " . - " five paths peace " five simple meditation techniques . - " eat beat heat : yin foods " more great recipes ! - " sacred spaces " - making your home your personal retrea t.t his only sampling ; fact , that less than half magazine alone . some articles fairly short , but provide just right amount information get point across . my personal favorite last page , " make one change " , where this month change " upgrade your z " . it included simple tips i able implement immediately . amount advertising seemed slightly less than usual ( probably same amount you'd find yoga journal , but not nearly many oprah magazine ) , they seemed line natural health focus . judging past reviews natural health , it seems magazine bad run 2003-2004 timeframe . let remember magazines change editors frequently . i found none past complaints true this issue , but may not so future issues years now . me , i want subscription asap	1

i discovered this " magazine " while employed reference instructional librarian culinary college . four annual hardcover issues arrive just one ad - back cover . recipe quantities typically family size rather than mass serving quantities . this important note because this magazine very much oriented towards professional or very advanced amateur chef . profiles articles tend focus needs professional . one patron ( local sous chef who graduated different culinary school some years earlier ) began swearing blue streak after thumbing through few issues . when i confronted him outburst , he apologized explained his behavior . three years , he worked under local chef amazed creativity chef coming up new recipes restaurant . after thumbing through issues , my patron realized ugly truth - their entire menu cribbed art culinaire . when i told him i my disposal large stack subscription forms , he immediately took one saying , " next time , i'll ahead him . " each issue large enough beautiful enough double coffee table book ( paper quality pictures easily superior most cookbooks ) , but you want keep every sauce-splattered issue close stove you burning pages . there no other magazine compare it very few cookbooks match it	1
" fortune " classic newsstand , vital important today ever . " fortune " generally caters people managerial bent , especially upper-level executives , but also offers excellent analysis current events business world , global national economic climate , forward-looking technology trend information . each issue normally organized around theme or major story , like enron trial , or 100 best companies work given year . i enjoy articles where they rank things , but more than rankings themselves , i am always interested justifications they use their rankings ; while i don't always agree magazine , i always find it good food though t.t he features generally very polished accurate , lessons conveyed straightforward manner useful ceo college business student . i particularly appreciate interviews " fortune " key players financial industry , also appreciate very useful index companies individuals featured every issue . magazine probably not favorite investing advice because it also covers so much other financial terrain ; small investors may also want read more specific magazine like " kiplinger . " nonetheless , investment advice insight " fortune " offers should generally held high esteem . i also appreciate coverage key trends , particular want note " fortune " lead excellent reporting pension crisis america : coverage this sort what makes me loyal reader . many other financial magazines available competing your money ; while there several i would recommend , " fortune " remains reliable source information macro-level trends , should part everyone business library	1

this magazine doesn't come out regular basis like most mags ... so they don't need fill it up junk articles make it press . it explains how amazing things seen current films . often more explained picture than whole page words , so they quite few high quality pictures ... they also assume least little bit knowledge industry , so they don't explain easy stuff :) i think this most important , they treat productions objectivly ... no reviews , or off handed comments story line or acting ... if you want stuff buy premire ! i haven't yet found mag goes this depth films , without feeling like you getting sales pitch film company	1
this one many magazines float around school library , it most common . maybe because not too many people read it . all it pure celebrity gossip . there really nothing else here . if you like blurry photos lindsay lohan , donald trump , paris hilton , simon cowell , paula abdul like , ( blurry so you can't see zits flaws ) then you should get this . one article mentioned britney spears stomach , how it coming back . she wearing baggy t-shirt . baggy t-shirts common among women wanting hide gut , not flaunt it . this magazine makes it seem like celebrities lose weight like magic ( they don't-not so far i tell ) . if you want read fact nichole richie acquired yet chloe paddington , fact donald trump thinks his wife melania looks hideous now he gotten her knocked up , or you would like see photos victoria beckham looking pissed off , then read this . this magazine full lies well-for instance , one writer claims young people like lindsay lohan get higher car insurance rates accidents they not fault . false ! you only get higher rates if you fault . this magazine nothing more than overpriced tabloid . there nothing value here . half time insider some anonymous friend , half time facts aren't right . avoid this thing all costs , unless course you celebrity worshipper . i've got better things than worship people who too much money their own good . i'll stick more intelligent fare , thankyouverymuch	-1

once thought women health magazine , cosmo taken twisted turn into pointless redundancy . one point , cosmo seemed must-have , water oxygen . more more lately , it seems magazine posing question " how we survive only water oxygen , still sexy while we ? " ocassionally , featured article faces issues things ranging eating disorders politics , but few far . they don't seem realize other side page eating disorder article , woman who wears size 0 still unsatisfied herself , thinking she must conform some " heroin-chic " fad . fun fearless female - articles real women who make real difference - great . it shines spotlight someone who not only beautiful successful , but enough education talent succeed world , without needing man . if magazine featured more these things , maybe it would worth my subscription fee . but tell me when last time you saw cover not featuring phrases " mind-blowing sex " , " how satisfy ( insert breathing life form here ) " , or " barely-there " , which seems refer not just underwear anymore , but everything . this isn't magazine women health anymore . it all how keep your man happy , while still conforming social standards fashion , weight , financial standings . i'm sorry , but " girl budget " can't afford $430 skirt , or uncomfortable shoes uncomfortable price $300+ . cater more real woman ; not one who only cares her relationship status , pant size , bank account	1

i found cat fancy magazine mostly advertisements breeders advertisements than real meat information cat owners . i'm also very unimpressed their cat channel online board they advertise cat fancy cannot recommend it others . they seem poor management their online board especially weekends so inappropriate posts stay there long time professional magazine advertising their own online board their magazine should their online board perfected before offering it . also cat fancy pushes ridiculous high renewal rate their magazine , but if you go onto amazon , you get renewal rate almost half cat fancy renewal price . so i come conclusion cat fancy magazine , their poor online cat channel board high renewal rate cat fancy charges , they not interested keeping their readers or online members .	-1

... while , yes , i've made comments past how oprah changed little , this publication . i'm sure person who wrote " this just magazine full things one can't afford " reads fashion or celebrity magazines full many things she can't afford . advertising generates money , while i don't like ads either , they everywhere because advertising works . if you don't want see them , don't buy magazines , watch tv or go anywhere . far layouts " too full clutter " ... everyone their own style . there some people who like look don't prefer pared-down , zen look . magazines not reality . if they , they wouldn't plastered plastic , bronzed 6 ' females who weigh 100 lbs . i'm originally middle america , nobody looks like there . just take magazines ads what they . save your money , like i , things you just . if you don't perserverence , then stick target walmart circulars . knock-offs never far behind .	1

this might sound strange first , but i confess : course i subscribe gramophone its critically perceptive unfailingly well-written reviews features , but perhaps what i love best this magazine copious informative record-label advertisements ! just leafing through nov . or dec . 2004 edition , i see full-page even two-page spreads showing : * all lastest issues gramophone awards series -- series mid-priced reissues universal ( philips , decca , dg ) recordings won gramophone award . * all latest issues rosette collection , series mid-priced reissues universal recordings awarded rosette penguin guide . * all latest releases hyperion , dg , sony , rca , philips , emi , virgin , naxos , naive , classics pleasure , bis , chandos , cpo , mdg , etc . etc . etc . other words , if you're fairly assiduous collector trying stay abreast all latest recordings , you find gramophone invaluable indeed unsurpassed this respect -- both new releases reissues . ads not only give you catalog numbers release dates ; they also inform you which recordings won which awards garnered accolades which critics . browsing ads gramophone every month * * best way see all new releases -- not even most well-stocked classical-specialist cd shop would carry all these titles . what more , many many desirable classical cds * never * issued domestically north america , so how else you going find out what available europe ? furthermore , every issue contains 4- or 5-page section called " new releases , " which lists very specific product info every cd issued month over 100 record labels (!!) -- that no exaggeration because i actually counted them . new developments i've noticed since gramophone significant makeover nov 2004 issue : gone robert layton ( bbc music magazine ) , apparently traded jeremy nicholas ( bbc music magazine ) -- these new developments , aren't they ? so it no longer true say all three penguin editors write gramophone : layton gone , now only greenfield march . ( i take this opportunity say i still miss baroque critic nonpareil nicholas anderson . his moving gramophone bbc music magazine reason i started reading mag first place . ) finally , way rebutting previous reviews this page : you see above list record labels advertise gramophone , it no longer true ( if indeed it ever ) magazine kowtows " major " labels . fact , gramophone critics recommend many or more recordings such " indie " labels naive , harmonia mundi , hyperion , chandos , mdg , cpo , capriccio , glossa , linn , avie , lso live , telarc , etc . etc . they " major " labels : sony , rca , warner , universal . it certainly * not * true next quality recording more likely emerge mp3 file russia than new release " major " record company -- reason this simple : record labels -- all them , including indies -- today greatest artists under exclusive recording contracts . until likes vengerov , perahia , manze , biondi , minkowski , harnoncourt , jacobs , hundred others free agents making their own recordings , record labels remain relevant -- nay , indispensable -- ever . you won't find vpo , bpo , lahti so , or concertgebouw popping up obscure mp3 file either ! therefore , gramophone " business model " -- earning revenue record-label advertising -- hardly obsolete . quite contrary , moreover gramophone quick embrace " indie " labels such harmonia mundi ( mag " label year " last year ) ventures such lso sfo issuing their own in-house recordings . fact , reviewer below who predicts imminent demise gramophone ( extension all classical mags , including fanfare , diapason , bbc music magazine ) sounds much like gramophone-resenters classicstoday.com, who making same claims quite some time . such resenters their ilk apparently never learned this simple lesson : you cannot build yourself up simply tearing others down . ( attention classicstoday.com: want earn some critical clout ? then learn write , crying out loud ... take hurwitz , example , who routinely exclaims : " this best recording or , period . " period ? this supposed enlighten persuade me ? but pardon me , i rant digress . ) finally , even if we assume sake argument gramophone fanfare offer reader equal amount equally well-written reviews -- i'm really not convinced this true -- but assuming this so , i give nod gramophone all above reasons . fanfare doesn't offer superabundance information copious amount new releases reissues , therefore isn't useful tool staying current * all * new releases . i must admit -- call me superficial if you , but i must admit fanfare lack production values makes it relatively unappealing . fact , based its appearance feel , it reminds me slightly larger-sized version reader digest . i freely admit i love tactile visual qualities gramophone -- large glossy pages photos graphics ads all make very pleasurable perusal . contrast , fanfare seem like underground newsletter . i believe more than one critical perspective good thing , while i would certainly not discourage anyone subscribing fanfare , i still think gramophone obvious first choice	1

my head pulsates useless music trivia knowledge , most it reading magazines like " mojo .

you've got take your hat off fangoria . whether their style gory , visceral coverage horror genre appeals you or not you can't deny their success . fact they've doing it 20 years really marvel world magazines , let alone genre magazines . fangoria still tops terms their production values photography although newer mags like rue morgue some imports certainly good . fangoria each month checks very large array reviews both current releases older releases you may missed . since many these films go direct video , chances you probably miss them . besides movies they also cover horror fiction non-fiction , tv even smattering music where appropriate . if there minor complaint fangoria it sometimes they come off bit fannish perhaps not critical movies they should . honestly i've watched movies they've given favorable reviews wondered just what heck they smoking when they watched . other complaint would they devote almost no space classic horror , but that just pet peeve	1

i subscribe few magazines , most which somewhat longwinded tedious . progressive not follow path . it also very informative magazine . example , one article i learned following items democrat john kerry :( 1 ) he gets good bit money telecommunications industry lobbyist " mintz , levin , cohn , ferris , glovsky , popeo " . ( 2 ) " he sponsored legislation help telecommunications companies buy up public airwaves . " ( 3 ) he thinks " we should all `smart cards ' - electronic ids our health history encoded them . " ( 4 ) he " voted every free trade pact come his way senate since cold war . " ( 5 ) afl-cio backing kerry even though he declined answer there questionnaire trade . all these came one article : " triumph bland " ruth conniff ( page 12-13 issue april 2004 ) . if your like informative information , check out this magazine	1

this magazine written many most influential people realm foreign policy . if one wishes know what establishment thinks foreign policy issues this magazine read . but i often found it err its judgment evaluation situations . most recent example recent long analysis u.s. - iranian relations which experts led zbigniew brezhinski posited iran would open conciliatory economic gestures u.s. relation its nuclear program . this analysis so far mark , so naive , so uninformed what iraniians saying their own people publicly mullah mullah conferences i astonished it printed taken seriously . since time course uncompromising determination iran attain nuclear weapons , its fanatic anti- american policy become clear all see . so my advice whoever reads ' foreign policy ' any major world program would well read many other sources wel l.i.e. reader approach reading ' foreign policy ' one now knows world simplistic , most often , wrong	1

yes , tc oldest continually published magazine usa , it their 160th anniversary . however , i see little reason celebrate . why ? because i fail see how it really improved over years . nowadays , this magazine seems cater far too much material lusts " nouveau riche " . back day when it true " high society " magazine , there rather interesting educational articles arts , literature culture . it beautiful it really gave person something aspire , but now just like so much rest society mutated into lot pretentious materialist wannabees bragging " bling bling " , so this magazine . there far too many adverts so-called " luxury goods " my tastes , although they put patronizing article women over age 60 new " power " base , they insist using only thin 20-something models who probably can't afford clothes they modeling ! articles wise , they starting sound more like glamour or cosmo than erudite publication i used enjoy buying newsstands 20 years ago . yes , tc changed times ... but these not good times if case . it too bad	-1

wired magazine proven me something it never even occurred me imagine : there level cynical , style-whoring , inaccurate , myopic snarkiness goes beyond merely " trading substance style . " wired consistently behind curve these days , but doesn't stop publication spinning every article like golden truth you too lame know . articles controversial subjects , one side routinely saddled straw man arguments so blatant artless i find them offensive even when i disagree parties who set up fall . just often , features which don't discuss contentious topic still edge them , making fun person , group , or idea way isn't enlightening or even humorous , let alone warranted subject matter . generally , wired mean-spirited it self-congratulatory . this attitude appeals primarily demographic tech wonks it industry tourists professionally personally deflated bubble burst , desperately trying assert their relevance relive their high-flying , know-it-all glory . any content easily outweighed sheer volume half-truths , shoddy reasoning , straight-up falsehoods which could easily revealed corrected casual investigation subjects treated pages choked high gloss , yuppie/genxer-targeted corporate mind-poison ( advertising ) . isn't world technology interesting magical enough without mixing spin , double-talk , factual misrepresentation presidential debate impotent , absurd bravado battle bot pre-match trash talk ? people know little enough how tech rules world how it , quite plausibly , save it . this magazine could evangelize technology promise educate its current future potential . instead it concentrates one-shots written style passes " hip " forwards attitude rather than message , emphasis sensationalism over accuracy , more common advertising than edification	-1
cook illustrated first cooking magazine i'd found myself truly motivated read cover-to-cover , even though they insert advertisements their own products , which i suppose , them , makes this " ad-free " magazine , but i'm not surprised they've bent rules claim . one time i found it necessary contact cook illustrated customer service issue , i simply floored treatment i received ... i'll simply leave it . i personally don't intend re-subscribing ( " fine cooking " , here i come ! ) . you , however , may find this cooking magazine you . , far what they goes , cook illustrated good what they - i'll give them . if you not found this review helpful , i'm sorry if i haven't made value my warning apparent . just know there those us out there who bad experiences , simply trying prevent others experiencing same .	-1

i subscribed this magazine almost year now i become very skeptical much its advice . this advice seems heavily influenced its paying advertisers e.g. us dairy industry ( there always least one those annoying " got milk " ads ) not surprisingly , every issue there several articles magazine hype supposed benefits diet high dairy products ( e.g. milk cheese ) . however read many books nutrition , it become very clear me majority current research shows diet high dairy products actually very damaging your health - instance read china study colin campbell , extremely comprehensive nutritional study sheds great deal light us dairy industry its shady methods influencing public perception healthfulness its products . it well known there many better ways getting calcium etc into your diet than dairy but this magazine unfortunately blinded its advertisers ' paychecks . magazine also appears very similar prevention magazine which i also subscribed i would make same criticism . my advice stick reliable sources health like excellent " berkeley wellness letter " not supported or influenced advertisements drugs companies or powerful industry groups like us dairy industry	-1

i under impression this literary magazine would full fiction , short stories , essays , book reviews , literary criticism . instead i received magazine discusses political issues . magazine know what it wants ? they recently released special fiction issue newsstands . why would they if they're becoming political magazine ? they want news/political magazines such time , u.s. news world report , newsweek or they want literary magazine ? they're doing poor job establishing themselves drawing line what they want . i regret subscribing because i felt mislead . course atlantic staff , turning magazine into political direction probably bring them more sales . i don't think reading literary magazines dead any means but format needs revamped so people want read it .	-1
after falling love gourmet yellow cookbook , i subscribed gourmet , hoping same great classic recipes commonsense commentary . wow , what disappointment . i just received my second issue , reviewer said , it 90% ads high-end luxury goods like jewelry cars . 6-page " special advertisement section " stops so special when there 20 them one issue ! what happened , ruth reichl ? few recipes one find unattractive and/or too difficult even weekend cooking . those cooks looking great cooking magazine , i highly recommend bon appetit over gourmet : majority magazine recipes cooking tips , only interspersed ads . i calling see if i get my subscription switched tomorrow .	-1
this worst magazine i ever subscribed too . i hated it so much after first issue when new ones came , i thru it right trash . here why : 1- ad after ad dietary supplements ( like dexatrim stacker ) which i think cheapins creditablity magazine b/c true health doesnt come bottle . 2- many pics overly built up women ( think fitness competitions ) ... not something average women aspire too ... too me , nasty looking . 3-the information it general information anyone common sense already know ! my advice you , avoid this magazine , unless you like body building or like looking body builders	-1
occasionally when i go grocery store i pick up magazine check out counter . so i bought issue fitness magazine then decided get subscription . i don't know what heck i thinking . each time i got issue i noticed there always some skinny blond chick cover wearing bikini . there never any women color cover . so when i sent letter , asking if i'd like renew my subscription , i said he11 no . i'm not wasting my money so-called fitness magazine doesn't feature women color its cover . there just no way . i thought fitness everybody , not just skinny blondes who wear bikinis . just because your skinny doesn't make you `fit ' either . skip this if possible	-1
our library just finished its magazine usage count , my surprise american spectator came dribbling only couple hits , measured current copies left table check outs older issues . yet our patronage here very conservative . perhaps people who once read this sort thing no longer read all , or maybe , couple reviewers suggested , bill clinton out office , it no longer same appeal . you change my rating five stars if you like , sake ideology , but you still won't read thing . just like i don't read nation anymore	-1

since its fisrt issue 1994 , mojo magazine source all things rock roll . what i love most this magazine they ridiculously exaustive articles semi-obscure but important groups past present . where else would you read 19 page story making ogden nut gone flake , or cultural importance purple rain soundtrack ? writing this magazine so great they make synopsis son ringo starr musical career most interesting thing you've ever read . british music journalism market cutthroat it gets , only best publications survive . my biggest concern after more than 10 years such writing subject matter become shortage where they begin recycle articles past issues because they ran out bands write abou t.t hat say it not totally without flaw . british music magazines this awful habit putting together these ' best albums ever made ' lists every two years questionable entries . sorry , but calling kula shaker 27th best band all time 1997 just stupid . also , since this imported uk ( would it really but their balls us publishing outlet like majority magazines out there ? ) you not only pay hefty price it , it hit or miss you end up included cd comes it .	-1

obviously " ugly " comments below written uneducated uneducated guesses assumptions . i love this magazine . there awesome workouts , great meals great stories inspire one all . yes , it cover fitness/figure competitions , but it doesn't mean everyone look like or get their bodies level ... it magazine inspiration ... look physcially fit ( who only able look like when they compete , not 365 days year everyone knows unhealthy ... even those who compete ) . yes , downfall this magazine all supplement advertisements ... but what magazine without advertisements ? every magazine you look some form adverstisements since this technically " bible " fitness , there going advertisements tailored supplements . i admit , i somewhat offended reading what " ugly " say . they must've jealous , because i felt way towards fitness like they when i their shoes ( i weighed 180 one point my 4 ' 11 " frame ) , or upset because they didn't research this magazine just assumed it would girly magazine false info how lose those last 20 lbs doing useless no weights exercises or " seen tv " cardio dvds/exercise machines/gimmicks . those women not ugly all not bodybuilders ... most fitness competitors doing gymnastic type routines only lifting tone . weight lifting not body builder make . you would lift extreme , power lift pros take steroids ( hence ugly men-looking women ) . so ... if you want take your body next level ... better yet , actually lose some fat healthy manner need some inspiration , please buy copy this magazine . check it out . if you're into fitness/figure competitions , well , obviously this bible . :) uneducated below , i am competing my first figure competition 9 days . all things i learned through my trainers , most supplements you see ads not condoned them . contrary popular belief , we don't all consume protein shakes all day , nor this magazine say you reach your weight loss goals . substituting toast jam bagel cream cheese just bad , because you're substituting sugar fat . doesn't make any sense . i am one who overweight learned great deal magazines like this ... every magazine , whether it fitness , fashion , etc . must taken grain salt every now then , because not even so-called " experts ' agree what works what doesn't . everyone body different . look this magazine , research , make educated choice	-1
yeah , some stuff way too pricey me , but there some really great ideas articles this magazine . i march-april issue , among my favorites this month : article how diplomatically discipline other people kids , gifted child who misdiagnosed autism , best adult friendly children music download , suggestions artistic children books . furthermore , there price range suggested products , some which would fit most people budgets . article make-up features products $8 - $65 . there also article how make room habitable 2 children , which hardly targeted towards people who live huge estates . you buy vogue magazine expect able afford everything it ? it not some people , but it me , i hope it well	1

i subscribing cooking light three years now it never disappoints me . there lots recipes , usually 85 - 90 issue , so i am little confused those whom complain there not enough . there wide variety also , crazy unique regular but re-vamped . i not kids but i made several recipes , such mini ice cream cakes chicken dumplings i would deem perfectly acceptable younger children . my only warning perspective buyers some recipes quite time consuming some ingredients quite expensive . when i get pinch i substitute something close if i don't feel like shelling out extra money . overall i am very pleased magazine ; both living recipe sections	1
this might sound strange first , but i confess : course i subscribe gramophone its critically perceptive unfailingly well-written reviews features , but perhaps what i love best this magazine copious informative record-label advertisements ! just leafing through nov . or dec . 2004 edition , i see full-page even two-page spreads showing : * all lastest issues gramophone awards series -- series mid-priced reissues universal ( philips , decca , dg ) recordings won gramophone award . * all latest issues rosette collection , series mid-priced reissues universal recordings awarded rosette penguin guide . * all latest releases hyperion , dg , sony , rca , philips , emi , virgin , naxos , naive , classics pleasure , bis , chandos , cpo , mdg , etc . etc . etc . other words , if you're fairly assiduous collector trying stay abreast all latest recordings , you find gramophone invaluable indeed unsurpassed this respect -- both new releases reissues . ads not only give you catalog numbers release dates ; they also inform you which recordings won which awards garnered accolades which critics . browsing ads gramophone every month * * best way see all new releases -- not even most well-stocked classical-specialist cd shop would carry all these titles . what more , many many desirable classical cds * never * issued domestically north america , so how else you going find out what available europe ? furthermore , every issue contains 4- or 5-page section called " new releases , " which lists very specific product info every cd issued month over 100 record labels (!!) -- that no exaggeration because i actually counted them . new developments i've noticed since gramophone significant makeover nov 2004 issue : gone robert layton ( bbc music magazine ) , apparently traded jeremy nicholas ( bbc music magazine ) -- these new developments , aren't they ? so it no longer true say all three penguin editors write gramophone : layton gone , now only greenfield march . ( i take this opportunity say i still miss baroque critic nonpareil nicholas anderson . his moving gramophone bbc music magazine reason i started reading mag first place . ) finally , way rebutting previous reviews this page : you see above list record labels advertise gramophone , it no longer true ( if indeed it ever ) magazine kowtows " major " labels . fact , gramophone critics recommend many or more recordings such " indie " labels naive , harmonia mundi , hyperion , chandos , mdg , cpo , capriccio , glossa , linn , avie , lso live , telarc , etc . etc . they " major " labels : sony , rca , warner , universal . it certainly * not * true next quality recording more likely emerge mp3 file russia than new release " major " record company -- reason this simple : record labels -- all them , including indies -- today greatest artists under exclusive recording contracts . until likes vengerov , perahia , manze , biondi , minkowski , harnoncourt , jacobs , hundred others free agents making their own recordings , record labels remain relevant -- nay , indispensable -- ever . you won't find vpo , bpo , lahti so , or concertgebouw popping up obscure mp3 file either ! therefore , gramophone " business model " -- earning revenue record-label advertising -- hardly obsolete . quite contrary , moreover gramophone quick embrace " indie " labels such harmonia mundi ( mag " label year " last year ) ventures such lso sfo issuing their own in-house recordings . fact , reviewer below who predicts imminent demise gramophone ( extension all classical mags , including fanfare , diapason , bbc music magazine ) sounds much like gramophone-resenters classicstoday.com, who making same claims quite some time . such resenters their ilk apparently never learned this simple lesson : you cannot build yourself up simply tearing others down . ( attention classicstoday.com: want earn some critical clout ? then learn write , crying out loud ... take hurwitz , example , who routinely exclaims : " this best recording or , period . " period ? this supposed enlighten persuade me ? but pardon me , i rant digress . ) finally , even if we assume sake argument gramophone fanfare offer reader equal amount equally well-written reviews -- i'm really not convinced this true -- but assuming this so , i give nod gramophone all above reasons . fanfare doesn't offer superabundance information copious amount new releases reissues , therefore isn't useful tool staying current * all * new releases . i must admit -- call me superficial if you , but i must admit fanfare lack production values makes it relatively unappealing . fact , based its appearance feel , it reminds me slightly larger-sized version reader digest . i freely admit i love tactile visual qualities gramophone -- large glossy pages photos graphics ads all make very pleasurable perusal . contrast , fanfare seem like underground newsletter . i believe more than one critical perspective good thing , while i would certainly not discourage anyone subscribing fanfare , i still think gramophone obvious first choice	1

it true entrepreneur mag loaded ads -- but those ads interesting themselves . i always find it fascinating see what ads pop what ads junk -- it easy see difference . this opportunity develop your own advertising strategy ! content , there certainly room improvement . i personally enjoy entrepreneur profiles , though i wish they longer . i would like see more meat here . business several years now , i find most value this magazine comes front section where they list interesting tips , new products , survey results . not month goes i don't bookmark page so i follow up new product or check out website mentioned short piece . alone , low subscription price worth investmen t.t here lot information franchising , which great those interested this business model . though this not my personal cup tea , i still find it interesting read lists franchises notice trends popularity . who knew there so many pet service franchises available ! sure , it could use more real-world advice , but i still consider this one best general magazines available entrepreneurs . not every topic appeal every reader since we all run different kinds businesses seek different information . if you're looking something more specific your industry , trade magazine would make more sense . but i still recommend you keep your entrepreneur mag too so you keep eye climate small biz world .	-1

i subscribed this magazine one year ago . out four issues i've received this year , i've knitted least one project idea each issue , three so far fall issue alone (!) each turned out beautifully . i haven't read any other knitting magazines appeal me consistently this one . i've noticed each issue careful balance projects , appealing both genders all levels knitting expertise . each issue contains few " gee-whiz ! " type articles front interesting , exotic sometimes downright weird news knitting world ( like , who knew knitting could considered performance art ? ) . there usually exotic " catch-the-eye " or cutting-edge fashion project , followed other apparel projects always beautiful , visually appealing frequently wearable , too ! although magazine occasionally include items make me shake my head disbelief , interweave knits generally seems select projects real humans wear without looking like freaks . you'll also find couple ideas non-apparel and/or " quick gift " -type projects each issue , ranging felted backpacks novelty purses baby hats . now , if all this sounds good , just wait : it gets better . real clincher me patterns seem tested carefully proof-read before going press . i've worked 7 projects iwk this year , yet catch single mistake pattern directions ! maybe i've just lucky so far , but i noticed iwk website list errata amazingly short ... so either they don't update errata onto their website , or they really don't allow lot mistakes slip through . short , i think " interweave knits " provides lot bang your subscription bucks . two thumbs up me	1

sunset magazine dedicated people , culture , lifestyle american west . this magazine divides its space among many different topics , such food entertainment , travel , recreation , gardening more . i reading this magazine six months now there several things it make it worthwhile . thing stands out most photographs , i'm not talking just stunning scenery one normally associates west ( like national parks or coastline ) . even ordinary pictures striking . gardening section , example , it common find pictures family homes beautifully landscaped yards full blossoming flowers colorful plants . home design section , one find nice photographs home interiors , showing different designs furniture . one most unique qualities sunset fact it published five different editions . there specially designed issue northwest ( washington , oregon , idaho , alaska , british columbia ) , northern california ( northern california majority nevada ) , southern california ( southern california hawaii ) , southwest ( arizona , new mexico , las vegas area nevada ) , rocky mountain ( montana , wyoming , colorado , utah ) . this nice idea it one other magazines should consider emulating . based where you live or where you active interest , this region your issue spends its pages covering . my subscription northern california region , so i am treated each month articles places like san francisco , sacramento , reno ( nevada ) , lake tahoe , etc . one specialties this magazine food it common find recipes throughout every issue . there special section set aside food , but one expect find food articles recipes everywhere they read . even cover page each issue features food dish . you might guess , featured recipes generally those types cuisine normally associated each specific region west , plenty generic recipes thrown make sure everyone something cook . one specialty sections this magazine i like " value vacation " - subsection travel recreation . this section highlights specific place travel then offers day day breakdown things places see , cost each itemized so you know exactly what expect . highlighted city or tourist area anyplace west isn't limited region your issue covers . this section nice because it lets you see black white what it cost few days budget entertainment . it reminds me some television programs shown travel channel . advertisements cover 40 50 percent pages each issue they often found bunches front back alternating pages much rest each issue ( typical most magazines ) . ads center all sorts different things . because this combination travel/culture/food/entertainment/home garden/living magazine , ads cover wide range products services , laundry detergent credit cards cat food . overall , sunset proven itself enjoyable magazine . i don't live western united states but this region my favorite part country , so it makes sense i would find something value this publication . i like photography , personal stories , gardening decorating ideas , most other aspects this magazine . if you're dead set your ways refuse read anything deviates your eastern , southern , or midwestern lifestyle , then you may not like sunset . but majority people , sunset much offer pages pages eye- catching pictures friendly articles life american west .	-1
