i bought two sharpeners . i sharpened ten pencils first one ( excellent sharpening while it lasted ) , something " let go " inside . motor ran but rotating blade no more power - soon i pressed pencil into blade it would stop turning while motor continued running freely . i unwrapped second sharpener see if it would hold up better . again , after 10 pencils , exactly same thing happened . when i disassembled one them analyze failure , i discovered crucial area plastic gear drives blade mechanism stripped away so gear spinning practically freely . it unable drive blade mechanism any significant strength . conclusion : this product potentially excellent pencil sharpener but it major design weakness its drive train . i only put one star this review because zero stars not available	-1

joy elegant addition lamy well-designed line affordable , functional fountain pens . i'm big fan lamy safari everyday writing using one years ( see separate review ) . joy longer , pointy-ended , calligraphic cousin safari , which also plastic fountain pen windows side . fact , caps interchangeable , threading joining front back halves pen same , so i normally write joy nib section screwed into safari back end , since i don't like joy long end section everyday writing carrying my bag or pocket . aesthetically speaking , i like long , tapered design end , which reminds me dip pens i used use art calligraphy . while this design fine pen lives desk , it little too long carrying around campus or office . said , i consider this matter taste than problem design . like safari , pen nib durable writes pretty smoothly consistently ... easily best various pens i've tried this lowest price range . it light pen relatively narrow , molded grip section , so stay away if you would rather write hefty , chunky pen . 1.1 mm straight chisel nib perfect me . i'm lefty , so most oblique nibs won't work . chisel nib just wide enough give my otherwise ordinary handwriting pleasant , calligraphic more substantial quality . ( right inkn paper combination , you get beautiful variation tone darkness your strokes ink dries . ) however , it not so wide i can't write it every day , unless i need write really small . i write letters , take notes standard lined paper , address envelopes , fill out forms , sign checks , etc . this pen without worry . everyday user fountain pens , i say i really enjoy writing this pen safari , both . however , i only dabble calligraphy cannot speak this pen appropriateness someone who sort work more seriously . i expect this would good starter pen , however , beginning calligrapher ... possibly one wider nib versions , if they don't expect use it everyday writing or fine ( small ) calligraphy wor k.p.s. if you like more serious , industrial look , lamy makes version this pen black plastic aluminum	1
