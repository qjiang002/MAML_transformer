we bought this when our baby born ( 6 months ago , only used it few times until recently ) . he loves it now get him sleep . problem lies 4 am , my husband i awake hear mobile playing ... scares us death since no one else should around start it . we go into nursery our child holding it playing animals .... clip holds umbrella part broken off , causing mobile fall baby . ( he thought it funniest thing world , he okay , thank god . ) but little plastic hook piece his hand . if you 6-month old child you know they eat everything they find . i thank god he didnt put his mouth . it great soother baby , but sure there no defects every day ! like i said before , other than this , it great .	-1
leak-o-matic fully lived up its name . new parent , i don't time things once , forget doing things twice . i need simple reliable- leak-o-matic neither . it worked ok first few times , then i partially filled tub put all items nearby necessary bathtime . time i returned baby hand , leak-o-matic dribbled all over laundry room counter , soaked all my other items counter , water ran down onto floor , under baseboard , dripped upstairs landing onto downstairs foyer floor . leak-o-matic hindenburg all baby bathtubs . it too bad i cannot give it zero stars . there many people who say you just assemble them correctly , but judging number irate mommies here , i conclude it either too complicated design or just plain crappy engineering . think it- number people young children who took time go online tell everyone this thing piece cheese ! cups feet stick countertop so you unable positon tub once it attached . fabric mesh incline allows baby slide down into water , so you're always repositioning baby . i'm surprised this thing didn't come built toaster ' added safety ' . i not research every single item registry- i figured if big stores carried it then it must least " ok " . back it goes . if you buy this thing , then good luck you , don't burn toast !	-1
i bought this chair because great reviews , i hesitated spending so much , but figured all features would worth it considering my son would using it couple years . pros : i like i roll it around table , or sink clean up after meals . height adjustment easy convenient . cons : folding it up didn't quite work i thought it would . it didn't lock into folding postition ... didn't really save much space . i would prop it against wall , hope no one knocked it down . we finally stopped folding it up . toys connect tray too dangerous my son , he would usually hit himself face them when he younger , time he older , i didn't really need them . battery operated toy funny smell it whenever it running while . he like it ... but buttons too hard him press when he younger . my son discovered 7 months how pull off extra tray go into dishwasher , so we don't use . he 13 months now , last week discovered how disconnect tray itself fling it off high chair . i washed seat cover per instructions , half time not use dryer , even though it said it could go into dryer , now seat bubling cracking ... i place cloth diaper seat protect my son legs . if i not spent $90.00 chair i would not disappointed ... but he only used it 7 months .	-1
thing you likely use most nail clipper . but it very blunt !!! special cover clipper makes cutting nails impossible , unless baby nail very very long . if i wait until nails long enough cut this thing , my 3-month-old would scratched his face head . i end up buying new baby nail clipper big handle magnifying glass nearby pharmacy . worked much better .	-1

i looked alot other reviews before i bought wished i hadn't because . you can't go off someone else experience , you really experience it yourself . first all it too bulky . suction thing tub didn't stick it way when i tried shower kept falling down . my poor baby kept sliding because there no non-skid bottom tub , so i go out buy small mat put bottom . i bought this tub only because my baby out growing fold away bath chair but it looks though i continue using it buy larger one her . i very temped send it back but i'm just going sell it ebay . i'm sorry but it waste money me . i'm happy it aleast work out other moms , maybe mines defected !	-1
i went chp office get my car seat checked , officer said car seat protection mats not approved considered major safety hazard because it causes car seat become loose . if you use these mats , car seat not installed tightly enough real danger during automobile accidents . don't buy !	-1
product claims carry children up 40 lbs . my daughter only 27lbs . it could not hold her . while it all pockets looks like higher end carriers it not . after one day amusement park straps started strain seperate fromt he carrier . i returned this item got sherpani rumba which wight limit 70lbs . i love it . also , cross terrain claim " load balancing straps distributes weight off parent shoulder onto hips " it not . i horrible pain after hour . both my upper lower back . i suggest you don't waste your money go higher end products like sherpani kelty . this work smaller child , but only if you compfortably carry weight . i like easily adjustable seat back . i able adjust my height my husbands .	-1
i bought this product i going long trip . i put batteries mirror it not work . i put batteries remote it still not work . all would happen little red light would flash you couldn't even turn it off without taking out batteries . waste money !	-1
we received this product off our baby registry couple months before our due date never used it until week before delivery . it worked first time , but never again ! i repeat we used it one time then it stopped working , it just would not turn !!!!! i asked retailer store credit but it after their return period . i then sent email first years explaining situation never received reply . lousy product !	-1
i initially very happy this product . we purchased it transition our 2-year-old double bed . however , plastic hinge bracket broke after several months use . since i liked product , i thought maybe i didn't it adjusted correctly bought second one . it , too , broke ; so i'm now looking sturdier alternative	-1

i thought i would love this , but it just takes too much time energy . germs go through cloth once it wet saliva . then this material rubbed all over cart then i put it my car etc . i just don't see difference not using it . my hands touch it , baby hands touch it etc . i enough keep track bag , baby , wallet , cell phone .... i just dont enough keep track giagantic piece material ! my grocery store those sanitary wipes outside store carts i wipe down handle bar .... far more effective against germs . you better off buying $3 thing purel hand cleaner than this bulky , ineffective cloth	-1

bumper very cute colorful i excited put it baby crib ... until i put it ... no matter how i tried fit it onto crib ( it white spindle jenny lind crib full-size ) it fit very akwardly never quite right . there large spaces where it should fit snugly around inside crib . i very disappointed since it very colorful matches sheet comforter we received gifts	-1
reasons why i not like this potty : 1 ) shield falls off one touch , ussually into potty ! 2 ) potty many cracks crevices bottom collect pee numerous ways . 3 ) it cumbersome empty potty . 4 ) once shield lost ( since it impossible keep attached ) it hard boys sit down not make mess . i highly recommend bjorn potty since it all one piece built shield	-1
suction these bowls so weak baby pulled it off highchair dumped contents few seconds flat . they come lovely colors , though	-1
so ... i bought this our 7 month old . what nightmare . what previous posters said this thing true . it hard get it stay put cart while you put your kid it . it just doesn't happen . then ... when you get your baby , seat portion so narrow it barely width your child hind end . forget bar cover . it just narrow . this thing covers just small area if you child like mine , they reaching over touching everything . add it , back cusion part doesn't even go up top back support . my daughter totally whacked her head back cart seat screamed . cusion part totally doesn't cover it . just bad . just spend extra cash buy something covers whole darn cart	-1
we ordered double stroller because it really good reviews it sounded like it would fit us perefctly . our children 2.5 10 months . our 2 year old almost outgrown back her head higher than back support . also 6 months we two different stollers because both issues rain shield , peek boo window cracking , also black out line seam came apart red fabric . kickers when we pick up our stroller airport mexico latch mechanism gave away when my two kids it . it cloapsed because locking system melted ..... oops , i guess someone forgot check part test !!	-1
i bought this car seat because it looked actractive safe . well , after one month i returned it because it worst car seat ever . car seat sits so upright my sons head always falling completely forward . he never looked comfortable . car seat comes strap covers suppose make car seat comfortable . these things only make it worse because they extremely rough bulky . this car seat extremely heavy even without infant it . carrying handle joke because you push canopy back put your arm under it . canopy also terrible because it barely works . it only works when sun directly above you sky . i constantly change direction i carrying car seat avoid sun beaming his face . ( unlike graco where you pull shade all way down ) i hated returning this because i really liked looks it but i my sons sake . i bought graco seat blackwell print ( which o.k. looking fabric ) . we both soooo much happier . he looks comfortable little more reclined . sun isn't his face i $130 extra dollars i spend something else . i think people mainly buy peg perego because they like way it looks ( i ) or because they expect it high quality because high price ( i ) . but actuality it just sucks . i wish graco would make their prouducts little more stylish because they definitly more practical functional .	-1
i received this seat gift told how wonderful it . i large baby . he almost 17 lbs four months old . so his thighs bottom barely fit it after three four months age . he also able get out it bu straightening his back legs . he didn't seem very happy it . it may work better if you smaller baby , but chubbier ones never fit long	-1

i this exact same soft light green deluxe pillow . i bought pillow when she 2 weeks old . i wearing it almost all day long every day since . she 11 weeks old today . she so comfortable when nursing this pillow . cushion made firm foam . she falls asleep pillow while it around my waist . even when she not nursing or napping , pillow helps me support her weight when i'm sitting or standing . it fits me very comfortably even though i'm plus size . only drawback i need order additional slipcover because it only hung dry , although it machine washable . i really love this fabric , but apparently , this fabric not available purchase separately slipcover , so i guess i'll try oatmeal twill cover .	1
after reading reviews reluctantly we bought stroller . i am glad we didn't listen those naysayers . it best decision we made because stroller wonderful . comments people wrote how stroller awkward heavy bunch rubbish . yes , stroller heavier than its predecessors but they fail mention how sturdy it . we've stroller 2 weeks we hike up some hilly mountains ( stanford dish if you palo alto ) it rides smoothly . it gives me comfort stroller well built protecting our two daughters ( 2 year old 4 weeks old enfant ) . i feel secure stroller not fall apart after few rides like its predecessor . also , we love capabilities , spring shocks smooth ride , shorter so we navigate through some tight corners it not awkwardly long like other double strollers . we toyota sienna it fits just fine our back trunk . weight . yes , it heavier but come , it not " 10 " times heavier . people exaggerate too much . if you accustom carrying your 30 pound toddler your arms , then stroller nothing . people too much wimp . it slightly heavier than its predecessors but not much . they made it heavier because load baring bar what keeps stroller steady sturdy . gives me peace mind my precious asset life ( my two daughters ) protected . only recommendation back two wheels could squeak which annoying . just use silicone spray they all went away . we've through rain , dirt , hot sun this stroller we've so happy it . i highly recommend purchasing it . but make sure you truck , mini-van , or suv . i am not sure if standard vehicle house such stroller . but i figured if you two toddler/enfants , you may consider getting bigger car	1

when we our kids , this mirror really great giving rear-facing child seat occupant ( would our boys ) view driver driver view their faces . soon enough they outgrew seating layout mirror got stowed door pocket . it great kids us we really got lot use out it . but wait , we weren't it yet ! when i got my jeep , i happened come across little mirror again decided try it blind spot mirror . i never liked those little circular ones go side mirrors because they take up too much room they're so small they aren't really very useful . instead i stuck this mirror up left corner my windshield where only thing it blocked low flying aircraft . it provides rear-view covers my blind spot perfectly large enough actually see what going . added bonus because it inside , it never gets wet , icy or fogged up . it my windshield ever since . kids 7 9 now so little mirror almost decade old it still sticks window survived several bumps never broke ! not bad few bucks	1
my floor becoming sea crunched-up goldfish crackers smooshed raisins . car rides consisted me tupperware snacks passing them back my one-year-old because given chance , he would dump whole thing . so snack traps life-saver . he still reach , grab handful throw if he wants , but mostly they've helped keep things clean .	1

i wash all my stuff either dishwasher or using sterilizer . my only complaint it isn't bigger . my son goes through least 7-8 bottles day ... even though there spots 8 bottles ... there isn't enough room my other pieces parts ( we use dr. brown bottles ) . if you dr. brown bottle user , know it works great 5 bottles ... i put my tubes " basket " part ... they stand up just fine .	1

i using blanket my newborn would wake up all night make sure she hadn't kicked off covers ( or kicked it over her face ) . since purchasing this , i don't worry all . she stays warm all night . one recommendation ... buy cotton sleepsack . i fleece sleepsack first it seemed keep baby too warm . cotton tight-knit weave feels warm enough ... even our cold illinois winter nights .	1
this works great our huge king size bed really thick mattress . it also works well no bed frame . you just shove horizontal legs mattress foundation boxes ( or box springs ) it stays place nicely . easy add take away looks clean streamlined . gives me piece mind night my 10 month old baby won't able roll out bed . morning when he wakes though he stands up shakes it so i get up right away pick him up before he throws himself over top it . it only works while baby sleeping but i don't think many potential buyers would expect more out it anyway . it great- highly recommend	1

lady below who said they dont fit her eddie bauer pack play needs realize eddie bauer not pack play - eddie bauer cosco considered just play yard - all play yards not considered equal . name quot ; pack playquot ; exclusive brand therefore these sheets fit just fine . gave them four stars because they're not most luxurious or long lasting sheets block , but they serve their purpose fit just fine	1

i so happy my purchase i bought one my baby nephew .	1
we use this our second child , it help him sleep * much * better . i wish we it our first child ! we own both fleece cotton versions , i prefer fleece - it not get loose quickly cotton one . despite name , this not swaddler itself any but most placid plump babies . our kid easily work his arms out ( usually through slit arm wrap bottom pouch ) if he fussy . however , we still use this daily - top swaddle recieving blanket . this way , swaddle not come undone . yes , you could same diaper pin , but things stay together much longer much neater this than diaper pin ( or even second swaddle recieving blanket . i haven't found good way use it car seat which i feel comfortable - swaddled kid his legs together , doesn't he ? - but we sometimes use it , cocoon style , baby bjorn or sling carrier , it quite magical soothing	1
what amazingly great stroller . this umbrella stoller all bells whistles . it light enough but yet heft . there detachable canopy ... basket underneath ... mesh baggy bottle holder ... winter boot ... rain cover sun shade . there so much . where child lays there even way elevate legs ... you usually don't get lighter strollers . if it gets too hot summer , you even remove some fabric seat so it ventilated . i would say my favorite part canopy there zipper parents store what necessary . first time i seen . haven't really tested it yet , but it seems roll smoothly , close down easily open just easily . i love fact i push up levers back stroller my barefoot .... usually it hurts through my boots . great buy ... you won't regret it . navy one really look black , but canopy seems navy . accents look hot pink picture actually red . good looking	1
this thing awesome ! we 7 month old she just loves this stroller ... so mom ! stoller so lightweight easy maneuver you take it almost anywhere . we live small city stroller handles uneven pavement curbs beautifully . i also taken stroller off-road trail running long i lock front pivot wheel , stoller easily manage rocks , branches , etc . this stoller given me so much flexibility opportunity get out house my daughter ... especially recreationally . things you love stoller : - very easy push , turn maneuver - lightweight - quick release wheels ( all them ) - great shocks - adjustable ( large ) sun visor - folds up compactly - easy use brake front wheel pivot release - cool colors ( we lime green ) - reflectivethe only thing i could recommend enhanced feature would shoulder strap easier carrying . this product great buy defintely worth money !!!!	1

i got this stroller last week ... i agree other reviewers skip joovy ... i only got one because i thought more expensive stroller better . i wrong ... joovy way too heavy hard push - no tray carry anything , not big basket bottom . sit stands front seat way bigger . my 4.5 year old more room back sit stand . i 4.5 year old no means short neither she 44 inches weighs 42 lbs 7 month old weighs 15 lbs . i love infant car seat holder . this works our really well ... i didn't know they this option when i bought it so it bonus me since i thought i going take my 7 month old daughter out her carseat put this stoller , but i just put my infant carseat there . this stoller compatable almost all infant car seats - we graco . it it no means all hard push ... my 4.5 year old loves sit back baby ... definately worth $120 ... i wish i would gotten this one before joovy . i taken this stoller airport shopping so far it made my life easier 4.5 year old infant . i am 5'7 handle push perfect my height - usually problem i other strollers handles lower .	1
this bouncer model best available currently market , even though there few flaws room improvement , other amazonians pointed out . but it work keeps our baby entertained , while leaving parents some much needed time other important things around house . sounds lights easily activated baby movement , but volume not adjusted . vibration mode could keep baby amuzed 1/2 hour first month , but later our baby got used it not care it before . we also like use this bouncer without play bar , simple comfy chair . this way baby could listen see parents or watch together ' baby first ' tv . i higly recommend this product new parents or baby shower gift	1

although those hospital blankets absolute best swaddling , these little suckers best if you're away home trying wrap up screaming infant couch your mother-in-laws , grass picnic , etc . nice tight wrap but cool enough summer , although they little small size so you should just get small medium . time they fit into large , swaddling isn't really needed	1

when i got this pump , it because i single mother my mom wanted give me night off once while . i chose this one because i orginally intended only use it occasionally i didn't much money . then i developed candida ( yeast ) infection my nipples simply would not go away . nursing too painful , but pumping bearable , so effort continue providing milk nature helped me make i used this pump . sure , suction wasn't industrial-strength , i one breast time . however , pump job almost same amount time my son finished his bottles , i even able pump little extra longer-term storage . i able use this pump steady efficiency two months straight ... my son never once any formula . if you planning returning work , i not recommend you purchase this particular pump . go ahead get yourself time-saving double pump . however , if you really going use this just occasionally , i would recommend this product	1
my 4 year old son just didn't fit our new kitchen table chairs . we tried phone books , but they moved ended up floor half time . we pulled out his old hard plastic booster seat but he just too big it . i purchased cooshie booster it perfect !!! he fits it lots room ( he big kid ) , its not all small standard plastic booster seats super soft material really great ! awesome product i highly recommend bigger kids , since it not secure onto chair or seat belt , i won't use it my 20 month old daughter .	1

my wife i very happy this highchair . adjustable height works well , well reclining positions back seat . it folds up relatively thin storage , wheels nice touch . unfortunately , entire tray assembly , while great its ability chose how close or far it baby , requires two hands remove or adjust . thankfully , 5-point-harness keep even squirmiest babies safely place while you use those two hands take care tray . it would nice few more themed toys or gadgets . tiger-teething-ring nice ( attaches tray so it won't fall floor ) , but most other fisher-price high chairs this price range come lot more baby . that our only hangup . otherwise , this good value	1

this absolutely best bottle market . after working daycare nanny , i preference these . then after my sister my nephew used them i knew minute i found out i expecting i would using them too . reason i love these bottles so much they very easy baby latch onto . most other bottles use very small nipples whereas these use nipple quite large , more like breast . if you think how woman body made really look nipples you see what i mean . able latch better allows them eat better much less gas spit up . i also love how easy they warm up bottle warmer or crock pot . because they use liner , milk heat up much quicker than standard bottle thick plastic - very important thought 3am !!! some people think always liners costly annoying . but not really . 100 eight ounce liners cost $8 last 2 2 1/2 weeks . so not bad you might think . ( if this truly issue you , consider advent bottles . they also relatively large nipples . but because they not use liner , you cannot eliminate air bottle they take much longer warm up . )	1
i love this stroller , tell all my friends it . our daughter 3 months old when i purchased it . there not better rated stroller available when i researched , there still not . you run , walk or rollerblade behind this stroller feel confident your child safe . lilyana now 4 1/2 months loves going our daily walks , occasional rollerblading . she fussy girl , ( only ) when it comes strapped down carseat , but loves comfort hammock like feel bob . we live florida , sun-guard canopy , she well covered . some other factors which made we chose bob : * braking mechanism , which hard find , wrist strap which if you should fall , locks back wheels ( unlike most strollers market ) . this feature great rollerbladers . * 5 point safety harness * 70 pound weight limit ( highest i found )* metal frame ( others more plastic metal )* shock absorbers , great rocking/bouncing her sleep * swivel front wheel , which locks simple pin . * simple lily likes it , we tried several others , all babies-r-us stock . cost pretty high , but would you put price safety your child , if you fall while exercising ? thanks hearing me out	1
it still waiting baby arrive , so i haven't used it yet .... but i love utility design it	1
we twins these mattress pads much more convenient than trying wrestle getting new sheets cribs middle night . they holding up well through frequent washings easy attach . i gave it 4 stars because it not extremely soft , though it isn't bad . i also like top layer breathable - gives me peace mind	-1
very cozy -- great wrapping up after bath get warm . but honestly , it usually laundry . since swaddling lasts short period time , it use pretty limited . however , when it clean , i like it around .	-1
we very pleased how easy this install , despite fact we rather unusual banisters . ours actually half wall half banister , but plastic just flexible enough bend over ledge . directions weren't great , but it fairly self explanatory . we feel much more comfortable letting our one-year old play upstairs loft now	1
we bought this when my daughter newborn , we surprised her peg perego car seat fit into it so well , now shes year half even if home she climbs into it plays steering wheel . she always loved it , snow ground picnics , its great , lot better than plastic wheels , front tire swivels also little switch so it becomes more like jogging stroller front wheel doesnt move . weve really liked it so far , except harness not fitting very tiny baby , its great . only thing now i 2 kids i cant use it cause i need double	1
while not portable i assumed it would ... it great space saver over std . highchair great	1
this seems secure seat , our almost-5-year old comfortable it . buckling system bit inconvenient - you really get your head down there put strap just right get side thingy snapped . i wish our son could buckle himself this point , but this seat makes it too hard . it also not seat you want air travel , it unwieldy carry around . but , all all i would say it good purchase	-1
i originally bought this bag trip disney world . it held everything great , stayed place less cumbersome than full backpack . although i not using it carry children gear , i carried umbrella , 3 bottles water , granola bars , sun glasses , cellphone , keys , wallet baseball hat small souvenirs it always stayed put fit great ! i am looking forward using bag diaper bag , it held up wonderfully vacation bag so far	1
i always graco infant seats my children . i got this one baby number 4 love it . it so cute ! cover just wonderful fall winter months . also , i love color it .	1
these wall hangings lovely . different textures very cool . maybe mine different than everyone elses , but they came little ribbon loops back , i don't get why there issue hanging them . they're very very cute , look adorable room .	1
i already single jogging stroller ( not bob ) happy it . we process adopting our second child , which we less than 24 hours notice , so lot money going legal costs , baby stuff , my time off work , result i concerned spending this much stroller , but worth every cent . bob duallie , i am ecstatic , overjoyed , delighted , thrilled looking forward my next trip out . my first trip out , i put my 2 year old 11 week old went six mile walk . trip so smooth , both kids slept most time . seats recline enough so my baby nearly flat , no problems his head bobbing around ( pardon pun ) . shocks give this stroller incredibly smooth ride , which transits less work my arms . i didn't realize how much effort went into other stroller , pushing it turning it . smooth ride also allowed us walk faster , plus when trying lose weigh t.t he stroller turn circles itself , allowing extremely sharp turns . very nice , especially when inside small store , like starbucks . windows up top well placed enough i actually see my kid face , not just their little bodies . straps easiest adjust any stroller i've used . there extra padding shoulder straps cushion kid shoulders . straps waist don't come out sides , ( this kinda hard explain ) strap attached center seat , sides come around child , more like belt allowing snugger fit . even my 70 year old mother great time pushing stroller . mesa orange , it more like burnt orange , brown trim i am very glad i got it ! it not all like neon orange it appears some photos . sure get tray , i forgot order it stroller . storage little shallow , but double wide , there still plenty room stuff .	1
i return work after my second daughter born no place pump . i bought this pumped my car several months . great	1
this excellent product . it such good idea given many warnings out sids . i felt reassured night our child would able breathe if she happened roll sides or ends crib ... she wouldn't get her arms or legs stuck slats . i expecting fabric would white cotton ... happily surprised it made white satin material . we even family members thought someone made cribshield us .	1
it works fantastically purposes we purchased it !! sometimes there little interference , but if you just move monitor ( sometimes moving it even just couple inches left or right make difference ) it work great ! we no problems whatsoever we would definitely buy this monitor again !! night vision works great , even our son dark room . color great long there sufficient light .	1
i actually put this my daughter wish list then broke down bought it myself her because i just couldn't wait see if she'd get it her 1st birthday . i always take tubbies my daughter so i like fun toys tubby i enjoy too . my daughter loves her out-of-water xylophone thinks this one pretty neat too - i admit i play it more than she this point . she only 9-1/2 months right now so i think she gets bit older she'll enjoy it more . my only complaint , reason i didn't give it 5 stars , it should come more play sheets they not waterproof . other than , fun toy . after i got this , i find it target same price it listed here no sh charges but still don't regret getting it .	-1
even though this costs bit more , its worth every penny ! it so easy put buggy ! my son comfy fits it very well !	1
it great manual pump , but it just manual pump after all . manually pumping both breasts one time takes more than twice long double electric pumping get same amounts milk . it would impossible me keep pumping work if i take much time out every work day . however i keep this pump my desk drawer emergencies ( like time i forgot my other pump home ) or out-of-office meetings ( because it small discrete ) . it also great occasional home use or women who need leave house pump every once while . i'm giving it 4 stars because i don't think it should advertized use full time job	1
these cloths awesome . they smell great don't crumble like other brands . they work well forsponge baths when there no time real bath ! love them	1
this our first only child seat worked quite well us . we need put specialized cushon our baby head . there recent articles warning against letting your baby sleep child seat sine babies ' head muscles aren't very strong , support good addition . i find triangle grip excellent but even small baby seat , you not want cary this very far all . my wife fact back injury carying our son this seat just car our house ! some day , these seats may come some other innovation making them more ergonomic parents . i don't know it would different seat , but warned , these things not meant actually carry child hand women weakened muscles after giving birth . it terrible combination . carying baby this seat should task husbands several months i found out too late . back seat , it works quite well car baby trend snap-n-go . we use snap-n-go quite often it prevents you repeatedly removing your child seat snapping him back ( which trying you your kid ) . i disappointed unit no spf rating sun shade . feature may not made it child seats but sun protection extremely important babies it wouldn't difficult use protective fabric . i called baby trend they no idea if how well shade actually blocked harmful uv rays . other seats may not this feature either but we look closely it future after sternly warned child safety class hospital . babies super sensitive skin it important avoid any direct sunlight if possible . i know it sounds extreme alarmist but it also should very easy recommended american adadamy pediatrics ([...]) . now , you would need additional cover top included cover . pros : consumer report top pick , not expensive somecons : no spf rating or sun uv protection listed sun shade . heavy non ergonimic cary hand ( not complaint specific this particular seat , they probably all )	-1
i diehard graco fan . when my daughter born 2002 graco snugride top rated infant seat ( i put lot stock into what consumer reports say ) . infant seat great we got it part travel system . i loved both stroller seat , very sad when she outgrew seat around 1 years old . i tried eddie bauer convertible seat next it horrible , straps always twisted my daughter head always fell forward onto her chest when she fell asleep . i quickly changed graco comfortsport ( one overhead drop down bar ) she loved it . it more padding , her head rested side carseat instead her chest straps never twisted . it easy get out not too heavy lug around airports . when she outgrew seat i decided make switch britax . although roundabout rate #1 cr i went marathon because only thing cr didn't like it infant latch ( which i wouldn't need my child 3yrs old ) it higher weight limit than roundabout . i own honda accord 4 door my husband drives 4 door toyota echo ( tiny ) . seat fits perfectly well both vehicles forward facing position . toyota latch honda doesn't but both cars it doesn't move . partly due fact my husband excellent installing partly due car seats weight . it quite heavy , it pain haul around airports . my husband usually just loosens straps wears it like backpack through airport . my daughter loves it , ( we girly print , not granite ) it plenty room her , she never uncomfortable sleeping it ( her head doesn't sit her chest either ) , though she very bright 4 year old she never able get out seat . i love fact she it until she 65lbs five point restraint straps never twist . britax also thoughtful things like adding velcro sides seat hold straps place when you're putting your child padded area under clip so your child isn't burned hot plastic summer ( or freezing winter ) . i plan staying britax here out	1
love it , it must our babies room , but only drawback our wipe warmer ( lion heart 2004 model ) not fit correctly . fix this we just taped down wipe warmer . i love everything you need placed diaper depot so easy grab one handed course . note : we not use bottom basket under wipe warmer diaper storage but instead cloth towel holder it works great , especially if you boy need alittle protection and/or clean up showers ! also our diaper stacker holds more adds decor nursery them	-1
i bought this my first baby ( now 2 1/2 ) . he didn't like spend much time jumperoo would only last couple minutes . i recently pulled it out tried my 5 month it . she bit fussy first but now absolutely loves this . she jumps up down hour , laughing playing toys front . any toy keep 5 month old amused more than few minutes wonderful so i would definitely recommend it . i would given it 5 stars but feel gadgets front could better	-1
we bought this swing just under year ago , when our baby two months old . she loved this swing either asleep it , or just peacefully playing looking around room us . now she 14 months not used it awhile , so two months ago friends bought it us their newborn son . they used it only two months , when one day they turned it off smoke started coming out motor compartment . batteries intact , but swing didn't work whatsoever anymore , even new batteries . i called fisher price , they very concerned smoke . i didn't purchase receipt anymore , wasn't sure if it still covered warranty . they asked product code run code , where i bought it ( babies us ) . they now sending me brand new motor housing ( entire top portion swing , which you just attach legs ) . they also sending pre-paid label put box , so i send them dead motor housing . how great ! i am so impressed amazed fisher price customer service . no receipt , still they totally helping me out basically replacing swing . talk gaining customer loyalty ! it good know you pay $130 baby item get your money worth all around . swing itself just wonderful . motor quiet , my baby loved moving bugs , two swinging directions offers nice change baby . swing colors great well , soothing neutral , instead usual super bright primary colors most other swings	1
i sent this baby shower gift it used right away . new parent loved it praised great smell	1
i completely understand your concern . although , if you read instructions any mobile , when child old enough sit or stand crib ( around 6 months ) , you supposed take it off . they not built anyone play them . my son liked his mobile so much when he old enough reach it , we took it off my husband attached it top his hutch . this way we still able play song , but he couldn't reach it . i think this mobile perfect way add room theme . those who looking buy this mobile , or any other mobile : go store where you buying your crib , try it out . people babies us must thought i nuts , because i took quilt mobile set i wanted took them crib i buying . i able determine if mobile would fit before i bought it , i got see how colors bedding looked color crib . this eliminated lot hassle me later taking mobile back if it didn't fit	1
my mother-in-law bought these my daughter . first , i skeptical how entertaining they would , but my daughter took them right away . beginning , she would just chew them smile quacking duck noise , but now she interacts more seems love feeling all different textures . she also loves knock them down when i stack them up . they won't entertain her hours , but she always thrilled see them when i break them out first time day	-1

i recently purchased this potty my 16 month old son . we not actively training but i wanted introduce him it . first night i got it , he went pee pee boo boo it . i screamed clapped sang little song . he really likes it . he even brought it out bathroom took it into living room watch wiggles while sitting it . i like color , how it fits his size(he 27lbs 32 inches tall ) . he sit it get up all himself . its very sturdy , it doesn't wobble or tip over like some . my son even held onto one sides ( while sitting it ) leaned over pick up one his books potty didn't tip all . one reviewer said splashguard little short , but i haven't problem . my son tends look down himself while he going , so everything pointing south anyway . i love there only 2 pieces this chair . very easy clean . i safety 1st chair flip top lid detachable splashguard i absolutely hated this thing . my son would pull off splashguard walk around house it . he too concerned lid turning around chair pull lid up down instead concentrating trying go potty . baby bjorn there no distractions , no music , no removable pieces(except bowl)which allows him focus going potty . i just really like this potty chair . i would highly recommend this chair	1
my son now 18 months old . i used this product time he born until he 10 months old started using sippy cups . i don't know what i would without it . my husband deployed boiling bottles takes tons time . my dishwasher sanitizing cycle , but when i used it bottles nipples would still film them . sterilizer kept them looking new . i also felt better knowing they through sterilizing process microwave . if you want use your dishwasher , i would still recommend using this , it not take much time all . i used it medula pump parts gerber bottles , even tall 9 oz bottles would fit if you put them right . i would highly recommend this anyone baby , it one few products i actually used regular basis	1

i bought this after reading other amazon reviews . i love this jumperoo . i put my daughter this when she almost four months old ( she great neck control ) . although she couldn't reach floor ( pillow worked great underneath her ) she immediately started play toys turn around seat . few days later she jumping fool . she smiles laughs this thing . watch out really messy diapers , poop jumps right up back front	1
overall this good gate . i use it puppy , so it much more different experience me than using it " baby gate " . intstalation easy . first i thought gate broken becuase latch didn't meet upper end stuck out farther than lower ends . this supposed way . i just want make clear . when you fasten it wall , pressure pushes top together so it latch . use product litlle hard . latch requires you push two buttons ( pinch them your index thumb ) pull it side ( left or right depending few things ) while holding buttons . pushing it forward or towards you . it sounds hard . first . but you'll get hang it . using 2 hands if you makes it easier . quality product great . it withstood lot . but keep mind i 5 pund puppy not 10+ pound child . one other thing i must note there bar bottom touches floor . it very easy trip over . when you , it hurts . don't let this factor alone deter you buying this gate . it good relativly inexpensive product one only decent pressure mount gates out there i could find	-1
this great booster seat . we bought one 5 years ago used it both kids . it folds up nice durable easy clean . we used take it camping us strap it picnic tables . best booster seat we ever tried	1
well , i can't give them too bad review since this only pacifier my son take . however , i can't give it all five stars either ... one , this pacifier really bulky compared other pacifiers . it almost looks like nipple you would put bottle ... it bulky . second , there attatcher attatches pacifier clips baby cloths so pacifier doesn't fall floor , even more bulkier than pacifier . so using two them your baby almost consumed this pacifier . i guess my biggest beef this pacifier more cosmitically . it ugly pacifier . besides it ugly , it pretty good pacifier . i like my son didn't problem nipple confusion due using this . moment he born he just high need suck i just couldn't spare my breast whole entire day , so we give him pacifier . he never problem using this pacifier then nursing me .	-1
i many stroller over span last 7 years 3 children this best one yet . so easy push isn't so wide you can't fit through doorway but wide enough so kids don't fight . my oldest even jumps front wheel cover ( i know he shouldn't but what you going ) i comfortably push all three . love it . love it . love it . get this stroller if you looking one	1

bed great . took while put together but absolutely no problems it . my wife who weights 125 lbs laid this bed it not even come close falling apart . it states max weight should 50 lbs but it appears handle more than double . my daughter loves it i recommend it if you dont mind time it takes put together . sure it bit tricky but i believe way poles made it more support . loved fact i could use mattress her crib .	1
my husband i bought this because our baby born right before we would moving back us . we very happy it it makes traveling baby breeze . we never worry if hotel we're provides cribs , or if they safe matter . we it almost three months now , using it exclusivly , only thing wrong small tear fabric . i no trouble setting this up , however i try it out before baby came so i wasn't exhausted time . i don't think it would gone same if i . i can't imagine what we would without this thing	1
i absolutely love this monitor . if i recommend only one baby item , it would this . 2.5 months , monitor gone off twice . i no idea if they false alarms or not , because time i sprinted her crib , she already startled out her deep sleep beeping monitor , which i like . even though she healthy , full-term baby 9 both her apgars non-smoker household risk sids low her , i great peace mind knowing her breathing monitored all times	1
i ordered safari comforter , dust ruffle , sheets ( yellow green ! ) , rugs , fleece blankets animals corners , bumper pads my boys ' room - it all so cute !!! it restful fun same time . i love you order only parts you need . only one my boys needed bumper pads , but both needed everything else . i hard time finding place where i could get comforter dust ruffle without bumper pads . i prefer yellow sheets over lime green . we lots guests , everyone comments how cute boys ' room , but even better boys love it	1

while my son still riding rear facing car , he would often lose his pacifier . without pacifier keeper , it next impossible locate . i trouble searching around carseat because i could not see where reach . i found this pacifier keeper useful because i always knew spencer pacifier near . now trips car less stressful . he even big enough find it himself ! i never worry it fallen floor car , either . what great idea	1

i purchased stroller sight unseen , no one around here it stock yet . i 20 month old 7 month old . yes , it still heavy , but graco never claimed it lighter , just more compact , so i just figure it help tone my arms up ! it gets around great ! only two things i found i would change stroller 1 ) cupholders small diameter not accomodate most my sons sippy cups .... 2 ) i hard time lowering cargo basket , maybe its just my model ? i received stroller brake shattered , but called graco they immediately sent replacement free charge .... great cust service . i'd spend money again	-1
removable cover ( zipper ) make this easy clean ( just make sure velcro stuck itself when you wash it or it stick all your nice socks . my wife tried boppy first month then got this , which she used continually next six . you even use it standing up or when you move around since strap goes around your back . strap also provides back support . pocket nice touch ( you put your lansinoh it ) only possible downside it isn't easy put one hand ( if you already cradling baby	1

i initially bought rainforest bouncer but wasn't too happy it . hanging toys hung way too low made hard plastic . my baby got his foot stuck them . i returned it this one my baby boy loves it . he smiled immediately puppy when i turned it watched it entire time then went sleep . i actually liked idea this bouncer because puppy more upbeat rather than soothing like other bouncers so my baby gets some playtime . time he gets tired , puppy music shuts off he sleeps peacefully vibrating chair . my only minor complaint i wish ball toy bar cracked or squeaked . but overall , terrific purchase !	1

i given this walker friend who child progressed so fast he skipped walker stage . when i brought it home my son instantally fell love it shear fact he could move around pretty freely he really enjoys it . it little basic design i found toys not stay put very long they not made very well very basic . my main problem this walker it pain butt put away it doesn't fold up easily it doesn't stay folded very long . i also am problems ajusting height walker my friend put it all way down now i can't get it go back up so my son basically standing all himself when he it ( which i am not complaining )	-1
i ordered this monitor listen my mother who unable get around because i am unable sit her every moment . i wanted able some freedom roam around room able listen her case she needed me . monitor wasn't expensive , so i wasn't expecting much . i pleasantly surprised this monitor picks up every noise room . there also clip so you attatch it yourself not contained one room house . it either plugged or ran batteries . i couldn't more pleased monitor . i would recommend it because it worth every cent	1
my son 7 months old just started sitting high chairs restaurants shopping carts . so far , clean shopper working pretty well us . fabric thick , so it doesn't make tiny package . it also doesn't fold up neatly , so you kind just wad it up . it isn't cushioned , but if it it would huge , i enough issue trying carry my son , cart cover , my purse , whatever else i might need . besides , he doesn't really need cushioning . even 7 months , he perfectly comfy thick bedspread-like fabric . clean shopper comes thick plastic bag ( sort thing bedspreads or other linens come ) zips closed . it snug fit get there because wadded nature bundle , but it works fine . handle short taut , so isn't much use . longer strap so it could shoulder worn or hung stroller would better . loops work well , it relief clean place my son sit play anchored toys . he can't throw toys floor , he stays entertained . there velcro tabs front fastened around front shopping cart or high chair . this keeps it place better . leg holes don't match up exactly whatever he sitting , but it doesn't cause problem . my main problem clean shopper belt strap not attach seat . it completely seperate piece . unless you careful snap belt clips together , looping belt around part seat , you end up losing strap . somehow i've lost mine after only few uses . i kept it rolled up inside thing when i removed it cart , it probably fell out parking lot somewhere . when handling baby , your purse , whatever your cart ( or trying eat restaurant ) , it very easy overlook such small item . since website sells replacement straps , it seems they aware issue . it shame they don't velcro tabs stick it back shopper , making it harder lose strap . i've ordered two replacements black , so i see strap more clearly against my blue clean shopper . i also make certain i buckle strap clips . it good seat cover overall , definitely worth . just careful strap	-1
hamper very sturdy . it also large enough hold quite lot clothes . i would highly recommend it .	1
i started out different shopping cart cover i bought grocery store . it worked ok , but it didn't work all costco because carts extra wide . i bought floppy seat it works like charm . it only one i've found that wide enough costco sam club carts . , it fluffy , comfy , easy use . regarding one reviewer comment - yes , you feed strap through back - but every shopping cart cover out there requires you . i can't get it one hand , but it big enough i put it seat , put my son seat , then get it perfectly situated once he sitting strapped . my only complaint it pretty big , but if it smaller it probably wouldn't fit big carts - which why i like it so much first place . plus , it covers every inch so my very curious son can't find random shopping cart or highchair spots suck	1
this set great my daughter loved it since shes doras fan everything . i love sheets they soft great if anything spills it it easy clean just perfect . i got this set kids 29.99 but amazon price i say its worth it . its great buy .	1

i love how easy this stroller use , way it looks , way it handles drives , most importantly my son loves ride it ! i say " nearly perfect " only because i wish it reclined . but this doesn't seem prevent my son pleasant nap it .... i just think he'd more comfortable if it reclined . i'd keep everything else it same , i would definitely recommend this stroller someone who travels her child much i ( once month least )	-1
if you're concerned plastic bottles , this excellent alternative . too bad it hard find them retail stores . it should promoted more , no babies should drinking out plastic bottles leach toxic chemicals anyway .	1
i bought this stroller my baby girl i haven't used it yet my wife due month now but everything came perfect conditions no broken pieces also i got it $130.00 60% off good deal , i don't know how it using it streets but i come back share my experience .	-1
i contemporary home . front stairs second floor slotted w/spaces plus metal tubular hand rails spaces landing same hand rail . we moved when my children much older . suddenly , i two year old grandchild one way . i panicked . what safety . glass or pexiglass would taken too long install very costly . suddenly i saw ad railnet . while it probably easier put it straight opening , we successful figuring out how string netting angle . i feel so much better knowing children not able fall through railing . we plan putting one under stair slats well . i highly recommend this product . it inexpensive , simple strong .	1
i love this bumper . only reason i got this begin because when i removed old traditional fluffy cotton bumper pads , which i realized weren't safe , my 4 month old would squirm around , his legs or arm would end up sticking out slats he would get stuck . so i realized i needed something block slats . i happy find this new breathable bumper keep his arms legs crib . my only concern whether or not i'd able easily change crib sheet once this installed . i ! my husband secured this bumper ( velcro pads ) extremely tight all way around . spend few extra minutes ( it takes 2 people ) then you not remove bumper get sheets off ! i even completely pull mattress out crib get sheets off easier if i need , bumper stays place since it fits so snugly against sides crib . it almost like it not even there . i highly recommend this product	1
i carried my first child everywhere this . she didn't care stroller who would ? hip hammock she carried around , able see everything eye level ( instead looking everyone knees ) close mommy ( or daddy ) got cuddled constantly . i would walk mall hours her there , she slept it i could sit down her it rest or even feed her . i loved i never needed take it off , but even when i it so simple ! trick getting it fit well make sure waist strap very snug child should slightly front your hip , not actually side . i put my girl , make sure she evenly positioned middle " seat " then pull her closely me while adjusting shoulder strap . you pull it nice tight , but not so tight it rides up your neck . i recommend trying it home first getting it just how you like i t-t hen only undo front strap take it off . otherwise you pull front back when you're " out " that difficult . i found best positioning baby mom baby back arm under mother arm which then draped over child back then easily " hold " bottom hammock or just hang free . i found i didn't actually " hold " my daughter while she hammock . my big complaint strap gets twisted padding eventually there no fixing it . i wish they would put non slip gripper bottom strap so it doesn't slip toward your neck . i think this would fix bunching padding happens . however , i loved this thing so much i'm just going buy new one my second child . i know i get my money worth ! it saves my back shoulders . i tried front carriers just can't stand them more than 15 minutes .

this made really well protects baby well also seems very comfortable . it also easy carry all our stuff , especially when out all day . it great walking because it steers really well very smooth . but , shopping stores it difficult maneuver down narrow aisles because it wide . i picked this over metrolite because other seemed too wobbly . it bit heavy lift car , but i am strong , so this isn't major issue , but my mom could barely lift it into car . my daughter also slept stroller fully reclined , which awesome doing yard work summer . we even taken this beach loaded everything into bottom over handles , there so much storage space below . baby also well protected sun under awesome canopy . but , i switched lightweight narrow stroller taking my 21 month old daughter out longer trips since she doesn't always want sit it entire time .	-1
i gave seat itself 5 stars - i guess our car gets 3 stars :) seat wonderful - easy install , good latch fit , foot it level seat out , nice lining . unfortunately , we going return it get seat our soon-due newborn ! it too long ( head foot ) fit comfortably our car . we don't center latch points , so it go behind seat . car seat so long , once it installed appropriate level newborn , seat front it almost completely upright pushed forward more than comfortable 5'7 " person . reference , we 2003 subaru forester . before you buy this seat , see if you find friend one ... check it out your car make sure it fits ! i didn't expect it problem - it wasn't our first child seat smaller . so , benefit this carseat ( rear facing 30 lbs ! ) could it downfall you if you don't large vehicle	1

we live 1.5 story home where master only thing upstairs my husband runs isp home - lots computers house , so we find good monitor would drown out static electronics outside world , but allow us hear our little pip-squeek clearly . first i thrilled sony when i used it downstairs during her daytime napping loved i could set it voice-activated only hear it when she reallllly awake ! but night when we used it upstairs it kept picking up interferrence form loud static chirp after several hours silence even though it voice-activated mode . i tried moving it several times , but finally ended up going back old fp sounds lights one we which really wasn't any better ! ( run up down stairs try all combinations 9 channels receiver transmitter sony royal pain ! ) next day i went target found first years digital 2.4 ghz monitor what difference ! it same price sony , but it searches clear channel like your phone . i afraid it would interfere out 2.4 ghz phones , but after week , no problems we no static/interferrence ! it crystal clear no matter where house ( hubby even took it into computer room able hear her wake up just fine ! ) i know everyone environment different , but sony definately didn't work us	1
i usually love first years products . i already fisher price healthy care booster seat loved it . i wanted leave one my parents one travel so i thought i'd try this one . i expecting love swing feature , it one thing i thought missing out fisher price one . well , i returned this chair w/in 24 hours bought second fisher price one . here reasons why ; base chair hollow wobbly , it also very wide didn't comfortably fit across normal kitchen chair . you attach straps yourself when purchased they also too wide . their tightest level they still way too loose secure . thought swing out feature would great but when tray swings out , then you wipe baby hands , you're putting your hands under his pits lift him off , he already got his hands leftover mess tray . back chair comes off every time you fold it down . you take chair apart adjust level . when folded up , it not compact portable fisher price model . yourself favor splurge extra $5 healthy care booster seat .	-1
this product absolutely useless . save your money . first problem this product area supposed fit over buckle part car seat carrier simply not fit over it . addition , there no way attach it carrier , stroller , or whatever . so when you try put your child into wherever you wish use it , all it slide around . so it more hassle trying use it every time than just dealing occasional blowout	-1
i've tried lots storage bags , far medela ranks lowest . these spill , you store them upright freezer ... if your freezer compact mine food feed five people , storing milk upright just too hard . these bags not ziplock seal them , which means they leaky unreliable if you hurry ( like if you more than one kid you work ) . buy gerber or lansinoh bags zip seals them . they both stored flat more convenience , they stand their own . pumping into bag fine if you someone who wants fumble attaching it pump ( medela bags ) , or you use your medela pump your reliable pump kit pour your milk into gerber or lansinoh storage bag ease . i use medela lactina plus , i find this method works best me . simple , clean easy .	-1

we switched bottles my daughter more times than i would like admit . she gas discomfort all them . i decided try avent bottles ... i bought twelve them first they seemed relieve some gas . but they leak horribly . sometimes it few drops . but most times it like continuous stream formula . couple times i wasn't paying close enough attention bottle while feeding formula ended up soaking my daughter bib , her sleep sack , her onesie , my shirt . entire bottle emptied all over us before i knew it ... leak fast ! i tried every suggestion given me : mixing formula seperate container , mixing it bottles , using sealing disks mix bottle ; heating before adding bottles , heating bottles ; wetting nipples , not wetting nipples ; making sure bottle rim properly inserted into nipple ring , etc . i wrote letter avent called twice this issue . each time , customer service rep spoke down me said i must not read followed directions ( which i ) . don't waste your money these expensive , poorly designed bottles !!! these worst market my experience .	-1
i owned my diaper dekor plus 25 months . 2005 , i found glowing reports wall street journal most other places . it definitely easy use refills last quite awhile , but ... trapdoors broken twice . i contacted regal lager year ago they sent free replacement . free replacement broke less than 6 months later . you can't expect it contain smell when trapdoors always broken ! this week , i contacted regal lager again they said replacement $10 . i loved this pail until trapdoors broke . unfortunately , it looks like it common design flaw i browse reviews last year or so . i am engineer i don't know what say , except i am really annoyed product not more durable . regal lager would well spend some time money engineer more robust spring system , instead relying $10 replacement parts-especially since loyalty diaper pails so fickle ! now i decide whether spend $10 replacement , try fix it myself , get different pail or maybe none above . what point enough , enough ?	1

" " hooks look so flimsy i wouldn't trust them ... again , they sell thicker , sturdier " " hooks look like they work much better than this , so that what i'll purchase . plus , parent cupholder also extremely flimsy ... already " arms " fallen off several times just moving it table kitchen counter ! thirdly , i'm not sure if it " clips " came my packet ( perhaps defect ) or if they all made this way ... but it extremely difficult get screws into clips ... then they didn't fasten correctly . no matter how i tried ( i worked it close hour i consider myself pretty good these things ! ) , i could not get clips tighten properly . they continued loose ... even using smaller screws . perhaps my stroller tubing " too small " ??? very unlikely , but it just might case . this going back store , where i purchase insulated parent cupholder $5 , package two ( thick ) " " hooks $3 my child learn " deal " holding her snack cup straw cup . i save myself $10 , headache backache attempting continue get this correctly , my child get added bonus learning responsible her own items !!! yourself favor don't bother this product !!!	-1

i've heard some say this best warmer available . if so , parents s.o.l. heating so inconsistent . same amount water same amount milk produce different temperature every single time . sometimes way too cold sometimes way too hot . when heating indicator light turns off you must right there pull bottle out or it continue significantly warm bottle without any water medium . sure loosen your bottles cap during heating check see travel disc not place . otherwise , bottles ( esp . brown ) overflow . if happens cleaning inside warmer major hassle because milk burned onto heating plate . carrier too short mr. brown 8oz . bottles or any other similar height . tubes provided premeasure water joke . caps so hard close open you need two really strong hands maybe multiple tools shut or flip tops open . course , you likely holding your crying squirming baby one arm while trying open cap not spill all water . they tried get fancy shape tubes cap they forgot make them easy use . i just can't believe someone can't design better " mouse trap " . add insult injury , taps handle supposed hold top bottle storage compartment just broke off ...

we bought this tubside seat just today tried it out first time our baby , who 5.5 months old just sitting up his own . initially it looked great , seemed very sturdy we thought he would love able sit play his toys . however , getting him out we noticed plastic edges around where his legs go actually very sharp , our baby tall end spectrum , it impossible get him out seat without scraping up his little legs knees . it not if he going get any shorter , so i don't think there any solution problem . i think safety 1st could better job making plastic area more comfortable , or even put some padding location . i'm surprised more reviewers didn't this problem . our baby , who normally loves bathtime , it painful frightening experience . we returning item . since you can't leave your baby unattended water anyway , we might well just get non-slip mat hold him until he gains more balance . i recommend you save your money this one	-1

this my second superyard . first one i bought many years ago when superyard made protruding metal hinges which somewhat hazardous invited mouthing little teethers . aside little stiff fold ( which might because it new ) this model vast improvment over old . it couple inches taller seems sturdier . great blocking off christmas tree or any other part house . cruising babies love go round round inside you hang busy box or other toys side amuse crawling baby . during football season , my friends i take our superyards tailgate join them together make super superyard , so all toddlers safely play together . it easy clean using pressure nozzle hose outdoors . minor drawback it scooted across floor or climbed out determined toddler . i really need say any play yard should always used only under adult supervision ? final comment - one most useful pieces child-care equipment i've ever owned . only reason i gave it 4 stars insteat 5 because my experiences north states ' customer service poor	1

other parents told us these , specifically vanilla scented ones . baby #1 bottle fed took advent pacifier right away . we used scented soothies whenever we couldn't get bottle ready fast enough her likes . not sure if it shape soothie pacifier or scent , but she always calmed down wihle we'd finish getting bottle ready . baby #2 also bottle fed , but not take any pacifier right away . we tried these regular soothies well vanilla ones advent ones too . she eventually took advent . it really up each baby what they like . but these definately worth trying . addition regular vanilla ones , there also various sizes , including preemie , pacifiers attached small stuffed , plush animals easier babies find put into their mouth ... also easier mom dad back car , darkened bedroom , etc	1
my 4.5 month old son never liked plastic bathing tubs , so right very beginning , he big tub tub seat . he loved bath time until just few weeks ago , when he outgrew our original especially baby ( bru " house " brand ) tub seat . desperation , we searched shelves bru settled mother touch . i can't say enough good things this tub seat . head support features soft washcloth-like insert cushion newborn delicate head , it repositioned or removed baby grows . two-position back reclines newborns , sits up straighter older babies . entire seat up high enough quite bit water needed tub , but i found it makes it easier control how deep my baby sits water ( old tub seat , he up his ears order enough water bathe ) . one things my son hated his previous tub seat he couldn't sit up it . design mother touch provides enough support allow baby sit up mostly unassisted , ample padding makes sure he doesn't bruise himself hard edges . even though there lots support padding , it still very important closely supervise your baby when using this ( or any ) tub seat . reviewer mentioned couple things things i'd like respond : * there no suction cups base : i found rubber grips provide more than enough traction , but tubs may vary . * she would like strap : seat i strap ( it stored underneath seat , so may not immediately identifiable ) , so i wonder if seat redesigned recently . overall , my son i very happy this tub seat , i've recommending it friends . they'll buy it new instead getting it hand-me-down , though . i foresee him able use it most his first year before he outgrows it !	1
this best carseat out there . it above peg perego britax . it weighs only 8 pounds so it doesn't break your arm it so easy adjust . best feature base designed so it not move car . i've graco infant seats completely flipped sideways when i made turns because they just weren't secure even special belt clip . only down side canopy bit floppy but it still it job . 5 stars !!!	1
i bought this dakota backless booster my nearly 6 year old . she previously using jupiter komfort kruiser xl100 , which i loved . komfort kruiser booster back , although it still fits her this day , she eager move into backless booster . i think dakota booster works great . it gets her height she needs seatbelt , but allows her feel more like big kid not back . this booster quality item large enough fit her until she old large enough no longer require booster . pocket side handy well , although not work well drinks ( i advise buying bottle holder put arm rest ! )	1
this one my favorite products i purchased new mommy . i love it . it warms avent bottles great . it took some trials determine how much water add but now i it down great . you over heat then you burn yourself if your not careful . it not like negative reviews if you pay attention use right amount water . it not warm playtex ventair bottles . i guess because vent but i preferred avent bottles anyway . cooler keep bottles cold up 8 hours if you remember freeze freezer pack each day . we 2 story house this helped us so much . i other first year single warmer also it my kitchen it great well . this definitly worth money	1
this item very cute . different textures ( just like bedding set ) lot fun . i hung 2 wall above my sons changing table he loves look them . my only complaint ribbon loops they've sewn hang them . mine not sewn into middle square so they originally hung uneven . you easily use nail or other type homemade hook though	1
love it , love it , love it ! no more digging through diaper bag or my purse dirty , lint covered binkies . it could little bigger , my toddlers binky but they fit inside it great idea	1
this stroller holds up 55 lbs ., unlike most umbrella strollers which only hold 35 lbs . i love raised handle bars . they cause less strain your shoulders back . there roomy basket under seat , which great bonus . 8 wheels make it easier steer push over rocks or grass . once my son able sit up his own , i used umbrella stroller exclusively . this hands down best one i ever . it also very modern looking black gray	1
we 4 yr old twins 18 month old , selected this gate means block off our dining room living room . we needed gate ( which already came one extension panel ) plus one more extension panel ( we purchased additional ) total 107 inches across . it wasn't horrible install -- just read directions first allot your self couple hours . if you measure well take your time , it not difficult . also best attach it stud wall xtra durability . durability , you need adult sized hand open this latch -- my almost 5-yr-olds can't it . extra foot adds stability . baby tried many times push it over or break through latch never succeeds . we like you set it swing only one way if you choose , since it prevents it smacking into our dining room chairs . appearance , neutral oak this gate looks soooo much nicer than those pricier metal things . we've received many compliments our wide spaces gate ( matching stairwell gates ) guests , it only takes seconds slide out wall brackets store if we're entertaining company . i think some previous posters either way too high expectations baby gate ( it not brick wall ! ) , or installed it wrong . i would recommend this gate anyone , especially those multiples need gate off portion large area create safe playspace	1
we haven't any problems cleaning this chair -- occasionally we need use crevice tool vacuum , but simple enough . most time , we simple take wet paper towel or wet wipe run it around seat sides . ( we'd any high chair . ) tray doesn't fit our dishwasher , but too easy clean sink . we love neutral plain color oatmeal vinyl . our daughter very happy her chair . she only 16 months , but very big her age she no problems fitting this seat all . our only complaint we push tray release handle when we put tray order lock it into place or else our daughter push tray almost out . may defect ours rather than design flaw -- we just live it since it isn't big deal .	1
i bought this my second son who year old . i love it . it compact fits easily diaper bag . after he eats , i take it restroom it rinses right off . i've started using it home too because little tray front catches food really well ( saves my floors ! ) . i recommend anyone who hates see their child rub their food all over germy table buy this !!	1
it works great me . i 2 floor + 2 kids + 2 cats before i didn't know what going my house . now i hear any sound - guests coming , kids playing/watching tv even when cats jump dining table steel some food . it makes some fone sound max volume , but i don't care - i just reduse volume or change unit position . i strongly recomend this monitor	1
i havent any problems bottles leaking like others stated , but i guess i always check make sure lid right . suction isnt too fast , which great . my baby doesnt get choked . she latches easily nipple since it same pacifier she loves . my only gripe since bottles so wide they cover whole lower part her face it smooshes her nose . there isnt curve bottle , so when milk gets low you either lean baby back more , which i dont like , or either mash bottle her nose . its avoidable , but i tend it whithout realizing sometimes . id rather just stick bottle like playtex curver or bottle slimer . i still use bottles , but i just make sure whole time i'm feeding it isnt mashing her nose so she breath	1
we got our maclaren stroller few weeks ago . we love it . my husband i both tall ~ me 5'7 " him 6'1 " . both us use this stroller without slouching or kicking wheels when we walk . stroller folds unfolds easily maneuvers beautifully . i highly recommend this stroller anyone who taller wants convenient stroller .	1
this pail not need special plastic bags -- you use leftover grocery bags , etc ., which big advantage . i don't know why people buy those diaper pails individually wraps every dirty diaper -- baby poop not smell bad !	1
we concerned using regular crib bumper our tall toddler , but we needed something keep his pacifiers his crib night . this crib bumper job . when he stands it , it collapses , so it no help boosting him over side . my one gripe ( which i'm not sure there way around ) there gap front crib corners bumper attaches front rail ( one slides up down ) . because our little one older , we put stuffed animals corners , but i'm not sure how comfortable i'd using bumper infant who might get her legs or arms caught	1
my son just so excited his sponge bob bed . he climbs out every second thus showing how much he likes it . i like it because it low no accidental falling off hurting himself	1
we waited until our daughter [ ... ] get her this , it fantastic ! she now [ ... ] it storage , but she using it until she [ ... ] i like height adjustable , springs covered , seat comes out easily wash it . ( it poop-eroo us too . ) few things i learned using this though : blue spinning toy doesn't come out yucky stuff collect underneath it . it incredibly hard clean . one i got pain tush get batteries , so once batteries died , we set kangaroo part aside . my daughter feet got rubbed raw when we first got this because she loved jumping it . i recommend using pair robeez , or very least pair socks , protect their feet	1
this book provides exceptionally thorough look baby first year both mother baby perspective . firs t-t ime mothers often express frustration how ill-prepared they felt early weeks months motherhood . this book excellent job giving mothers-to-be realistic idea what life after baby really like , better worse . it truly one-of-a-kind top-notch reference	1

my 9 month old baby mild cp . we bought this seat her when she younger , but she just now able use it . she loves it . it worked well help her her balance , her muscle control provides safe environment her play . it limited number activities . our only complaint we check screws bottom bouncy foot rest , because they often fall out . but we just check it periodically it hasn't problem . i few pictures hope her seat customer photo section this seat	1
este producto es tanto mejor que las ba�eritas porque te da m�s flexibilidad . lo comenc� usar cuando mi beb� ten�a unos cuatro meses la ba�erita comenz� ser inc�moda ya que no ten�a un buen espacio donde ubicarla . el safer bather se coloca en la ba�era , no se resbala el beb� queda muy c�modo . mi beb� tiene ahora 10 meses medio le gusta sentarse para jugar mientras lo ba�o a�n as� resulta fabuloso . adem�s , se puede lavar en la lavadora seca bastante r�pido . a�n las veces que no lo he lavado enseguida , no ha olido mal . creo que es un producto excelente	1
this good looking functional gate toddlers cannot open , but most us adults open one hand . ( i show couple guests how it without damaging it ) . we trouble delivery , only because ups left it entryway wrong house - - - one next us empty up sale . assembly little difficult because instructions all pictures very few words . if it installed two walls no molding obstructions , it fine . however , my case , i high 6-inch baseboard i wainscotting chair-rail . these moldings created uneven surfaces i could not install gate without making wooden spacer blocks i paint white match gate . it took me five hours get it , i'm handy ( although bit perfectionist ) . anyhow , it looks works great , we've gotten compliments it . i thought it bit expensive , but i could not find anything else looked good ; it installed top stairs leading into our formal dining room . despite work install it high price , it worth it me .	1
mixed reviews this gate , i hesitated buying it , but i wish i hadn't! my house rather small but there large open area kitchen , living room , hallway , door basement ; this highest traffic area house . also , none walls or corners straight across each other making it impossible use more " traditional " gate . i actually found it easier not attach this gate wall so i change what part house i want my daughter access . it possible gate tip over if my 2-year-old daughter playing it , so i made rule she not allowed " play " gate . it took her day adjust but now she no problem it . i'm not sure durability gate since i not it long , but i think price well worth my daughter safety my peace mind	1
this best , wish i'd invented it ! no more ziploc bags wasted , no more cheerios all over supermarket floor ! this little cup lets child reach fingers pull out several treats ( cheerios , goldfish , etc ) munch away without spilling . no more mess or crumbs all over car , store , house , etc ! i love it ! bought 3 pack , twice ! i keep one my diaper bag road trips ! my daughter using it 1 yr old	1
we swaddled our daughter forever , it worked miracles us she loved it . i also so much more comfortable ease knowing she bundled up nice warm night . then she got too old it i so irritated just leave her crib no blankets or anything . then i saw these i tried them out i love them . we bought fleece ones they keep her so warm . she cuddle them if she likes nice warm like she used swaddle . she seems like them . bottom line her tummy , chest , toes kept warm safe way . i highly recommend these . fleece ones quite warm so if you live warmer climate i would recommend cotton ones	1
few these my new daughter just loved them ! she hated swaddled prefered freedom something like this . plus i never worry her tangling blankets when sleepsack . also not too awful late night diaper changes since it zips bottom	1
we just received this today . it didn't take me too long put it together myself ( hubby deployed ) . i secure my son his sister crib couldn't find proper screw driver but it put together common kitchen knife 45 minutes . only problem i am so far back keeps wanting pop out this one snap parts . my son , john , so excited when he saw this just loved playing it rest afternoon . he went bed right away he couldn't wait get back here .	1
this great product i'm glad i went ahead bought it . i go jogging my daughter nearly every day , so i needed something would block sun well . i using light blanket clothespins , but wouldn't you know , just i got going good jogging pace , my daughter would remove clothespin " shade " no more . i stopping fix it more than i actually jogging . this sunshade , she can't undo it ... although she tries ! i pull it all way down ( low i my particular jogger ) she still see out but shielded sun . i like side pockets - great keys small items - velcro tabs easy use . only drawback - this such minor issue , probably hardly worth mentioning - shade doesn't fold up all nice compact like instructions say . i wrestled my shade awhile before i finally got it folded up ( it matter " doggone it , this thing isn't going get best me ! " ) ... even then , it wasn't very stable . my suggestion - keep little bag it comes semi-fold it store it . all all , this worth it . wish i'd one when i started jogging my daughter last year	1
these good sturdy cloth diapers , whether you use them diapers or burp cloths . absorbancy quite good . i use both these , quot ; gerber prefolded absorbant layerquot ; diapers . diaper service ones not quite good two reasons-1 . ) they difficult pin , work much better velcro closure diaper covers ., 2 . ) they take longer dry drier , thus increasing laundering costs	1
my son born july 04 i usually keep my house very cold ! i noticed when i put him crib swaddled up blanket came minutes later check him , he some how squirmed his way out blanket cold ! my first child , i freaked ! so we went trip babies us ( because every mother ( you know what i'm talking ) , anything just go back store ) i found this item . i only bought one try out go back least 3 more . they great !!! they light one summer you buy thicker one winter .. my son wore this bed till he least 8 months old he wore long sleeve onsie underneath keep his arms warm ! you can't go wrong this ,,, i promise you !!!!! you no longer worry your baby getting out their covers getting cold	1
experienced original diaper genie my baby niece 2 years ago , royal pain this bottom load diapers change out liners . it seemed like liner needed replacing every couple days , probably due " twisting " sausage effect . i received this new diaper genie ii gift my newborn , wow . it truly easy load liner , i used it last wednesday through this tuesday before needing empty it . emptying it easy advertised , i slipped liner through cutter tied off top dirties tied bottom liner where we starting over again . first , it took two hands un-snap lid get it open because it new , now after week it adequately broken , it truly one-handed operation . even though baby newborn , she producing some massively stinky diapers . prior receiving genie ii , we using regular trashcan . genie ii completely contained smell since it use , my nursery now blessedly odorless ! liner situation great . diapers not come contact actual container which extremely sanitary , love it ! also , it seems you safely stuff lot diapers into each load which great . bottom line , i give my highest recommendation this product , 5 stars plus !! this my signature shower gift others now unless i get beaten it	1
my 4 1/2 month baby girl fits well this . i bit hesitant first not sure if she would fit but it all fits very nicely . make sure you decent screwdriver . take 30 mins set it up . my last chair grace 8 years ago chairs come long way . much nicer fit very smooth move around if needed . toy just icing cake . would not even think twice recommending this . this chair considered one best chairs babies . always review [ ... ] .. this group bundles up all reviews all web sites , etc . 2 thumbs way up ////	1
i originally purchased avent everything - bottle warmer , microwave steam sterilizer , etc therefore thought bottles would great . however , avent bottles leaked everywhere you could hear my son sucking tons air when he ate , causing tremendous amount gas etc . because i used avent , i bought wide neck dr. brown bottles they life saver . i threw all my avent bottles away . dr. brown bottles never leak my son rarely any gas so much happier - i also nurse him these nipples seem fit my son little mouth similarly breast . bottles also easy clean - just one more ( easy ) step than other bottles .	1
i got this gate my two miniature pinschers i love it . i use it pressure mount doorway . i previously one those plastic ones all holes but i opted this one not only look but safety . it virtually impossible dogs climb over it . it get scratched very easily , but doesnt bother me , i expected it two small dogs scratching it when they want out ! overall i impressed design how well made it . i would recommend this anyone small dogs long you dont mind scratches	1
i purchased this item myself , i absolutly love it ! bundle me makes it so easy get baby ready go , instead put coat her , etc . i get many compliments it , am glad i spent extra money this version , material so soft warm , it great quality . now instead getting my daughter new coats fit her , ( match her wardrobe ! ) i bundle me ready go , already carseat ! i would definately recommend this item , would proudly purchase it gift anyone baby wintertime	1
according consumer reports , this car seat one only two car seats pass all crash tests . i highly suggest parents ( soon parents ) check out consumer reports before buying any car seats . price it worth it !	1
this wonderful product infants not quite ready adult tub , but too big baby tub . i love how it fits perfectly into regular tub , so it easy fill/drain make easier transition when my son becomes too big it . my son loves playing rings seems very comfortable . my brother super-picky , but after seeing my son tub he bought one his daughter	1
i find these quite convenient giving my baby breastmilk bottle . playtex one-step storage system , i pump directly into liner stick it fridge , then i pop it nurser when it time feed . my husband other caregivers quite glad ease putting it all together when they're juggling crying baby . advice others , i wonder whether original nurser gift set might better , because it comes multiple different kinds nipples , whereas this set only comes silicone slow flow . we've lucked out , my baby seems happy it switches easily breast bottle vice versa ; however , it might handy able try different kinds see which babe likes best . shells this set more modern looking , but i can't see how matters . i'm pretty sure pieces both interchangeable . nice silicone nipples this set ( all other pieces ; latex nipples less hardy ) dishwasher safe , repeatedly boiled sterilization if desired . short shells this set fine , it easier reach bottom squish liner your fingers ( help it collapse ; drop-in liners relatively more shape-holding than regular liners , so they suck air ) , but usually my baby more than 4 oz sitting ; 8oz size shell , burper nice ( it hard reach when liner less full ) , but it doesn't squish liner all way , so we end up taking off shell using our fingers last 2 oz or so . i never any problem leaking . i like disposable bit this system , since nipples , collars , lids take up enough space cleaning effort without bunch bottles around well . liners pricy if you use lot ( $5 50 walgreens ) , but since we only use bottle day , it doesn't seem like much . they also freeze easily . this set came one adapter breast pump ( i use ameda purely yours , they fit together perfectly ) , one-step comes , so i use double pumping without buying any other pieces . overall , i'm very happy this set	1
this great booster seat so far ! it light east carry my son loves it . i like fact it folds half when we travel it easy handle . also , great price such great seat	1
i received this shower gift ( i'm resurfacing new mother - my only child now 11 , so i'm starting over again ... ) it soooo easy swaddle my newborn son . i remember struggling my daughter get her wrapped up receiving blanket matter minutes her wriggling out swaddle . my son , he cuddly this swaddle hours sleeps soundly . even my husband , who two left thumbs wrap him up snuggly without my help supervision ! my only thumbs down this product i notice repeated use my son wriggle his arm out it it looser age . also , i notice it tendency bunch up neck , so you careful when you wrap little one up swaddle . however , benefits far outweigh those two glitches	1
this great . we it our 7 month old son who crawling all over place . he loves hang out here play . he doesn't hurt himself if you add foam playmat under it , it even safer . it nice insetead playard because you sit there kid hang out him . it gives him alot room play crawl . he stand up hold sides . he even stood himself ! other cool thing all toys one spot ! we two baskets toys there him play . this portable light . it kind pain reshape ;( which why it got 4 stars ) but once you it together , it pretty sturdy . it also indoor-outdoor , which great people backyards , decks or pools . folds up very compactly . you could easily store this closet when not use . overall , it great product well worth money . i highly recommend it .	1
this steamer works great , holds more accessories than avent sterilizer . it very easy use . plus , it twenty bucks less than avent . more money use diapers	1
i graco side side stroller . like most strollers , canope this stroller almost useless . why it so hard companies figure out what we mom really want ? functionable canope would one thing example . most strollers they joke . so i bought this sunshade . positive : folds up flat easily ; attaches easily ( though you may fiddle bit find best position ); side pockets nice extra help weigh shade down some well ( you perhaps hide some goodies there because they really not easy spot ); it shelters side well ; negative : hello .. slight wind this thing bends backwards or moves sideways ; when sun comes front , while setting , you can't really pull it down far enough protect your children . living island we deal wind all time so it not practical i would like this shade . but still would recommend it over leaving child just exposed . perhaps if you less wind deal you really like this shade . i gave it 4 star because it protect my children what matters . you deal negative points , but i wished it would designed all weather . i don't see how you attach weight still allow it stand up correctly . material too thin . but i am open ideas suggestions . i don't problems folding stroller together while shade attached . perhaps just matter trying see what you prefer like . all all it worth money afford because your little ones deserver need proctection . till strollers made better canopes , we rely something like this . i also peg perego aria stroller bought single one one . same issue , problems wind but otherwise nice protection . yes you fold it back when you put baby . perhaps main concern designer . easy acess baby .	1
this mobile sends him off sleep every time . i love music lasts so long -- wind up ones , he would just start settle down when it would shut off . there two volume levels ; usually quieter one enough bedtime . my only ( minor ) complaint remote control it makes loud clicking sound when you press it ( enough make him stir , but not wake up ) .	1
i needed gate odd sized doorway looked all them least twice . this gate great bargain extensions included(which expensive buy separately other gates ) . i found it very sturdy no movement or realignment when it closes . i didn't want use hardware install it never problem bar bottom . i installed it my 9 month old tugging climbing me no problems . it good appearance easy operate(visitors figure it out after 1 or 2 tries ) . i received many good comments visitors i am very glad i picked this one .	1
this bottle solved these problems us : gasspit upmilk leaking out baby mouthlow birth weight(she just wouldn't eat much)my baby started out life breastfeeder 2 weeks diagnosed milk allergy . she not gaining weight . she switched soy . i didn't want try these bottles . i tried gerber , evenflo , playtex , avent . my mom read they helped colic so she brought me one . i used one bottle two days until i could get store . since then , i retried all those other bottles . she started eating less losing more it out side her mouth spiting up again . this her favorite . so it worth it me	1
well , i ordered this item overnight because my 19 month old began climbing out crib again . he this months earlier , when crib not lowest setting , so time problem easily solved . this time , not so easily ... i so afraid he would crack his head open our hard mexican tile floors ! many other moms wrote how their kids seemed love it . wsh i could say ! i love it , because i know it protecting my child potentially very harmful fall . but , he really freaked out it first few nights . i think it would nice if it go higher up , higher arch , thus not making it feel so confining , so much like caged . so he didn't like it all , but , it five or six nights now he used it , simply checks it out , then rolls over goes sleep . but it cost us some tears . ( i'm not talking hours here , five minutes max , worst night ) . anyways , all all , i think it great product all parents who want protect their little monkeys potential injuries .	1
i got this my daughter , who very big her age , grew out her infant tub 6 months . she sit up well , but i worried her falling/slipping hitting her head . this product easy use works very well ! instructions tell you make sure your tub clean dry , you must follow these instructions if you want suction cups hold ! bonus -- it covers up lever you flip up down stop up tub , too !	1
i am very pleased this purchase . i little concerned size , i ordering it 6 year old - but it plenty big enough her , seat very wide could easily hold even larger child . if you hello kitty fan , this great chair !	1
i bought this monitor over two years ago , still love it ! especially now my son out crib . i make sure he not mischievous night without him knowing . i also enjoy plugging this into television recording times when he mishievous , or just plain cute	1
i like style ease this potty seat , but my daughter , hole much too big . she squirms it , not use it unless i am holding onto her-she starts slip fall . i am end up buying much smaller seat . hopefully she grow into this one . she 2 1/2 little small side	1
this toy bin such great investment . i'd give it 5 stars if it just tad bigger . it not only functional toy box , but light portable , carry handles , collapses storage travel , interactive toy itself its " mirrored " flower bright , colorful , textured surface . my baby loves this so i . i it both designs - fish flower	1

i finally picked up jogging stroller now my boy 17 months old . it easy put together very quiet . since its brand new there hasn't time it get squeeky ! my only complaint it seemed lean right until i walked it mile . then it corrected itself i think it nice . other thing left back tire rubbed one time break sits up above when unlocked . but could some uneven ground . i sport model doesn't come mp3 thing i think . i'll just listen birds ambient sounds instead .	1
friend mine bought this item me first i thought " wasted " her money . i noticed she bought it me l-xl course i thought this never ever fit me , after all my pre-pregnancy size 4 . well , i sooo wrong ! into my 3rd trimester , i developed discomfort my lower abdomen back . i decided try this belt it awesome ! i've able continue working out , walking , etc ... because this belt . i love it !! my only suggestion buy bigger size .	1
i love this bumper . embroidered animals plush very cute . colorful too . just any color set you use paint/decorate rest your nursery . i just wish inside this bumper also patchwork/animal design it . instead it just plain blue -- like trim outside . so , when you walk into room look into crib , what you see basically blue bumper . other than , its nice bumper -- set great	1
i love these bottles using them my twin girls since week 2 their lives ( week 1 spent fighting wide necked version this bottle ) once we figured out how prevent all leaks , these bottles amazing speed up feeding time since baby drink continuously . helpful hint all dr. brown bottles : when pulling nipple thru collar , everytime run your finger around base nipple inside plastic collar make sure it fully seated before screwing nipple collar bottle . eliminates leaks completely . not over-tighten collar onto bottle . again , prevent leaks . we learned all these tricks hard way ! :) mother twin girls texa	1

although i am die hard baby bjorn fan , i am not true fan little potty . it small design , no removable bowl which makes it very hard keep clean . save your money upgrade baby bjorn regular potty which well worth money !! we keep our little potty minivan those unexpected road trip emergencies .	1
i'm thinking getting this stroller , but i need know ! thanks	1
this great booster , easy move car car since you don't strap it . cup holders perfect ! good quality	1
this spoon only one keeps my little one getting frustrated losing interest when self feeding . food actually stays spoon long enough him place it successfully into his mouth without food slipping down him getting upset because it . plus curve spoon provides just right angle him hold it enter his mouth he turns his wrist . other spoons which straight handle cannot job . it takes too long reach their mouths food falls right out . hooray sassy once again ! other manufacturers should follow their example this one	1
they look awful but if you sore cracked nipples or inverted nipples they only thing really fix what wrong . good news if you use breast shells when you need them above mentioned maladies- you won't use them long because you heal after just few days even if you wear them part time . they come little curved white sponges you just drop bottom shell . these sponges absorb milk leaks so you don't worry it comming out vent holes top when you bend over . i just would rinse them soap water clean let air dry i think each breast shell set come four sponges you buy more if you need them but 4 enough me . note : don't use them collect milk give your baby one reviewer suggested . milk collected breast shell discarded it states package instructions .	1
blue cat cushystraps so soft ! they very easy install , added bonus helping keep straps straight her carseat ... this way , when i go put her seat , straps not don't become twisted process . used bit problem our graco seat before we used cushystraps . my 3 month old daughter loves rub her face mouth straps . i imagine theywould helped hold her head too , when she newborn	1
i received combi ex travel system my baby shower . it looked like perfect size/ weight city living . unfortunately it not work out way . stroller began squeaking falling apart all bumping around brick cobblestone through city . basket also very very tiny inhibited large bar through middle . i would reccommend this stroller use smooth surfaces . carseat great easy use , but stroller not what i expected . one tip urban parent -- sink your $$ into good stroller shocks . it worth it	1
i just baby so writing review totally amazing thing this stage game - that how much i love this thing . they should pass it out hospital . regular swaddles come undone . this one stays place you change diaper without disturbing arms , which so important . buy more than one .	1
i've tried number monitors both my kids ( returned several well ) , but this monitor hands down best longest range least crackling noise . it pretty much quiet . my view , it not worth buying any other monitor but this one	1

i thought because there no buttons or batteries my three year-old daughter would not enjoy it but i wrong . she loves it !!! this doll goes every where she . i purchased this doll help potty training it trick . this quality doll , when you squeeze her tummy she go potty . feeding her water little hard because you make sure you get bottle her mouth all way . but she doesn't care if she spits water up or if she actually goes potty . she also loves taking her into bath tub too ! not expensive other dolls but well worth money spent	1

we both urban lite bundle me . i'm glad we bought both ! thicker urban great colder weather . it thicker , so stiffer , than lite , which makes it easier me zip up carseat then fold ' flap ' down leave my daughter face exposed . windy , cold or nasty weather i bring flap up cover her completely short outdoor time car destination . lite flimsier , perfect early fall i'm starting use it stroller warmer winter days . i personally prefer stiffer urban , but urban so much warmer than lite i'm glad both . switching 2 very easy takes only minute or two . both versions , we just put hat baby ready go ! no jackets or snowsuits needed . we also set cushy straps ( cute fleece animal-shaped covers stroller/carseat straps cushion straps help keep child head lolling around ) those help keep top baby too exposed when you bundle me folded down or partially unzipped	1

i bought this because my 18-month-old grandson whom i am raising started fits when it came time change his diaper . this really helped make diaper changing breeze . even though it states you should use packages you just put stack wipes although sometimes you add water them keep them moist but it works like charm . i always thought baby wipe warmers just gimmick because i not them when my kids growing up but it sure helped solve his problem . thanks so much great product .	1
i 2-year-old daughter little boy due july , so i wanted get something bit more portable than my big kate spade bag . i've looking something like this while . size great- you fit so many things it- 5 sz . 4 diapers wipe container , well snacks , toys , cell phone , wallet ... list goes . however , i am my 2nd one already- quality bag not greatest . cord cinches bottle holder broke within 2 days , one zippers fell off . i just took 2nd one vacation , though it great traveling , bottle holder already fraying top . i keep this one , however ... it only $30 , so i guess i could always get one later down road not too upset it	1
when i pregnant my son i received one those big , bulky strollers baby shower gift , but after my son grew out attaching car seat he quickly grew hate stroller - i . after much research we bought maclaren volo carbon stroller mesh backing ( we live florida so mesh perfect our climate ) i am sure i never own stroller . i remember cringing i spent $100 but we now joke it best $100 we ever spent . it really . we traveled all over country stroller - it lightweight , extremely collapsable comes shoulder strap genious addition . wheels don't stick like cheaper umbrella strollers , it take beating still keep going . 4 years 42 lbs it still carried my son without squeek . ( ok we wd-40 wheels once 4 years we it . ) mesh backing made cleaning stroller breeze . it easily steered one hand , we personally loved shape handles handle padding - pushing other strollers feels so awkward now . basket underneath incredibly handy carries surprising amount . it folds easily one hand foot . my son doesn't use stroller anymore but volo still looks works perfectly so we saving it our next child . bottom line , this stroller worth every penny you pay i t.t he one only complaint i stroller it would nice if seat reclined younger infants . if you thinking purchasing this stroller younger infants consider spending extra $ model recline . sun visor might something consider too	1
i graco car seat my first son . he always uncomfortable it he outgrew it time he four months old . he also uncomfortable accompanying stroller i hated trying get this heavy stroller out my car . whole travel system waste money . after lot research i bought combi connection car seat flash ex universal car seat carrier my second son . i very happy both . my second son almost 10 months old i'm still using this car seat . he very comfortable it , i'm dreading give up convenience him infant carrier . my son isn't exceptionally small . he light his age - he 25th percentile weight , but he tall - 90th height . i am completely shocked previous reviewer who thought this car seat too small . only reason i gave this car seat 4 stars instead 5 because canopy isn't very sturdy . other than it highly recommended	1
i just my third child buy all new things , because i got rid everything after my second child . i sling other two , but instead getting same one , i looked new ones , this far better than old . i like lighter fabric its easy fold up stuff diaper bag . you need watch dvd , but little practice anyone , even husbands use it !! my son 11 weeks old loved it since day one . when he fussy , we put him sling he instantly get quiet . this best one back support also , i think	1

inexperiennced new mom , i no idea " porta crib " meant speciality sized crib not standard size ( 52 27 ) . i just figured it some kind name brand among all others . no where detailed page it describe measurements , so i assumed standard . i registered this so excited until i tried fit it it too small ! so basically , i just wanted warn new moms or moms who didn't know ~ this not fit standard cribs . however , bumper ever cuter person then photos(a good thing ) , but crib sheet very thin/cheap ( bad thing )	1
