i ordered this blower/vac after reading many reviews many different blowers . i must say it doing outstanding job this fall ! we many deciduous trees i worried cleanup this fall . blower powerful enough move bulky leaves into pile . it easily blows off porch , concrete drive gravel drive . vac part works well i am glad metal impeller blade i occasionally vac up small pine cones liquid ambar balls out damage blade so far ... mulching ratio may correct dry leaves but i find damp or still fresh leaves only mulch 1:6 ratio - still not bad i use leaves mulch compost addition . i not clogging problem blade . it little loud ( don't know how it compares gas one ) alot dusty bit heavy once bag full , but nature leaf cleanup ! i am pleased currently - hope it works well down road	1
