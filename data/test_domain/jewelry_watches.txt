i'm rn bought this watch mainly work purposes . it stylish simple , not overly flashy . convenient second hand which essential me . size perfect , my wrists really small i hate huge watches . i'd say this face size nickel . weight light , making it barely noticable while but same time durable . my only complaint i thought " self adjustable " links meant you take links out yourself . since my wrists small , every watch i've owned i've take jeweler get links taken out . i bought this watch mainly because bonus self adjustable links . my husband finally able take 4 links out but only after getting tiny , tiny screwdriver which noted enclosed instructions . so don't expect these links just pop out i . other than , good value price	1

this ring absolutely gorgeous i havent taken it off since recieving it . but when buying this ring , careful not take string off bands . this string protects you well .... insanity . i unfortunately took off string my ring separated into 4 separate bands . luckily i found website gave me instructions how reassemble it . my dad put it back together it fine , but i admit i'm little distraut how there no indication or warning telling people not take it off . if this happen you , google " puzzle ring solutions " there many websites guide you restoring your ring normal .	1

i bought nighthawk ( although one leather band ) year ago i very pleased it . it looks very masculine classy , style certainly age well . slide rule takes little figuring out , but it very useful . it keeps time pretty well , too . i've only got couple complaints : leather band , which i picked because metal bands always uncomfortable me , little too large my wrist . even when i use innermost hole band , watch still kind floppy . price , watch could sapphire crystal instead glass one . those conplaints very minor compared everything i like watch . i didn't want give watch five stars if i complaints it , but my rating would probably more like 4.75 stars . price , it great value .	1

beautiful box hold most my watches . two other watch boxes hold 11 watches ea some rings . this box holds those watches less space ! no place rings not minus my opinion . nice able see 10 my most worn watches glance ! 10 drawer below . if you several watches you want put nice looking , good quality box you not go wrong buying this item	1
this watch classic . i no issues it losing minutes . i am very tough watches , i never take them off , this watch real tank . i needlessly worried red blue dial would chip or scratched off . i am amazed it not b/c i accidentally scraped , smashed it into doors , walls etc ... same dial , tough diamonds . it big watch , so it may not everyone , but if you like styling , it steal . seals never weaken b/c it never opened change battery . i am very impressed	1
review below " owen wilson " pretty funny . he never took it out box , it stopped running , so he returned it . lol ! it automatic watch , dude ! you wear it wind it , or it stops . anyways , i've mine 4 months now barely ever take it off . it keeps excellent time , gaining only second or two day . i really like this wonderful piece classic technology my wrist , i like size substantial weight it , it very comfortable wear . i took star off rating because original strap developed unpleasant odor after couple weeks , which no amount scrubbing would remove . i replaced it after-market italian rubber strap . 3 months later new strap still smells pleasantly vanilla , which i guess common additive real rubber straps . who knew ? original strap looked bit beefier more diver-like , but new strap deployment clasp which handy . occasionally i wish i bought skx007 instead , i like look round markers , but it hasn't bothered me much these square , i prefer second hand this watch . i really like way sat blue sun red - reminds me it weekend . this my first modern automatic overall i'm very happy my purchase .	1

when shopping around new watch , this model fit bill perfectly . analogue face , additional functions ( date , stopwatch , alarm ) , waterproof , perfectly sized case . bonus finish - black ( very dark grey ? ) gold details . i thought all metal cased watches these days silver or gold little variation , so it nice surprise find this model . one slight gotcha - what appears " second " hand face not actually second hand . it used stopwatch . there smaller face ( located 9 o'clock main dial ) counts seconds . little odd , but not big deal . still very happy product . all this got it half price amazon . nice one	1
