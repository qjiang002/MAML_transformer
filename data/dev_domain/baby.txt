we live 1.5 story home where master only thing upstairs my husband runs isp home - lots computers house , so we find good monitor would drown out static electronics outside world , but allow us hear our little pip-squeek clearly . first i thrilled sony when i used it downstairs during her daytime napping loved i could set it voice-activated only hear it when she reallllly awake ! but night when we used it upstairs it kept picking up interferrence form loud static chirp after several hours silence even though it voice-activated mode . i tried moving it several times , but finally ended up going back old fp sounds lights one we which really wasn't any better ! ( run up down stairs try all combinations 9 channels receiver transmitter sony royal pain ! ) next day i went target found first years digital 2.4 ghz monitor what difference ! it same price sony , but it searches clear channel like your phone . i afraid it would interfere out 2.4 ghz phones , but after week , no problems we no static/interferrence ! it crystal clear no matter where house ( hubby even took it into computer room able hear her wake up just fine ! ) i know everyone environment different , but sony definately didn't work us	-1
worst product ever ! safety 1st should recall this item if they any sense all . i'd like smack so called engineer designed this infant tub . my 10 month old son pinched his little privates so bad it gave him blood blister . yeah , ouch !!! stinkin bar goes legs slides out place when baby moves -- snap ! it pinches their private part . everything just fine then suddenly my son looked me such panic then screamed cried . i realize what happened quickly moved bar . ouch ! it still makes me grit my teeth when i think it . horrible product especially baby boys .	-1
we really cheap monitor before we bought this one because it just so noisy .. so we bought this one thinking it going quieter . well , it alot quieter than our monitor , but like others said , it makes this awful beeping noise ! it gone off twice middle night before ! we also digital phone , so it constantly switching channels well trying find available channel . i would look elsewhere monitor .. beeping what gets me - i dont like woke up very loud beep middle night !	-1
if you infant enjoys mental stimulation , this item not you . since she brought home my daughter enjoyed looking held so she see all around her . she bored tears ( literally ) every time we put her lounger ( baby faces ceiling .. not too exciting ) . i thought it cool concept , however , my daughter not . she much better her papasan , or bouncy seat where she could nap if she wanted , but option look around play well . looking up ceiling not fun my daughter	-1
when i ordered this product , i hoping my baby girl enjoy it . i so excited when my baby likes spend time it . this happiness only lasted two days before mobile , lights , music stopped working . i am little bit concerned quality this product . i return swing consider type swing my baby .	-1
i love my medela pump style but their breastmilk storage bags awful . twis t-t ie closure complicated . they also spill milk easily when pouring into bottle after thawing . i recommend lansinoh bags . they easy-to-use double zip closure ensure milk stay fresh it very easy get air out bag before closing . you also lay them flat freeze so they won't take up much space freezer . they pour great - no spills !	-1
we bought this 6 weeks ago , it already stopped beeping when nipple sterlised or milk warm . now markings its measuring cup coming off . basically , i believe minchkin cut corners poor quality product . not recommended all ... i would prefer some other brand	-1
i loved this first . but after two months daily use thing broke . i cant get it back together . i think i just go back walking diapers regular trash outside	-1
i just received this product after much research , i am really disappointed it quality . mattres so stiff hard especially baby , sheets provided like emory board , scratchy stiff . my baby too long this , so her feet fall off edge mattres . i just thought it would much better than this . looks like i returning it . my daughter now sleeping her bouncy chair , tied down back reduce bounce fluffy pillow underneath it also reduce bounce	-1
we read directions product still works sporadically . my wife physician ! leaking problem incredibly frustrating , especially when baby crying . buy anything else - you very disappointed , especially this price point	-1
we asked 2 these got both . material itchy scratchy never got softer . it very thin you could see pattern through sheet . it easy put mainly b/c it bit big . they ended up closet no time	-1
don't buy this sheet !! it not much thicker than piece tissue paper ! spit up would go right through it . i much better solution you -- buy couple sheet savers use your pack-n-play . they couple $$ less sold " especially baby " (which b-r-us house brand ) . they great . i use them both my son crib pack play . they come number colors so you should able match them just any pattern	-1
i told these wonderful , keep your baby safe while sleeping his side or back . but my little man slides down where his face foam sides . this worries me more than if he sleep his stomach	-1
this very cute bouncer chair . however , i feel it poorly designed . it sets baby almost laying down so it difficult play toys . addition , our baby acid reflux it not good chair him because it sets him back too far . we find one set more upright	-1
we this stroller aren't really thrilled it . fact , we're going buy different double stroller replace it . our children aged 2 years 4 months . while 3 month old still his car seat/carrier , this stroller worked well him . he now out grown carrier , we've put him seat stroller . shoulder straps too tight him don't adjust well . seat isn't padded well there no head support . our 2 year old not like back stroller . infant front , we keep it reclined , so my daughter lean forward if she sitting back . she hates standing it because she very short she can't see anything . she would much prefer sit front . we find basket bottom practically useless . we can't reach it so we never use it . there no cup holder or tray parents . it also bit bulky when folded heavy . so , i think we put this stroller storage until kids older get double stroller 2 seats now	-1
i received this gift loved it first . but after using it just 3 times one support poles snapped when we putting it up . i bummed too because i loved it so much . if you buy it , careful when you handle it - it not durable it seems	-1
i bought this sling when i still pregnant . after my son born i tried putting him it but he just didn't seem secure , so i threw it back closet . when he turned one , i dug it out again , thinking it would work well hip carrier , but it even worse this ! i him this total five minutes it awful . first all , buckles should not placed so they hit wearer either neck or shoulder bone , it very painful heavier baby . i took him out it never touch thing again	-1

lucky me i didn't pay this pump but hospital gave it me . i could only get two drops milk every ten pumps . what waste time . you would figure hospital would know if pump worked	-1
i looked amazing computer but let me tell you it ugly ! we recived it my mail it cheap plastic fake wood !!! needless say it went back !!! i also upset way it delivered it left my front patio blocking my door pouring rain ... so i am sure crib wet well	-1

i bought this seat my son when he probably around 6 months old just starting solid foods . ten months later , i hardly ever use darn thing . it worked okay us little while but it not one my better baby purchases . my complaints product : - not particularly sturdy . backrest portion particular seems pop off way too easily . - straps secure it kitchen chair annoyingly long way . not such problem when seat secured chair because you just tuck straps somewhere . however , everytime i remove seat chair straps prove real pain rear . unfortunately it seems i need unstrap remove seat after every meal clean bits food inevitably end up big chair which this seat secured ( complaint ) . - second tray which pops over swing away tray ( least my particular model ) very easily removed my son . he lifts it up dumps his food floor . point this second tray make food prep cleanup easier but it fails miserably . - this seat not all sturdy or useful stand alone seat . it strapped chair or it easily tip over . good things this product it relatively inexpensive good spacesaving alternative regular highchair which sucks up so much floor space . it also fairly easy clean due plastic design . overall it not bad product but not my list favorites . if i it over , i would bought similar type chair but probably different brand	-1
i agree first reviewer , " cindy " -- i love concept , but proportions this swaddler just aren't right , unless you really tiny baby or one doesn't kick his/her legs much ( my one-month old boy weighs 11 lbs 23 inches long . ) . velcro doesn't hold because patches too small , knit fabric too stretchy . however , i put him larger size swaddleme today , it fits much better	-1
don't buy peg-perego their customer service horrible !! i never buy them again !!	-1
i read other reviews said it headache , but i went ahead purchased this item because it less expense than anything i else i saw . i should listened ... i ordered it feb , it now may we still don't dresser together . there pieces missing , major piece broken . when you try call , line busy . i hang up redial , what felt like forever . they said my piece would come 3 weeks , it more like 7 weeks . piece broken drawer rails it , but when it came , it no rails . so , i said i wanted return entire thing , they fine it , but it take up 8 weeks get your money back . so , this point time , we going go hardware store buy what we need so i dresser my son room .	-1
nursing mother i researched many different brands bottles find easiest one my little one make transition . i read so many sources soothie would make transition easiest babies . i bought starter kit several other bottles . i greatly dissapointed learn out all bottle i purchased only one not leak . i tried repositioning nipple i tried tighten lid . nothing helped . my son soaked everytime we tried use them . i switched brand now we very dry	-1
don't waste your money this high chair . time your infant safely sit it , they almost outgrown it . you're just paying name brand , not quality . stick w/ graco instead	-1
not purchase this product if you plan use your play yard bassinet . tent snaps same spot you not use both	-1
ok so how many people think their baby exceptional ? well , pretty much everyone i know , they all right course . each baby exceptional , their own way . but how many babies rated exceptional pediatricians , nurses early childhood educators ? well , i know one - mine ! i faithfully used babyplus system when i pregnant . one time when using it , he started knocking back . yeap , i actually felt him knock back it , rhythm . it only happened once , but i told my husband i think this going one special kid . i 7 months pregnant then . well , lo behold , after he born people ( professionals ) don't stop telling us how amazing he . he most aware newborn you ever meet . he 2 months old now , sleeping through night ( 11 hours time ) since he 2 weeks . he cries when he needs something , never cries no reason ( but i make sure respond quickly his needs so i don't know how much it . ) . yesterday he started reaching objects . can't quite grab them yet , but it doesn't stop him trying . pediatrician nurse remarked how incredibly physically strong he , how aware he seems fact he vocalizes music unheard this age . he holding his head up since day he born ( 3 days late ) making eye contact since 2 weeks . so , i don't really know what if anything baby plus system it . i mean it could just accident but ... all i say i definitely use this product our future children . i would pay thousands if i ( we not rich people ) because its worth every penny	1
this item invaluable preventing plagiocephaly ( flattening head ) ... i wish we known it our twins . newborns especially need very soft surface their very soft malleable skulls . we used it our third baby result , he perfectly round head proportioned features . incline greatly reduced spit up ' flap ' their esophagus stomach not developed yet . gravity prevents milk/formula traveling back up causing gas or spit up . i've noticed biggest complaint this item infants seem slip down it during night . this true , however , rolling up receiving blanket real tight placing it " u " shape under our son bottom prevented this happening ever again . result , he slept soundly , never spit up once , never woke us up gas pain perfectly round head . i strongly recommend boppy noggin nest well keep pressure off head when your baby not his crib . also , if your baby old enough roll over , this item not you . one other note : foam wedges either side trap some body heat , so don't over-swaddle or put too many layers ... adjust thickness your blanket ambient temperature . i would say this good item newborns 5 months . it made enourmous difference well our third child compared his older twin siblings	1

when my daughter born , i didn't know swaddling , it would take me hours get her sleep ! i would feed or rock her my arms until she falls asleep , then put her her crib ... she'd flail her arms , wake up cry , i start all over ! what nightmare ! then i figured out since her arms wake her , it would make sense wrap her something so she couldn't move them much ... so i started wrapping her regular receiving blankets . it worked ! it became much easier get her sleep . but then she wiggled out those receiving blankets wake up again . when she little over month old , somehow i came across swaddleme blankets internet immediately bought it . it worked great ! it so easy wrap my daughter it , it stayed put . my daughter started sleeping so much better ! i wish i found those blankets sooner - it would've saved me so many sleepless nights ! 2 years later , my son born , thankfully i already knew those blankets start . he goes sleep great swaddleme blanket ! out curiosity , i tried put him sleep without this blanket , his arms wake him right away - exactly same my daughter ! i consider this blanket one most important baby items you could buy . it should must new mother who wants get some sleep	1

i using diaper genie i wasn't all impressed . i shop needing pick up genie refills saw this pail sale $14 . i bought it . day one i loved it i threw out genie i won't go back . it only got 4 stars because you need buy fresh disks every so often . they nice because when you open pail you smell fresh clean sent . also i feel pail could taller , when i change kitchen bag ( which only time you really smell foul diapers ) my bag only 3/4 way full . but other than its great investment , no smelly nursery no dang refills buy	1
i own this seat my son who age 6 . it law my state children must booster or car seat until age 8 . seat material high quality cushioning very comfotable . headrest perfect long trips since my son fall asleep without annoying crick his neck . price decent too . only issue i this seat cupholders . if you regular sedan want fit others your car , cupholders aren't very usable . additionally , cupholders don't slide out very well when child sitting seat . personally , i leave cupholders pushed . i carseat young infant my sedan must fit my 10-year old back seat . i wish carseat booster seat makers would instead make mesh bag pocket hang right off botton front kid toys such . furthermore , booster seats general , i think they very impractical families who need fit 3 kids across backseat . my son very hard time buckling his seat belt because he must reach side where space premium . i would love forward-facing booster seat 5-point harness would lock into latch loops older child . not only 5-point seat harness safer but it much easier child buckle themselves instead reaching around side . far options available child who outgrown convertible seat but too small regular seat belt , this nice option .	1

i bought this my son when he just shy 4 months old . initially , he would just sit seat , occassionally moving sideways ( probably because he lost his balance ) . after 5-10 minutes he ready hit eject button ( he'd enough ) . lasted 4 or 5 days during which we'd put him jumperoo 2 or 3 times per day hopes he'd grow enjoy it . 5th day he began jumping up-and-down like crazed kangaroo ! his face wide smile some drool , he excited ! point forward ( still going ) he consistently loved his time j-roo . he regularly jumping sessions 30-45 minutes while watching clifford , dragon tales , ... this great way little upright position while strengthening his little legs . also , it not bad break us parents now again	1

my son 13 months old 25 pounds . one mother wrote her 10 month old 24 pound baby could not fit it , but my son fits into it fine room grow he even considered amp ; quot ; big babyamp ; quot ; . i think people need take into consideration height weight proportion when buying product . every child different , different weight height which means different shapes . instead my huge high chair kitchen , i now small booster stays one kitchen table seats slides right under table w/ chair when my son not it . it great space saver .	1
i love this potty !! my 16 month old daughter sits it long time before wanting off , it seams comfortable . her little feet touch ground so she feels stable . i would recommend this chair	1

i got this pump because i wasn't sure if i would need electric stay-at-home mom . this pump easy use clean . ergonomic pump handle pretty easy hands wrist ( i could pump even when i tendonitis which hurt when i moved my thumb ) . it not take up much room when disassembled so it'll great travelling . i'm not thrilled soft comfort flange provided . i prefer regular plastic medela flanges come their electric pumps . i find i get much milk out this manual pump i medela pump style electric same time this one makes lot less noise ( great middle night pumping sessions ease engorgement without waking my baby husband up ) . also , just note some people problems getting milk out medelas ... it may not pump itself but size flanges . every woman breast nipples different sizes . initially , i using standard 24mm flanges ( suction cup things go over your breasts ) . it painful pump my milk would not come out even though i engorged plenty milk . it would take me 2 hours just get 2 oz milk ! i went see lactation consultant who suggested i try next size up flanges ( 27mm ) . she got me one try it made world difference . i could immediately pump 2oz under 5 mins . now , i pump daily my electric stock up get 4 oz both breasts under 10 mins ( estimate since i don't really time it cause it so fast ) . i use either my electric my manual depending my mood , whether i need double pump , if i need my hands free ( then i use electric ) or if i'm going pump somewhere besides my bedroom ( i.e. living room while watching tv my husband ) . i am now planning pump donate my milk milk bank . this pump made world difference . i think medela makes flanges 3 different sizes . standard 24mm comes all their pumps , 27mm 30mm .	1
all i say bed quality , strong , kids enjoy it . i didnt know bed so big . this worth your bucks . kids actually feel like they train	1
it great product below $100 price range . pros : it almost all necessary features which other travel system got . low price . cons : there no suspension front wheels	1
i used this co sleeper my son up until he 7 mos old . he now 2 we expecting our second any day now . i can't wait set it up . it lifesaver when i returned work because my son nursed every 2 hours up until 6 mos old . i didn't get out bed feed him it made him feel safe next his mommy daddy . mattress they provide too firm so i suggest you get portable crib mattress fit . i haven't tried one i got yet so i'm not sure which one ideal . i personally didn't set it up so i can't relate concerns others . my husband sets it up takes it down which not often . we use second-hand playpen trips . he hasn't complained it . maybe some sighs frustration . still well worth it	1
this third one these we . our daughter 19 months old we sorry when she out grows this product . it keeps her warm cozy can't come off during night . she seems really like it too	1
i put this stroller system my registry we've using it since my son born last year . he now 11 months still fits infant carrier . we like carrier used multiple cars so we bought extra base . stroller height seems great my husband ( 6'2 " ) me ( 5'8 " ) . we don't feel like we hunched over when pushing i t.t he stroller seems like it folds very compactly , but it still doesn't fit into my vw cabrio trunk ( trunk opening just bit small ) . so we use it my husband car we thinking getting compact stroller fit my car . my major complaint using stroller without infant carrier . now my son older wants see everything around him , he doesn't like recline . back adjustable , but we can't get it fully upright , so he always 20 degree angle recline . he started pulling himself forward leaning tray . it ok now , but i think he'll start get annoyed tired when sitting forward like this . overall i would recommend this stroller system	1
our first son slept us we learned mistake our second . our second son sleeping his crib throughout night but i wanted him warm but most importantly safe . when he sleeps night his sleepsack , we feel ease . i highly recommend this product	1
i newborn extremly picky unlike my first baby , she won't sleep anywhere hardly but because this padded she sleep it , i packn'play bassinet also this fits great . it alittle expensive that why i rated it 4 instead 5 becuase not everyone money spend extras like this	1
well , everything i said below true but now 10 months later tub developed it 3rd leak so we inflate it every night foot pump . i'm giving up ordering one . not bad every day use 10 months though . my original review : when our large 6 month old outgrew her tub we looked around other inflatable tubs only realize diameter they gave outside so once it inflated actual tub size even smaller than infant tub we using . we couldn't find snug tub any stores ( babies us carries their own brand , baby depot target only carried munchkin duck tub which so small ) . our 70 year old cast iron tub we definitely liked idea inflatable tub protect her little head harm . she loves bath time so we wanted make it safe possible . well this tub answer . it everything reviewers said - convenient ( blow up once store suction hook ) , big ( lots room toys splashing ) , secure ( fits very snugly , thus name ) bonus obviously you travel it . if you pay couple dollars more get snug tub deluxe versus snug tub you get toys . not i cared but she really love squeaking fish . so bath peace mind fun little one	1

i saw this fisher price sight i fell love it ! i able find it @ toys-r-us store . my 3 y.o daughter seems love it too ! it comes carry so you take it anywhere . i usually keep it back my suv . it especially very convenient when there no place stop when she really go . i just pull over parking lot , open it she sits it goes ! it helps avoid accidents her car sea t.t he only drawback though it built cup . it not removable . my daughter doesn't seem mind it . i don't know if fisher price makes one little girls	1
no more nasty indentions your seats . no more out control chocolate milk spills . i purchased stageseat saver my brand new suv mainly because my daughter eats like caveman ( no offense any living neaderthals ) . she now enjoy beverage snack without getting crumbs all over floor seat below her carseat . seat saver wonderful job containing all spills removed cleaned very easily . it made hard rubber material not move around once your child carseat securely fastened . it also lower flap sits low enough so your toddlers muddy shoes not scuff up front edges your vehicle seats . i recommend this all car seats your vehicle	1
my daughter i love this . i actually saw this before i pregnant loved it because i love turtles . i always said i would buy this . i know it bit pricey what it , but i justified it making it my daughters gift her first christmas ( she only 1 month old ) . i put her bed it turned blue light play soft relaxing music . she honestly goes down pretty well . it casts starts across her crib up her walls both my mom husband complimented how soothing i made her night time . only thing amber light doesn't seem work well showing stars , but there blue green . there actually star constellations it casts it comes little book showing which ones they .	1
i originally bought these bottles b/c they recommended almost every breastfeeding person i asked since i planning breastfeeding i decided go w/ this starter kit . i appreciated variety things kit offer . my baby born prematurely never really took breastfeeding but i decided pump breastmilk feed it her via bottle . i tried several other brands , but none worked well these her . i always found myself buying few more these . i fed my child 6-8 bottles day using avent bottles since day she came home hospital only 1 incident leakage i recognized what i wrong able correct problem w/o further error . i also use these storage time time w/ addition sealing disc . it would nice couple sealing discs included this pack	1
how i count ways ? this tub greeeeeat ! i little trouble first trying inflate it since it indicates only use your mouth but all effort worth it . it very light suction hook latches bathroom title future use .	1
i didn't realize tentacles horns when i purchased it -- i thought they electric touch-sensors . i like horns much more since batteries not required i know it not break easily . my 4-month old son cannot squeeze tentacles make noises ( yet ) but i'm so much fun playing it him ! he loves different textures colors fabrics . i've already purchased two more friends ... this toy bargain $10 ! it definitely worth much more .	1
i never problems these bottles leaking if stored correctly . i use discs nipples when traveling so i don't need full caps except storage . honestly i don't use these freeze , because it would too expensive . i use lansinoh bags these work great fridge shorter term storage . strange little nipples first ones help my son latching problem . he always sucked air when he fed , no problem these , really only reason i buy this product opposed other less expensive bottles storage	1
it excellent product , childproof , easy install works intended . locks only open when key placed , magnet it easy figure out where lock case you forget . you even stick key fridge if you use locks kitchen	1
my baby 8 months old loves this swing . i love it too ! it much easier than other brands fasten unfasten baby swing . i love how tray moves out way get baby out easily . it came hooks too so all we hook it up our existing swing set .	1
these easy use , convenient , make clean-ups breeze . reviewer who complained these don't stick tablecloths -- uh , you're worried germs cleanliness restaurants tablecloths ? i've found these adhere quite well variety surfaces , my son enjoys designs . people frequently stop our table ask where we found these table toppers , then exclaim , " if only they'd those when we baby ! " you've gotta love	1
i really like this mobile . it keeps my 13 week old infant entertained she also falls asleep it time time . she gets so mesmorized it she fall asleep . my only problem it first one they sent me not work but amazon such great job returning it all i email them it not work they sent me one right away replace it all i print label out postage everything taken care , just drop it off post office . i actually got replacement within 4 days so pretty good . they top things .	1
i bought this mat my six-month-old baby . he so excited colorful display mat . you tell his expressions , he just loves colors . i am not sure , if he understands characters yet but colors dazzle him . i guess it good stimulus his brains . also , this mat very inexpensive , good quality very decent size . i highly recommend this product	1
tummy time mat baby enjoys lot . i gave this gift my friend kid they liked it very much . esply aquarium theme it looks nice . kids enjoy waterpart mat . i wud definitely recommend this item anyone	1
this chair good places small , i started using it when my daughter sitting support , it really good her , it saves space , provides support , comfortable , i fully recommend this chair anyone , it very affordable well ..	1
i love this item because it perfect diaper bag or car . it handy me when my baby wasen't feel well i able take her temp . then give her medicine without open five differnt bags	1
we got this instead diaper genie because we wanted something simple easy use -- no turning cranks -- something would still usable after baby out diapers . we love diaper dekor ! we bought 2 refill packs before my son born . he 13 months now , i'm just now shopping more . reviewer mentioned problems installing refills . we trouble first time , but once we'd each it once it breeze . highly recommend this product , though right now it looks like amazon no longer stocking refills . means i go actual babies us store , which i hate . so , if they no longer stock , could serious strike against this product . ( but they still stock diaper dekor + , so i'd get instead .	1
clamp hangs door frame very secure , strap adjustable baby height . it rather hard get baby into it , however . it also rather large bulky my baby gets his hands stuck leg holes . i wish it didn't metal frame fit more snugly around his body so he felt more free jump around . this problem probably not such issue when he gets bigger , though . overall , it good product	1
i especially love this warmer middle night changes . cold wipes shocking baby skin cause lot upset . these warm wipes soothing not shocking . follow instructions add 1/2 cup water over wipes each time you fill warmer . this keeps wipes drying out . nightlight not show much light , but job	1
when deciding which froggy tales items i would need , i wondered how useful this hamper would . i thought it might flimsy not very practical . new mom never ordered nursery stuff before , i didn't know these hampers come separate lining easily lifts out its themed shell ! i happy i bought it . not must-have but definitely 5-star functional accessory .	1
my son 6 months old becoming way heavy me carry bjorn anymore . my low back shoulders we really starting aching . so i decided see if their something else out there i found it ! i torn playtex hip hammock ellaroo . playtex carrier so much good feedback i thought i would love too . i decided get them both give them try . i took hip hammock back immediately . material scratchy uncomfortable . it felt so synthetic looked cheap ugly . i wanted something i could wear out still look stylish . when ellaroo arrived i so happy ! fabric soft beautiful , it really natural feel it . now real test my son love it too . he ! second day he actually feel asleep it . i am able carry him around long time out feeling crippled afterwards . it great shopping well . it folds up small goes instant . my son wont deal sitting his infant carrier while i grocery shop so i would always end up pushing cart , holding him seat way , minding my 3 year old same time . i know you moms relate . now he content riding my hip things lot smoother everyone ! i highly recommend it ! just checking back in- my son one year old now i am still using carrier daily basis . we both comfy happy . now he walking it great keep him up when i don't want him crusing touching everything like doctors office . if i just holding him he would just squirm away get down . carrier also gone through several washings holding up just fine . my husband jokes one day my son wearing me it ! haha	1
this prettiest car seat best fit my baby ! she loves it	1
first time we ordered this bed half parts missing . i called wonderful customer service people they sent replacement bed . after long wait it finally came . it little hard put together but good amp ; quot ; know howamp ; quot ; this bed put together within 30-45 min . it very sturdy , i my husband test it out , he jiggled jubbled it it stayed together perfectly . my daughter loves it	1
i recommend this product all new moms without hesitation . this product awesome ! my baby slept much longer using swaddleme . i'm only sad my baby outgrown size large only 15 pounds ( 4 months ) , but he seems lost startle reflex , which reason he badly needed swaddleme first place . this one those items " must , " i buying all baby showers . i tried brand similar blanket wasn't nearly impressed ; velcro not stay attached . microfleece warm washes well .	1
i * love * this product . it far better velcro swaddler than other brands because it uses bigger patches velcro . comparison blanket , this much easier use provides much more durable swaddles . i'm quite good blanket , but six weeks age , my son could wriggle out . other hand , three months , he never wriggled out cotton flannel swaddleme . however , even cold weather , microfleece too hot . several times i've felt under blanket find my son sweaty . it even worse when we combine swaddle sling . other hand , cotton knit ( solid colors ) blankets too stretchy - my son quickly converts his knit swaddleme into toga , leaving both arms flying free . cotton flannel ( gingham prints ) less stretch than other two fabrics , plenty enough cover keep baby warm indoor temperatures . it trickier find , but worth search . microfleece swaddleme , however , make great non-swaddle blanket cold days , particularly when baby front carrier . velcro quite versatile .	1
we splurged little get this monitor but we very happy we so . i sleep much better night knowing my baby breathing monitored . instructions indicate sensor pad should placed under mattress directly under your baby no bedding or padding . however , i've found sensor work even through mattress , bedding , one inch thick sleep positioner . it super sensitive which great ! one thing keep mind - you should not ceiling fan night or strong draft room ( such ac vent blowing directly onto your baby crib ) . unit pick up air movement room . i highly recommend this product ! i would not resting night peacefully i am without it	1
halo sleepsacks great ! best part it zips bottom . i thought this weird first until i needed change her . you just unzip her stomach , change diaper , zip back down . we few cheaper sacks they zip top which always wakes our little girl up . it totally worth spending little extra money these	1
i decorated my entire nursery this theme am so pleased i could not found better set than this one ... i highly recommend this set everyone ..	1
we this toy since my son 3 weeks old ... he almost 7 months now , he loved it all . it still looks great still barks , when we travel we always sure take " red " thomas ' favorite toy ! it lots ' chewable ' pieces it attatches almost all his travel gear	1
after trying avent bottles my newborn hating them , friend recommened playtex nurser . my daughter very well them 2 weeks old 7 months old . soft nipples more like breastfeeding .	1
my baby enjoy this toy . he likes kick it hear music , i like it 3 modes - it just play music 10 minutes , baby kick it play songs , or it set play like keyboard when kicked . only problem ( one i see many crib toys right now ) it doesn't fit my crib . it 3 ties meant attached spindles crib . problem most cribs now ( such mine ) solid ends , you can't tie anything them . this toy meant used end crib , it simply won't fit . if you crib slats or spindles ends then you fine . i don't , so only way me use this toy hold it while my baby kicks it . fun him , but not me .	1
this good car seat . i can't quite get it level ground like it suppose when base attached , but it works same still . also , clips buckles get turned around sometimes strap . biggest pain i this . my daughter loves it	1
this exactly what we needed keep our baby getting hurt bath tub spout	1
we this system our baby crib , he seems like it more than just music playing nearby stereo . sound quality good low volumes , which appropriate crib bed or naptime , but quality deteriorates quickly once you raise it all . so , if you planning using this yourself , think again - but that not what it designed . i agree no-a/c adapter option stinks , but caught our baby holding ipod charging cord when ipod this device , i realize a/c adapter would just hazard - rechargeable batteries would great addition - that only reason i'm giving it four stars . our baby loves look lights . 15 minute timer great too , that all he really needs . i'd buy it again , plan getting it friends new babies	1
my daughter hospitalized forgot how nurse would naw get frustrated . nipples shield long she able re-learn how nurse using these shields . i highly recommend these moms who trouble nursing	1
i received this travel system yesterday couldnt wait put it together . car seat comes fully assembled but stroller needs put together . i didnt find it difficult all since everything just snaps into place . i gave this 4 stars because i find it little difficult attach carseat stroller . i find myself try quite few times before it snaps into place . other thing closing stroller needs some practice before you get it right . other than those two issues , stroller system very classy different others out there . material very soft touch huge wheels make it whizz push around .	1
this seller provided this great item ( hard find locally ) quickly conveniently , great price . diaper pail works great - wonderful you don't need special bags . very pleased	1
i such difficult time breastfeeding it near impossible me it without crying . after seeing tons lactation consultants i finally decided pump all my sons feedings . i given slightly older model pump style original not very comfortable . so i rented medela symphony month ($90 + starter kit ) . pump amazing but 90 month not so practical . so i bought pis advance . although it not efficient hospital grade symphony this pump amazing job . it much quiter than original 2 phase suction . not only 2 phase suction more efficient , i found initial short suck phase preps my body more intense longer pulls follow . most i'm sure original fantastic but if you're very sensitive pump style advance what you need ( unless you want shell out $90 month . symphony retails around $1250.00 . ouch ! ) good luck	1
i bought this booster seat because we just bought new table chairs , our previous hard plastic booster seat rubbed some paint off our old chairs . this seat wonderful ! it soft enough comfortable , my three year old climb into it herself without it sliding around chair . it rests against wood chairs without damaging them any way . i highly recommend it older toddler , but you might want something little more support younger child	1
attractice , lightweight comfy . grown-up enough kindergartener who would rather not booster all	1
both my 4 year old my little daughter 5 month old hate their noses suctioned ! my little girl reflux spits up lot , due she always quite some milkbuggers up her nose add , she teething like mammoth right now which makes her congested well . first she wanted sqirm away , but hummingsound comes it nice tune it plays destracted her ! since it vibrates quite bit i first touch her cheek it so she knows what expect she immidetly calmes down today started even giggle because it tickled her nose ! long short tip both very soft no sharp edges suction very gentle . yes , i agree it won't suck crusties out nose but even bulb , hard stuff should soaked couple seconds squirt saline up nose soften it . once you bigger buggers come out big tip ! i personally find bulbs invasive aspirators hospital pretty strong , so strong not even stuff use them unless babys oxygen drops due stuffiness nose ! i know i just spent 1 week hospital february my duaghter due rsv , yes those aspirators there shouldn't used unless there no other way ( but even there they use always saline first soften stuff then use suction)oh , way , aspirator comes handy little sack store tips easy take apart clean aspirator ! sure , suction not strong hospital one but hospital cannot used often you want , this one gentle enough even fun little ones while giving them relieve used needed it gentle ! that why it gets 5 stars me	1
this bunting soft inside like breaker outside . it well constructed good buy newborn . it looks feels better than other carriers out there	1
we purchased this walker our son because he loves elmo sesame street . we love it ! our son loves pushing " musical buttons " spinning red circle middle . it glides easily breeze get our son out . cover also comes off easily washing , if necessary . i'm not sure what " papa bear paul " talking , because there no paint our walker there no way our son hand get caught ... even if your little one doesn't enjoy sesame street much ours , you love this walker !	1
don't fooled ! this carseat cover no where near weather proof . that not say it isn't nice product . i like it much better than any other cover i've found . it keep my 3-month-old nice warm , however , flap goes over her head not secured anything . wind easily catches it blows it off	1
if you travel toddler this great item . we one " cheaper " ones before you get what you pay . cheaper one didn't last through first leg our trip ! this one very heavy duty well made .	1
easy use , fast , flexible tip . i believe readings where accurate beeping nice signal fever before you even looked thing . flexible tip also comes handy when you're doing underarm temp taking .... i hate doing rectal one , but this makes me feel like i'm not totally invasive . :	1
these toys don't hold water . they're colorful cute . they also pretty durable when dropped	1
these bags great ! my son extended nicu stay so i pump exclusively very careful hygiene . these i quickly easily sterilize my pump attachments , his bottles , his pacifiers or even couple his toys . all i add some water , microwave , drain . no boiling water , no timing , no accidentally melting things bottom pot , no hassle complicated electronic sterilzers , almost no storage space ! each bag good around 20 uses then you toss it out get new one , so package them lasts quite while . very handy when traveling too , since many hotels gas stations microwaves so you sterilize what you need go without trying haul bunch junk around you	1
this bag very useful , many pockets so everything order . looks very cool , i sometimes use it myself aswell . downside sometimes it hard remember which pocket you put your stuff . it would easier use if it symetrical so i carry it either my left or right shoulder . but result i am glad i it :)	1
i purchased this when my child already going 4 months old . he long tall boy , it winter time , i haven't occassion use this much except church around house . why oh why didn't i get this initially ? i nojo baby sling , which great when i my twenties but really pinched nerve ( literally ) me over decade later . my back feels so much better this product . especially if you already top heavy person , this sling relief . i love color , we'll going florida two months . i intend use this beach maybe zoo	1
we just ordered this crib last weekend already received it put it together . it looks really great . however , when we received box ups , it looked terrible we really afraid crib would damaged . it looks fine , although we touch up few places stain pen . i would recommend you inspect each piece carefully before putting crib together . also , directions came crib said nothing washers included hardware . we just sort figure out use them bolts . so , if you order this crib it comes washers , don't forget put them , because directions won't tell you ! we impressed how fast crib arrived free shipping great too . it wasn't terribly difficult put together , pretty sturdy , i would say it worth what we paid it	1
i love glass bottles , i now peace mind ! during late night feedings my husband i just place glass bottles bottle warmer without fear chemical contamination . only down side glass bottles heavier than plastic ; however , time your baby learn how hold them !!	1
we diaper genie , it total waste money plastic . diaper genie so hard use didn't anything stop odors . my son room smelled if we threw diapers open garbage . we replaced it first years clean air diaper disposal system . it awesome ! greatest thing it it store 6-7 days my son diapers without no yucky odors . wow !! it " clean air " venting system which totally 100% silent . i actually though it broken because it made no noise ! it runs batteries last 9 months . there little light briefly flashes let you know lid secure vent system working . it uses regular tall kitchen garbage bags -- saving us money . only drawback occasionally you shut lid it won't fully secure . you'd know two clues , first little green light won't flash . later you'll get second clue -- your baby room start smell ! i now check see if light each time i put diaper make sure lid secure . we love this product so much . our son room smells clean no poopy odors , we save money using our own tall kitchen bags . it also very easy change -- no confusing bag twisting . i highly recommend using this diaper holder , it best	1
after sleepless nights listening my husband snore i mission find something help me sleep while pregnant . i found this pillow target sleeping soundly ever since . must if you pregnant!it little expensive but worth every penny !	1
i searched online sage colored crib bedding weeks before my daughter born finally settled something close . i satisfied it matched well enough maintain cuteness her nursery ( utmost importance ) affordable same time . i seen breathable bumpers but opted " cuter " bedding , confident my child would safe . my daughter started sleeping through night 8 weeks which meant i not going into her room 7-9 hours time , depending night . even though i swaddle her sleeping , she still manages travel around her crib during night well during longer naps . one morning when i heard her wake up , i went into her room find she wiggled her way down southwest corner her crib her face pressed up against " adorable , nursery-matching , affordable " crib bumper . i jerked bumper out bed ran down order breathable bumper . since i put it her crib she pressed up against it two or three times able breath . i am delighted because i think it actually cuter than one i before i don't worry all ( least ! ) . it very clean look green gingham matches crib skirt i got perfectly . only reason i didn't give it 5 stars because fit . it comes 2 pieces : one side crib moves up down one other 3 sides . this leaves 2 openings , one each end front crib , arm or leg could potentially get stuck . it hasn't problem us yet she quit southwest travelling now just spins place . however , i would much rather risk let getting stuck than suffocated baby . i no regrets buying this am advising all my pregnant friends consider breathable option over puffy ones	1
my husband i looked several cribs in-store little unsure buying one over internet , however everything worked out we very pleased w/ our purchase . price , no shipping handling etc . can't beat . crib went together relatively well quite sturdy . wood mark rather easily , but our budget hardwood crib out question . we also purchased davinci emily changer/dresser . they look great together . overall , we very happy w/ our decision	1

we bought this sleeper our son help plagiocephaly 5-months . unfortunately , we didn't get this product soon enough . time we began use it , our son moving flipping around his crib more . it soon became more hazard since he would slide down his head would end up sleep positioners . we bought other sleep positioners use when he newborn wished we used this instead . product itself great . it easy wash care .	1
good quality car seat . only reason i'm rating it 4 instead 5 it big - it not fit easily rear-facing seat sedan car , but fits well when used forward facing . straps easy adjust . velcro sides seat helpful keeping straps side when putting child into seat	1

my wife i purchased this baby monitor preparation arrival our first child , after using it almost 2 weeks i could not more disappointed . we drawn promise clear connection would prevent others listening , but many drawbacks far outweigh this one advantage . this one more expensive highly rated baby monitors , but you certainly don't get what you pay here . pros : 1 . you get clear connection when unit range ( see cons further explanation)cons : 1 . biggest complaint i battery life . even parent units lowest volume setting , you not get more than 5 hours use without recharge . you know when you need recharge because unit start beeping loudly every 5 seconds until you put it back cradle recharge . this great feature discover during middle night . nursery unit even worse , it not take rechargeable batteries eat through 3 aaa batteries 6 hours unless it plugged . why they even allow this unit operate without plugged beyond me . basically all units plugged all times . 2 . i already couple instances where parent units simply not connect nursery unit . they just sit there beep like they if you out range . this required couple off/on power cycles nursery parent units correct . 3 . range not ideal . i 2800 square foot , 2 story house we already 1 issue where parent unit would not connect nursery unit . granted , units far away they our house , but considering this distance only 60 feet , i not think it unreasonable complete coverage our house . 4 . other reviewers noted , lowest volume setting too loud if you light sleeper . since speaker always , you hear any ambient noise room amplified played parent unit . several other monitors market noise thresholds only transmit sound if it above certain volume ( i.e. if baby crying opposed shifting crib ) . also leds also extremely bright dark room . unfortunately i cannot recommend this product . we making due it simply because i refuse throw away $100 baby monitor , although i'm sure i would much happier different product . if you deal leaving units plugged all times only taking parent units out cradle short periods time , then this product would probably suffice , although i'm sure you could find much cheaper product would work just well	-1
i wish i would checked reviews other people wrote before buying this item ! these flimsy , thin little sheets not snug or even slightly fitted matter . i'm definitely going purchase brand actually fit play yard pad . fortunately there other products work better ... if this only option , i might well not sheet all .	-1
seems like good idea seat . i liked handles them hold ( more sanitary ) it sits okay big adult seat . but opening just too small . it not lack deflector . i brand bigger opening our other bathroom my son fine one . this one pee gets all over his legs , seat , stool floor each every time . this big hassle , unsanitary pain clean up each time he tries go potty . maybe it would okay petite girl but not boy . we shopping replacement now . i don't want deflector type because doctors warn they scrape little boys private area cause them not want sit potty because it might hurt . we just teach him point " it " down potty bigger opening works just fine	-1
i ordered this through walmart . com received it damaged , but walmart and/or storkcraft use distributor called seko worldwide . seko delivery truck delivered crib . so either this storkcraft problem or seko problem , but head board piece completely split off two other pieces dented or chipped off . walmart re-odering crib this one picked up me it 80-pound box . hopefully next crib won't damaged , but if so , i am giving up storkcraft completely . walmart didn't rating system leave comments , when i saw others this website damage problems , i wanted relay my experience well . walmart graciously refunded my shipping fee , which large . i then received second crib it spotless . delivery man seko worldwide said they hear complaints this lot blamed air carrier flies boxes out ground shipping location . i also emailed storkcraft what happen other negative reviews , they offered send replacement piece broken piece ( but no mention dented/chipped piece ) then proceeded place blame retailer . i not impressed . i willing take my chances reorder one fortunate customers who recieved unmarked crib . i put it together myself , all parts accounted drawer works great . i only bought this price convertable feature but not buy storkcraft future .	-1
our knobs front stove , these covers hung down over oven door , either got way , or popped off regular basis ( or pulled off our 16 month old ) . we found it easier just remove knobs put them counter when stovetop wasn't use	-1

after 5 boys my first daughter just pink highchair her princess 1st birthday party so i retired boys trusty blue graco ( still great shape after 4 years ) into basment ordered this pink one . after what we paid it ~ i don't know how tell my husband i want blue one back ! ( maybe i fnd pink cover ?! ) my daughter 12 months old 20 pounds cannot reach tray without dropping food into her lap . there 3inch gap her tray so half her food she tries feed herself drops into her lap . thick padded seat adorable comfy her but it such deep crevices you really dig deep get every crumb cleaned up . base very large her food falls down onto it after every meal so i am not only cleaning floor but base well . buckles awkward impossible one hand . if you petite baby ~ this not highchair you	-1
i wish i put storage bags my registry instead . they work okay multipurpose container , but my freezer full these things . moreover , i got 8 oz ones , so they only 1/2 full my newborn only drinks 3-4 oz right now . one major pains these you buy lids containers seperately . plus , you need adapter fit pump .. something i didnt know i needed didn't get . waste money avent .	-1

i no idea bjorn so expensive , since i got it gift my baby shower . but knowing what i know now , id definately spend cash since its such blessing it . my baby reflux really bad when she born alot times , only way help her feel comfortable her bjorn facing me so she could fall asleep . ( she needed upright or inclined help her not spit up so much ) it so used , im super glad its easy put take off . durability it awesome also i still dont see any wear tear it after almost daily use . now my baby getting older , i switch her forward she loves . she see everything grab whatever front her . ease clips godsend , so i clip her quickly without need someone assist me . i tried some other carriers , but all straps clips so confusing . plus alot others arent reversible . you only your baby face inwards . this totally worth money guys !	1
now i've caved power pink ( it only took three girls me finally give ) , this turns out very cute second cheapest i could find . quality seems fine ( two weeks post purchase ) who doesn't love tool keeps kiddo safe calm while one dishes or makes dinner rest brood ...? first babe , we given different seat aimed improvement over classic very simple bouncy seat , but so many functions it basically useless . this case , though , where basics best . looking around new one , saw many $100 ; if you stomach not-as-posh aesthetic , this seems like great value seat only used few months , anyway	1

i bought two potties before i realized my boy big bottom most other potties really small opening no pee guard front . i broke down bought this . this doesn't bells whistles like some other potty . but it beauty its simplicity . he able sit his business , carry urine/poop container toilet rinse it all himself ( he not even 2 yet ! ) . i would highly recommed potty training book " potty training less than day " . it out print but you might find used copy [ ... ]	1
these definitely life saver during first 1-2 weeks when you don't want compression nipple you want them air dry . i small breasts so i could wear them any bra , i didn't huge leakage problem , so i changed foam twice day . only problem i my skin broke out where rubber rested against it . i think it got damp wasn't allowed breathe because it cleared up within 48 hours after i stopped using them . bottom line : relief worth any minor inconvenience	1
my daughter loves cuddle soft sleep sheep i love this product because it puts her right sleep calm soothing sounds ! i love rain ! even i fall asleep listening it . i originally bought sleep sheep because my neighbors upstairs squeaky floors they walking around late night wake up my daughter . so i block out their squeaky noises turning up sleep sheep noise blocker :) i am happy so my daughter who sleeping like baby !!!!!!!	1

i little apprehensive ordering this product , i read all negative comments . i ordered it anyway , because good comments described potty one would benefit my son . when it arrived ( earlier than expected ) , i noticed it easy assemble , because it not made very thick plastic , it probably wouldn't good idea order this big children who potty training . my son 18 months old , 22 lbs , it perfect him , sturdy enough him climb up use potty . he really enjoys climbing up himself , it encourage him more independent process . i let him look box , we talked how little girl going potty , he liked seeing little girl box :) using potty , " just like him " . so if your child very big , or potty training 3+ years , i wouldn't order this , they don't need it . i would just get stool	1

i bought this same crib may 2005 buy buy baby it came six weeks pretty easy assemble i it while i pregnant . it no scartches or chips . i like it lot my daughter loves it . we havent converted it toddler bed or full bed shes only 2 . but its very roomy . it get dented little easily when she banged toy it there some dents but since its white you dont notice it much . i really like it cuz quality superb we're very very happy . fact we bought one amazon , my son . my kids 12 months apart so we needed crib him since now hes 1 . he likes it lot too . but even though company everything same . crib come some damaging it , but it wasnt bad , you dont really notice it , we got lucky i guess . but i plan just paint over parts where white paint come off . quality also seems different it doesnt seem dense first one i bought . i dont know whether manufacturing changed or its quality issues . but overall its nice crib i just wish it came better condition it same wood feeling first one . but its definately worth buy . it came super fast shipping amazon . shipping free too . but its well worth buy !!!!!! my kids happy so im happy !!	-1

basic idea great ease assembly nice - no tools needed . we used it all grandchildren ( 6 ) one nephew . i think it needs some design improvements : ( 1 ) straps which used hold it chair would better if there strap which went front back , not just around back seat . one grandkids seems unable sit still i keep expecting him tip over chair because it tends slide sideways front . ( 2 ) tray designed slim child . one side , tray fits finger like protusion into hole . other side , there 2 places attach tray slots . only when tray innermost position , it aligned directly front child there isn't great deal tummy room . if you move tray outer position ( available one side only ) , tray cocked angle it still probably wouldn't accomodate child larger stomach . ( 3 ) belts hold child need longer . fortunately us , all grandkids nephew slim . least so far	-1
i absolutely love this matress . i purchased high end crib usa baby they tried convience me purchase these ridiculously priced matresses . i decided get best quality matress offered babies us . this matress much better than anything they offering over $150 dollars . delivery quick easy . i love amazon/babiesrus i love this matress . absolutely perfect !!	1
bit difficult install , guide marking placement screws slightly off so we couldn't fit feet , but that okay because we didn't actually need them . looks nice , better than white barred gates . i find it easy open . i it one handed once you figure out how it . easy clean ! we gate up keep kids our out kitchen . when eating lunch they tend touch gate sticky messy hands but wipes off easily wet cloth . people often comment how nice gate . i love neutral color . happy purchase	1
others said , lid easily removed even very young child . first time we used it , our son took lid off spilled snacks . but after few times , he figured out if he took lid off snacks would spill , stopped taking lid off . we find it very useful our now 27-month-old ( we started using it probably year ago ) . it not perfect but we not found substitute	-1
great boppy cover ! color goes practically any decor it super smooth comfy	1
i love not worry blankets crib when i put my son his sleep sack . middle night diaper changes easy , too	1
i bought this seat when my son 8 months old he too big his graco sung ride . i 2005 honda crv . rear facing position seat belt not long enough strap it seat . my suv only latch system side seats not middle seat . i spoke car safety officier police department he told me place him side seat behind passenger seat this would safest place regards incidence accidents since i could not use middle position . reason he told me not use latch middle position ( using side seats latch system ) since my suv not equipped it because latch connected car frame if we accident frame car bent it could tear his seat pieces . i not aware latch connected frame . so officier told me when he able forward facing i should able put him back middle seat it shouldn't require so much length seatbelt . i love this seat so my son who now 9 1/2 months . it very soft cushy . i probably wouldn't bought infant car seat if i aware this seat could accomodate even newborn . i would definately recommend this seat . it very easy install . it not cup holder only thing i wish it when he older	1
this great take-off normal boppy ( which also wonderful invention ! ) . i like it smaller , which better propping baby up tummy time . i also like toys attach boppy . i usually add few more links , variety ... but this not necessary . tummy time such important part baby day , especially because doctors ' suggestions keeping baby his back sleep . this great way keep tummy time easy fun	1

i prefer avent bottles over playtex ventaire brand . they both worked well advantages over one . this my non scientific review . head head comparison : criteria_____________comment1 . bottle material______avent stays clearer more dense . 2 . bottle design_______playtex curve shape innovative . 3 . nipple design_______baby likes avent shape better . avent nipple size labeled more visibly . avent recommended flow rate age fits my baby more . 4 . vent system________both work well . no difference . 5 . assembly ease______avent less parts , but nipple harder assemble . avent recommends wetting nipple before assembly . slight advantage playtex . 6 . cleanning ease______avent less parts . this big timesaver me . playtex 2 more parts clean . it hassle if you cleaning lot them . 7 . overall quality______avent bottle seems better constructed . i'm not saying avent better than playtex . i just prefer avent more . because it fits my baby my needs better	1
bought this month ago my baby girl . she 5 months old now doing much better sleeping this product . i also feel more comfortable knowing she elevated slightly night time . this product exactly what it says it . worth every penny ! mr. mom	1
like other reviewer , i needed something my daughter could splash around while i took shower . way , i'm sure neither us leave our children unattended . we want our children accompany us we bathe , so i purchased this tub , she grown out her other tubs . it great tub . it large size , but we very large shower , so it works great us . it work great regular tub too . my daughter can't wait climb . only drawback mine got tear side , but we it while , so i'm going purchase one . you also can't find inflatable tubs very easily . i highly recommend this tub	-1
our baby wasn't sleeping too well her bassinet when we first brought her home . first time parents , we afraid bring her into bed us fear smushing her . so we went babies us found this , purely accident . yes , price little high what we use mostly just sleep positioner , but we love it folds up travel . we planning skip bassinet few upcoming trips just take this us . we queen-sized bed , it bit snug three us fit , but we it . now she tolerating bassinet so we've moved nest her bassinet . it inclines , sometimes she wiggles down , but she still positioned her back ! it comes two sheets , which great ! it handy led nightlight quick pacifier replacement or covert diaper checks . bedding firm but comfy . i am very happy product , i would recommend it others . it pretty new product otherwise i would put it my registry when i still pregnant .	1
i bought this mirror because it sale i'm glad i . mirror very large i see my son clearly without shift or strain like i previous mirror . colours also bright attractive get his attention soon i put him seat , he seems talk butterfly incessantly . although it not play music light up like some other mirrors , he few car seat toys also distract him well enough when he looses interest mirror . i gave it only four stars because it bit difficult install my particular car . my middle seat not headrest attach it , nor it latch so i resort using some pins keep it place . but all all great item .	-1
this life saver . our little one likes move around crib , but she couldn't figure out how get " unstuck " when her arm or leg went through crib slate . we crib turns into headboard/footboard it still works great .	1
my son this mattress over 2 years now its form still great . he wont sleep anywhere else other than his bed . we now use it his toddler bed i layed down it few times ( pretending nap ) believe it more comfortable than my bed !!! it really full mattress offers great support our little ones spines !! why we purchased our second one our new daughter . i know my son isnt ready give his bed up !!	1
my granddaughter 3 years old potty trained quite some time now .. when she used regular training potty seat she always wanted me accompany her but now she flip flush she likes go alone . i recommend this any child who wants independence going potty alone . it great invention	1
sheets very soft after first wash they also fit mattress well . price good buy	1
container hokey we tossed it , but it great value all products inside . fever reducer/pain relief drops ( just like tylenol ) don't taste too good , but they work . it nice gift gives new parent reassurance they'll what they need emergency .	1
spent money other stroller shields would fly away gust wind , i so happy this one not let me down . it extremely secure since it couple velcro straps actually stitched shield ( thank you)that keep shield place . others come stickers come right off but not this one . it actually covers stroller all way . right now i am using stroller system carriage car seat it , so it kind bulky , but this shield actually covers stroller down foot rest down back behind handles . roominess excellent . cool pop up part what makes it easier put too . it bit tricky first close it since you twist it certain way order so , but it well worth effort . no more fly aways awkward folding .	1
i attribute my son great sleeping early swaddleme . velcro life saver because most babies break out blanket you've swaddled them then you worry blanket smother them middle night . only issue we when he got little older stronger , he would bust out his arm . usually he would continue sleeping but sometimes it would wake him up . i'd take any day over trying deal regular blanket . it amazing calming effect helps prevent them waking themselves up their arm leg movements . you also should really go cotton because it breathes- i wouldn't recommend fleece polyester doesn't breathe	1
i home day care i own 9 these gates . yes , you mount them wall , but holes small safetly factor makes it worth it . gates stood test time , most over 7 years old still same , walls needed anchores because my dry wall given out before gates . i recommend these anyone who needs permanent , safe , attractive gate .	1
after looking all options , we decided this car seat carrier . it perfect ! first , it lightest least bulky all carriers . it folds up into nothing makes very maneuverable stroller . second , it great suspension more forgiving over rough surfaces . third , it far most sleek stylish car seat carrier available . i'm not one write reviews products , but i felt compelled write something since we used this carrier every day last 3 mos , it one most useful things we own . you won't disappointed	1
am very happy i purchased this product , am able stay away hours while baby my mom . it must every breastfeeding mom . it fast very effective . it discreet too , comes great tote bag little bottle bag well insulated . i strongly recommend it .	1
i bought this my daughter when she born october . we used it all winter long . it very convenient easy put stroller or infant carrier . it holes fit staps through , so baby strapped secure . we didn't bother jackets snowuits , just put baby zip it up	1
features make it good : there flap head end tucks behind under your mattress keep it place . top portion molded plastic , decent height , which helpful if you're toss/turner - you won't roll over onto it . lower half mesh , which one assumes allow air circulation , but i think it mostly way allow it fold , portable . there foam wedge foot end prevent baby " scootching " out it . however , this makes sleeper short enough only last maybe 3 months ( more or less , depending length baby ) . i've read other buyers " split mattress , " but mine not split , but one piece . after folded , it obviously bent middle , but i solved just flipping mattress over use . i suppose split mattress designed after complaints mattress bent , so not great change my opinion . i also liked nightlight - just bright enough let us see baby , without waking her up fully . it sized so it would best fit king size bed ( if you 2 parents bed ) , but we managed queen . after reading other reviews , thinking my own use this sleeper , i've come conclusion : length may too short use it long , however , once baby outgrows it lengthwise , it probably time get him out your bed , he too mobile sleeper this design . so perhaps good planning first years part	-1

i just got my 2007 revolution i absolutely love it . my 19 month old gave it his seal approval when he refused get out it first time he went ride . if he even sees it , he wants it ! main differences 2007 2006 : 1 . increased seat recline up 70 degrees ( earlier versions only recline 45 degrees)2 . increased back support seat back3 . additional padding added seatquite frankly , these improvements weren't huge selling point me . if my son infant , increased seat recline might matter , but his age he doesn't want recline all . sun canopy biggest i've ever seen stroller . past i've put blanket over canopy try shield sun my son eyes , but this canopy solves problem . it huge ! maneuverability , revolution far surpasses any other stroller i've tried . it smooth , steady ride . i typically use swivel feature , but stroller still great front wheel locked position . storage basket fairly large jogger sufficient typical walk or jog . i take this stroller mall today , while it incredibly easy maneuver through mall , storage basket not large enough shopping storing packages way . it very easy fold fairly compact when it folded , but it not latching feature which makes picking it up bit awkward . it not huge deal me , though , since i usually leave it open ready go our garage ( thank god 3-car garages ! ) . i really like 5 point harness my son doesn't mind buckled into seat . he seems very comfortable snuggles right soon i put him . " cup holders " inside seat nice , but he hard time getting his cups into them which tends frustrate him . older child may not issue this , though . shock absorbers really nice work very well . we " off road " it still nice smooth ride . if i hit uneven area pavement or branches/roots trail , it barely noticeable . overall i am very happy this stroller . , more importantly , it got my son seal approval	1
my 11 month old son my husband i love this backpack . i originally just started out using baby bjorn loved until he hit 5 months started gaining weight .. then it killed my shoulders . this backpack great ... comfortable .. lot weight your hips . highly recommended !	1
we black white large monitor also picture quality black white camera much clearer than color camera . color samera picture looks like there some oil lens or something - not necessarily grainy , just smudged looking . i returned it new one see if color one i defective . i didn't see why picture quality would differ . we'll see ! also , you never get much color so don't ' buy it . we didn't care color much size/portability monitor . also , you easily plug it into tv if you want picture tv instead monitor . very cool idea . but overall we love these monitors . black white one crystal clear , excellent sound , good reception too . you move monitor around sometimes if something else interferes it but this very minor problem our house . also , if you walk monitor camera path it sometimes gets static . again , rarely problem . ours sits right near our phones , computers , etc . we two monitors switch channels see each kids rooms which so convenient . definitely " can't live without it " item our family . although regular black white one good enough if you don't care portability/counter space . also , we great experience summer infant customer service . after black white monitor long time we noticed low pitched hum they sent us replacement very quickly , no problem .	-1

few swaddle blankets ... my son hated swaddled ... so this blanket worked out well us ... he would fall asleep breast then i could lay him down this blanket wrap him up it while he asleep ( no battles ) he snug his blanket which helped him sleep longer better ... but other blankets required wrapping flipping under him , etc ... which woke him or if i swaddled him while awake , he would cry fuss ... so this my swaddling savior ... i since bought more my baby due soon ! :)	1

i my first baby 2004 , new mom spent tons money cute little bottles pictures designs them only come realise they gave my daughter worst gas ever . i switched playtex bottles right away , didn't any trouble after ! my second baby came 2005 denial , tried cutsie bottles again thinking maybe it just my daughter . sure enough tummy ache , lots gas ! playtex bottles came back into our home right away , never problem . i just couldn't believe they worked so wonderful . they so much easier wash , pre-sterilized liners just pop right , larger nipple looks so much more comfortable than those tiny nipples some bottles . my sister law her first baby november , i swore her they worked like charm . i bought her tons her baby shower , she started them , mixed breast , also amazed they worked miracles ! i would guarentee positive results anyone who asked , wouldn't recommend anything else . those cute bottles may calling , but itn't worth your little one alot pain discomfort	1

this item well loved our family . i want go ahead state my only disappointment it though fact it took lot elbow grease collapse it travel or storage . it very stiff always became my husband job . he didn't like it either , way . otherwise it great i able use it until my daughter 8 months old ( then she could crawl out so it not safe use ) . it nice her close middle night breastfeedings . since we only queen bed , it good able put her into it after feeding so my husband i could more room bed . finally , middle night diaper changes or clothes changes ( my daughter huge spitter upper ) it wonderful everything right there where i needed it . it like second changing table . i used it changing table while i sitting bed . if i standing , it uncomfortably low . i bend down too much . ( i'm 5'10 " ) one more thing-it great when your baby wants nap . i rolled it close window when she newborn so she could get some sunlight help rid her jaundice .	1
i use these mats my 2 1/2 yr . old twins my dining room table . they keep mess off wood easy clean . you also travel easily them .	1
i love this secure easy use toilet lock . i used this lid lock my toddler 10 months until 3 years . best thing it , it works well , but not attached adhesive , so it installed removed easily use or cleaning . i think previous reviewer must strange potty , or more likely , just it installed improperly . if used properly , it clamps onto rim potty without permanently attached . i found it difficult remove , couldn't remove it just pulling . it also doesn't rattle if it installed front half toilet not under little buttons keep seat off rim . i tried it variety toilets . we able spare travel , so every toilet safe . i really can't understand what went wrong previous reviewer . i wish i could help her try install it so it would work . there two sizes clamps fit different sizes toilet rims , i found i use one our very old upstairs potty other more modern downstairs potty . you clamp them tightly rim though , or it won't work , would certainly rattle . maybe problem . base clamp that adjustable fit rim toilet tightly . then there swing-up/down latch clamps over lid seat keeping both them down . you lift two buttons same time you lift latch , i found i could easily it one hand while holding newborn , but my toddler , who could easily defeat all our cabinet , drawer , door locks just couldn't it . because i it one handed trick wasn't obvious . well , i recommend this all my friends , buy more my new house	1
i love wireless option you take it anyware i hear alot noise wire but i bought it wirless i use it wireless only there no noise all when used wirless i like it . it what i looking fo	1
i am first time parent 4 month old . i surprised learn babies can't clear their own noses until they 3 years old . i tried using manual bulb aspirator but my little one would get frustrated i would limited success clearing his nose . it usually took several attempts get into nostril once there , i only able get good suction 1/3 time . maybe others better luck than me but these my stats . i ordered nasalclear week ago . i concerned vacuum might too strong little noses or tips would too invasive . vacuum very gentle . i prefer shorter , stouter tip it seems less likely go too far up nostril . either tip certainly shorter than one manual bulb . suction , while gentle , very effective cleaning nostril . i surprised how much little nostril could hold . said , nasalclear comes collecion cup max fill line it seems absurdly large . i yet get even drop into chamber ( there quite bit storage space tubes leading chamber get filled ) so i can't even imagine filling it . i don't find music feature very important . it great product works well doesn't irritate my baby . so far , there hasn't tear caused nasalclear -- which huge improvement over manual bulb	1
our five month old son took right it ! he immediately began pushing himself around within hour he figured out how direct it where he wanted go . this great product !! this injection moulded plastic so there no paint flake off . perhaps he reviewing wrong item	1
this really nice changing pad . it soft comfortable . only thing i didn't like you buy cover it , so that more add'l money . it worth price though .	1
i originally tried type shopping cart cover which difficult use . friend mine using buggy bagg i impressed she able install it cart one hand while holding her baby other . i liked buggy bagg * completely * covered anywhere baby might touch . it comes pillow but frankly padded back seat so comfortable i never needed use it . ( you may find pillow more useful younger baby isn't sitting up steadily yet . ) i've also used it cover restaurant high chair - fit very tight bit lopsided , but if you small baby it works out great ! large pockets back also great feature . i keep wipes , diapers diaper cream large pocket all time , smaller pockets come handy while i'm shopping my sunglasses coupons .	1
i love my clean shopper every time i use it , i least one person asking me where i got it . i also buy it baby gifts all my friends . it best purchase i've bought . there no strings tie , no velcro deal , no snaps or buttons ... it just piece fabric covers pretty much all size carts . keep my now toddler occupied while i shop ( i still use it him ) i place some goldfish either next him , or front him he eats them while i shop . those who say there no cushioning , that not really purpose clean shopper ! it purpose act buffer you cart . if there cushion it tons bells whistles , then it would too bulky too cumbersome deal . i easily flip it cart one hand while i've got my kid my other . i highly recommend clean shopper any parent	1
i using maclaren triumph past 18 months , envious all features my friends strollers . what my stroller missing ? - leg rest , window through canopy , greater sun shade , ability increase recline thoroughly , all found zooper twist , plus more . i love matching boot , accessories included . i may go ahead order more structured cup holder cuz i dont trust mesh one coffee . also , wheels smaller than what you might find more expensive stroller , so longer walks you may want nicer zooper model . other than , it gorgeous , perfect mall walking/ shorter street walks . my friends now stroller envy me change , thats fun . ; -	1
this product really great idea- it also well made . sadly , it worked 10 minutes our 3 year old daughter- she figured out how get it off . certainly recommended item those whose children don't like playing " houdini escape artist " routine .	-1
it wonderful deal price . i especially like safety feature t-bar holds child without tray	-1
this potty so small easy use go , making it indespensable tool potty training . it comes little carrying bag folds up so small you fit small bag , large purse , under seat car , just anywhere , so you it handy when kids need go . this way kids potty trained don't use large adult toilets public restrooms if they aren't comfortable they use this anywhere , if there isn't restroom nearby . refill bags could get expensive so we just use generic plastic bags they work fine too	1
easy assemble , solid wood , no damages , nice color good price .	1

i spent hours online stores comparing cribs my grandson . very hesitant purchase something this big online , especially after reading some reviews it coming damaged , but when i saw price , cheap shipping , i figured it worth try . i am so glad i . crib arrived time , perfect shape , packed very secure , not scratch . directions easy follow , all parts included , we it up hour . ( even two old grandparents . ) my daughter spent almost $500 her crib , i think this one more sturdy better looking . haven't chance put our little guy it yet , but so far i believe we very happy it . i plan getting round teether covers top rails , since i don't want him scratching it up his teeth ! would recommend it anyone , especially this price .	1
i received this gift my baby shower . i 2 pumps hospital 1 pump wic . avent one one i liked best i am still using it . it small easy use . it also nice because you attach bottle or throw away containers , or use collapsible liners it comes . i don't pump lot or often , so it perfect me .	1
this jumper great . my son doesn't really like jump it , but he love play attached toy . plus it loops straps so i attach my own toys it too . i bought it thinking he would spend long time jumping away , but it turns out , it just portable " exersaucer " he plays ( which great travel , or just place him play ) . i bought some others market without toys , he would very bored . maybe my next child use it actually jump ? ;	1
my granduaghter only 5 months , but i am sure we get great use out this walker	-1
leaking : put pieces wrong or over tighten , they leak . pay attention assembly so you put small plastic pieces exactly they came out it won't leak . hard find : local stores/markets rarely cary avent line products . i would guess it because they don't sell . they probably don't sell because they're ... expensive : finally found avent magic cup market . it $8 one cup . since then , haven't able find any any price my local stores . we're raising our granddaughter she drug baby . change doesn't come easy her it very hard teach her anything new . after trying every cup market ( reason i only purchased one time ) , this one finally trick	-1
we several toilets so i bought other potty seats intially so i didn't carry up down stairs . handles must user get cleaner take seat out without touching icky stuff . boy cup this one not removable user . one other model i , cup didn't last day . this ring far most stable . reviews it unstable , i wonder if foam supports put . addition , your child supposed supervised bathroom ! good grief ! they shouldn't leaning over anything ... hand them book ! chafing ? how long kid sitting there ? overall excellent seat . i ended up replacing all potty seats house this model .	1

this product not safe product should not used your child . not only it give additional padding not intended , nor tested your safety seat , but it also voids warranty safety seat . nhtsa ( national highway traffic safety administration ) government agency sets standards child safety seats states " after-market products " should not used . it also not meet fmvss213 standards stated manufacturer description	-1
this high chair great start , but after while tray table would come loose one side during meals . i thought it me , first , not latching it correctly but we soon realized it my 9 month old releasing clasp . reluctant change chairs we persevered now , 3 months later , she remove both sides entirely send tray its contents crashing floor . i am worried she either trap her fingers tray comes loose or bruise her legs tray falls ground . if you looking chair last you into toddler-hood your child learns quickly , don't buy this one . i am looking replacement before my daughter hurts herself	-1
before i even opportunity use this product , it disappointed me . i washed this item per manufacturer instructions . bottom pad came out drier all pilled . i wonder how many more washings this pad stand . truly disappointment	1

after my husband i put this together using terrible directions , we've using this free-standing bassinet past 5 months ( not attached bed , some people ) . my daughter sleeping it just fine . however , we attempted fold it up take it us weekend away home recently . what nightmare collapse ! again , directions absolutely no help . it impossible get whole thing into carrying case get it zipped up . also , this thing weighs ton . i now realize i need buy something else use when travelling . how annoying . bottom line : if you're going set this up never take it down , it fine ( once you initially get it put together , ) . however , if you think you'd like use this occasional overnight trip away home , forget it !	1

this stroller great year half . my only complaint until now sunshade .... it doesnt block much sun when up falls off when down seems always catch things when folded ... but i could deal how light easy this stroller . it easy steer one handed when needed folds down very compact . however , now i am suddenly problems it folding while use . it it both my 2.5 year old my 9 month old , so its not related weight . every time it happened i right there , so there no injuries , but i am leary put my children it now . i contacted chicco told , " sorry , you out warranty " their products carry 1 year warranty , i purchased mine year half ago . i only gave 2 stars because it 4 or 5 star worthy until it started folding its own ,..... otherwise i would try give it no stars . every mom wants feel their child safe , i am now uneasy safety this stroller	1
don't bother , it doesn't fit all !!!!!! plain simple ... just don't bother	-1

shoppers beware : item itself great item but i received worst shipment ever my online orders : 1-even though item advertised amazon new , i received item which previously used apparently long long time . rocker seat dirty smelled . 2-even though seller charges more than 9 dollars shipping , they not bother put manufacturer fragile box mailing box . therefore package arrived cut several locations some items bulging out . 3-some accessories missing i bet previous owner forgot return them	-1
ditto other complaints - won't separate easily- either unscrewing or prizing . cheap , flimsy , leaks water also because no gasket . i'm looking something else hoping reviewers give honest good advice . . . this almost identical product munchki	-1

$52.00 less weighted down cash , i my way what most expensive non-video monitor available local target . surely most ridiculously expensive all highlighted bubbles beside features like " clear reception " " no interference " i would able hear baby every move every household location beyond . we hooked it up short order , turned it , * screeeech * . apparently volume level might permit us hear baby one room away would also cause some sort massive interference monitor reciever . we tried shutting monitor off , plugging second kitchen outlet - entire length house away . no screeching , but it sounded like someone speaking inside tin . totally distorted , useless . you couldn't tell if baby banging her crib bars or if someone moving heavy machinery her bedroom . we've packed it carefully back into box , hoping target take it back without fight . needless say , i'd steer clear this one . our $20 safety first monitor far surpasses this one - even its last leg	-1
i bought this hoping it would help my newborn calm down or sleep same way hair dryer or vacuum cleaner work so well . this thing doesn't white noise sound but i thought maybe womb sound might work . however volume not even close loud enough compare hair dryer . it just become toy my older child who likes play other sounds .	-1
i brought this gift my son his wife ; their daughter born 2/21/07 . when i questioned them why they not used bottle warmer , they just didn't get around using it . i insisted they read directions start using it . next day , my son stated . wow mom this best baby shower gift . they could not believe how fast bottle warmer worked . how much timed it saved them new parents , milk heated just right temperature each time . my son so thankful , i insisted he use product	1

i agonized over whether buy this cheaper pump or go straight one high-end ($250+) models . effort save money i started this one . but i quickly realized i'd made mistake -- it took * forever * even get one ounce milk . i ended up getting medela pump style loved it . i just wish i'd gone straight one saved my money this one . those you who trying decide this or more expensive model , here my two cents : try this one if ... - you very abundant milk supply- you only plan pump one or twice month- you wouldn't mind giving your baby formula if you away her extended periodinvest money higher-end model if ... - you're going back work- your milk supply medium low- you plan pump more than two or three times per month- you opposed giving your baby any formula , ever ( higher quality pump you could build up reserve breastmilk case emergency)also , it worth noting most more expensive models safely re-used other people so could sold someone else when you're ( unlike this one )	1
i thought these would great , but could never get them work right . sometimes they would flow sometimes not . i would take bottom off make it work then remember put it back after using them or dump it all over . many pieces , much trouble , i would upset my baby would also ! switched avent loving it	-1

i bought dual room imonitor yesterday . ( only available store babies us ) . it same one shown here , but it two transmitters montor two children . based only 4 hours testing , i am taking unit back . pro : -the range great . whole house , plus 800ft outside . -no interference . i live dense suburban area many sources interference . -easy setup . -shape/size parent units much better than others ( especially sony)cons : -controls not very straightforward . -the unit always hisses . it not sound/voice activated . -the power switch parent unit button not recessed . when you turn it off , it not beep or let you know you . button easy bump , would make it easy carry thing while it off , you think it . -the deal breaker : power outage requires turns off child units . even short power interruption , child units come up " off " mode . you go baby room turn them . until you , parent unit beep flash red . we using sony 910 3 years our first child . i guess it spoiled us	1
i two double strollers , 1 front back graco this side side aria . i don't use front/back graco much not able both children sleeping same time ( 2 1/2 year 1 year . i peg mt single first loved it . so thought product quality would same . used it 2 years no problems . but say stay clear aria design . our side side numerous pieces fall off , cup holder , seat clip , logo tag , clip hold trays place , etc . its not durable all ! we even close it using pen one side due clip you lift left side falling off too ! we took it plane trip last week sworn whole stroller off . my sister law single same problems product . she since bought maclaren single i am process purchasing maclaren twin techno . it may cost more but it would alot cheeper buying it first than second	1

very useless pants . i bought them tried them my toddler twins they not work all boy or girl i buy correct size . they even leaked when used over diapers night . they bascially nothing	-1
i started my newborn out using avent bottles . after few weeks , she began crying alot . you could hear gas moving her tummy , every time her tummy would grumble , she would pull her legs up shriek pain . she would also pass gas constantly . it so difficult feed her because she would cough , spit cry whole time . then she would miserable gas pains hours afterwards . i tried switching formulas - didn't work . tried mylicon , zantac , gripe water , bicycling her legs , etc . etc . etc ... nothing worked . pediatrician diagnosed her colic said there nothing we could , she would outgrow it . finally , we decided switch bottles ( i switched playtex nursers . ) instantly we noticed difference ! she extremely quiet during feedings , didn't squirm or cry ! she began ingesting almost twice much formula per feeding(probably because her tummy too full gas take any more avent bottles ! ) would go longer feeds . when she swallowed , it sounded different - you could tell she no longer swallowing air ! something those avent bottles made her swallow tons air . i think it suction created inside bottle she ate . playtex nursers , liner inside bottle contracts she eats , eliminating any air bubbles . she completely different baby now . she more alert interacts us much more because she spends less her awake time crying . so if you decide buy these bottles - beware . if you already using them your baby colic , switch immediately ! don't just assume colic " normal " or " outgrown . " babies don't deserve suffer this way !!!	-1
this item packaged very poorly . you literally rip box apart open it . i this twice , both times very last item completely cracked half . very inconveniently shipped packaged .	-1
i bought this my grand-daughter , here my daughter reviews how this product working ( or not ) " hmmmmm .... she loves music more than potty itself . we listen dance " potty " song everyday- but there little progress actual potty . i think way go her may attachable seat goes top real toliet . otherwise she carries potty around room room treats it like seat . i think getting something looks more like real toliet would worked better . or perhaps she going thru phase not over yet , so maybe she get into it again after few weeks . thanks , anyway . " i don't find this very encouraging , so i wish i purchased something else .	1
i thought i would love this but just returned it . it hurt my neck so badly after only wearing it short time ( 10 minutes ? ) maybe i'm too small ( 5'2 " )or my baby ( 5 months 18 pounds ) too large . either way i still find bjorn much more comfortable . i would like something where baby more sideways my hip like this than either facing me or facing out so confined he bjorn , but i couldn't stand wearing ! very painful	-1
i purchased earlier version this product two years ago . i disappointed i wasn't able use it my second pregnancy , most likely because it dropped too many times . this new version comes cloth pouch makes it much more user friendly . also , one set batteries ( 4 aa ) lasted 4-1/2 weeks . batteries my old one would last 5 days if i lucky . my daughter just turned two january 06 extremely smart , verbally advanced joy around . 16 months she knew all her colors could recite abc . 18 months she could recognize all letters . i believe we well our way reading child age 3 . i credit baby plus ? who really knows but we decided not chance it using it again baby #2 .	1

i just bought this one top stairs pressure mounted gate bottom stairs . my first impressions pressure mounted gate fine bottom stairs . however , gates which attach walls screws way more sturdy than even best pressure mounted alternative . we considered this model evenflo " top stair gate " . after inspecting both gates store we opted this one because wood spindles evenflo seemeed less sturdy potentially prone breaking . if one spindles breaks you replace entire unit . also , why take chance safety ? anyway , here few things consider when installing this item : 1 . i took advice others only used template swing side hardware only . this must . it would wall-damaging crapshoot try get both sides lined up exactly right using templates both sides wall . 2 . unless you screwing hardward into banister don't want damage them screws go all way through , use longer screws than dinky 1/4 " 1/2 " screws provided kit . i went 2 " screws additional strength . 3 ) installation isn't big deal . just take your time avoid silly mistakes result extra holes your walls . i found picture-based instructions back booklet far more useful than word-based instructions front booklet . it wasn't five minute job but it not hard all . i'll back few months post my thoughts gate after it some wear tear our 11 months old son our 100lb dog .	1
i love my new native sling ! i used it so many times find it very easy use very versatile . my baby very chubby guy 9 months he 24 pounds still fits sling . he loves it too , whenever we out shopping or even home he little fussy i put him sling he calms right down snuggles . i've even nursed while walking around .. many places : costco , disneyland , walmart ! very discreet . i also love fact it small enough fold up put my diaper bag , so i always it . no bulky rings or padding . i'm buying them all my family babies ! i love it , i've gotten lots compliments it . must item ! ericawashington stat	1

after reading some reviews i felt compelled share my experience this product . i love it ! i'm not sure if they made different model before , but mine on/off switch works just fine ( its back ) . its not rocket science if you follow directions . i never problems bottle floating . if you put bottle first then fill warmer water like directions tell you , then bottle won't float . warmer itself chart it tells you how long leave bottle warmer what setting . it also light flashes off when warmer reached constant temperature . there no " dings " or timers , but hasn't presented any problems me . overall this product what it supposed it it well . first time mom , i highly recommend it .	1
i lot online store researching before i bought this seat my 3 1/2 year old son . my one concern my son very slim all reviews talked how seat worked well larger children . well now i say it works well slim ones well . he loves arm rests cup holder . it light weight so easy move fold when necessary . we liked it so much we going buy one when our 2 year son son ready transition	1
my little guy loved this start . this versatile toy lasted many months . mat machine washable , so it became our take travel . hanging toys rings detach so you rearrange them variety take them anywhere , such car seat or stroller baby grows . he now 2 yrs , mat still wall hanging his room ! this great investment	1
this great sterilizer , it chamber big enough holder 4 5 bottles wide neck bottles tray hold quite few nipples cap rings . i bought it when my son born after year , i'm still using it . it works great , saves time , auto shut-off function when steaming cycle complete .	1
i got this hat because it matched jj cole bundle me blanket my son car seat . he looks absolutely adorable it , but he hates wearing it unfortunately . elastic little bit tight it smooshes his whole forehead down . overall , if your baby hat-wearer this fits him/her , then it wonderful . it warm , soft made very well	1
safety 1st cosco portable crib great ! i purchased this my first grandchild when she visits . it small enough fit anywhere it easily rolled one room . i would recommend this anyone looking alternative full size crib . it very sturdy also attractive	1
this so much better than bjorn carrier . you wear it hip or front . it very comfortable . my baby always felt secure i never thought he would come out . i could wear my 25 pound baby 2 hours without problem . my back shoulders never sore . easy put . great way calm fussy baby ! reversible black men too	1
i shopped around cabana take beach , my sons first visit . i found this one , let me tell you , it perfect ! it so easy set up take down , it sturdy enough stand up high beach winds . i saw lot other tents/cabanas beach this one far best ; both price durability wise . excellent find buy	1

these really good bottles . i using them 4 weeks now my newborn son . my only complaint regard stage 1 nipples they come you supposed use newborns . flow much too slow . my little boy could not get anything out it he tried tried . so if you plan using these bottles , i would recommend going ahead using stage 2 your newborn baby . i am not only person who this problem stage one nipples . other than , these bottles great	1
i bought this item based previous reviews recommendations not disappointed all . i love color , material easy wash , most all it keeps my baby warm comfortable . i bugaboo cameleon stroller it fits perfectly . my only recommendation would parents purchase toddler size rather than infant size if your baby older than 3 months . bag runs rather small so size labels decieving . other than , what you see what you get ! worth every penny !!!	1
i bought this pump after avent isis failed me electric pump . fact this pump puts so much control over suction power my hands great . im able empty each breast 15 min or less sometimes . although its little loud it manual pump all manual pumps little noisy . reading other reviews i think alot other mothers expected results this pump just arent reasonable . remember most manual pumps arent constant expressing purposes or bringing milk supply . if you read tegh package manufacturer even says they recommend pump emptying breasts occasionally like when spending time away baby or breastfeeding moms who express once or twice day so others feed baby . they discourage it working moms who pump everyday .	1
we britax roundabout our daughters so very pleased them , especially safety ratings . when my older daughter ready booster , choice easy -- britax ! my daughter loves her booster . when i first got it mail ( we live overseas ) i initially disappointed because i thought she wouldn't like side supports , but she loves them ! i would like comment two previous comments .... boosters not faa approved shouldn't used airplane . boosters use shoulder seatbelts . second , you not secure booster down because it not carseat . it used because children under 8 80 pounds too small shoulder seatbelt . i simply want comment those because britax makes great .... safe product	1
i very pleased when i saw just how beautiful this car seat . now my daughter 3 months old i feel i give it review . i read many things complaints but i just don't any . everything works well it . it doesn't fit well all carts but carts weren't made baby carriers fit them so it not bad thing car seat itself . all infant carriers same problem . i recommend this anyone who wants infant carrier likes how it looks . it pretty fits great it stroller . all all , it great buy . although my next time around , i'm passing up infant carrier going britax . they're much safer imo what i've read heard	1
zanzibar collection bright cheerful . . . animal images unusually cute . i mounted wall hangings velcro so they taken off wall . baby enjoys touching them seeing them close up	1
this baby gate ideal size price . i shopped tons stores websites before i found this gate . hardware mount , eye hooks , not sturdiest , but this gate definately gets job	1
we've used this seat when traveling , everyday use home . when our son 15 months old , i put highchair away started using this . it taken apart easily put dishwaser !! it folds down so it put away easily if you're guests , unlike big highchair ! great chair !	1
i my doubts when we first used it b/c it closes just some toggle-like buttons i worried wind would slip through . but my baby comes out this stroller-sleeping-bag/wrap warm every time . we've few days this winter here northeast way below freezing wind chill strong enough sting your face .	1
i tried several different bottles , including avent second nature , this only one my baby could get good suction didn't flow too fast or make her gag . nipples same pacifier given me hospital ( which only pacifier she take well ) . i am breastfeeding , all trouble i findnig bottle , i worried what would happen when i went back work my baby fed bottle . this bottle eased my mind . also , wide neck make washing easier than any other bottles . reason i am not giving it 5 stars because it leak if top not really tight , but long i make sure it tight i no problems	1
this great item , but , it some flaws . i got this my 2 month old , he loved it ! now he 6 months loves it just much . thing , you need manually push button , then you use remote . after it plays all music , it shuts off , only way turn it back , press button yourself . not great when you're flying freeway ! but , it still seems calm my baby soon music goes	1
this seat caught my attention because higher weight height capacity , 29 inches 22lbs but this seat also very well made padding exceptional compared evenflo graco every where padded head rest additional egg shock support it comes additional body pillow newborns , until pillow gets snug you remove it.my daughter 13lbs 8 ounces 25 inches her 4 month old wellbaby check up june , now six months old she still fits not hanging out all . i wonder if previous reviewer removed body pillow . it get snug then you use seat without pillow . why not five stars ? instructions bad seat much easier install without base . but good seat overall	1
my daughter breastfed , but we introduced bottle around 3 weeks ensure she would take one ( pumped milk and/or formula ) . we originally bought avent bottles no problems until all sudden 2-1/2 months she went bonkers ! refused drink bottle . granted we bit lax giving her bottles ( not every day , but least once per week ) . i tried dr. browns it same problem . it didn't matter if it breastmilk , forumula , warm , cold , room-temp , etc . she just screamed ! during this time , she using platex ortho pacifier , but begun using soothie pacifer i got hospital . she didn't like soothie pacifier all begin ... took several months her like it . anyway , i randomly freebie soothie bottle motherhood maternity drawer i thought i might well try . she took it immediately !! i since bought several more preparation daycare , she still takes them no problems ( she 4 months now ) . i not any problem leaks , fact she stays much much cleaner this bottle than she avent . my only problem , there no disc put underneath nipple when transporting or mixing bottle . however , stage 1 nipples pretty slow , so long its kept upright it okay . i using my old avent bottle sealing discs milk transport pouring into soothie feed .	1
i researched many breast pumps line before my daughter born . after she two weeks old , my milk supply established , i decided purchase pump . i read many reviews isis so skeptical ... i didn't want pay $300 automatic one . i enjoy breastfeeding so much , however , i am not comfortable nursing public not mention pumping allows my husband feed her too . after much thought , i decided purchase isis amp ; quot ; back workamp ; quot ; . it came pump , bottles tote ( which way very discreet ) . i no trouble assembling it all . first time i used isis i've great success . i am able pump several ounces 15 minutes , without any pain or discomfort i control suction . our daughter not any problems switching bottle breast all , nor we ever experienced bottles/nipples leaking . i assemble pump nipples/rings when they just out sterilizer still wet . i love how easy this use i don't find place plug it work . only thing i've noticed little gel packs don't stay cool enough my liking so i went purchased 2 little ice packs ( . 90 cents ) they work like charm ! i would recommend this any mom !	1
i highly recommend this item . soon your little one sit up his own , this must all moms . it fits all shopping carts ( except costco , but including target ) well those icky high chairs available restaurants . it keeps baby ( mommy hands ) touching cart handle prevents kiddo wedging his legs wrong hole cart . must ! this gift i give baby showers . i've over year it survived many washing touch bleach . still looks good	1
our son especially strong startle reflex , swaddled sleep , all . 2.5 weeks , he startled able get out any swaddle we , no matter how expertly , no matter what blanket we used . so , 1 hour sleep , he'd start crying we'd go start all over . we searched online actual " swaddling " blankets based reviews , chose this one . what utter miracle . we such debt dad who created this ! our son now 12 weeks old , we use this each nap nighttime sleep . he sleeping 6-7 hour stretches 5 weeks , slept 11 hours 8 weeks . we would never this success without this blanket . we've periodically tried get him sleep without it , but his reflex still so strong he needs it . it took little " getting used " method get him wrapped up , but no time we both experts . price amazon , free shipping , way better than what we paid directly through amb . i wholeheartedly reccommend this all parents , especially new parents .	1
i 2 activity centers different makers ( other grandmas house)so i something compare this . i honestly say this this activity center worth extra 15-20 dollars you might spend . begin , seat swivels easily baby move one activity next . might not important issue older babies but my daughter 4 months old when she started use this compared other exersaucer , it really makes differnce seat she maneuver . toys attachments great quality offer variety skills baby learn entertained . i can't say enough positive things this activity center . i highly recommend it it both stimulating entertaining baby .	1

this sort product wasn't available my first child . it such pain get him into winter outerwear , even more pain take it off when we got where we going . when i found this bundleme product , i knew it would much easier survive winter months michigan my second child . it fits easily into my graco infant carseat/carrier . i don't worry dressing him up , i just put hat him off we go !! it also easier buckle baby up without so much extra clothing bunching up everywhere- probably safer too !! when we get where ever we going i just unzip sides he fine . so far we endured 40 degree temps , rain , wind snow he stayed warm snug bug whole time !! truly excellent purchase !	1
this tent not easy pop up manufacturer claimed . we fussed it while before actually figuring out how it . no intructions came tent . second time we tried open it one spines broke now tent useless . $100 it shouldn't broken easily . when we it up first only time , however , it great . our nine month old son loved it . i sat center tent while he crawled laps around me , chasing some little plastic balls . he liked hearing crinkling tent fabric he moved across it . tent need pegged any kind wind , but this easy . reviewer said tent hot , but we're hawaii where there always least breeze it fine . there also slit one wall tent which allows wind pass through . i'm going try contact manufacturer lack instructions relative fragility tent parts . if i am satisfied their response i order tent again . it really great once it set up . however , i more careful when opening it try find non-windy place it .	1
i recently purchased this seat my 1 year old daughter used it last week beach . chair easily securely fit chair . tray stayed attached , unlike other models i tried . my daughter enjoyed many meals her new seat . cleaning it breeze packing it travel . this great seat great price	1
i decided potty train my son using just potty topper stool . he really loves things all himself just like mommy daddy so i figured would work best him . no matter what i he continued accident after accident . we would sit bathroom long periods time he would always pee after i took him off potty . i decided getting him his own potty seat would enable him sit potty longer periods time , infront tv or living room , family , or his room . i thought it might just thing make him understand so i went internet pick one out . i picked babybjorn potty chair because simplicity design , easy clean up deflector . most seats very small deflectors or none all . some deflectors don't stay put . i also liked designed stay floor not slip , slide , or get stuck child . day this arrived my son three consecutive accidents spite fact we spend most day bathroom . i just give up put him back pull ups when it finally arrived . he scared first but i told him this his very own new potty chair second he sat down he peed it !!! i let him take pot big potty dump it me it ! he hooked . i didn't even need encourage him anymore or harass him sit down . he would just run right over pee then declare " i it !!!! mommy help me dump it . " he only used this potty chair only one day but it definetly what he needed get idea . very next morning he said he wanted use big potty now never looked back . we use potty chair now outings . it great ! easy clean easy bring car !!! i would given 5 stars if not fact deflector just bit low . if my son wasn't leaning forward watch himself pee it would close call . there few reviews stated their child legs squished because deflector so wide ... my son 3 2 months he big boy top 75 percent height weight he fit fine lots room spare !!! only thing concerned me when i read reviews .	1
what previous reviewer didn't realize there 2 different packaging options this item . first option pack contains 1 key 2 locks people who want try it out second option buy pack contains 4 locks but no key those who already bought starter kit happened like product . so make sure you really read description what you're getting if you're buying online . ( this one happens 4 locks no key so you might want try starter kit first ... i actually rec . it because unfortunately lock doesn't work all situations because draw designs ) then top kidco also sells key seperately no locks those who product , love it , happened misplace or lose their key or want purchase additional incase they ever lose 1st key . i admit i think it pretty lame company try squeeze every penny out you especially when it probaby only costs 5 cents make darn key especially when you're dealing child safety products . far how well product works ... i love it wish it worked out better all my draw situations ! it especially great those cabinet doors stand alone don't door next it where you just buy one those wrap around door knob locks require 2 knobs side side . i didn't great luck my kitchen draws because draw panel added actual draw so it isn't flush where you put catch . i put 5 stars bring rating up because last reviewer only gave one it actually great product . i know it outsmart my baby far beyond any cheaper options out there . i installed them adhesive tape comes it but i plan reattaching it screws also included because i personally feel screws better job because i love my child more than my freaking cabinet doors all those worried messing up your precious wood cabinets ... i mean give me break ... holes so small anyway it totally concealed , only you know it there . also , this locks so tight little fingers/hands can't reach inside small openings ( which usually occures other types locks ) pull stuff out . also there option turn lock off kids . definitely consider this product !!!!	1
we love this pillow . my daugter 2 months old she naps it . it fits inside her pack play she lays it nice long nap . it keeps her rolling over . it also fits couch me my husband so we enjoy together	1

this great tummy time us ! we started using it right away , both tummy time just lying baby against . it really seemed help our guy hold his head up look , 3 or 4 months he reaching toys while holding his head up . it also handy propping him when he started sitting up , i used it 6 months when we starting doing solid foods prop him up instead highchair . we totally got our money out this item , it packed up ready next one	1
i bought this my baby when he month old . he now 4 months old loves it . i never change batteries yet . he doesnt pay much attention lights or movement so i just it set play music sounds . he impossible get sleep without it . even if i am staying somewhere else him , this must pack ! it i feed him , bathe him , lay him down , push button leave room . i rarely go back start it again he falls asleep it so quickly . i only hope when he gets old enough activate it himself he doesnt stay awake just watch it .	1
i must agree i tried others - cheap expensive - before finally getting dr. brown bottles . i tried others same claims - even few gimmicks would work theory ( ventaire ) . i only found success dr. brown bottles . these bottles sometimes leak - until you get hang them keep inner-tube empty collar not-so-tight . usually gentle twist collar empty inner-tube then you twist it back ... but not too tight . disks help stop leaks during travel , but you really just need work keeping them upright . yes , more cleaning - thank goodness microwave sterilizers . i simply handwashed then boiled first child , but love my microwave steamer now . markings fading some my bottles , but i believe hand-washing saved them little . i compared avent ( which only slightly cheaper - but lots " transition sippy cup " type advantages ( or breast pump straight bottle ) . i still love my doc brown complaints scratched off markings applied other bottles , too . i personally preferred wide-neck because they seem fit my baby better , but several friends like standard . we all agree doc brown lifesavers , though . i give 3 pk 8 oz size every baby shower	1
this actually pretty good ! i use it warming breastmilk formula . it took few tries get it perfect temperature , but i never too-hot milk , so my baby didn't get hurt . there few times where milk wasn't too warm - but didn't take long . my measuring cup markings rub off after 2 months , i contacted munchkin they sent me new one free .	1
we recently purchased this mattress 3n1 natural crib . no problems noted mattress ; however , our son ( who now 6 weeks old ) doesn't sleep crib much just yet ..	1
this tub excellent transition tub baby too big those little plastic tubs , but too small big tub . it spacious enough our 11 month old play ( he big 11 month old ) , provides nice soft sides so when he slips he doesn't bang his head hard sides tub . we got deluxe toys , but i think they more entertaining me than him . i wish we skipped traditional plastic tub went straight this . great buy	1
these toys great . easy use . they even taught my 2 year old how not only blow , but i think it indirectly taught her how blow her nose too . toy years come tub .	1
dr. brown bottles best ! we tried everything else wasted lot time money ... not waste your time buy dr. brown bottles ...	1
this warmer must . it stops most squirming fighting over changes(once your child gets past newborn stage ) . wipes nice warm , but not shockingly hot . i would suggest adding 1/2 cup water container if you live dry climate . i like this model because it not built night light ( eventually light become attractive toddlers ) . it also works very well any type wipe , pop-ups singles . i wish they portable ones .	1
it simpler than i thought it would . no diaper sausage like diaper genie . we use scented bags curb smell little extra . i would definitey recommend it anyone	1
we love this carrier . we live seattle need carrier all kinds trips we both happy this purchase . i am 5'2 my husband 6'0 we both use it ease very comfortable us our daughter . just fyi you really need 2 people put it take it off safetly . carrier massive storage . very good all around carrier . very good price !	1
my baby developed feeding issues including unique mixture colic reflux made feeding times nightmare everyone our house . we started out using playtex drop-ins system worked fine us until we 1.5 months old . then suddenly there lots gas screaming feedings . i switched playtex vent aire bottles screaming stopped , but there issues nipples just wasn't working out us either . baby spending more calories than she taking level 1 , drowning level 2 . plus there wierd extra parts clean keep up . it temporary answer our prayers but still not what we looking . because we preemie , changing her formula isn't option because she needs nutrients this special formula we giving her she continuing gain weight . so real issue become trying make feeding more comfortable her us . final resort ( i spent so much bottle systems didn't work out i almost given up ) , i gave avent feeding system try . it worked wonders . baby eats appropriate amount time now , there only standard parts any bottle clean manage , baby tolerates nipple flow well ( we use both level 1 2 nipples ) . best all special " variable flow " nipples , sold separately-we use those feedings where we mix rice cereal they allow cereal through , not too fast but no clogs either . i like not " alter " flow regular nipples toothpicks , etc . because once you this , there no going back . variable flow nipples solve problem leave other nipples unscathed normal feeding needs . also , our baby addicted soothie pacifiers hospital . we tried nuk , mam , gerber she wouldn't accept any those . but she accepting avent pacifiers included this newborn starter set . my advice parents looking bottles help with/solve feeding issues-buy smallest number possible give it 5 days . if it looks good day one same kind good day 5 , it safe sink more money into it . but if it isn't going work out , it obvious day 5 or sooner you haven't found " answer " . avent bottles passed this test us i would highly recommend them . additionally , if your baby experiencing colic or reflux , see fussy baby dot org tips ideas . also i would recommend specific brand gripe water called colic ease ( all brands not same , see their ingredient page see why ) . fussy baby site this gripe water teamed up avent bottles really helped us out work through our feeding issues . good luck	1
works great . easy use . just bit costly but worth money	1
we comparison-shopped booster seats while , found this greatly superior anything we've used past . price higher than other booster-only seats ( no lateral head support ) , but additional safety factor well worth it . this second this model we bought , so now both active boys ( 4 7 ) ensconced them	1
i didnt monitor my son so i wasnt sure what expect . i thought there would lot more background snow but there isn't it very clear . we vaporizer running all time there but when my daughter cries , her voice very clear through vaporizer sounds . only thing i wish monitor little more portable , maybe battery backup . minor inconvenience . 2-way speaker awesome . when i shower she starts cry , i calm her little conversation get couple minutes dry off .	1
works well banisters . great thing it you remove it when you guest over night when babies asleep .	1
i first bought this swing 8 years ago when my nephew turned 1 . he loved it , it his best birthday gift . since then , it become our standard one-year-old gift . i've given it dozens children received rave reviews every time . when friend bought this my son first birthday , we thrilled . he his friends now nearly four still like swing it even though they mastered big-boy swing . my one-year-old sit it watching big kids play garden he mover - not like sit still all . it also perfect days when ground too wet crawl around ( which seems like everyday lately ) . way , i read ' upside down ' post . i concerned tried turn mine upside down without child it ropes balanced i could not turn it even empty . family may defective ropes or it installed improperly ..	1
i use this top my son dresser short viola ! it changing table . i've never any problems it we've using it almost two years now . i highly reccomend it way i use it ( without actual changing table ) or one i'm sure it works too .	1

far best baby gate i ever used . needed keep baby one side dogs other yet still able walk through . this gate simple set up , tall enough keep dogs ( boxers ) jumping over ! then swinging door lets you go room room simple push tab . highly recommended , i plan buy one once grandbaby starts moving	1
after my 20 month old figured out how " escape " , i felt this option best i knew if we put him toddler bed , entire family would up all night hearing him scream gate . pros : really works even hard-core escape artists , made well , makes me feel much better knowing he safe . cons : can't hang any crib toys , can't use " ultimate crib sheet " ( which one best baby products ever ) , your child hate it first , mesh kinda rough so my little mad one red " face burns " rubbing it . biggest downside : too expensive !!! i feel since this company , far i know , only one making this , they feel they charge this much just b/c desperate parents no other option . overall : love product , hate price	1
my 7 month old used this daily since he 8 weeks . he loves it even more now . he grows he finds new ways play gym . he loves music lights especially . he play his own 20 minutes least . this lifesaver me , i use it occupy him while i get ready morning , or any time i need distract him , or just put him floor play know he'll stay one place . i would highly recommend this anyone . i think it one piece baby gear i absolutely would not give up	1
initially , i going get toy box my 10 month old daughter . then i decided she needed extra space her room crawl around i didn't want worry piece furniture she would bang . i saw this product store bought it . not only it cheaper than toy box , its space saver , its portable , its light so you carry it its contents room room , you put alot things into it . baby loves colorful design i love fact she won't get hurt if she bumps into it . also , it zips up top so you seal it . i recommend it .	1

i bought this set my baby when she 6 month old they quickly became her favorite . she box full small toys/rattles but she always ends up grabbing one these . i like how flat they which makes it easy tuck one into small diaper bag so she musical entertainment when we're go . my baby approaching 1 year still intrigued them . i anticipate years fun this toy . great purchase	1
overall i love this carseat but i found out today i driving around handle wrong position . i kept handle what instructions refer position which also setting you carry seat . after speaking police officer recently trained certified car seat installation/safety , he said handle absolutely needs far back possible provided very strong arguement why . manual came seat very ambiguous not specifically say this all . i called graco suggested this statement added book safety concerns she argued seat " tested " handle up it fine . officer i spoke adament infant could grave danger if handle up crash . i think i am going believe police officer vs . manufacturer !	1
our baby getting fussy . we started gas drops nipped problem bud . then couple weeks ago , feeding time turned into battle zone . screaming , back arching , twisting writhing , spitting formula while passing gas , burps sending formula up air . we desperate . so i ran out bought these bottles . good : moment we switched , screaming stopped . hooray ! we still get little screaming if we didn't get bottle assembled properly we leaks , it seems slightly harder get burps out baby , probably because there less air going so it takes longer build up good solid burp . bad : these bottles 3 pack only come stage 2 nipples . flow those too fast , baby drowning . i bought bunch stage 1 nipples whoa , we went 125 ml per 30 minutes 45 ml hour . i tried letting baby build up her sucking strength these stage 1 nipples 3 days , then finally , out desperation , came here read reviews see what others say . i bought narrow dr. brown level 1 nipples . baby sucking evolved time i got those home , unfortunately , she sucks so hard after used these crummy playtex stage 1 nipples she drowns some more when we use alternative nipples . this solution would worked well i got these nipples day we noticed how slow stage 1 playtex nipples . needless say , i thoroughly read through instructions since screaming stopped i able process information again . it recommends you bring nipple tip where hole closer where baby lips come together , meaning , don't allow more than 1/2 nipple baby mouth while she sucking . this worked perfectly we now back 100 ml 30 minutes . ptl ! ugly : addition needing stage 1.5 nipple desparately ( come playtex , puuuuhleeeez ! ) , parts bit awkward . not like dr. brown , but you nipple , ring , bottle , disk , vent cap . lots pieces clean keep up , but easy handle if they keep your kid screaming you hours end . also , you not supposed use bottle warmer this . guess what , i tried it anyway . sometimes bit formula leak thereby requiring cleanout bottle warmer . but it isn't too bad we using bottle warmer anyway , seems working out just fine us . take my advice-assemble bottles while baby sleeping , you can't slap these things together during screamy baby emergency or you mess your hands ( everywhere else ) . bottom line our baby eating again . so i would recommend , i just take away one star bad/ugly portions my review . edit : these bottles temporary answer our prayers . however , we switched avent bottles they worked great us two weeks now . my advice parents looking bottles solve feeding issues-buy smallest number possible give it 5 days . if it looks good day one same kind good day 5 , it safe sink more money into it . but if it isn't going work out , it obvious day 5 or sooner you haven't found " answer "	1

good : 1 light weight2 mesh/breathable fabric warm weather3 handles tall enough woman heels , or husbands . 4 nice colors5 easier steer than other stollers . ( use 1 hand)6 folds flat carry handlebad : 1 too light put your bag or purse handles , tip no baby it . 2 doesn't recline3 sometimes 5 point harness takes more effort unclipoverall , this good investment . turns out most parents end up using thier compact ' umbrella ' stoller way more than deluxe , super gadget stoller . it so much easier use these simple light weight strollers , than their bulky , wide , heavy counterparts .	1
