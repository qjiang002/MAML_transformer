t-mobile worst customer services . sometimes , it company mistake they still blame it customer . since i started my plan , i problem reciving my bill time . so , company start charging me $5 late fee four consecutive months . also , when i tried adding additional features such their text-message-bundle , change account not take effect till two days later , i charged 10 cents each message i used these two days , it costed me additional $4 . every time i tried complaining their customer services , they just wouldn't listen . i am starting get feeling they just trying maximize their profit . more than once , if i stay long-enough line , they put me mute so they don't listen my complaining . i feeling i am treated like dirt not like customer . i worst customer-services experience t-mobile . also , reception not best country . i friends who using same phone one i but different network , they getting services places where i don't it , they pay same amount money	-1

i've previously subscription cell phone services variety providers , but found i rarely used number minutes i paying . prepaid phone service seemed like way go , sti mobile sounded like good alternative because price competitive minutes don't expire . i signed up shortly after received my samsung phone . it arrived , however , defective - port recharging phone damaged . per sti mobile web site , i contacted them within 14 days arrange replacement phone . this resulted number email exchanges customer service . first one , rep told me i mistaken , must sent wrong charger . no offer made replace charger , strangely , which included part package deal . after additional emails where i reassured her i fact right charger ( i took phone local merchant , who showed me charger i shipped worked identical model phone - it port shipped phone defective ) . this point , rep apologized told me i would contact samsung replacement phone ! this entire process took several weeks . short , i guess you get what you pay . if i shipped working phone sti mobile probably would met my needs , but i turned off poor customer service since found prepaid phone provider	-1

this phone case worse one ever treo 650 . yea color great but , if you just tap it ground or anything color comes off wit ease . screen protector not great either . piece plastic over screen .... you lift it up so now you piece 2 cent plastic over five hundred dollar phone . not smart . now there someone who likes this cheap piece plastic over screen protect it . quote " it attaches easily i especially like screen cover - most cases don't this ( if you drop phone crack screen , you're hosed ) . " well this statement . insurance !!! if you invest five hundred dollar phone then you must insurance it . so , i guess you not hosed end . final : i am very disappointed cover recommend you invest product ( leather ) . i bought this item hoping something different . sale price really what it worth . six bucks .... $6.00 $500.00 phone .... my bad .. i really should tough this one this warning others . how cheesy ... i tough i getting deal	-1

i wouldn't buy this unless it emergency , because it one those chargers reports errors , makes your phone start beeping non-stop when it charging . i don't want this because i like charging night , other chargers don't this ( i guess what it it starts fluctuating power wall , like switching off , when battery fully charged .. so it beeps if it plugged over over ) . when i first got it , i trying carefully plug it into my phone -- i didn't want damage little metal things inside my phone or charger . it wasn't going smoothly it didn't match up or seem fit inside all . so i went day without phone i more research see why heck they'd lie it fit my phone . finally i got fed up because i couldn't find charger anywhere where i live i tried forcing it . finally it fit ! but i shove it .. who knows if it damaging my phone . but it charging so i happy ( my cell my only phone .. so i cut off world ) . then i tried getting it out couldn't figure it out ! i jimmy it off , broke off one side hooks helps it secure itself . i able put it back , finally learned routine so speak , taking it off , but it cheap . it very cheap . so , charger works , but it very hard use it isn't convenient all . i don't recommend it unless it emergency . me , it	-1

after owning 3 blackberry over years , i made switch blackjack because camera ability add memory . compared blackberry , microsoft operating system very cumbersome ( me ) somewhat frustrating set up initially . plus side , blackjack good battery life , screen excellent it best reception i've ever experienced . reason i only gave phone 2 stars because after just 3 months moderate use ink ( ie : numbers ) began wearing off keys . it point now where phone pretty much unusable , especially when it backlit . i called cingular first , who passed me samsung where , after 2 hours phone , i told my only option send phone ( my primary source communication ) their service center wait 3 weeks . my surprise , they went say , their discretion , they might also charge me repair . i've read comments these reviews people complained service i always just assumed they exaggerating but now i've encountered this , i feel it worth considering . if you're thinking blackjack , i encourage you aware , one , ink may inexplicably wear off keys , , you may well your own when it comes service . i feel it reasonable expect device expensive this remain functional least 3 months if not , company who sold it should assume responsibility making it right .	-1
i think this pretty good earpiece ... granted , i've only used one other ( it flimsy little thing came w/ my friend nokia ) , but this one far surpasses one sound quality comfort . where my friend would fall out my ear , this one ( once i got it figured out ) never comes loose . second , listening people my friend , i would turn up sound hear person well , then they sounded muffled distorted ; but my jabra i actually turn down volume my phone they sound crisp clear -- moreso than when i'm not using earpiece . finally , when my friend calls me uses her earpiece , she sounds distant muffled ; i've no complaints people i'm talking using jabra , , fact , my mom said it sounds better when i use earboom than when i don't . ear gels bit hard get used . they oddly shaped ( you see picture ) , there six them total -- three them each ear . lots reviewers complained fit comfort ear gels , while others claim these most comfortable earpieces they've used they fit perfectly ... i honesly say i've both experiences . when i first got this unit earpiece kept falling out everytime i would turn my head : * very * frustrating . i tried pushing it into my ear hard i could , i tried holding it place my hand , but only seemed defeat purpose hands-free earpiece . nothing seemed work . i thinking returning it . i thinking throwing it into traffic i-95 . then one day , somehow , i came realization you sort twist it into your ear -- little poky-out part stuck fold your ear next ear canal ( not fold top your ear ; if you it'll just pop out again) -- then * voila * it stays put . matter o ' fact , it'll stay put so well it'll little bit difficult -- even * painful* -- get out again . i imagine people different ear sizes , different patience levels , lower iqs might different experiences than my own . but all i say once i this little bugger figured out , i golden . i love this thing almost never talk phone without it . admittedly , it bit difficult get into your ear -- i'd say it takes upward 2 seconds get properly ( before you're good practiced it ) , which may not sound like lot , but it long enough not recognize somebody voice or hear first sentence they say , or whatever . * very mild * frustration . but like all things good pleasant , it takes little practice get it just right now i it so i answer phone , slip earboom my ear start conversation without missing beat . fact , i find this earpiece so comfortable i forget it until i go scratch my ear or something ! other complaint i saw here it not compatible nokia phones . fact , it even says right package it not compatible nokia . that funny , i nokia 3589i it works just fine . they make two other models earboom ( one which clearly would not worked my phone ) , both which claim nokia compatible , * neither * those works my phone ! confusing ? yes ! problem it doesn't work * all * nokia phones . while browsing store i noticed ones claimed nokia compatible list phones it works , but it didn't include mine ( it included one , numerically speaking , very close my model : 3590 ); which piqued my curiosity . so i went friendly manager store i he opened two different packages me let me test both them . one them worked , other didn't . strange part it we couldn't see visible difference two units ... then one us noticed one them jack two small black stripes around it ( that this one , if you look closely picture you see them ) , while other one ( one marked nokia compatible ) three . hmmm ... curious . so my advice either know your phone well ( , little book handy ) or ask help before purchasing . all all 4 5 stars . i'd give it 5 stars performance comfort , but take it down notch extended period getting used it confusing packaging . addendum : several months later little piece foam fallen end boom so any sound wind becomes almost unbearably loud person other end ... living windy providence , this bit annoyance . also , while i problem where earpiece would cut out seconds time so i couldn't hear person other end line ( , likewise , they couldn't hear me ) unless i jiggled little jack . this * very * frustrating . ** now , some reason , i'm not problem anymore . i'm not really sure if problem due my phone or earboom . either way , it something buyers should aware	1

i must admit , i skeptical this package . it didn't seem possible stuff would actually work such low price . even though shipping steep , it still worth money . case fits great , it hasn't cracked all . both chargers work great ! i think maybe my phone charges bit slower this wall charger than one came it , but i can't complain ! i would highly recommend this package . chargers aren't high quality , but they work	1

i recently purchased this motorola hs805 headset find it more than adequate . price , it worth every penny . ability using aaa batteries puts it above all other headsets respect . nonreplacable rechargable batteries gimmick . once they finally die , your headset useless . too expensive send away repair . so you throw your headset charger away buy new one . good company but not you . depending your ear structure fit either formfitting or loose . reading other reviews here one infer this . me it formfitting . also you may infer bluetooth telephone or device it pairs would make difference performance . some reviewers here felt this headset low volume or allowed some static . me others , we experienced no such problem . best bet check return policy if you find it doesn't meet your standards . but if it works your device , you headset goes 16 days standby 22 hours talk time 1 aaa alkaline battery !. you never bothered charger unless you use rechargable aaa batteries which pretty good idea . if it also fits your ear comfortably then you winner	1

if you own , you know battery life standard battery horrible . this charger also slot 2nd battery , which great . so i charge my phone standard battery , extended one verizon sells back slot . never worry battery life again . also , it makes wonderful stand phone , when hooked usb cable , you get data conectivity too . only downside , it won't charge extended battery until phone fully charged .	1

others mentioned , front window blanks out almost immediately , even worse , it doesn't show your missed calls . you open phone . stupid design . it not any exterior lights , such my old samsung , showed when it charging , when charge completed , when voice mail waiting , etc . this phone needs opened get any info . can't even see time without opening phone . while talking phone it blacks out after 1 minute . i don't like either . it also very hard hear it . especially if car , traffic noise . no , i'm not driving , but i'm passenger trying use my phone . forget it . re color someone mentioned . cingular light pastel pink , tmobile magenta ( dark pink ) . one thing i like this phone quad band , if you travel interationally , it great . i just got phone , so haven't used it interational yet . oh , it must tmobile get international service . phone camera , plus other tech features , but i don't use them . i want my phone only phone , no other gadgets . i would never buy this phone again , soon i'm eligible upgrade this phone history . i doubt i would get motorola ever again , i'll stick samsung .	-1

this product alone none things listed descrption itself . you must still buy other software use it . when i questioned them why they listed it doing all these things , which it doesn't , they pointed out where it says " may require 3rd party software various uses " . i just didn't know definition ' various ' all uses we listed . i would rate my experience this seller : dissapointingat least let my misfortune warning someone out there somewhere .	-1
i got phone because it small but i didn't know i'd sacrificing so much . speakerphone only works when call picks up my text message inbox fills up basically every day . i get shoddy service while i like design , there lots places where paint chipped away i see thru casing . all all okay phone if all you want it emergencies , but it not really best what you'll want your cell phone .	-1

this review more virgin mobil customer service than phone . i ordered vox 8610 1/22/2007 online thru virgin mobile . phone wouldn't charge . i called customer service explained problem . they said i want charger or phone . i replied i could not tell if it charger or phone fault so please send new kit . i received phone but not charger it also wouldn't charge . i called customer service explained issue it must charger fault . rep said they would not send new charger , i would purchase one . i said this didn't make any sense , according offer i could return phone full refund mean get new phone charge i need return phones refund then order one get charger ? support rep said yes i make up my mind - either return phone or purchase charger . i asked speak supervisor . customer support rep kept going off line ( talk someone ? ) but refused or couldn't get supervisor talk me . she then asked esn number phone . when i said i didn't know what ' esn ' number she indignantly explained it like serial number back phone . i'm not clear why she needed this , since i haven't activated phone i already referenced order ( vmu ) number . any rate i phone now over 40 min support rep ( obviously not very cost effective virgin mobile ) least she trying track down some info - or so i thought - she finally came back line said computer down she couldn't handle my order - i would call back . i called back , work my way thru answering system got thru rma fellow named mike . mike explained they couldn't send charger ( none stock ) i would send entire phone back - which what i am now doing - 60+ minutes after initial call . i say my interactions virgin mobile so far not positive . they customer service staff obviously poorly trained not empowered make decisions . interfaces support youth geared - not bad thing except when it expense treating adults courteously professionally . i am sending phone back refund re-considering provider pay-as-you-go service . 01/26/2007 .	-1

t-mobile worst customer services . sometimes , it company mistake they still blame it customer . since i started my plan , i problem reciving my bill time . so , company start charging me $5 late fee four consecutive months . also , when i tried adding additional features such their text-message-bundle , change account not take effect till two days later , i charged 10 cents each message i used these two days , it costed me additional $4 . every time i tried complaining their customer services , they just wouldn't listen . i am starting get feeling they just trying maximize their profit . more than once , if i stay long-enough line , they put me mute so they don't listen my complaining . i feeling i am treated like dirt not like customer . i worst customer-services experience t-mobile . also , reception not best country . i friends who using same phone one i but different network , they getting services places where i don't it , they pay same amount money	-1
this deal too good true . course i wasn't expecting any name brand stuff here , but least i expected them all work . i don't know if i got bad earbud or what , but it adds static noise therefore cannot used . case i didn't need , but it fit well looks decently constructed . power adapter seems work fine . so basically i spent $9.99 am only using power adapter . i guess that good enough deal . i think i'll go spend some extra money get brand name earbud/headset though	1
this headset not compatible nokia e62 ! nokia e62 2.5 mm headphone jack not pop port shown this accessory .	-1

i bought this because my current battery would die after 5 15 minutes talk time full charge ( after sitting closet year ) . i thrilled get battery would make my mobile phone truly mobile again . i opened it up , put it my phone , tried close battery cover it would not close . not even close . if i forced it really hard i could get it just close over latch , but it actually bending plastic phone latch would probably danger popping off any momen t.t he battery 50% thicker than standard battery motorola v60 . might great extra battery life , but bad if you can't get get battery cover your phone . i give it two stars because battery may work fine all i know , but it won't fit v60	1

i've my headset month now . noted reviewer , this headset not come any buttons or switches - only thing cord shirt clip . 6 different ear gels included accomodate different ears , which nice ( though i've only ever used one ) . headset very easy slip into my ear ( only takes 1 second ) comfortable up 2 hours wear ( which point my ear starts get little sore ) . my boyfriend reported similar experience other headsets use ear gels . if you regularly stay phone longer than 2 hours , it something keep mind . however , it suits my needs just fine , low price , i think it really great buy	1
these very good not expensive . you buy these staples they charge $5 more . i agree public exchange needed . if anyone knows one , you please post information here . we'll all appreciate it ! anybody want trade extras	1
i've using this phone net10 service since march , say i am very happy it . coverage areas great . i don't use cell phone very often , so this most economical way me go . although phone doesn't all bells whistles like other phones .... it gets job	1
product compact convenient , but it feels flimsy . hotsync function stopped working bit but restored after i hard reset my palm tx -- so it not cable problem but problem my tx . some reason , cable won't let me charge using usb wall-charger i got my wife ipod , but it charge tx off my computer usb port ( which powerbook g4 -- notorious underpowered )	1
title says it all : fits great , great price ! real leather fits like glove	1
i recently got 8525 i loved it first mainly because multi functions it could . however eventually i found out phone part this pda not great my previous camera phone . my friends complain they hear lot outside noise while talking . phone ear-volume quite low i constantly put it max it if i am noisy places . pros : software : windows applications - word , excel , media player . plus : ability create office documents play games hardware : micro sd slot - sandisk card cost me 20 bucks . wireless internet : you could connect this device any wireless unsecure network get internet . i dont data plan cingular but i connect internet home through my wifi home network . if iam coffee shop i could connect their secure network get internet free . cons : * bit bulky carry around . * camera not expected . view finder sloppy cannot capture images low light . * battery needs charged every second day ( depends usage ) but even light use i charge it every other day . best suitable : * internet savvy people who move . * email messaging . * pocket pc . * listen music ( need purchase micro-sd card)accessories : boxwave leather case ($30)leather case boxwave fits pretty good protects device . only problem after you put this case , phone volume needs set max , even after you wont able hear other person so well . but boxwaver case could opened half way folded over . bluetooththis device works very well blue tooth . bottom line : if you ok minor inconveniences while using phone this you .	1
my v180 through cingular - i never dropped call reception excellent . long battery life , very easy menus/wayfinding small size . no frills like mp3 player or camera however - just very good phone	1

k790a currently best " cybershot " camera phone sony ericsson lineup ( but more way ) also hands-down best camera phone u.s. today . it too bad se doesn't sell their 5mp 6mp camera phones stateside . but k790a very capable digital camera . sure , it only 3mp , but like many professionals tell you , pixel count only one thing . this 3mp camera-in-a-phone takes better-looking pictures than 5mp 6mp cameras vivitar , aptech ( sp ? ) , samsung other offbrand companies . my main phone sanyo m1 2mp i thought it pretty good camera phone , but when i got k790a use my prepaid sim card , i simply blown away quality . ( course , i bought phone exactly because i heard great things its picture quality , but results still far exceeded my high expectations . ) camera very easy use . i don't care mms features because my prepaid service ( speak out wireless ) doesn't support them . i just download them my pc using usb card reader . i wish there optical zoom ( more more camera phones japan , including models casio , now optical zoom ) but truth course if you need serious picture-taking you still use real digital camera . but this comes real close replacing your workhorse digicam . i'll use this year upgrade se next gen next year , hopefully then they'll released optical zoom-equipped phones . summary , this great camera . oh , phone functions fine , too . reception pretty good t-mobile + cingular networks ( used speak out wireless ) . voice clear loud . really good . 5 stars	1
this case what it supposed ... it protects your palm treo phone . it very nice looking durable . only negative comment i make case occasionally memory card gets ejected when taking phone out case due snug fit . why i gave it 4/5 . amazon best price case it well worth price	1
i bought my v360 ebay it sold unlocked/unbranded it quad-band variety . here my take : pros :-d urability ; this thing built clumsy mind ( like me ) . i must dropped this thing dozen times there barely scratch . -mp3 player ; i agree onboard 5mb memory joke , but cost transhflash memory coming down ( i bought my 512mb chip ebay $7.99 ) then upgrading easy affordable . said , mp3 player feature you actually use , sound quality good . i've no problem playing my itunes music ( long they're mp3 format no greater 192kbps quality then it play fine . ) ** media player defaults wma itunes defaults m4a formats - you need convert them mp3 or change default either program rip mp3 format ( you change default mp3 settings menu)-programmable " smart keys " ; i read where one user complained camera button not side , it camera icon button front keypad . he must not known you reprogram all smart buttons " personalize " menu . not only , but you rearrange menu buttons program most buttons face frequently used apps . it handy little feature . -built bluetooth edge technology . you may not use these features out-of-the box , but they're time when these technologies more commonplace . i use my bluetooth my wireless headset syncing adding files ( mp3 , pics , etc ) my phone my laptop . -quad-band world phone capable . this phone works 850 , 900 , 1800 , 1900 gsm networks ( although not personally tested ) . however , i traveling micronesia uk within year i'll know certain then . cons:-there slight delay when you answer call - i usually say " hello " 2-3 times or wait few seconds before i begin speak . i don't know if this carrier problem or phone . ( i use cingular prepaid ) . -the light stays while charging ( even when phone powered off ) . it annoying . -the onboard memory joke . you really need upgrade memory if you want anything extra phone . -it monochrome outer display ( full color inside ) . this doesn't bother me all , but it not flashy razr or other phones . overall : this great , durable little phone handy features i think people actually use . i've read where people complain picture quality - but that what digital camera . if you want good quality cell phone that well designed , user friendly , doesn't look like tricked-out teenager phone , then this phone you .	1

i wondered if " snap " concept would feel look secure . it . it rock solid looks like it part phone . additionally , extra protection it provides little screen wonderful . i'd love buy more colors when/if they become available	1
works just fine ! delivery earlier than predicted . i am well satisfied . i looked everywhere two towns buy such simple thing but they didn't them . i told " they order one " . i thought myself ....... so what , so i . this much easier . i ordered it one evening while wearing my pajamas it came right my door ---- no muss , no fuss . this way buy such items ! thanks great job	1
i gave this four stars because `jacket ' adds significant bulk weight sansa product . what once slim , sleek product now rather large , rubberized item . plus side , this jacket definitely protects mp3 ; it very solid , covers item completely securely . they included belt clip , screen cover very hard not easily scratched . buttons around wheel far easier press now . i wish there other color choices , but over all i'm very pleased product . before it covered i reluctant put my purse or pocket fear breakage scratches screen , but now i feel very safe carrying sansa taking it anywhere i go . highly recommended product	1
after reading reviews here this case , i thought i'd take plunge try it . cases i'd seen stores fairly cheesey , although they cheaper . this wonderful case . materials first-rate fit perfect . i highly recommend this case	1
promptly received two replacement batteries our phones , price one original vendor . they work great ! they hold charge , normal use , two-three days , our original ones when we first purchased them . would buy again , if needed	1
