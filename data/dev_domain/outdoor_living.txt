i am not disappointed . this grill cooks hot . 500 degrees within 10 minutes . fact . i've grill month i think i've grilled 25 days month . i need watch it all meat but man i'm loving it . it so convenient . my last grill didn't cook hot . it didn't leave grill marks . it didn't flavor what this grill offers . there not much complain . i dropped it while trying put it together myself . i thought it going break my floor , not other way around . this sucker tough!i'm glad i didn't go cheap . i can't afford $1000-$2000 grill so this good medium me . my last grill i paid $250 . it rusted 2 years replacement parts cost almost much grill so i dumped it . i think i'll get my money worth out this weber . this price even shipping it cheaper order online through amazon than buy local . i consider this one smarter purchases i've made amazon . ** bad side . nothing grill but amazon shipped it through company named egl or eagle ? logistics company they sure don't know what their doing . delivery date kept changing eventually it week later than original estimated date . they sent it reno sacramento chicago omaha back chicago then back omaha . omaha they hired two dudes truck drive it des moines where i live . once des moines they called me while i work . i met them gas station highway lead them my house . it took 20 minutes find them because one spoke english still new language . no problem . they nice enough fellas but i'm just not used going get my stuff when i order amazon . i've ordered least 50 items off amazon . normally i track it thru internet it shows up my door . this case i call freight company get status . then directing drivers around business . i guess this special order maybe that why they sell it this price .	1

great weber accessory ! sturdy easily removed storage cleaning	1
seems quality product , but others already mentioned , instruction booklet seriously lacking . one thing , there no index , nor table contents . i spent hour trying figure out how engage alarms outdoor high temp , etc ., no avail . i guess i am just not hitting right buttons , or leaving them depressed long enough . i able calibrate barometer match my wall-mounted barometer i admit - it works very well . i enjoy too barometric histogram , covering last 36 hours . because booklet doesn't explain , i am still trying figure out what percentage factor " forecast index " really means , why it sometimes presented " 12 hour forecast " , other times it 24 hour forecast . because outdoor sensor not waterproof , it becomes bit challenge locating device where it protected rain , direct sun exposure , etc ., yet out open true reading , so not influenced warmth radiating house . la crosse ought strive waterproof sensor someday	-1

i've using stainless steel weber grates few weeks now , replaced old porcelain ones . i think heating quicker , more event , perhaps even more absorbing items grill . not sure if makes sense , but it seems foods seem heat through adequately shorter amount time without getting overcooked . i tend keep burners down low turn cover down almost everything i cook . i'm little disappointed grates don't stay shiny stainless steel , even areas which i don't lay down foods . i guess that because all heat swirling around when i cover closed . all all , i give this hearty recommendation	1

i am amazed . my mom sent this me after i'd complained already eaten alive mosquitos this year . i don't just get bites ; i get huge , oddly shaped , so-itchy-they're-almost-painful , welts . i am person who attracts every single biting insect . i often wished i sweated deet . however , i don't . i tried this dubiously , first morning--i'd getting bites every day 8 10am ( even high % deet ) . -- no bites . -- i still didn't believe it . i used it again evening -- after rainstorm come through -- 6pm 10pm . no bites ! it comes belt clip , but i left it outside one point when i came inside . second i left its side , mosquito landed me . i , since then , used it several more times , no insect spray all , it very muggy around here . absolutely no bites . i seen couple more bees than usual , it turns out ingredient this blows out ( geraniol ) said attract bees . not big deal me . it apparently doesn't work everyone . i always assumed there some sort chemical i give off makes mosquitos head straight me , bypassing everyone else . ( i might party where no one else even sees mosquito i leave over dozen bites . ) i wonder if geraniol somehow combines whatever it i put out neutralizes it . this could explain why it would work some people not other people . this price , it worth it find out if you one people whom it might work ! i figure if i replace cartridge every 2 weeks ( ~ $3.50 /cartridge ) , i even saving money because i'd going through 1-2 cans high-deet bug spray per week	1
while principle product rather simple ( flat piece metal spikes sticking up ) , it very useful . instructions very easy - coat light coating oil , drop potatoes metal spikes . stick bbq cook . allegedly cooks faster than potatoes would oven . here my reflections after my first time using this contraption : 1 ) i started cooking potatoes same time steak vegetables . time my steak asparagus cooked , potatoes needed 10 minutes or so . hindsight , i should started potatoes while grill heating up ; they would time2 ) i varied original instructions - wrapping two four potatoes aluminum foil before placing them spikes . they cooked faster , though less roasted taste ( i found very desirable ! )3 ) one four spikes i placed sweet potato - which tasted fantastic after coming off grill ! it needed no foil , cooked little faster than exposed ( foil-free ) potatoes . summary , you should probably start cooking potatoes while grill heating up . you wrap them foil make job faster ; though it cut back nice roasted flavor you otherwise get . i gave it 4 stars because it isn't 100% non-stick , even coat oil . when i pull potatoes off rack , they tend stick spike tear part potato open . still taste great , though	1
i received cover , it fits just picture indicates , it comes down wheel . i leave charcoal underneath mine , haven't any problems rain soaking it . cover heavy-duty seems very good quality . i'm pleased my purchase	1
i can't complain durability these sensors . i bought original la crosse weather station 5 years ago while located texas . it recorded temperatures high 113 degrees since i moved nj 2.5 years ago , it also recorded low 18 below . i'd say that pretty durable unit so no qualms buying replacement when original one quit recording humidity bounced around temperature readings within short timeframes . i'm back working now i this unit ... i can't live without my weather station la crosse nice looking works	1
i recently purchased this model replace separate radio controlled atomic clock wired in/out thermometer . unit seems well made display easy read . based upon my experience so far i would still buy one but design/implementation could certainly improved . 1 - remote distance 80 ' line sight under perfect conditions . manual suggests deduct 20-30 feet external wall . if there wasn't external wall it wouldn't outdoors now would it ? 2 - time day only updated once day at/near midnight . my unit off 2 seconds noon . not big deal but one would expect bit more accuracy . 3 - algorithyms computing sunrise/sunset moonrise/moonset seem off couple minutes when compared values intellicast , etc . 4 - temperatures humidities seem accurate compared other measurements i . 5 - even though it ' rain cap ' external sensor must out direct rain fall such under eaves . 6 - oak trim just vinyl decal plastic . nobody going confuse it real wood . however , spite my criticisms i think it good unit approximate weather monitoring	1

this seemed like wonderful grill , but regulator ( which keeps gas leaking ) failed after month . unlike other grills , charbroil regulator purchased part full burner assembly ( over $100 , while other grill manufacturers sell just regulator tube , $20 ) . regulator not covered their warranty , either . customer support terrible , " communication " only coming through charbroil faq web . fortunately , there enough other charbroil owners similar problems who written web this problem . i never buy charbroil product again . this all so terribly disappointing , because i've wanted support good u.s. company -- but charbroil engineering customer support reminding me big three automakers 1980s .	-1

this very basic smoker . it well built . easy assemble w/ good instructions . not much information actual smoking process but internet full information . no information how adjust vent make it run cooler or hotter . not think it should matter w/ gas . it might just regulate amount smoke . i leave mine 1/2 open . runs hot smoker when set instructions recommended , gas valve 1.5 turns open . i mine less than 1/3 turn open achieve 225deg . it took some trial error figure out how get temp low but once you figure it out gas smoker works great . would 5 stars if knob smoker able adjust temp low enough . i keep mine pegged low	1

gusty day when i saw chessy plastic thermometer i gave my wife mother day shattered back deck , i decided it time replace it something decent . i my home work internet found la crosse made good quality unit reasonable price . after opening box when my ws-8025 arrived reading over instructions , i it up running under 20 minutes . ws-8025 allows you adjust barometer local conditions ( which you get line your local schools ) . i've it up running two weeks find ws8025 good job forecasting weather . atomic clock took day link up ( which they tell you manual it might ) but stayed linked up since . i purchased optional tx3up remote probe i my fish pond . so besides seeing outside temerature humidity , i keep eye pond . you set ws-8025 alarm any high low temperatures you chose .

i am now my second round herb kits this batch , i purchased three kits mixed pods make my fall/winter mix : cilantro , basil , parsely , thyme , savory , sage oregano . parsely sage new french herbs kit . everything i've planted either sprouted day early or right time . savory appears most delicate bunch , but it grown tallest three weeks since i started . sage grows very quickly more robust than even basil . parsely seems slow but steady . your herbs good least six months . proper care , i'm sure you could extend their life . these very easy care it great always fresh herbs your disposal . i recommed this product anyone who loves fresh herbs and/or anyone who problems growing herbs past	1
i owned this smoker 5 years now few insights those looking purchase this smoker . i smoked 7 turkeys , alot pork , some beef all really great results . i love its electric . regulating temp charcoal smokers tedious . you barely anything it except add water chips . it maintain ideal temperature 220 degrees fairly well , but there few issues this smoker : 1 . materials construction- metal thin lid fits loosely . lid suppose fit loosely ! there no vent so it helps smoke . but because metal thin , cold and/or windy days , it difficult it maintain it temp long smokes . often runs 200-210 degrees . this increase your cooking time ! hot days it run 230- 240 degrees . although i can't reccomend this modification help heat loss , i actually heard people fitting electric water heating blanket outside smoker help this . 2 . i wish heating element adjustable help regulate temp . 3 . door small which makes it hard add chips or water . although you take unit off its base add chips , this akward bit dangerous since you may spill water . it nice remove base help clean unit though . 4 . i installed after market temp . gauge lid . ( must)overall good entry level smoker super easy use . got mine w-mart $75 . anyhow , it great value under $100 . now after 5 years , it i need new smoker . i try upgrade although after looking around all electric smokers , i might just buy one these . i love " bullet " design vertical smokers . stainless steel version this model looks nice obviously made better material , but main section attacted base . i like able remove base . plus element still not adjustable . only other choice stainless steel meco smoker which better door design adjustable heating element , but double price . so i either get this model again some modifications ( temp gauge maybe adjustable element ) or get meco . hope this review helps .	1

despite fact this clock hangs my basement rec room cincinnati , it no problem receiving time signal colorado . it should noted , though , , manual mentions , proximity powered-up tv or computer monitor interfere reception signal . owner some expensive acoustic guitars , i find hydrometer readout very useful monitoring room humidity . readout big enough easily visible across room . i only wish this thing looked little less purely utilitarian . big clunky , two-tone silver , it adds nothing my room aesthetically .	1
