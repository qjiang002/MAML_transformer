acrobat 5 so buggy i thought i'd give adobe couple product cycles before upgrading . should waited longer . there improvements v7 : better look , better commenting , ability add text actually prints , far better ocr functionality . but other basic functions way worse than v5 : some word documents easy convert pdf v5 not convert v7 , seems something font license issues . installation nightmare repeated re-installation required get past system hangs , clashes standard security software , endless errors automatic update feature . new product activation makes this even more pain because too many re-installations force you activate phone . despite my already low expectations adobe , this product disappointment . acrobat 7 , adobe , usual , charging top $ what any decent company would consider embarrassing mess even beta version .

several years ago i used delorme street atlas usb gps receiver . software worked but interface lousy . this year i tried microsoft streets trips 2007 surprised find it interface smoother some ways than delorme software , but still surprisingly clumsy . help possibly worst i seen microsoft product ( that saying lot ) . here some problems : 1 . street trips expecting gps receiver uses ** com port ** . you kidding me ? 2007 ??? delorme earthmate 20 ( usb ) work if you use delorme com port emulation software , but why this necessary ??? ( it not trivial get it work . ) 2 . handling pushpins ( identifying spots map ) , favorite places , like , extremely clumsy . ( although , contrary review , you don't re-enter information each time . you just save file reload it . ) 3 . directions sometimes not so great . why would you instruct someone " turn left " if you don't know which direction they're pointing ( e.g. , when you're stationary parking lot) ? much better such cases say " head ne " or some such . freeway exits ( least so . california ) often not handled well . ( one freeway entrance identified " local road " , which time proved quite confusing . ) 4 . why doesn't software automatically recalculate directions put you " on-route " once you're off-route ? you push f3 , but why this necessary ? 5 . i never got voice providing driving guidance work . online help useless . i'm sure someone jump tell me how it , but it should trivial . 6 . general , software feel bunch modules written independently thrown together . i'm not reflexive anti-microsoft bigot ( i bought this software after all ) , but i find much ms software bad precisely because it feels like it cobbled together without much attention given integration . it shiny surface but shine vanishes once you really start use it . given this experience , i probably give delorme software try next time around .	-1
everything negative reviewers say true more . please note following well : 1 . if you college student taking class online uses blackboard software , vista prevent you posting class discussion board answering any fill-in-the-blank or discussion questions tests ! fix this download foxfire browser ( free ) use it access your course . because vista uses so much memory already so huge , they drop quite few little programs software needs access operating system . 2 . huge memory hard drive drain . look this comparisonwindows xp professional size drive 1.5 gig memory requirements 128 mbwindows vista needs 15 gig load . not say how large program but i wouldn't think its small !!! memory requirements 1 gig ! if you check dell website you see they recommend you 2 gig memory use windows vista . few $$$ worth memory just run operating system while openning program . try running game or doing animation kind sink hole your system ! less memory you available , slower everything , including websites load ( no matter how fast your internet connection ) what worse fix what wrong it ( ie replace all those small programs your software expects find operating system ) , they add patches only make it bigger hungrier memory ! this most pathetic excuse upgrade i ever seen . i would expect some lawsuits before this over ! not buy this product	-1

teacher i use word , powerpoint , publisher when working students engaging professional activities ( presentations organizations , etc . ) i using office 2002 , thought i should upgrade . big mistake . ribbons icons frustrating scroll through , especially since i previously just customized toolbar so everything i needed immediately available . i'm still trying figure out how type chinese , although spanish german working fine . additionally , they've come up truly ugly color scheme their ribbons/icons/etc . previous commenter noted , making changes basic template creates extreme problems , i also unable get darn number bullets renumber . it took me almost twice long write test usual , i ended up doing manually what used quite easily using toolbar . designs publisher now very difficult see differentiate . previous versions , you could see stark differences different designs . current options pages , everything so soft , both line color , well so small , it hard tell what you're looking . but truly big disappointment powerpoint . their new selection slide designs all appeal rotting road kill -- i would embarrassed give presentation professional group using what available 2007 . i reinstalled my 2002 programs . i feel like i just wasted all money i spent this suite . my suggestion ? if you absolutely pc because you lot word processing , stick word 2002 or 2003 . if you need presentations/brochures/etc . your business , get mac avoid this problem altogether	-1

this worst software i bought . first , it cost $100 mcafee not honor $55 rebate because i sent rebate form little late . they only 15 days send out after purchase while compusa receipt much longer deadline send our rebate form . isn't kind trick ? second most important , it slowed down everything , not bit but dozens seconds or even more than 1 minute . third , speed not only problem , its wireless connection sucks maximum couple my machines can't get online can't connect network . i 3 pcs 1 laptop . only two machine get connected . it also conflicts belkin network card driver which so popular so many years . how hell mcafee not know adaptor ? fourth , there no manual whattsover you all figure out yourself . given it so much problem it very frustrating configure it . sometimes security center downloading forever . who hell knows what it doing . sucks . i spent so much time fine tune it it still sucks much . i changed back internet security suite which much better than this . don't buy it even they give it you free or you break disk .	-1
this first review i written probably few years . normally , i don't feel strongly enough any product , good or bad , bother entering review . this new version quicken , i something i feel strongly enough write . i using quicken close 20 years . i built all my finances around it . past 6 years , quicken going steadily downhill . this latest version , i hope , represents rock bottom . i don't see how product could possibly get any worse . words cannot describe how bad this product . no functionality added previous 6 years . what happened screen become more cluttered more links quicken " financial partners " , more redundant links other , old , program features , more white space . return , user page through tab after tab after tab view same information previously fit only 1 screen . further , each screen refresh now takes seconds , whereas older versions screen refresh instantaneous . entering simple transaction may require this bloated sofware generate 2 , 3 , even 4 complete screen refreshes , each one taking maybe 1 2 seconds . means , once you hit " enter " key complete transaction , you waiting long 8 seconds before you move entering next transaction . little 3 years ago same step required less than second . obviously , time required vary your computer - but it bad enough quicken now requires you " downgrade " your quicken software every few years - it also necessary you replace your entire computer system same time just so you realize same performance level you previous version . all this no additional features or functionality . there new kid block i am switching . it called " moneydance " . it import data quicken , it fast , compact , runs any platform , windows , linix , unix , mac , even os/2 . it easier use than quicken support great . it available download - functional evaluation version free full version only $30 . you actually speak person get help w/out pay . since i using quicken years , it take while test mondeydance out make sure it works properly . i am running 2 side-by-side while make sure numbers agree . so far , things going well . then i plan dump quicken forever . well run dry quicken ; everyone who made product great apparently left company . obviously people quicken free make their product bloated cumbersome they want . but they should not allowed force people downgrade . yet , what they doing . i am absolutely positively through quicken , i am not coming back	-1

i am retired senior software engineer ( web development ) . i've used many antivirus/malware packages both work home . this absolute worst . after installing it , i got popup virus alerts bitdefender every 10 seconds . no kidding . i couldn't believe it . i previously copy norton antivirus 5 my computer which highly reliable ( not like latest version ) . i tried bitdefender based reviews below which obviously written people less than standard operating systems . i use pc windows xp sp2 ie6 ( ie7 still buggy ) . although multiple runs bitdefender show absolutely no viruses or malware my system , i continue get these popup " virus alerts " every 10 seconds when i browse internet , which way more irritating than anything norton ever my computer . addition , it drags my computer almost screeching halt when i go web page i haven't more than day , sometimes even ones i just went hour ago . i find this truly irritating went bitdefender website tried their online chat . " jack " completely worthless . he told me completely wipe out my cookies , well lot other useful files no apparent reason other than he probably not named jack , but something like vishnu this first thing long list things tell people . very useless . not recommended anyone . try get old copy norton antivirus 5 pay update feature ($20 per year ) . much better than this garbage . addition , there virtually no options customizing this product . you're stuck what they think necessary ( like automatically deleting internet files you may need -- like shopping carts ) . it literally cripples your computer .	-1
we very disappointed this product because it provides almost no options customize spreadsheet . we cannot rename catagories not applicable us ( i.e. , child care ) , we cannot create new categories specific our needs . what even more limiting disppointing you cannot create different tab each month use comparison , which makes us wonder what value we gain single month finances captured . finally , bar graphs summary comparisons shaded same color background which makes it very difficult read	-1

this software might recommended if better utilities weren't out there . this one gives user sense security , but when my system crashed , fix-it couldn't . i dutifully put rescue disk , booted up it , restored my earlier system , exited rebooted . nothing . before i'd able get into safe mode , but now nothing . so when i manually restored my system , guess which program got yanked ? it freed up lot system resources , too . ( i known how much before , alone would soured me . ) my system now runs faster doesn't lag while typing . small criticism : even though fix-it automatic update virus scans , i found more often than not i go vcom site manually download anti-virus files . no reason ever given ; i'd just get message telling me it . very inconvenient . also warning*warning : this program strict activation . you only it one computer , so forget putting it your notebook computer . finally , careful when cleaning your registry . look every entry this suite wants delete . if you run it default , it may remove critical registry keys settings . fact , i'd use different registry cleaner or some free ones . fix-it some great features , but not enough make it worth system resources system sluggish system . ( not mention anti-virus problem ) . try system mechanic instead .	-1

since most complaints recent switchers i went ahead bought this because most their problems don't apply me ( running powerpc , no old data transfer ) , because intuit offers 60 day money back satisfaction guarantee . oh , i downloaded it their site , saving like 5 bucks . here thing . qfx file quicken uses get data financial institutions restricted . my bank offers download , so i get file just fine . however , part quicken import process internet check bank see if they " support " mac users . support , all really means bank pays quicken allow mac users import their qfx files . if not , you get error message saying try import again later . there hack floating around ' net invloves changing some text qfx file , it works . but there cheaper alternatives out there support format ( moneydance one ) no fuss . aside this issue , interface really bad . it looks like check register . if i wanted glorified spreadsheet shape my checkbook , i would made one . program not even close intuitive , which means if you dislike/avoid tracking your finances like me this software scare you away pretty effectively , making your purchase pointless . lastly , customer support really very bad . you basically get canned responses don't even really address questions you ask , semi-broken english . i'm sure someone banks mac supported qfx , tons patience , predisposed dealing accounting minutiae would find this program useful/powerful . me , all advanced features world don't matter if i can't even use most basic ones	-1

honestly , i don't know how much more they improve adobe acrobat . it excellent product , god-send electronic file management . i upgraded version 6.0 . only problem i 6.0 it seemed terribly slow . this new version seems much brisker . it loads quickly , files seem " print " it much more quickly than version 6.0 . i not utilize " one-button " feature it provides ms office other programs . i try keep all my programs non-integrated possible , because my previous experiences showed they really , really bog each other down , no matter how much their makers claim they won't . i don't come close using all features acrobat , but my needs , it far surpasses anything else i've tried ( or researched ) . if you're problems version 6.0 , or older version you just want upgraded , i strongly recommend this . however , i don't foresee ever needing upgrade acrobat again	1

i used this program 5-state road trip midwest , while overall it " adequate , " it some key shortcomings . bad stuff : first , this not especially user-friendly program ; there steep learning curve operate it ease predictability . spend lot time playing this before using it primary navigator ! lot commands not intuitive , you need go through lot menus figure things out . this problem when you road looking get somewhere . it doesn't lot clickable buttons main screen . example , get program talk you , you must certain tab bottom screen . if you any other many tabs , program doesn't talk you or show you turns . it took me hours figure this out ! help function useless . second , tracking very slow , result you easily overshoot your turns -- especially when there no physical street signs many areas country -- which happened me numerous times . many times screen showed me i lot farther go before scheduled turn , this caused me overshoot it when there no sign . third , " rerouting " function awful perhaps biggest problem this program : if you stray route -- even pull off get gas -- program flips out keeps trying route you back original route even if route not easiest or most direct . i not found way it manually or automatically calculate new different route . i also found no way modify route once you begin route ( see below ) . several times several different cities , re-routing function totally wrong -- spitting out names streets weren't even screen close zoom level . this really annoying glitch , it happened without fail every time i strayed route . once off route , there no way hush program yelling you you're off route , there also no way easily program recalculate change route . when there construction you didn't anticipate , example , this program sucks able change route once you've started it . very annoying . there no construction updater plug-in , which would helpful long term construction projects go forever . fourth , program not audibly warn you if you going wrong way one way street . this actually happened me , there no " one way " signs particular street springfield , il . though there green arrows screen indicate one-way , but voice commands didn't warn me i actually going wrong way , so i not looking screen , i wouldn't known . you can't always look screen when driving . iowa i35 , construction brought northbound drivers over southbound lanes . i heading north southbound lanes ( i supposed ) but there no visual or audible indication i going wrong way ! big time safety issue here . fifth , search function wholly lacking not easy use . i needed find police station while missouri -- no such luck . i also needed find state fairgrounds missouri ( which i later came across screen ) but it not show up when i intentionally searched it . search limitations second biggest problem this program . sixth , several times screen showed me " off route " totally blacked-out area no roads around me when i fact u.s. highway or interstate . something wasn't communicating correctly . other times screen showed me more than 1000 feet off highway even though i certainly highway . illinois , screen showed i pretty much driving through corn fields even though i u.s. route . this problem pronounced multi-lane highways . if you're not center lane , often program indicates you're off route . very annoying . seventh , zoom level not stay constant ; it fluctuates automatically high zoom far-out zoom . i wanted high zoom most time see all minor roads landmark indicators , but program kept zooming out every few minutes . eighth , help function joke . it totally lacking substantive information . program should come separate dvd movie showing how use it . ninth , program not recognize lot road name synonyms . example , some u.s. routes also county/state/local designation numbers and/or alphabetic name , but map often only listed one or two many " also known " names/numbers . this quite problematic when signs roads don't match up turn commands ( e.g. " turn left u.s. route 40 , " when only street signs showed alphabetic name no numbers . this also quite annoying . tenth , antenna comes program sucks . without fail , i would get red " no signal " indicator every city i where there high-rise buildings . this happened kansas city , des moines , indianapolis , springfield . if you city , you risk no gps tracking ability . yes , my antenna mounted recommended . one point i held it up through my open sun roof no success . eleventh , main-screen buttons way too small use while driving if laptop your passenger seat . you pretty much pull over or risk crashing see what you're clicking . yes , i'm aware disclaimer program states you should separate navigator operate program while driving . i'm also aware almost no one who uses this program actually navigator/operator . twelfth , trip planning lacking . when you input starting ending point , program gives you one route . there no way easily plan alternate routes or preview them . true , you things like program it not take you toll roads , but this function not easy use . several times program kept me off interstates when i wanted them , sometimes it kept my interstates when i wanted u.s. or smaller county roads ( sightseeing purposes ) . i would go off route listen program whine off route . thirteenth , i emailed list my concerns/constructive criticisms/recommendations folks delorme . never heard back them , which concern me quality issue . ok , so there some redeeming qualities : first , * general * gps tracker on-target . 95% my 2000-mile trip , i knew where i program operated just fine . just realize this program ( well gps general ) lot limitations , especially when there bad weather or you woodsy area or place lot obstructions . third , you easily add points interest comments yourself . i used this function lot mark places where i want return take photos daylight . fourth , there selectable function show high contrast colors ( black background bright road colors ) . this quite helpful . summation , money this program good deal , but not rely it ( or any gps program ) your * sole * source road information/navigation . if i hadn't my rand mcnally paper road atlas back-up state city maps i borrowed library , i would big trouble several times . there lot ways this program should improved , but meantime i'd still recommend it despite problems . knowing limitations i've listen save you time frustration . there no better alternative imho price . it possible some my complaints fixes , but you wouldn't know it crappy help function .	-1

after using this software week , i'm generally pleased results . learning curve not too difficult climb ; though i some prior experience less sophisticated versions this type software . box comes thick printed manual , which nice reference . index manual good but not great . unfortunately manual not comprehensive . it appears cover core functionality but not any depth its discussion " power tools " . manual appears nearly verbatim copy online help . software comes short online instructional videos -- basically animated screen captures voice-over commentary . two or three videos i've watched filled gaps manual left open . my pc 2001-era 1ghz celeron 1gb memory . it renders 3d drawings fast enough not frustrating , i limited patience this sort thing . however , i not added great amounts detail plan yet -- mostly just walls , roof , electrical , some trim . addition detail may slow rendering down enough annoying . other reviewers complained performance , but documentation hints speeding up if you run into problems . while core parts software pretty good , power tools leave little something desired . this may just lack education my part , but if so then i'm going blame skimpy documentation . these power tools almost appear developed either different groups or third parties . overall they lack polish usability part core software . take " room wizard " , example . this slick way put together interior floor plan house . problem room wizard launches almost separate application , when you're it asks " update current design " . when you say yes , it appears paste picture drawn room wizard back into main application . there , it difficult ( impossible ? ) get interior layout overlay your foundation design . i difficulty other power tools : topo designer clunky , site planner annoying lot size limitation ( no line more than 1000 ' ) , estimator won't let you add additional materials ( you put cost concrete your foundation , but you can't add fill or stone drainage ; if i manually put this stuff into separate spreadsheet then built-in estimator pointless ) . so . again , maybe this learning thing , but rest software easy figure out -- why these so different ? overall , i would give software 3.5 stars : four stars doing stuff it absolutely must very well , minus one star advertising extras don't work so good , plus star good documentation core functionality , minus half star failing document extras . ( i figure extra thirty fifty bucks cost over competing brands due these extras , but i haven't tried competition .	-1

this program average below average it abilities . said , just hope you don't need any roxio tech support . why ? because roxio support bites ! you cannot contact anyone online or email help ; whenever their dis-functional " web portal " [ web-based support ] system traps you endless loop . i needed couple simples updates pc not allowed internet . it used you could download roxio patches any pc internet access . then burn patch[s ] cd , or copy floppy/jumpdrive . then " sneakernet " patches pc needing them . no more . what happened today their webpage apparently trying download/patch roxio product directly my pc . [ ezcd5 doesn't exist my pc ] . instead simply letting me download it somewhere , like my hard drive , vs patchging it directly their webpage my pc , [ which won't work my case i'm not using roxio , nor it installed my pc ]; apparently morons roxio webpage coding make download/patch process stop/end proceed send customer back roxio initial patch download page . when you need patch , all these endless loops support gamesare enough get me looking different product/different company . if you want minimize human contact customers , fine . but let folks least download patches they need order keep their pc going . don't hand over your customer support system [ almost ] completely web server . ignorant arrangement works well when companies try save few pennies get rid phone receptionists customer service telephone calls . then they let customers wade through 100 layer deep voicemail system find answer simple problem . it just doesn't work . if company won't provide access patches , even after i logged into their website username password , [ so they know accessing their patches ] they don't offer any type ftp site download backup option , then i sure heck won't buying anymore their products . i see why roxio bought up cequadrat other companies .

i recently purchased hp laptop , my regret , came pre-load win vista . some bad things this package : 1 . help files all line . if i'm not connected internet , i can't access help files . 2 . hp ship it laptops vista install cd . instead , cd purchase upgrade next version vista included . 3 . newer laptops , hp not producing drivers any other os except vista . 4 . vista less user friendly than xp or even 2000.5 . yes , vista looks familiarly like os , but harder work . i owned several apples looks deceiving . just because it looks like apple doesn't mean it works like one . 6 . all my instructional software no longer works . i use lot software teach information security no longer works vista , such : . cyberciege ( information security wargame ) . boson ccna network simulator . visual studio ( not everything works)7 . also , some network management tools not run or run properly vista . i lot remote management workstation versus going server . many vendors provide tools way behind power curve their vista support . i could go but what point ? i can't even dump vista go back windows xp or even 2000 if hp won't even make attempt produce drivers laptop . linux out same reason , no drivers . so i'm basically stuck overpriced emailer word processor . if you plan purchasing computer , make sure if you plan dumping os going back xp or changing linux , vendor all drivers support change not microsoft vista conspiracy bandwagon	-1
this thing nightmare . first , it impossible understand unless you already know how run some other comparable system . next , it requires huge amount fiddling buffers ( believe me -- read help files this , which huge suggest ten different things when your music doesn't sound good , trust me , it won't , either before or after unlimited tweaking ) . finally , it actually not export it says it . it lost my files , including one song i cannot quite reproduce ( gone forever ) . bottom line : if your idea fun spending two weeks vacation fiddling software not work never work , then all means , buy this garbage . i using computers since 1985 , this , i think , worst single product i've ever seen . other hand , if you want actually make music , you might want try sony acid pro 6 , which you try out free ( company thinks you'll like it , whereas sadists cakewalk must know perfectly well you won't , hence no demo ) .	-1

i long time user delorme products but decided get combination microsoft products both us europe ( autotrip ) . program loaded very smoothly , but make sure you load program before plugging gps locator . there multiple warnings this well what if you don't follow directions . i loaded all data my laptop so i would not carry dvd . setup also quite simple . there warnings usage automobile pop up use ( well cautions during setup ) . one needs keep this mind not distracted when driving . i set mapping program forget it . but it works best two people car one navigate . gps locator great chipset . very , very sensitive quickly finds coordinates within seconds , even i sit my house . it rarely loses lock satellite . route finding works well , so far . you save your track well route , but unlike delorme products you can't playback your track ( or if you , i not found it ) . screen pleasing you go fullscreen . i haven't tried voice recognition but spoken commands average . ability ot overlay satellite photographs when planning routes internet connection plus . plus you routinely update road construction sites . so far , no opinion how good feature . microsoft location finder internet leaves something desired though i've only tried it home . it routinely thinks i'm china ( which interesting because so many ads quite able figure out where i am ) . gps also works other programs selecting generic nema gps . there other optional equipment go gps . if you've never used gps mapping program laptop , microsoft st good choice . just don't surprised if gps lcates you accurately microsoft locator product puts you other side planet .	1

i really like omniform 5 . actually i'm using version 5.1 i'm very satisfied it . i using forms program i purchased adequate but not nearly good . after using formtool i much greater appreciation omniform . scansoft my list not buy software recently because some poor performance some their other programs , tech support expensive scansoft none their software i used easy learn using manuals or help files . contrast omniform well worth money . omniform 5 great job either creating forms scratch , scanning or converting pdf . it only forms program i tried so far actually great job importing form pdf file . its all tools you need create form starting blank page . you define any field variety formats . example you create date field specific format then no matter how data input program automatically reformat data way you specified . you create just any field simply dragging symbol menu onto page . case inserting graphic you choose graphic saved form or not saving form itself conserve file size . you graphic resized program little loss quality . features such these might available other programs this type but i found omniform best job creating form field field least effort . scanning form almost flawless . it even recognized fields paper form meant circled created field them . other programs i used could not this well if all . only adjustments i make scanned forms sometimes omniform recognized text bold when it wasn't occasionally it would change font . example it would change arial times new roman some spots form . strange quirk . get form imported pdf file you open pdf file print omniform . this very accurate little adjustment necessary after import . omniform really shines this area . but i notice if form your importing pdf multiple pages omniform give you out memory error when you try save . overcome this flaw you import one page time , creating new page each time omniform make multi page form pdf . little time consuming when you 9 page form . it create self running . exe form you e-mail person other end fill out form send it back . this works even other person not omniform their machine . because some people filter out . exe file attachments program also creates . html version form . this very handy feature . help file not much use . paper manual better but still lacking . if you problems tech support scansoft expensive . but there user support forum you get through support page scansoft web site . i used forum great success . overall this program little difficult use some quirks needed features like able import save multiple page form pdf . but well worth effort use it most accurate forms program i used . i recommend this program . if flaws i mentioned corrected i would give this program 5 stars	1
i'm not going cover technical drawbacks this software except briefly mention you should look over other reviews before you buy . however , despite annoying design features , this quite amazing piece software ! i would certainly rate it 5+ if there weren't some design shortcomings undocumented features ;) starters , educational intent this software well thought out . young people certainly learn lot chess through using this program they tremendous fun doing it ! game teaches fairly advanced concepts very clever engaging ways children all ages even adults . graphics characters great . explanations principles sound they reinforced through fun chess exercises . program encourages young chess players same time challenges them improve . product description above covers scope concepts covered detail i found this description accurate so i won't repeat it . i spent 2 hours 9 year old playing game i lot fun ! i didn't find this program especially difficult use my young friend able figure it out intuitively . he also found it difficult pull himself away so i . this definitely activity you enjoy your children . overall concept this teaching tool interesting because it involves three layers play . there overall game rescuing king who trapped castle which used tool motivate player learn new chess skills allow them progress this higher order game . embedded within this larger framework number clever chess teaching games where you record high scores learn various skills . these selected within animated room , which gives player some freedom choice . additionally , there other fun games not necessarily related chess , but allow player relax their chess concentration refresh themselves tackling more difficult chess skills challenges . i also think it good kids could join [ ... ] year play against others part purchase price . this gives them arena apply their chess knowledge good community always available . there other online chess communities free , but i still think this nice added bonus . i don't think any parent could go wrong purchasing this software their child . it good hundreds or even thousands hours entertainment its powered excellent chess engine . however , you can't play game chess against computer it . it only teaching tool . however , you buy fritz grandmaster software [ ... ] which this capability very low price point compared other products comparable playing ability . i've heard criticisms fritz 9 my understanding extra cost not add lot value . fact , this point there seems some bugs fritz 9 . if you purchase this product , you won't disappointed . i wish they it when i learning play chess	1

bought this usb gps just before christmas my trips virginia dc . weigh it against similar product garmin . but price , usability track record microsoft user reviews persuaded me towards this ms product . i must say , this excellent value money . not only it it give unambiguous directions ( voice ) , other feature like gps trail help you determine how lost you actual route . also you recalculate route your current position . voice giudance one or two instances bit slow , but i pretty much got adequate time make turns merges nearly all instances . extremely useful during night driving when it becomes difficult read street names . maps very detailed some cool features like " nearest items " ( gas statn , railways stn , bus terminals , restaurants , hotes , etc ) impressed me very much . since this plugs into your laptop , its best suited your navigator , although i make long trip laptop front seat just listening voice driving directions . but since it not call out street names but shows it display , you would neeed look screen which ofcourse dangerous . it say " wrong route " when you go ofcourse but you'd need hit button relculate route your current position . all said , less than $100 this stuff rocks !!	1

one thing you find reading through many reviews dissatisfaction state filings . this my own experience this may last year i use taxcut because it . first all , it would not allow me e-file my state return but didn't explain why . i later discovered most states you apparently can't e-file partial year return . then when printing out state return it told me i also include form mentioned nowhere else program . i later found out taxcut not support all state tax forms ! i then get form fill it manually , then discovered i owed less than before because taxcut incorrectly calculated my capital gains . there nothing missing state form could not completed data program already . taxcut also advised me i could save $1000 off my fed bill contributing ira . so i opened ira contributed $4000 . when i went back taxcut entered details it told me i wasn't eligible any tax deduction . i ready tied up ! this software seriously dysfunctional . i'm guessing this stage you get idea . bottom line : i looking elsewhere complete my tax returns next year . oh , way , if like me you unable efile you paid efile option , you get credit hr calling 1-888-4taxcut option 2 , 2 , 0	-1

answer obvious : people seem compelled review products only if something went wrong their experience . short , people confuse review sites complaint forums . therefore , self-proclaimed dr. prog , i feel it my duty step out my usual mode reviewing progressive rock albums give honest , no nonsense review microsoft windows vista home premium . -the interface-ah , yes . you've heard all new windows vista aero interface now . virtually every screen shot you'll ever see feature aero . but it much more than just pretty , glass-like window frames . aero includes many new enhancements ui , such live thumbnails appear when you mouse-over minimized windows . name suggests , these actually update real time , so if there video or animation playing window , it appear live thumbnail . this very useful . perhaps less useful but scoring 8 1-10 " coolness factor " scale oft-mentioned 3d-flip , which allows user view three-dimensional representation all open windows , offering ability virtually paw through these bring desired window forefront . these things you'll hear most . what you don't hear so much all general changes made overall interface . new icons photo-realistic size-scalable . they start out little large , but you set them any size within wide spectrum . explorer windows radically redressed , new breadcrumbs backward navigation tool beats old address bar hands down ( you retrace your steps logical , step-by-step manner , instead using cryptic addresses ) . also , they're spruced up decorations recall visual aura style some new wallpapers . speaking which , these first time actually usable , unlike previous versions windows , where wallpapers small grainy . more general changes include absence menu bars most areas explorer , including ie . these replaced momentarily tap alt key , least until you learn how navigate without them . also , animations much better than previous versions windows , particularly one you see when copying file . addition , start menu reworked drastically . it doesn't even say " start , " anymore ; instead , it simply blue orb windows logo . first big change way programs accessed : gone delicate finicky ever-expanding hierarchy system , where slightly overzealous hand could miss mark close entire desired level . now , all programs button leads explorer-like listing folders , each clearly named , each which opens closes single mouse click . each time start menu opened , folders reset themselves . also , they automatically alphabetized . start menu also contains most system links usually found desktop ( computer , documents , etc . ) , which why only thing desktop first time you boot up recycle bin . , case you seen screen shots or tried out vista already , search bar bottom pulls double duty replacement run command utility . speaking search , though i seldom ever find myself wondering where my files ( i suppose i'm unique this respect ) , many people far more data keep track than me , thus they greatly appreciate enhanced pervasive searching facilities vista . there search boxes virtually everywhere explorer , including start menu . there even one ie7 , though it not integrated system search . but , you've probably noticed , this but list interface changes additions . i assure you list could go , i know i'll receive more than one comment reminding me some feature or other i've forgotten . i'll read those when they come add material necessary . but , aside this , how this new interface really impact end user ? perfectly honest , though it certainly pretty few parts it required little adjustment , it didn't feel much different previous windows versions me . but , honest , this good thing . perhaps you've heard it nightmare learn vista . that load hogwash . few things renamed , few things moved around , whole everything looks prettier . but it still windows ; it accomplishes same tasks it works virtually same it always . -included software bundle-taking hint apple , microsoft included compliment digital media manipulation software . while course ilife superior , there one issue must cleared up : ilife not integral part mac os you may led believe . older mac users must purchase it ; it only comes newer macs . therefore , microsoft windows vista , purely technical , offers most comprehensive digital media suite ever offered stock os . however , technicality seldom practical , microsoft inclusion no ilife killer . still , included calendar ( new vista ) , photo viewing editing application ( new ) , windows media player 11 , windows movie maker , windows dvd burning program ( new ) nothing scoff . no , they won't replace dedicated , professional stand-alone programs , but let honest : neither ilife . new internet explorer 7 step forward piece swiss cheese ie6 , insofar security . new features include phishing filter , tabbed browsing , improved security . additionally , ie7 runs protected mode , also called " sandbox . " idea this one application cordoned off rest system , thereby making it more difficult malicious software take control your computer . but that more security section review . new ie7 certainly more attractive than older versions , version vista offers enhanced visual appeal xp port software lacks . perfectly honest , i still use mozilla firefox ( mostly because i can't stand those blinking ads web pages , there firefox extension gets rid annoyance once all ) , but if i , i would no qualms using ie7 . new incarnation window media player really no different xp port . it still doesn't support aac , it still doesn't handle gapless playback . ipod user progressive rock fan , respectively , i gather only one thing these shortcomings : it time break out itunes . don't get me wrong : wmp not all bad tool . it still default player my system most audio types . however , once ipod owner prog rocker , always ipod owner/progger . i still say itunes king , if only because its interface cleaner , it supports my audio device , it offers gapless playback . i haven't extensively tested windows movie maker application , but i read it updated very slightly xp version . photo editing tool completely new vista , after little experimenting i pleased , though simple , controls offer nice results . this application par many basic image editing software packages you'll see offered digital cameras , printers , like . other applications yet receive my testing , only because i don't often burn dvd movies , i haven't entered event calendar ten years . far windows mail , i cannot objective because i never used outlook or outlook express . reports seem indicate windows mail simply dressed-up outlook express , many same features . i said , i never used mail program . call me old-fashioned , but i just check write my mail my internet browser . either way , i don't honestly believe microsoft would offer outlook-level functionality stripped down version outlook 2007 . all all , i rather impressed steps microsoft taken embrace digital media age . effort falls short ilife proprietary solutions this regard , but then , simply expected . i haven't really benefited tremendously new additions , but there certainly nothing wrong them , i know many people very happy this digital media suite . -security-this big picking point many people ( rightfully ) windows xp . it seems though there least two critical security updates every week . mac commercials definitely point , but that only because macs make up so small percentage market share ( though it indeed growing share ) it not advantageous malware written os users . even so , xp doesn't get free pass here . something . something security measures taken windows vista . " sandbox " already mentioned above , but other features added . one these , windows defender ( microsoft anti-spyware program ) , one those rare pieces software just perfect : it may not best what it , but it unobtrusive , it simple use , it totally completely free . leave it supplement your already existing spyware solution , you only benefit . also featured vista now infamous user account control ( uac ) . basically , it prompts you every time your computer basically anything , including installing programs , running some programs , updating settings , etc . , if you wondering , mac commercials it right : it really annoying . fair , you see far fewer these alerts once bulk your software installed , but until then you very , very sick uac . i don't advise this , but since i able get my anti-virus anti-spyware software up running vista , i finally turned off uac . symantic seems think this unwise , but norton virus scan doesn't bother me it other than recommend , its information page , i leave uac activated . yeah . like that going happen . beyond these broad , tangible aspects security , there lot new stuff under hood vista makes it less susceptible malicious attacks . mostly , unless you're very savvy , you don't need understand it all , frank , don't ask me because i haven't foggiest how it all works . i'm just glad it there . overall , i think microsoft made valiant effort security . i would still not advise running any windows operating system without active virus spyware protection , but least vista taken step right direction . plus , you likely anti-virus anti-spyware software running windows xp , which you then install vista . -the hardware-graphics : this part i waiting . everything i read up until i finally installed vista told me i needed dedicated graphics card least 256 mb memory order run aero . i'll honest : i fell it . i graphics card * my hand * , but way checkout i realized i left my gift certificate home . so i decided wait see how my hardware would react . this where i realized utter bias among tech community : i absolutely no trouble running aero integrated graphics . only makes sense because my setup rather typical : 17 " flat panel monitor modern computer . this what majority people moment , this size , ig should no trouble running aero . now use logic : if you want run dual 24 " widescreen monitors , yeah , you'll need graphics card . especially since i don't believe there even exists dual monitor-capable ig motherboard ( if there such thing , it certainly not available oem consumer market ) . but if you fairly typical single monitor scenario computer you bought within past few years , you should no trouble all insofar graphics . don't fooled . if you want absolutely sure , however , there no harm -- plenty good sense -- downloading microsoft free upgrade advisor utility see if your setup any way deficient . plus , if you find you can't run aero any reason , you going upgrade vista anyway , so you still buy dedicated graphics point . you don't need top-of-the-line card unless you want make this excuse foray into gaming ; older technology get you up running very reasonable prices . ram : there one area , however , where many computers deficient : ram . oddly enough , while many sources pushing graphics card brigade , almost equally strong force -- computer manufacturers themselves -- seems think ram no big deal . trust me : if you've ever tried run windows xp 256 mb ram , it painful experience . that what vista like 512 mb -- you don't even want go there . dell shockingly honest when they qualify " minimum " vista requirement 512 mb ram ( per microsoft ) " great booting operating system , without running any applications or games . " this where most people upgrade their machines . 1 gb perfectly acceptable ; if you want true multitasking power ( you dual-core processor support it ) , then go 2 gb or more . most people , however , 1 gb fine . my first two vista machines 1 gb it works perfectly . i warn you , though , often times memory installed pairs , so your 512 mb most likely two 256 mb modules . paired method offers better performance , but it make upgrading system only two memory slots somewhat expensive ( though not exorbitant any means ) . but this not somewhere you want skimp , so least one pair 512 mb memory modules should your list extra hardware if you only 512 mb memory currently installed . processor : this perhaps most accurate terms hype . you'll need least 1 ghz processor run aero . many computers such processors don't even support 1 gb ram , so if you're situation , you definitely looking new computer vista pre-installed . however , these very old machines this point , most us something slightly newer . one myth needs dispelled dual-core processors run vista better than single-core cpus : vista , most part , based microsoft server 2003 code , which , turn , based xp code , both which came before advent multi-core processing . therefore , effect operating system run , there only marginal difference single-core or dual-core cpu , provided both use identical core architectures . course any applications take advantage multi-threading benefit multiple cores , but this , , always case , independent operating system . question simply whether you see yourself multitasking more vista . if that case , then new computer dual-core processor installed probably your best bet ; if you're fine your current setup , then it most likely run vista aero without any problems . it interesting note , however , some upgrade aptitude utilities some small quirks give conflicting non-real results . example , such utility offered advanced micro devices ( amd ) passed both my a64 x2-based machines without hitch . however , when whim i ran it my old p4-based desktop , utility seemed think 2.40 ghz pentium 4 northwood ( 533 fsb ) would insufficient run vista . i smell amd bias , even though i happen favor amd over intel . just take what such utilities tell you grain salt , remember microsoft own utility likely most reliable . generally , your processor not issue when upgrading vista . hard drive : again , this one pretty straightforward . if you 40 gb hard drive or better , you're good go . if you don't , hard drives so cheap these days you could easily least triple your current capacity what it costs take family out dinner one evening ( amazon not allow price figures , hence my vagueness regarding pricing throughout this review ) . things get interesting when you consider dual boot scenario . this when you two operating systems running same system , either same or different hard drives . my honest opinion , this best way go because you get keep your current operating system ( just case you run into problems vista ) , you also get vista . keep mind , order run vista same hard drive your current os , you'll need install each os separate partition . you either purchase third party partitioning tool , or what i , which use ubuntu linux live boot disc built-in partitioning utility . course there risk involved this last solution ( but , my experience , i've used it dozens times no problems ) , so latter only your own risk . -compatibility-this where most horror stories come . both hardware software compatibility nightmares flitting around denser clusters than fish flies june . up until recently , anti-virus anti-spyware programs unable install vista . addition , many proprietary printer applications incompatible , yet printer itself often times function perfectly . graphics sound card drivers still haven't really caught up , despite fact they've little over two years so . i won't deny , if your system just happens roll snake eyes , you're some hell . but it not half bad you hear . i installed vista without hitch ; there separate part process where os scans system hardware , installs necessary drivers , then generates list anything doesn't install properly . every piece hardware i recognized . addition , my printer recognized installed five seconds , despite fact its own software would not install ( its maker , hp , still hadn't posted vista-compatible version ) . even my usb internet modem , which upgrade advisor flat out said would not work vista , installed ran perfectly when i supplied drivers manufacturer website . fact , vista shipped exponentially more drivers than any edition xp . plus , it possible supply drivers manufacturers ' websites odd , esoteric bit hardware isn't immediately detected . sometimes it work , sometimes not . but this only expected when upgrading new os . i don't seem remember everything rosy when xp came out , either . this yet item strong support dual boot scenario . software no different hardware . all my software titles , possible exception ancient original roller coaster tycoon , work flawlessly vista . latter didn't work windows xp mce 2005 , either , so i don't blame vista this . if your software acts buggy or otherwise just won't work , check manufacturer website . if it fairly recent title , there most likely some compatibility patches or whole new version application , all free charge . just ready insert your product key , if required , latter case . now course chances if you some pet application mid-nineties , it might kick up few dickens . again , strong case dual boo t.t he final perhaps most prolific source upgrade hell , ironically , upgrade itself . this process works performing in-place upgrade already existing operating system ( xp ) . these sorts upgrades notorious problems , vista crop no exception . however , since you're currently viewing full version page , this obviously isn't issue you . just remember , best ways install vista either clean installation ( if necessary obliterating existing os ) or dual boot scenario . anything else you might experience problems . but this always case in-place upgrades . -overall-i thank you reading this far . most people won't . i know this pretty long , but i wanted get it all out there people read . vista not bad operating system . i absolutely floored it ? it may require some more time , but it hasn't revelation microsoft promised . this somewhat disappointing , yet , somewhat reassuring well . i didn't suffer any downtime because i couldn't figure out how operating system works , i didn't any glaring compatibility issues , my computer worked virtually error-free ever since i first installed os . short , change , while not mind blowing , wasn't drastic or disturbing , either . end day , just remember : it windows . love it or leave it , it just microsoft operating system . vista same thing xp earlier editions ; it not source inspiration or drive . it only good person who using it .	1

coreldraw my first foray into vector graphics back when version 3 showed up my desk small " mom pop " screenprinting shop i worked . back then , corel came oodles free fonts , clipart , manuals ... not mention free technical support via toll-free number . i stayed corel exclusively until version 10 ... enduring countless patches , bugs dreaded " odd-numbered " curse ( if you tried version 5 or 7 , you feel my pain ) . adobe photoshop always my photo-editing program choice ... corelphotopaint just never quite " it " me . industry demands eventually delegated i delve into adobe illustrator . already familiar adobe photoshop features , tools " look feel " , illustrator didn't present huge , overbearing learning curve . illustrator , i found same robust features coreldraw ... which wasn't what impressed me illustrator . adobe intuitive programs , their ability interact one ... seamlessly ... what won me over illustrator . illustrator ability edit/create pdf their native format ? wow ! exporting layered vector files photoshop ... layers intact ??? wow !!! ( i could go on)now , said ... there still things i prefer coreldraw compared illustrator . extrude function corel much easier utilize . powerclip function more user friendly than illustrator " make clipping mask " function . ability customize/edit/add shortcut keys amazing feature . ( again ... i could go ) ( edit : i learned this possible illustrator cs2 via edit/keyboard shortcuts , or alt+shift+ctrl+k)in regards importing exporting files other applications , coreldraw wins , hands down . it boasts robust set import export filters , my favorite . eps import filter which lets you import . eps while converting fonts curves during import . this must if you work . eps file created computer whose fonts you lack . if i dollar every . eps pulls into illustrator fonts blown out ... i'd independently wealthy . why illustrator never implemented this beyond me . so , sum it up ... coreldraw great program ... but i can't imagine it my only vector drawing program . just like real life , you need great team . this program , paired adobe creative suite , meets my needs perfectly .	1

* this upgrade edition*we should cover few things editions before we review vista . " starter " very basic limited 256mb memory . almost everything good vista omitted . " home basic " not aero graphics flip windows special effects . " home premium " limited networking interaction . " vista business " extended networking interaction . " vista enterprise " unix virtual machine support . " ultimate " all bells whistles . carefully choose what you want before you make this expensive purchase . installing vista very easy . checking hardware vendors patches updates must . " windows vista upgrade advisor " identify changes needed . many notebook manufacturers recommend updates pre-install patch before vista upgrade . vista upgrade identify software system might not compatible . depending compatibility issues upgrade , clean install also optional works notebooks although driver installations must after . install sequence matter few clicks vista up running . this might not so simple if vista loaded virtualization platform like vmware which requires additional configurations bios some other tweaks . we come long way since days windows 3.1 insert disc #10 . first thing strikes user sheer speed which vista launches . this most certainly microsoft fastest os date . soon vista loads up , low behold " gadgets " display appears desktop moving pictures , cpu meter , real-time news feeds , real-time weather , clock , notes , stock exchange , calendar contacts . wow , impressive stuff ... but let stop press moment tell it like it ... gadgets just apple osx " widgets " ripped-off ( some might say widgets existed before separate plug-ins yahoo called " konfabulator " , but we talking this inherently part os , not plug-ins ) . it apple invention demand , much like need desktop recycle bin ( which apple didn't patent , doh ! ) . microsoft settles just straight out burglary apple innovation hopes user just enjoys it . truth-be-told , modern times when everyone downloading everyone else stuff free , microsoft even game , making money it . however this all competition . since competition exists ( we may some things say ms monopoly ) we should thankful other forces driving ms what it may not without these pressures . who really cares if vista ultimately apple osx rip ? this what microsoft always . same time apple openly accepted command line interface , ms right-click save or open intel chips . balance things out . if you don't like microsoft , then you know where go . third party software probably sway you one way or . however seeing osx86 boot vmware top vista something makes you stop think . linux users simply front `customization ' bonus not going windows many ways they big point make . vista same lockdown start menu system . you just can't change it or put any folder anywhere you want . way this creates standard ( " where johnny keep his documents this system ? " " oh yeah , documents folder ! " ) , while same time professional users just want custom start menu way they like it , but can't . microsoft hasn't really got whole pile originality going here ( although there many gizmos included bundled ultimate pack ) all intents purposes vista osx . vista great . its fast , fast , fast 3ghz pentium 4 or 1.66 ghz core duo . 1gb ram run it no problem . first thing open pile windows , hold down windows start key + tab , press tab repeatedly watch screen turns into flip 3d windows ( new aero system ) . also you get thumbnail preview each running window task bar rolling mouse over it . very impressive . no longer we pinned down one desktop . just scrolling through multiple windows 3d sight behold eyes many make upgrade worth every penny . vista also looks whole world better than xp no longer plagued boring sterile look . vista art but then again gadgets play enormous role this . apart , windows now beautiful fade fade out windows , some which transparent so you see windows underneath . this whole new art dimension windows never presented before many ways thankfully somebody decided higher graphic designer all money they make . installing office 2007 just brings it all life , but story . 99% xp software run vista . only problem comes software creates virtual drives devices . it seems vista security ( although vista cracked already ) trying prevent people loading up iso software like daemon tools . no doubt however someone out there punch hole through one . 70gigs worth software running xp here installed no problem vista ... no bsod ( blue screens death ) or serious flaw seems apparent . while some software not like way it installed , using windows own manual driver installation just overcame those issues . something so brand new it hard fault how stable this . xp users complain they only just learned xp see no reason why they need vista . right now nobody `needs ' vista . however microsoft indicated some games ( especially xbox ports like halo 2 ) software only vista compatible . if you like oss like what cutting edge then don't hold back moment longer get it . if you need system absolutely solid , then try out vista test system few weeks see . you might inclined wait vista sp1 but honest i see no reason why most people not use this , right out box , right now . like i said , i ported my xp software over vista just stable ... surprise !... well not really . since win2k , microsoft got their stability issues sorted out apple seems just exploitable these days anybody who reading see it . very existence osx86 proves this . vista gives you little future boost too probably main reason want it . this going future windows oss next few years . last time windows released os around time 911 . it 6 years , longest gap microsoft oss history , it worth wait , especially imagining what vista sp2 deliver . many us still hoping lot big things change though . why we still using keyboards why we interface our hardware this way ? bring multi-user touch-screen pc give us real show ! don't you think we all deserve it ? we . bottom line here this stable future-tech . if makes your eyes go bing then don't hold back second more just get this thing . you very pleased experiencing rush new os once again .	1
