many useful features this design : compact but capable rugged . recommended item emergency power outages , general service where portable power needed : starts dead car batteries , pumps tires , runs 120v tools , etc . two design shortcomings i hoped weren't there , keep it 5 stars - #1 : it charges either wall-wart 12v adapter , or 12v cigarette lighter plug . i much prefer direct 120v power cord connection versus wall adapter variety . #2 shortcoming : it doesn't self float-charge cycle - you must limit your charge times manually unplugging it ( battery damage if charged too long ) . ach ! still , guess person could attach his own float-charge unit instead supplied 12vdc adapter . but heck , wagan , design into it , like better powerpacks	-1
