product average ... ours button whole sewed so tight even i problems buttoning ... impossible my 20 month old . it says clothes remove fully easily ... which i thought would great my daughter since she likes try dress things ... but pullover removed pulling over head it isn't easy ... again almost impossible little one . also ... ours didn't come back pack which i'm sure would made toy more fun ! perhaps she'll gain interest capability toy months come ... but right now ... she much interest it she say ... carpet	1
we bought this dollhouse , because when we went store , it adorable display looked like step up twintime dollhouse , which very small rooms . you could press button display , people would talk each other . my kids thought it would great . when we toys us , i looked accessory furniture/people/animal sets go this dollhouse . i not see any . i thought it probably due christmas just passed . we got home , opened dollhouse discovered there really not many phrases provided people/furnitureanimal , so i went amazon try find more sets order achieve purpose this dollhouse ( get 200 phrases ) . thats when reality set we just made huge mistake . you cannot find any accesory pieces this set . you go ebay pay many times more than original price used furniture . i really disappointed . i even tried fisher price website , only find they marketing twintime dollhouse furniture this sweet sounds dollhouse . what shame sham .... i really like fisher price toys we many , but i am very disappointed fact they trying fool consumer . what good dollhouse , if you cannot get it accomplish what it says it --- 200 phrases . not mention , what included sweet sounds dollhouse not much . just mom , dad , girl , baby , swing , cradle , radio , cat , scant few more pieces . definately not enough keep kids interested long ! there actually three fisher price dollhouses still available , this one , twintime dollhouse , one we eventually ended up buying value city ( also available ebay) -- fisher price special edition townhouse . it doorbell rings , doors open , birds sing , phone rings , lights come , fridge light comes , computer lights up(and part desk set attached dollhouse ) , fireplace crackles lights up ( which also attached dollhouse ) . these things all dollhouse itself . no accesory furniture or people needed make this happen . battery replacement compartment back this dollhouse not bottom , like sweet sounds one . front townhouse flower boxes likelike flowers you place them ( comes set ) . you get it lot cheaper than sweet sounds dollhouse , too ( almost half cost ) . it comes great deal furniture : 2 beds pillows comforters blankets , lawnchair , 3 people , potted plant , real curtains , kitchen table chairs , clothing people , computer chair , lounge chair more . kitchen counter , stove , microwave fridge part dollhouse . it also closet doors open stairs people walk up . you practically not need buy anything else , but if you , you get loving family accesory people furniture sets . this dollhouse so much larger boot . there plenty room put everything . it shuts closes together just like sweet sounds , but it clearly larger . we also thought twintime , but it too many comments how small rooms display toys us looked jammed packed . i not know how more than one child could play it not shoving match , because they could not play , well . my kids absolutely townhouse all its sounds , especially doorbell . great thing it these greatly reduced price , because they older model , which what they should sweet sounds dollhouse . let public know ahead time , so their kids not get disappointed , because it not live up what it says store . thank goodness i able take mine back , because i my receipt box . careful keep box receipt if you choose buy this dollhouse even after all warnings , because after your kids see it not what it says because it small side compared townhouse version , they may not want keep it . when we took ours back , toys us worker stopped talked us agreed fisher price just trying get rid their extra stock sweet sounds dollhouses . unfortunately , it consumers expense disappointment !!	1
i am very disappointed this produc t.t he volume not adjustable , default sound setting so loud it heard room , even door closed . electronic toy voices occasionally annoying or difficult understand , this case here . so , needing something repeated ... loudly ... " get your nerves " . i more careful future not assume all speaking electronic toys come adjustable volume . buyers beware !	-1
like many overhead gym type toys , this one turns out short or legless babies . when my daughter kicks kickplates , she kicks toy right away her ( this carpet ) , when we brace toy against something , she kicks herself right out under toy . we found same true number similarly designed toys . now we looked box more closely , baby picture his/her legs bent really hard order baby fit under toy . our daughter 3 1/2 months old already too big this . positive note , this very well made toy all other respects . looks durable , all chicco toys , music lights pleasant . negative : you apparently push two hanging toys get them activate sound lights , most babies want pull them . might good tummy toy , but we're not waiting that--we'll try chicco 3 1 gym instead , it appears much better bang buck not kick plate	1

i purchased this my 2 boys , 5 3 , february . got it clearance walmart $19 , but would not wanted spend much more it . i debated whether get this or kitchen made cooking sounds but didn't speak 3 languages , since we're trying raise our children bilingual ( least ! ) we thought talking kitchen would preferable . unfortunately , voices hard understand - not they're soft , but there seems lot mumbling static , so if you don't know exactly what voice saying already , you wouldn't able learn , example , spanish word bacon " tocino " - it sounds more like " poseena " . beyond , however , both boys enjoyed it . it little small 5-yr old now but they both still play it . they occasionally get frustrated only cookie sheet fit into oven ( you can't put pot or nearly any other cooking vessel our other playsets ) . reason this obvious- sensor talking feature top oven , thus order close enough food sensor respond whatever there , floor oven raised rather high . if i it again , i would probably look kitchen set only cooking sounds not talking feature , it just not used often this house .	1

my oldest daughter got older version this product her 5th birthday . she could only play couple games time , but she loved it . three years now it her all-time favorite car toy . it dropped , banged , kicked , stepped , fought over , everything else two kids could it 3 years , still works great ! drawbacks : pixter leapster caught kids might actually want play their toys past 5pm car put lcd lighting , but this company hasn't caught yet . also , no headphones jack -- some games make incredibly annoying noises ! one more thing -- ages not appropriately labeled . closer first grade up	1

i would rated this lower , but idea so great . my 7yo loves his book . careful w/ pages you submit . we ordered two books first book contains original submitted pages w/ artwork ( except cover which scanned reprinted " glossy " paper ) . 2nd book , course , all photocopied pages firs t.t hey simply take your submitted artwork pages someone ( or possibly ocr ) , prints your submitted text just under your drawings ; then binds pages into book , title page , dedication page , etc . not sturdy book i thought it should , but i said , my kid loves it , so that what matters most . lt ; grin	1
my daughter got this birthday gift really likes playing it . she loves palying animals this perfect fit doll house she recieved christmas . she still playing it several months later	1
box said it came 10 refillable paint containers , but ours only 9 bottles , one those empty . no matter , really , it just small amount paint start , but why not give people what you tell them you ? color selection all right , but not super - you don't get roygbiv or anything . it may vary , course , but we lot light green . some them glitter , which extra cool good job making whole picture sparkle if you add it last . it also comes small assortment ( 40 pieces ) paper -- both large small sizes -- which you encouraged reserve last one template trace make new ones . poster board seems same thickness original paper . smaller " bonus " machine go fast if you pump button down repeatedly . doing this , it actually go faster than battery operated one paint distributes spatters very well . instruction manual , if you call it , pretty limited . it shows 3 pictures how put everything together operate it . no tips or hints how make neat designs . it least detailed set instructions i seen art toy . it comes apart easy rinsing/wiping . i've always this immediately after paint session , units still clean they first time out box . my kids love it . they want spin pictures every day	1

we bought game thinking it would just like real life game , but sponge bob characters . it very simplified version game . it geared towards young children . game , if you run out money , you just keep playing , you exempt pay any fees , while people money , still keep paying ... so you actually better off if you lose your money early game . ( bugs me)as far spinner goes ... it snaps , you press hard get it click into place , it works great . just little disappointed , just remember , it little kids . if you love game life , get original one ... my older kids want me buy original one , they don't care sponge bob version .	1
this puzzle great , i'm glad i bought it my 2 year old , claire . however , like most toddlers , she prefers things her size . i find hands this puzzle slim adult sized hands , like my own . maybe makers felt " mommy " sized hands way go , or simply they wanted fill space standard sized wooden puzzle . i think it would nice make hands toddler sized , chubby palms fingers . said , it great tool . we don't use it much counting , though it intent . this more prop song fest " where thumbkin " even more exciting prop game " dr. claire " wherein she repairs " owie hand " . all all , fine addition your wooden puzzle collection	1
i bought this my 8 11 year old girls extre inexpensive christmas gift , i pleasently surprised how much they enjoy it	1
my twin boys ( 16 months ) love this toy . i would suggest getting least 100 extra balls . ( i 250 our ball pit it really looks fun )) connections aren't best , but they work better than other company models don't velcro straps . our kids play this off most day . cautionary note , this fairly large system tunnels tents so make sure you plenty room . course , you use pieces separately make several smaller play spaces instead one large area . overall , i am glad i purchased this i didn't wait until recommended 3 year old age range .	1
i bought this computer my just turned 5 year old . while he thinks it really cool , it bit hard him . 26 games , he play 6 . i am happy it toy he grow it teach him lot . graphics great but i wish volume could turned down one more setting . i wish there setting they could just type letters learn keypad . all all , good investment .	1

shopping puzzles over last few years i've noticed manufacture age recommendations seem bit off . when puzzles too advanced , simple solution put it up later date ; however , when they too simple , they're waste money . unfortunately , alphabet art puzzle one those disappointments . puzzle encourages thinking , matching , but i'm not sure it helped teach alphabet . addition , some images too goofy this age group . instance , piece rope shaped into letter " , " but 3-year old don't associate such thing . example this , letter " " yarn . wouldn't yo yo better solution ? raised pieces offer new motor challenge plastic knobs , but they too shallow board . i can't seem move this puzzle without dropping several pieces floor . my son found this frustrating well . what more , i think age recommendation needs adjusted . i purchased alphabet art puzzle when my son 2-years 4-months old . it recommended children 3-years up , so i thought it would make good choice . it didn't challenge him all . second time he worked it , he completed it less than 4-minutes himself . said , my son benefited puzzle . he likes working it , continues ask questions pictures . i recommend it children 18-months up , they find it more challenging than 3-year old .	1

if you your friends just too crazy conventional board games , give i've never - game truth try . object game simple , players move around board answering highly personal potentially defamatory questions , take shots or drink beer while playing . questions formatted " i've never .... " ( example , " i've never skinny-dipping " ) . if this true you , you get move forward designated number spaces . if it false , you pay consequence ( generally you must take drink ) . some spaces game board automatically force you drink . many people find questions far too offensive overly personal , uncomfortable playing this game . if this you , don't feel bad , you're not only one . however , group close friends , this game total laugh riot . this game perfect bachelor or bachelorette party , or just regular party group friends who crazy you	1
i bought this my 5 year old daughter we tried take very good care it . within few days careful use , one latches bent , hinge broke off piece edge came unglued . it great idea , but needs better construction . positive note , my daughter loved it would spent hours drawing creating tools inside if i let her . however , i take box away so further damage not occur before i fix it . drawers work fine . problem two doors top flip out . note drawers ; little plastic door knobs pop out . need glued .	-1

this extremely fun addictive game . you shuffle cards , place three ( room , weapon , person ) secret envelope . every room you go into , you make accusations . if someone card you accused ( like room ) , then they show it you you write it down your notepad . game changes constantly , so it never gets boring . character pieces teeny details , like mr. green straps buckles his briefcase . i gave it 4 stars education because it teaches you focus really think . oh , good problem-solving skills too . coordination ( you add all clues up see who it ) . all all , terrific game . great rainy days or playdates . i mention weapons ? very realistic . cute	1

this house great ! adorable beautiful . it even looks good my daughter room . i think it difficult get furniture during after holidays but now they easy get . my sister bought house my 2 1/2 year old daughter , peyton . she also bought all furniture her except nursery because she two cradles highchair there no more room room , family room , because they living room already . two chairs came house breakfast bar also came house . they aren't dining chairs . i think they just gave little furniture because they obviously want you spend money purchase more . yes rooms small . i wish they bigger too , but i don't think my daughter notices so much . she just likes playing it . although i admit she uses my coffee table kitchen my ottoman parents ' room . furniture adorable ! lots cute fabric accessories ! i 9 month old so i put all small pieces away . i don't think my 2 year old would appreciate them much anyway . there some accessories tied furniture strings . good idea someone her age since i baby i'm glad . i cut those off her when she older so baby , if she cares enough then . we kitchen , bathroom , parents ' room , girl room , dining room , living room laundry room . i haven't taken out dining room laundry room yet because kids room where dining room should . there room downstairs laundry room but i think set seems little old my daughter . she doesn't know what laundry room because ours our basemen t.t his house can't really hold all furniture available unless you use " terraces " . i also bought blonde mommy ( babysitter , aunt or older sister ) because i wanted little girl it came se t.t he only other set i really want suv . i admit i am living vicariously through my daughter because i would loved this dollhouse when i little girl . i think that why my sister bought it her too!it beautiful house i think well worth money , especially since it wasn't my money ! lol . it probably not anyone older than ten years old . i see how it would frustrating them .	1

this toy lots fun . i like play it using my old gijoe toys . my favorite scenario sigmund freud kill off cobra commander , then take his place leader cobra : enemy . his cigar , he works really well evil villain . ( plus , he likes torture good guys they capture tying them up putting his cigar out their bare chest . ) it lots fun play . final battle usually takes place rug foot my bed ( which substitutes jungle ) , where snake-eyes challenges sigmund freud duel order avenge death duke all other joes . ( snake-eyes always only surviving joe left . ) sigmund freud then tries some ninja moves kick snake-eyes ' rear , but snake eyes beats crap out him . it finally ends snake eyes using his sword gut sigmund freud , his sword slowly slides out his bloody entrails . it really lot fun ! sometimes i transformer crossover universe , where megatron comes sigmund freud join him some plot obtain energy order build ultimate weapon take control universe . joes always go get help optimus prime , who always puts stop this plot just last minute , but not before his arm gets chopped off battle . ( i am actually missing optimus ' arm real life , so that why this always happens story . ) anyways , sigmund freud great fun whole family ! especially 10-year-olds ( above ) . buy it today	1

i really enjoyed seeing my 3 children enjoying this toy . all three under 5 years so this perfect fit . i said , fun kids . putting this together easier common sense than confusing instructions . this product made plastic semi durable springs . front end loader good my son carrying my daughters toys away them , but not feasible doing much good when outside . ( i mean , thats what tractors , playing dirt . ) tires not good grass , they slip not get grip . it becomes family pushing toy instead one driven chain . i say it fun children , i give it 5 stars fun . it around , durability wise , we see ..	1

i really like it , but it little too easy adults . not fast-paced they say , well . but , it still fun play ! cards cool look , but bit too slippery . somewhat hard shuffle control . overall though , nice card game .	1
what i say . this fantastic game . you know when you keep seeing movies often disappointed keep waiting blockbuster . well , wit end blockbuster . i can't tell you how much fun we playing this game . it trivia knowledge based game but twist . not only you challenged questions , but question types make game even more interesting . there four different card categories which ask different types questions . teaser category , asks you figure out relationship ; sequence category asks you put people , places things sequence ; odd-1-out category asks you decide which thing not belong wild card category many different types fun question types . if great categories where not enough , questions cover great range knowledge ; including pop culture , music , literature , geography , history ; science .... just everything ! better yet , there detailed answers every question . so you not just left one world answer , but explanation . you actually learn thing or two interesting facts details . questions smart ( real smart ! ) , not dumbdown version other trivia games . i cannot stress you how fantastic this game .... if you up challenge	1
my 8 year old daughter wanted this more than anything her birthday it absolutely everything she hoping . she loves able change password any time she wants gets huge kick out thinking she only one get into it ! ( it seem little-sister-proof ) it even tells her how many " intruders " tried open journal . pen radio gets few stations depending where she walking house - only downside radio i can't hear what she listening unless i'm always checking her . shredder pen manual tiny pieces paper only - which seems perfect whatever shredding 8 year old girl want . there way set journal easier get into - more sensitive setting really very sensitive - we reset password several times when it wouldn't recognize her password - but problem resolved when set less sensitive . ( easier mom get into without setting off intruder alert ....	1

this cute , easy game play . i bought this one my son few years ago it still big hit . it fun keeps him giggling . he asked play few times row , because it short adventure . i think if your little one scared monsters his room this helps ease his fear . when they happen pick monster out sack ... they say ~ go away monster pitch it into box ... i make up little things say when this happens . i highly recommend this game , not hard really you don't need directions ... explain it once they it . great buy	1

my son ( currently approaching 15 months ) totally obsessed cars trucks , pretty much time he old enough hold toy car his hand . even car ads tv drive him crazy joy . compulsive shopper , i buy him toy cars trucks all time . :) out all his toys , this set may his favorite . he loves zoom cars across floor ( they roll very easily , even carpet ) also take them apart put them together . it little hard pull first piece off when taking them apart , so his mom or i help him , but it ok -- he take second piece off put them back just fine . ( we sometimes use his other mega bloks put together big crazy vehicles using parts these three trucks -- it hard see picture , but each truck consists two top pieces chassis piece , all which connect up any other mega bloks . ) same token , they very sturdily put together . he course throws them drops them floor sometimes , because they hard plastic , they make very loud noise tile , but there hasn't so much hairline crack . i see them lasting until he outgrows them . set seem little expensive amount stuff you get ( we actually bought it much less discount store ) , but hindsight , my son loves this toy so much it so sturdily built it would worth retail price .	1
this teaches both color shape recognition , while fun toy bath . my son loves bath time , any time i make it fun learning time , it good thing .	1
my grandson polar express train expert . he very disappointed train didn't really look like movie train . he liked whistle , but very expensive whistle .	-1
you deal cards , show green apple card , everybody turns red apple card , hilarity ensues . each hand inspires discussion chuckles . i liked variations suggested instructions , such dealing all green ( adjective ) cards finding best match red ( noun ) card , or trying find least-fitting match , or just turning red card blindly before seeing what green card says . judge determine how play hand , my favorite part , decision judge completely arbitrary , meaning you pick whichever card you like . it easy , fun , game long or short you like . there lot shuffling involved , since you go through lot cards quickly , so someone hand who knows how shuffle deck cards . recommended	1
this item pretty cheap when you buy it target or any store good prices , but it eventually adds up more than it worth . each pvd $8.99 , but only holds 30 min . most ! i got this toy because hasbro.com made it look so cool , but it not worth it . i use it every now then but my dad doesn't spend lot money me there limits . after buying few pvds player , you could dvd player . dvds same price sometimes lower if it sale , hold lot more space . you also make dvds computer ! you make pvds but they hold under 20 min . i am not saying this toy horrible . if you child 8 or younger , video now xp might good way go . good thing it back each pvd , there now point . if you get six or more nowpoints , you get free pvd mail ! one good point it there long waranty . my first one didn't work very well so i got new one . although box you see two kids watching their videonow car , it not good idea unless it warm day . videonow xp sensitive cold could damaged if left cold too lond . think twice before you get it .	1

these cars so much fun ! just name says , you just shake it up it goes . my son several these they all slightly different reactions . some faster than others . they work best hard surface - cement , hardwood floors , tile . they go pretty slow carpet . cars very durable . one my son favorite games launch them off deck see if he get it land grass below . if weather isn't nice , he likes send them racing down stairs . so far , nothing broken its over six months . these cars easy my daughter ( who only two ) play too . kids love shaking cars racing see who car goes farthest .	1

i received this wagon second hand , i'm glad i didn't spend outrageous price charged it . yes , it relatively durable ( although ours literally fell apart under my 2 year old other day . nut holding wagon together worked itself loose our walk whole thing went pieces . replacing nut fixed problem ) , but it also tips easily . handle much too short . i've tie piece rope handle so i reach it without bending over . it really rough ride , my son never looks very comfortable it . all all , i think i'll passing it buying something else . maybe i'm just picky , but i'd rather pay quality , not radio flyer name . *** eta *** please excuse incorrect stars given this product . i'm not sure what happened . i meant give it 1 star , not 5	1

these babies so cute ! i suprised when i found bunch them yesterday local store same price other individual characters , now i wish i'd grabbed two sets , since they such huge hit ! one my kids little annoyed babies stay sitting - their legs don't move , but once convinced babies don't really walk all , she forgotten all fact . twins sit perfectly , don't topple over , plus they seem just perfect size . definantly great addition dora dollhouse character collection	1
i love melissa doug stuff -- well made , colorful toys always welcome my house . this puzzle perfect wee ones who manipulate floor puzzles like castles princesses like . however -- aware this actually 24-piece puzzle , not 48-piece puzzle . we two these , purchased hundreds miles apart , both 24 pieces , instead 48 listed both boxes	1
this game great sense just everyone play ! we pretty much scrapped rules it came with- they written inanely relatively useless . instead , we modify each game suit situation we're in- so we play it while waiting line disneyland while we're party . it great way " go back " all songs you didn't know you knew , marvel your friend talents ( or lack thereof ) mimic famous singers . if you get it nothing but word cards , it still totally worth it	1
i never one problem this monitor . it works great . occasionally ( once month ) you'll hear cb radio come over frequency second , but it doesn't wake baby or anything it gone quickly it came . i highly recommend this monitor	1
descriptions don't mention creepy voice says " it lullabye time " before it launches into seriously off-key rendition twinkle twinkle firefly ( huh ? there copyright problem using " little star " ? ) you press moon button skip first song , so i didn't too much trouble this- most songs after first mercifully without vocals . later this same robo-mom also says " i love you " , which seriously spooky . aside this , " amazing 3-d ceiling light " really more rotating circular slide projection some cartoon animals , bee-and- led light show actual toy looks really old-fashioned . nature sounds ok , but i am pretty sure one sounds " plank wood tapping against plank wood " . even all this , i still willing strap it my son crib see how he liked it- within first five minutes projector light flickered off , robo-mom got stuck kept saying " it lullabye time " over over .	-1
i happy give my 9 year old cousin game exercise her brain rather than barbie or video game . she learned rules first 5 minutes first game , just few snags ( trouble understanding discs must placed contigously . also occasional trouble understanding discs cannot flipped if they surrounded opponent disc indirect move ) . but point , she able play right away , eventually gain skills strategy . her dad teaching her play chess now , which all strategy but harder . othello good game playing same age while learning chess , because it easier but exercises same parts brain strategy thinking ahead .	1

please oh please not buy this item . my son interested engines i bought this show him how engine works . parts all listed correctly assembled picture looks interesting . assembly engine nothing short maddening . parts not line up correctly , they break if you apply even small amount pressure them worst thing all screws provided . they slightly too large holes they fit into . holes not tapped screws becoming stripped when attempting screw them . i tried smaller screwdriver than one provided but not help . i took out my drill tried widen holes but cast plastic case cracked . i eventually got it all together tried it ..... crap . pistons move up down cylinder but cams not move rocker arms which not move valves . i disassembled it all tried again , spending almost 6 hours massaging parts , adding glue , ensuring contact made using other means holding parts together , but after all ... same result . pistons move up down but all . there just too much slop rest parts actually all move together . don't waste your time .	-1
ok , this set little small side . despite this , there good number bricks this set - can't remember actual number right now . batman sets little pricey side ; but since this smallest them , it most affordable . you get two minifigs , batman catwoman- alone reason enough fans pick this set up . catwoman motorcycle great , but you can't rebuild it into very many other things . batman dragster - i don't like it it own - but it built enough parts there huge potential making your own creations . plus you get some bricks bat-symbols them . this set also includes good number tiny less-common bricks mocer would always find useful . must batman lego users	1

i got this tricycle my nephew his second birthday . although it may little beyond him , he still dazzled it . seat comfortable enough them stay it adjustable . assembly pretty straight forward simple . i gave it 4 stars because there couple parts seemed little flimsy . rear step press formed little thin . same process used seat . minor defect seat wasn't perfectly square body . since adjustable rod seat squared , when you tighten set screw , it forces it offcenter point . something i noticed , but it not dramatic certainly wouldn't affect ridability . fun toy toddler your life	1
we bought this our three-year-old daughter . i not even know where begin convey my disappointment . this no better than plastic toy lights up you push buttons . first , price unit plus software ridiculous what you actually get . second , software joke . it not intuitive . it not challenging . it hardly interactive . there nothing learned except word " dummy " . voices disturbing diaglogue snippy some times . most time you just sit there watch what little content available each program , instead interacting learning . it actually worse than plopping your toddler front tv . overall concept idea good we very excited it . we expecting learn colors , numbers , letters , lot more interactivity such games , puzzles problem solving . there freeware/shareware available internet far better than this . i'm wondering who consulted when comfy designed this stuff . i early childhood educator 10 years i would never used this my class . software titles we purchased christmas comfyland , joy music , animal world , your neighborhood , world colors . all complete total waste money . i am so sick it . i know i sound harsh , but i don't want anyone waste their money like we .	-1
i love this wagon ! my mom purchased it my 2 sons because my 2 year old hates double stroller . they love this wagon ! my youngest just turned 1 i don't even problem him trying climb out while we're moving . they love sitting like big boys looking out while we walk . lap belts very helpful just case . there little storage compartment behind back seat which great my things . my only ( very small ) gripe sippy cup holders kids down inside wagon their feet . it easy them reach , but they get knocked over roll around bottom . some other models kids cup holder up side . i think i would like better , but it may way there also ... i don't know . it not big deal . my favorite feature canopy . it installs very quickly since we live texas , i use it constantly . handle folds flat easy storage . wagon pretty good size , but it fits fine back my jeep cherokee if we take it us somewhere ( which we constantly ) . i don't know how well it would fit back car trunk . wheels real rubber too so it seems smoother ride than one plastic wheels . i can't think better alternative double stroller . my boys just love it	1

i bought this strawberry shortcake doll my 4 year old daughter christmas . when i little girl strawberry shortcake very popular . marketing re-unveiling strawberry shortcake great timing --- just when i am my own children ( they get us nastalgia ) . anyways , technology this doll reminds me technology available when i growing up 1980 , interaction doesn't work correctly . interactive pen doesn't recognize what page i am half time . page i think most educational , when strawberry shortcake supposed read story , not even programmed . i tried retried make this part work , but it just complete failure . i am pretty disapointed this doll , however , we opted keep it because i got excellent deal it . i would rather spent ten dollars more up-to-date technology actually works . my recommendation wait until next year . maybe company come out higher quality doll	1

hi , names tom , i'm 12 years old i know thing or two kids these days one my self , my parents bought this toy me last christmas it terrible , it took 3 days put up when it got put up every time you tried use it it broke so it took hour set backup . it almost impossible get orange tubes right place when you get it right place they bend back out , so when you drop ball it either misses thing completley or it hits rim bounces out . i highly not reccomend this toy . *************** my toy rating top 100:98 ***************	-1
my 22 month-old son many wonderful abilities , but puzzles , however , not quite his forte . this puzzle he loves ! he concentrates mastering it because he enjoys hearing puzzle sound he places car , motorcycle , airplane , etc . into their correct spaces . sounds clear authentic . your child ( you ) lot fun this . it also great gift	1
this game supposed gift my husband our anniversary . i took my time figuring out " theme " pictures names properties so i actually gave it him 4 months later valentine day when i finally completed it ! don't worry though , it not hugely time consuming - it probably only took me few hours complete once i'd decided everything . it deciding took while . he loves it even wanted play it right then there when he opened it ! it great idea , you make it very personal using your own pictures , etc little creativity thought whoever recipient this gift quite touched you took time put so much thought effort into gift them . only negatives actual game pieces ( different colored cheap plastic pegs)and fact there no houses hotels buy properties . i planning making my own personalized playing pieces out clay then baking it , but would've probably taken me 4 months get around doing ! now we're using pieces old monopoly set we . all all i definitely recommend this game	1
when you first realize series 1 2006 topps baseball card set 329 cards it , numbered 1-330 , you probably think you know which card not included . because wake mickey mantle death several years ago topps decided honor mick retiring card #7 . today we say modern era baseball cards begins 1952 topps set , which mantle card biggie , not just because it his topps rookie card but also because it high number , which jumps value up well . however , there card #7 2006 topps set , it mickey mantle . what kind cool card it just like all other cards set there nothing distinguishes fact mick no longer active except his career stats ending 1968 ( he stole six bases his final season those ruined legs ) . card missing #297 , alex gordon , who turned out not meet new gold standard rookie card . there some cut out versions card floating around out there you want really complete series 1 collection ( opposed four incomplete collections same price ) . intact version sold $ 7,000 because clearly it rarest card around this year . topps cut outs because under major league baseball players association rules former university nebraska star , who second pick last year draft , not sign contract until september . after years baseball cards players who never spend day major leagues , mlpa changed rules so rookie cards now only put out players who make 25-man opening-day roster or played least one major league game year before . topps anticipated gordon would make royals ' 25-man roster , but third baseman assigned wichita instead . solves mystery missing card series 1 . personally , i think this rule change great , because i now complete topps sets 1956-57 , 1961 , 1964-66 , 1968 date ( less than dozen cards each go finish my 1953 , 1958 , 1967 sets ) , i lay out my sets so you see how teams finished each year . so i like see who playing each team each year . granted , difficult today because this set already johnny damon yankees ( #185 ) , but coco crisp ( #12 ) still indian not damon replacement red sox . tom gordon ( #163 ) appears phillie photo back , but his card still says yankee matt morris ( #238 ) seen cardinal front his card giants . main thing when you get rookies series 1 ( cards 296-325 ) you actually find players who major leagues right now , including prohibitive favorite american league rookie year award , francisco liriano ( #309 ) twins . this beats going back couple years looking all rookie cards finding only handful made it show this many years down road . topps set remains set me each year because it one history behind it , so if you feel same way it must your collection . base cards set run #1 ( alex rodriguez ) #242 ( felix hernandez ) , big names manny ramirez ( #50 ) , barry bonds ( #100 ) , pedro martinez ( #150 ) , roger clemens ( #151 ) , ivan rodriguez ( #175 ) , albert puljos ( #200 ) , ichiro ( #225 ) . cards #243 -59 american national league gold glove award winners , set missing a.l. catcher , who not i-rod but jason veritek , who not topps card again this year . we then award winners two leagues cy young , most valuable player , rookie year awards ( #260 -65 ) , followed team cards/managers ( #266 -95 ) . what they doing here interesting , because they teams arranged alphabetically arizona diamondbacks washington nationals , what you hear manager card or team card each , but never both ( e.g. , you get mets manager willie randolph new york yankees team card ) . series 2 , you find appropriate counterparts . mentioned above you rookies ( #296 -325 ) , then team stars ( #326 -30 ) , which pairs up stars yankees , orioles , braves , red sox , cubs .	1

our 6-year-old daughter just got this bear her birthday - unfortunatley , it doesn't work way they claim . i hid it one end house , my daughter began searching opposite end house transmitter said " you're getting warmer ... ( which obviously she wasn't ... ) " . half time she just found bear accidentally without it giving any hints all - it just kept saying comments like " you're fun play " other such statements , but nothing help direct her bears location . she just ended up wandering around house comments coming transmitter mostly haphazard nothing where bear located . so " fun " lasted barely 10 minutes . i would love return it , but we already threw away box ... if your child wants this toy , i would highly suggest you try guide her toward something else	-1

we purchased read me dvd system our 3 year old son christmas . ok , so first , setting up remote took all mabey 10 minutes . then you simply pop one dvd your good go ! this system so much fun , it really brings these familiar stories life . my son previously familiar titles offered we them traditional book form ( nothing should replace reading aloud your children ) , i hope they come out more titles soon . illustrations same ones you find books but they animated , reallly entertaining . narrators voice very clear nice hear . words bottom page light up correspond what narrator saying . $15 dollars you spen each dvd bargain considering each dvd comes 4 different play modes tons questions you your little one answer . my son play system often it usually his attention anywhere half hour hour . someone who studying teacher i like some other educational aspects system other than just reading benefits . when you answer question wrong it prompt you give answer , rather than immeadiately give right answer . when you answer question correctly it goes further explains why answer right . this good tool use conjunction daily reading your children . fisher price definitely got it right	1

( main difference two models tires . ) i thought i purchased " classic " skinny non-inflatable tires , but instead got this product , " all terrain wheels " , which come inflated . no biggie- this one more practicle , anyways , but if you're concerned getting " original " model , look closely product decriptions .	1

we bought this product when my daughter just over year old , but wish we'd found it sooner . my mother fisher price aquarium light/monitor set , which we used during one our visits . our daughter loved watching light show , but we already baby monitor so when we got home we found tomy star . it great help bedtime , although we disabled music part toy because it irritating just not necessary . we use it nightly only changed batteries once last 9 months . i also like it straps crib , so after it automatically turns off my daughter turn it again if she not ready sleep . room really dark see projection so you'll need blackout shades or heavy curtains if/when baby goes sleep before sunset . we've very happy this product , but i'm only giving it 4 stars because it doesn't switch turn off music ( we disable wires inside )	1

my 3 1/2 year old daughter received this christmas gift she loves it . light only stays when she needs it , there storage drawer pegs it runs batteries . it also flat so it takes up very little space . my older children older model which no storage drawer ( didn't fit back box once assembled ) , came no light bulb such short electrical cord kids sit floor near outlet play it . they never ended up playing it , so i got rid i t.t his one so much better ! only improvement make so this toy truly self contained would add pocket pattern sheets . love it would highly recommend it -- just don't forget buy batteries it !	1

we got this ball pit our 18-month old daughter . we love it ! most importantly though , she loves it ! i picked this one because i don't blow it up , like you would other pits . i also like it not plastic ... plastic ones seemed like suffocation hazard me - although that just my personal opinion . plus - this ball pit huge compared other ones out there . four children could very easily fit there play . my 18-month old daughter stand up it least foot grow ( she tall her age ) . 3 openings ball pit tied up stay open . however , only largest opening velcro close it shut . i think we may add velcro other 2 smaller openings so we could close them if we like . i love it so easy put up take down . it literally springs open folds closed . plus , balls come mesh bag . everyone else right - 100 balls not nearly enough fill up pit . we got extra 100 balls - they just barely fill up bottom my liking . but , extra 100 really all you'll fit ball pit . this leads my only gripe this toy ... bottom pit where 3 openings not very high . so , we're constantly picking balls up put them back into pit because they fall out easily . i don't really feel this small issue affects toy . i still gave it 5 stars , but wanted let other people know it case it affects their decision buy ball pit ( although it shouldn't!) . all all , this such fun toy ! it big , so you need some room it , but it totally worth it	1
i work elementary school we purchased 3 these games rainy day recess . kids love it . it simple enough kindergarteners yet still enough fun 5th 6th graders . it lot like jenga you choose right rod pull out prevent marbles spilling . however , unlike jenga , clean up set up takes just couple minutes . far durability , we've used it during recess over past 3 months it stood test all those children so i would say it going last while .	1

my son received " mummy gold " present his 6th birthday , he played it exclusively around 24 hours before even looking his other presents . solid week , he visited mummy every day when he came home kindergarten . completely , unapologetically uneducational it , i see charm toy shouts " who dares wake mummy ? " " i've got you now ! " " you've mummified ! " when car rolls over activating switch . if i toy like this when i kid , i would probably still telling my friends , " you've mummified . " trouble , there really no game play , no challenge , activator switch mummy head broke week after we got it . one month later , my son doesn't even look toy . so i give it overall rating three stars	-1

action figure supposed resemblance son god , this toy lame . granted , it kind cool toy jesus , but it not very good toy . other than his arms , figure no flexibilty whatsoever : his legs permanently hidden beneath robe hard plastic his head fixed frozen forward gaze . even though his arms move , they only capable forward backward motion . finally , gliding action feature toy ( meaning little wheels figure base ) more annoyance than anything else . toy coolness factor ten ( it jesus , man ) , but toy it resembles something kid get out one those claw games	1

i think my title tip-off my review . when i got this toy , i charged it long it told me , then i tried it . it didn't even sputter . then i tried it again , charged it , since some reason it ran out battery . didn't work . i then tried bouncing beam cieling ufo , no go . i tried launching it middair , it just fell . then i charged it again . seems repetitive , don't it ? then , 5 minutes later , after almost giving up , i tried it , it actually flew , then crushed my hopes stopping falling my face , then it never worked again . just so i prove it wasn't just my ufo , 5 my friends got ufo , similar destructive results . unless you want buy piece styrofome propeller much money than its worth , don't even bother getting it . don't beleive salesmen store actually use it , they get working tested ones	-1

overall i only very good things say . device very durable , much more so many other kids devices get dropped , thrown around , etc . battery life pretty good even without any expansion cartridges there lot you . cartridges you get even more . unfortunately , it hard find them unless you look online , or least it me . only kind negative thing i say it rather bulkly younger kids who it supposed . my son hard time holding it his small hands drawing screen same time . usually this okay . he puts it table or bed he good go , but sitting car it harder him manipulate . it still doable , just bit tricky . one plus/minus depending how you look it batteries really there good . it got pretty big screw holding battery cover they're there pretty tightly . this makes changing batteries kind chore requires pretty decent screwdriver can't really fly but it also means cover doesn't pop off batteries go flying if you happen drop device . overall very nice product i would reccomend	1

while i love dr. suess his books , i didn't love leap frog version his book . course dr. suess words wonderful i liked how simple page lay outs ( compared some cluttery leap frog books)i not like un needed ugly phrases leap pad people added . ( bumble bee rude cruel ! )even my son said " mom ugly ! " some phrases . voices some characters sound almost sinister . maybe " goth kids " grew up got jobs leap frog , but i remember dr. suess he funny quirky not creepy . sorry leap frog guys , i feel you missed point , tone dr. suess wonderful books . i feel some phrases this book not age appropriate . i would like see more " innocent " books where they not cynical or cruel each other . ( 3-5 year olds should not forced cynical ! )i guess i am picky , i also don't let my son watch sponge bob , or tom jerry ( too violent ) but if you not picky think sponge bob great , then you probly like this book . every mom different ...	1
my son ( 3.5 yo ) loves * everything * thomas lego percy no exception . he plays him almost daily even though he certainly other thomas friends options . part attraction he gets build things ( using his own imagination ) his mega-bloks legos work percy ( duplo size ) . example , this particular set comes special pair blocks pivot . this allowed him build his own `cranky ' water tower , etc . also , he some lego wheeled vehicles ( four wheel 12-up peg size ) percy pull . these he turned into some remarkable `coaches ' . ( really some them huge ! lol)now reviewer pointed out you don't get much track any lego-thomas train kits , but i wouldn't worry it . this actually one thomas toys track doesn't seem important . my son just plays hours floor making things work percy - buildings , coaches , cranky . five stars . great educational toy . lego percy sturdy allows lots creativity . my one suggestion would buy other legos - particularly some wheels bases coaches- if you don't already own some . this way percy his educational best . your child build all sorts friends equipment . note : our lego collection 3099 . i couldn't find it amazon but i think lego duplo 140-pc . bulk tub ( 5352 ) ($15 ) wheeled base vehicles connect percy	1

i bought this game my new family christmas . this not all game life i remember playing countless hours child . first all , my old game all mountains , houses , spinner permenantly attached game board . new version , all these things attached each setup , which takes 10-15 minutes they easily knocked off board . also , spinner hard spin frequently comes off its pivot . cars less sturdy people pegs not stay car so you constantly put people back car . finally , rules game gotten more complicated yet meaning game become more trivial . i think i put this top closet or yard sale go find my old version game play future	-1

we very unhappy this toy . speakers distored music sounded awfu	-1
when putting together mobile section this item , i very disappointed its flimsiness . it looks like just few knocks cause screws break plastic . when i turned it i disappointed second time , this time irritating buzzing sound mobile makes it rotates . it so loud you can't hear music , which shame because i'm sure my son would enjoy looking moving lights . third disappointment - buttons very hit-and-miss . sometimes music buttons don't work ( lullaby one worked eventually once i mashed it really hard ) . i could live , but it fiddling other controls really irritating . control music off , lights on/off rotation on/off all seem tied up two buttons . if you music lights going , then turn rotation , music lights go off rotation comes . then you press buttons whatever order seems logical until you get them all going way you want them . please bear mind i am not particularly daft - i managed figure out my tivo remote day or so - but controls this baby musical mobile make no sense me . i thought first it supposed deliberately challenging order stimulate ' baby natural curiosity ' , but after two nights it really got my nerves , if i can't figure it out , i don't see how my one year old supposed . i only think there something very screwed up circuitry there . i'm not dismissing this item all together . music lovely - not too simplified not too electronic-sounding . minute waltz particularly nice ( i've noticed my son scans it ) . lights lovely too , look pretty when they're moving if you stand buzzing . my son come depend music amuse himself he falls asleep . but , if you buy it , i'd recommend testing buttons motorized rotator before screwing very flimsy mobile pieces together case you need return it .	-1
i asked my sister buy this bike my daughter xmas last year - she decided buy one my nephew also since he same age my daughter ( 2 yrs old time ) . she bought two bikes same time , same model , same color , same store . my daughter , who far more coordinated then my nephew , tips over very easy , my nephew seems fine . my daughter taller may where difference lies . perhaps height child using trike what causing trike tip easily . not sure - but i know i regret she ever got bike -it total waste money	-1

my daughter drink wet doll she could give bath but it filled up water even though you couldn't empty all water out , it still leaked everywhere . i got rid it hoping she wouldn't notice . well , she , so new " doll i give bath " her christmas list . i wanted find solid rubber doll would not fill up water . like dolls i child . i thought this would it since top half visible box appeared no holes . wrong . it soft torso filled polystyrene beads get waterlogged . water all ( i hope ) drains out bottom feet after couple minutes squeezing . then you let torso drip dry . last night after bathtime , my daughter wanted tuck her doll into doll cradle , but couldn't because she still we t.t he other features fine . shower works great . you don't fill up fish . just attach it tube squeeze . it suctions water bottom floaty . doll doesn't sit upright floaty , but she doesn't flop completely over , either . i don't care bow sewn head . who takes bath bow ? but if you take it off , she'll holes her head	-1
just like big chunk us right now , i'm quite sudoku addict . i just can't put those little puzzles down ! so , i tell you first , if you haven't worked sudoku puzzles yet , you really missing out ! get your hands some ! naturally , i excited try out sudoku game race against my friends solve puzzles . but what disappointment ! one small board , several people straining see it , everyone racing fill puzzle ... it just doesn't work . way they designed this game board , which puzzle solved , number tiles you distribute evenly amongst players . everyone rushes fill puzzle , person who uses all their number tiles first winner , assuming puzzle solved correctly . first all , if you more than 2 people playing , players aren't all going able see board well . some people going board upside-down trying solve it . that rough ! talk getting confused 6s 9s ! plus , everyone hands way while they're laying their tiles , which makes it really hard see concentrate puzzle . next , inevitably games i've played someone lays tile wrong . then whole game thrown off . instructions say if someone rids themselves their tiles but placed them incorrectly , then next person finish would win provided all their tiles correct . most likely , if one person made error , caused chain reaction next person tiles also placed wrong , not necessarily fault either players . it could anyone who started chain reaction . format just doesn't work this game . my advice pass this particular game . perhaps game where people racing side-by-side same puzzle , but their own puzzle , would work better	-1
i should bought my girls ipods . yes , these mini-muddles cute they fit into little girl purses pockets , but that where novelty ends . first , it not abundantly obvious children how work controls get where they want . these kids crimy sakes ! they needs controls clear easy . my youngest no idea how get particular song because buttons never what she thinks they should ( that big hint hasbro ... don't design product adults point view . design it child their point view . button multiple functions very confusing kids ) . so i end up constantly mash those itty-bitty buttons until i figure out where song her . second , process getting music point point ( point mini-black-hole ) not quick easy process . copy here , burn there , transfer this spot , drag/drop who knows where . oy vey . then you discover music isn't correct format so you start all over again . 128 worth space ... 128 piddly amount space but it clearly advertised packaging this amount you're going get . no surprises there . now if i could only get darn music into player without giving up chuckin ' it dog play . ipod might expensive , but apple certainly doesn't cause this consumer grief frustration hasbro	-1

don't get me wrong ... concept this toy if fantastic ... when it works it wonderful .... however , it sucks up so many batteries it not even funny ! it requres 4 batteries we replace them least every 3 weeks ! not only but there something wrong toy makes it stick " " position even after you turn it off ( very loud sqeaky " . v-tech knows this problem but tell you when you call " take batteries our turn it off 20 times reset it " . well , work few times but then toy totally broken . ... their idea you send it them they take 2 weesk send you replacement .... hmm .... this not toy marketed help children sleep ... so we obviously need it bedtime ! i offered apy them up front new one they could reimburse me but they would not bend . needless say i am quite frustrated v-tech !!!!!!!!!!!!!! if they know it problem they should tell you first call so something it !!! creepy side note .... thing says " i love you " some strange voice your child ...... scary ! v-tech great idea here it best toy its type ... however , it doesn't work .... looks like they came out technology bit too soon ! btw ... i rated durability 1 amazon it showing 3 stars ... hmmmm !	-1
i would not recommend this product anyone over 3 1/2 years ( unless small their age ) . my 4 yr old son ( 36lbs ) got it his birthday , broke steering wheel within 10 minutes . there plenty room him seat inside car , but its " parked " since broken . i wish we would spent money something would lasted . plastic seems cheaply made . voice buttons noises loud work well . stickers already started flake/peel off after 1 month . consider bigwheel	-1
my daughters little young this toy aren't into it yet . it very cute , lots sweet , tiny , realistic pieces , i see it lots play value somewhat educational . however , they made it so arms jointed order she hold baby . well , my daughter threw doll floor doctor office bottom half arm fell right off . even if it hadn't broken , you place arms just right or they look totally strange . this least favorite barbie my girls own . if it weren't arms , this would great toy . oh , back dresser open , so you can't really store small pieces it . not sure why they didn't just close it up make storage easier .	-1

i bought this toy my three-yr-old . she excited , but then one dolls fell apart , its pelvis broke legs fell out . super glue might fix it , but i'm not sure . i'd recommend it older child who wouldn't play it so roughly . but price , i wanted it last more than three days	-1

this item came mail my 4 year old son i very excited . i guess we should read description more carefully because i wasn't expecting so many tiny little pieces . we used ticky tack began tedious process sticking different sized stars such all over his room . we waited night see glowing celestial extravaganza . we kept light some time ' charge ' glow dark element then turned off light . what we found nothing close amazing . glow fairly dim only lasted very short period time . we even turned blacklight them all make them glow little brighter but , again , glow only lasted 10 -15 minutes . i ended up going back online buying glow dark paint star shaped sponge . we dabbed stars all over his ceiling . these glowing stars last most night our friends family think his room really cool	-1
this big my 8 year-old son christmas list , mainly because ben 10 game . he even wanted it more than any other game system . although i wasn't pay full price it , we got it 60% off main console . so we got it , paid extra controller , ben 10 game cd , couple ben 10 booster packs . unwrapping hit , excitement first play-through went over great my son . but i noticed right away it not going last . game itself contains graphics 10 years ago . game play difficult , both my son i would find it easy die , thus restarting game both us . you only play characters happens come your game or booster packs , that not many . ( want more ? fork out more $$$ more booster packs . ) finally , it takes so long load cd ( it load every level ) it must 1x drive . seriously slow . although my son still loves idea it not admitted he disappointed , he comment how slow it , how he wishes he other kids trade cards so he could get more . apparently we only suckers buy it around here . it hasn't played but maybe 4 times one month since christmas . if you notice it huge discount , it may worth it . but remember , you pay extra more cards . personally , i wish we'd bought used gamecube few cartridges . way more staying power than hyperscan	-1
when i bought this toy , i thought it soooo cool . but it really doesn't anything it supposed ! it just makes annoying crying whining noises not sound real . even if i tickle its tummy it just whines cries . not , i repeat , not buy this toy !!!!	-1
pros : very cool toy/model 12+ extra time their hands . cons : too many microscopic pieces count . very little room open play . requires extreme caution playing it because propeller other pieces fall apart slightest breath . not appropriate under 7 , least . first just let me say my son loves lego duplo blocks spends hours creating all kinds different designs them . he begging " big boy " legos , i turning him down , pointing out recommended ages box , ( knowing i would picking up infinite numbers tiny pieces throughout house next 18+ years ) . ages they put box seem purely arbitrary , based this particular toy . well-meaning relative decided bless him this present his 5th birthday . ( i seeking revenge soon they children . ) i spent next several hours constructing this nightmare , which itself defeats purpose building toy , my opinion . i no idea where they idea this appropriate 5-year-old , given it challenge me put this together . given amount microscopic pieces this toy , one wonder who designs these things if they children their own . so much it seems purely sadistic . when helicopter finally assembled ( i warned him one only time i putting it together ) , my son spent some time playing it , only constantly frustrated fact pieces constantly popping off , particularly propeller , this very gentle play . bottom line , if you child under 10 , they would probably many more hours play if you just bought lot inexpensively priced lego blocks ( various types ) they could make into all kinds different designs . these expensively priced city lines like really neat once built , but then it just like very fragile model . once you've spent time constructing it , you really don't want take it apart , so i'm not really sure why you would buy this over traditional model . i guess i miss point .	-1
excellent product ! i really appreciate option choose any 50 given mystery cases solve . after playing all 50 , you just start all over again ! fun , fun , fun game ! thanks	-1

story " hansel gretel " obviously warning against children talking strangers . but it also argument against eating someone house story represents triumph poor working class characters over witch her upper class pretensions . but my marxist leanings more groucho than karl , so i am not inclined think deep thoughts particular direction . original manuscript story siblings referred little brother little sister . brothers grimm chose hansel because it common name german fairy tales ( their equivalent john doe so speak ) picked gretel essentially same reason ( which makes her jane doe ) . then again , your ability identify twisted fairy tales version hansel mcfarlane toys probably going limited fact he trapped cage fattened up witch when she cooks him up main course . hansel comes 7 1/2 inches tall , although figure itself 3 inches tall stuck his cage . actually he 3 inches tall when you remove him cage , which point you discover he articulation his neck , biceps thighs . matter , you really cruel take away his boner . meanwhile , candy cane base chain pulley guides play well , but careful because this not toy ( well , okay , it toy , but it not kind toy ) . twisted fairy tales fourth series mcfarlane monsters , rest menagerie consists not only hasnel gretel , now redone german princess , but also red riding hood , peter peter pumpkin eater , little miss muffet . if you aware probable origins lot classic fairy tales then you already knew mother goose twisted sense humor . these figures mcfarlane toys certainly takes twisted next level . even if you not want entire set , there should one these figures captures jungian dark side tales we all raised once upon time most appeals you	-1

this , fact , anti-nerf hoop . whole point nerf hoop simplicity safety it . but this toy takes many batteries , some hoop some ... ball ! i mean , what point nerf ball weighs two pounds ? it breaks things and/or hurt if it thrown too hard . it lands loud " thump " i yell not throw it walls . what point basketball doesn't bounce ? it hits floor " thud " stays there . okay , it cool it lights up , but big deal unless you're playing after bedtime . i wish i bought one flimsy rings you suction-cup door , soft , squishy ball you could bounce off your sister head . i wish amazon sold them ! i wish nerf still made them ! this over-developed toy doesn't give my kid half pleasure it could . ( don't get me started how hard you push turn light ball , or what pain it open battey compartment .	-1

i recently purchased this jeep my two daughters , ages 5 2 , they both love it ! it perfect first ride-on toy them . speed setting slow enough ( 2.5 mph ) so they learn how drive vehicle safely , there faster setting ( 5 mph ) increase speed once they get accustomed vehicle . parent , i very pleased ease assembly . like most parents , i don't like spend great deal time putting my childrens ' toys together . happily , i able assemble jeep 90 minutes . instructions very detailed illustrations clear easy follow . pieces fit together neatly everything slides correctly into its proper slo t.t he jeep loaded fun accessories . there working radio clock plays cd , there colorful decals really brighten jeep up . jeep stops automatically once child lifts their feet off accellorator pedal ( nice safety feature ) . only disadvantage ( its slight one ) length time it requires charge battery . initial charge requires 18 hours plug-in time , each successive charge requires 14 hours . owner manual suggests charging battery after each use , but i've found unnecessary . it driven approximately 20 hours before charge required . i recommend this jeep very highly . construction durable assembly quick easy . two children ride same time , so it won't long before your children driving off their own fun adventures	1

these blocks great fun . each block something interesting inside it . our house these played boys pretty roughly times . windows see inside still clear not one these blocks broken . so i would say they sturdy hold up well normal play . this set my particular favorite transportation set . animals very cute . ends each block texture . within each block something interesting . many blocks activity associated it- push button make noise , twist knob make something turn around etc . one thing i would warn these blocks not stack well , particularly tall towers . so if you thinking buying these tower building , i'd consider different set blocks . otherwise , these excellent toys . they provide basis communication vocubulary building your child . they sturdy encourage language , eye hand coordination so . if you enjoy toys fairly quiet , more than push button make noise , foster independent creative play exploration world this excellent toy . enjoy .	1

i bit nervous what this toy would bring given other reviews , but since my 3-year old this top his list christmas , it must . it fairly easy assemble , although pieces fall apart if you try pick it up move it . mat 4 feet long made thick , flexible vinyl . it not painted garbage bag one review indicates . my pins not come off , ball return works well . maybe these things improved since those reviews . when i first set it up , ball return not working , but since christmas day it suddenly started working hasn't broken since then . only minor disappointment balls don't fingerholes them like picture shows . scoring unit works well . it set 1 or 2 players . if you miss , you manually push " missed ball " button . it keeps score based six pins ( there 6 this game , not 10 ) . final frame ( frame 6 ) if you get strike , you get 12 points ; if you get spare you get 9 . you don't get bowl " extra " balls final frame . therefore , scoring bit weird , max score 102 . otherwise , it scores like regular bowling . tubes sides attach mat velcro . they don't quite match up perfectly , but good enough hold them place . my 3 5 year old love game operate it themselves . i see how kids few years older would find it boring given fairly small size shortened gameplay ( ie 6 frames/6 pins ) . also , one reviewer notes , hitting head pin any speed almost always gets strike , but even , i've only gotten 1 perfect game . overall , great fun . found sale 40 dollars . i'd say worth if your kid really into play bowling . improvements would more sturdy construction , a/c adapter	-1

i loved it when i purchased it online it met every expections i this slide . great slide just great design but when slide upright postion locked it very unstable unsafe . it easily knoked over even infant or it just easily tip over when child tries climb it or slide it . you physically hold both carrots your hands keep it stable while child trying play . just one oversight incidence parents , child get hurt . since , i like product otherwise , i am trying figure out way mount legs ground before i allow this used . please not buy this unless you way mount base ground somehow .	-1
santa brought this item my daughter chrismas she so excited get it . she wanted it open soon she recieved it . when we finally got it open everything all set up read instructions nothing it said it worked . hair not change color eyeshadow didn't come off . we tried even using ice cubes instead little curling iron thing came it . still no luck . my daughter still plays it but it not her favorite toy	-1

i like swingset fairly well , my daughter seems like it too . it seems very sturdy , well made . my first impression it after i get it all put together " man this small " . slide very little . but price compared others , should somewhat expected . although swingset not difficult put together , instructions not super clear ( you go little tikes website view them ) . also , half plastic covers go over bolts broke while putting them , i very careful them . my biggest problem swingset missing 3 4 pivot joint swing hangers . i called little tikes several times , but they always either closed or lunch . when i finally get through , i would get voicemail told me redial number press different option . i finally get person phone after 12 attempts , told parts i need backorder because swingset so new . so , sum up my experience this set , here my pros cons : pros : sturdy , clean nice looking , fun my two year old , not time consuming put together other sets . cons : instructions vague pictures , no words . pictures screws bolts not actual size ( makes it harder tell if you using right hardware ) , missing parts , replacement parts backorder , very small , customer service difficult get touch . if i it all over , i might would buy this swingset again . even though it small , it still serves its purpose , my daughter loves it	-1

my four year old absolutely enthralled this toy , his 4 month old sister . i bought wand monkey , which i think cutest glo toys , my kid spends huge amount time changing colors monkey across room . if you get this toy around $15.00 , i'd highly recommend it . monkey really soft , but beware getting monkey hair caught velcro ( where toy opens house electrical innards . ) once hair gets caught , velcro doesn't want work very well	1
this great overnight bed grandma grandpa house . my son 2 years old absolutely loves his elmo bed ( well , honest , he loves all things elmo ) . it said it took sheets but it not work fitted sheet . we just put blanket down bottom then my son blanket over him . this bed comes very archaeic foot pump inflate . first time we tried this we not taken our air compressor it took me 45 minutes inflate . next time we portable air compressor it went up 5 minutes . it takes little deflate it also . we took long route first time pinching open valves ( they protected valves so you pinch them take air out ) . second time we took nozzle foot pump , pushed it into valve inflation viola ..... we then able lay bed oursleves deflate . you never get all air out either so we purchased small plastic bin lid storage . over all very good investment though	-1
we gave this our son his second birthday he really enjoys playing it . i guess it only good whatever accessories you get go it - we some plastic dishes some small utensils , it keeps him very busy while i am working kitchen . mostly he puts things oven , takes bowl sink out puts things way , bangs his spatula , etc . it well-made lot play value little space it takes up	1

i purchased both pooh dora dolls my daughter . both dolls her name , but dora only one options pronounciation . her name avery , pronounced " av-ree " pooh only say " a-ver-ee " also when he says her name , his voice drops tone sounds very out place . i also trouble dolls losing time . when i bought dolls , i under impression they able many games , songs , stories all once . ( box says over 100 ) . auctuality , doll only three activities once so you choose song , story , game lists . currently i choosing one activity each list which means i get my computer every week or so change settings so my daughter different thing listen . box should say they over 100 games , stories , games , phrases , just not all once . my daughter enjoys dolls , but me they very aggrevating . my last thought if you purchase doll , sure set daily schedule little ahead your child . i her breakfast schedule set 8am , but mornings when she sleeping little , pooh dora woke her up announcing breakfast . i now it set 9am even though she already up running then	-1

this stuff amazing . it advertised what price ! you get 10 times much this stuff you one tub floam same price . i never buy floam again ! i would buy more this stuff give it gifts ! even older kids grab this stuff start sculpting away . it claims never dry out . we've it 2-3 weeks now it isn't any different than day it came amazon . shipping only few days , even standard price . we really enjoyed this product . drawbacks ? you can't quite make ' detailed ' sculpture ' it .. texture kind like rice crispie treats .. colors eventually end up mixed , no matter how hard you try . although if you wanted give your teenager challenge , them separate colours , it .. !! i would highly recommend this product . even kids sensory issues may able handle this . you can't beat price , buy few sets give it gifts . it favourite . it doesn't stick anything but itself ! no stains , no mess ! no real clean up ! two thumbs up	-1
got this my 11 13 yr old daughters like show . we also got dvd version game . handheld version actually more fun then dvd game because selecting cases painfully slow dvd game . display little hard see if it not bright room , but it simple fun . game shuts itself off if you put it down don't turn it off . only delay when it calculates bankers offer after each round , but otherwise it moves good pace . good game some mindless fun you take anywhere you	1

i saw this game advertised winning ' major fun award ' you bet your bottom dollar , this game major fun . you cannot help but fun playing catch 22 . name suggests , you need catch 22 chips exit game board win . but , also name suggests , you might find yourself ' catch 22 ' situation . example , once you win alot chips , everybody else going try catch you steal your chips . or , player might land switch places square when you thought you home free , you forced switch places opponent . strategy part you ' blocker cubes ' try clear path yourself or indeed block opponents path . but careful , you only five cubes once you use them up , you must land square which allows you collect blocker cube board . this simply fantastic game . it fast moving heart stopping . i cannot tell you how many times someone verge winning heart beat , all their chips stolen . really , you should definitely try this game , i highly recommend it if you into fun	1

watching this set take shape probably best part assembling process , outcome great-looking fighter craft . pieces you " click " into place ( sometimes ) make assembly tedious ; it ( sometimes ) hard tell what right number clicks ( i.e. clone scout walker ) . but everything works perfectly here . reason i say watching it come together best because tri-fighter comes tri-assembly , meaning you doing same thing per step , basically , three times ( x3 ) . some people may not bothered this , while others may look more variety step step . nevertheless , it not big problem . buzz-saw droid tri-fighter lone minifig , if you even want call it minifig . only part his body represents true-to-form minifig legs ; rest him just normal lego pieces . i small problem this ( you may not ) because minifigs , me , big part what makes or breaks lego set . but whatever case may , buzz-saw droid rather unique figure , he essentially hidden ship center anyway ( getting him stand up right bit monotonous too ) . putting this 148-piece set together took little over half-hour . i found outstretched beams , this set took up lot space ; i started corner my table wound up clear most space off make room . i said , clicking beams into place very easy , while end-pieces join three efficient you'd expect lego . also , this set fair number small stickers you must apply , whether or not persuades or dissuades you .... so besides lack true minifig number steps times three , tri-fighter great lego set . i highly recommend this , one cheaper episode iii sets one more attractive ones . two shades blue elevated durability -- it noted you drop this high levels not fix thing ; , within reason , true -- make tri-fighter definite steal star wars lego line . give this set " tri " , you shouldn't disappointed	-1
our two half year-old received bug eyed buddies his first kid k'nex toy holidays last year . first thing he create " lollypop " out long rod , circular piece , eye . he so proud himself quickly made one my husband . i excited he could figure out how build them so quickly . over next six months , he building more elaborate structures telling stories them . we've added his kid k'nex collection footed friends , garbage truck gus , lion mouse story pal . he loves them all . bug eyed buddies great beginner set because it enough pieces creative but doesn't cost too much	1

you see my other reviews building toys big hit our home . my boys love legos but they just not into them 24-7 like other lego lovers . so we variety different types . zoobs one well-played sets our home . i use building sets occupy hands minds while eyes glued television . i really dislike idle staring television . so , my solution not take television away , but encourage play while boys shows . over years , my boys become bored " just watching " television rarely ever found just watching . anytime television ourhome , boys sitting playing too . zoobs usually floor arew typically first choice . bright colorful plastic " ball socket " type joints enable child create pose-able articulated figures . i also used these pattern making recognition , well math manipulatives helping boys their homework . 75 not nearly enough though . you need couple sets . ebay great source scoring add ons this set less . we even bring zoobs reataurants us occupy boys while we waiting our food come . ziploc bag works great transporting enough keep family occupied . fine building toy encourages imaginative play ! rosemary bertinelli	1

price , i quite disappointed bed we received . hardware not properly attach bed sides ends , beasue bolt holes installed incorrectly . decorative wheels flimsy , good pull come off not reattachable . photo gave me impression car would made smooth material resemble " real " car , but instead it constructed " pebbled " plastic common most little tikes outdoor toys . but my son seen it , i am not willing send it back - i've enough aggravation one day ! but you , dear reader -- if you shopping bed your little boy , i'd recommend looking elsewhere	-1
we bought this after using swim school deluxe tot trainer pants aqua leisure . its awesome allows both us enjoy water , our son just cruises around pool this vest . it not coast guard approved so you cannot use it city or ymca pools . he lessons now but i feel more comfortable him vest while we pool together , since our condo doesn't life guards . if you want more than 3 inches away while your child still learning swim , then this must .	1

i love it comes matching food containers , thermos , separate storage area front . i also love idea thermos design pop-up built-in staw . my son really enjoyed whole package beginning . however , functionality thermos rests flimsy tab plastic flip-open top . ours broke pretty quicky now it won't close all . it rendered useless travel . we've only owned it few months already images badly scratched worn . while i give them points great design ideas , lack durability simply unacceptable . i would not buy one like this again	-1
friend gave me this game birthday present , i'm addicted ! although i love scrabble , i hate playing my husband because he takes so long form words . seven minutes game , wordigo gives players enough time form great words , but not so much time game drags . i also like how i set myself up form high scoring words . different playing boards make very competitive games players differnt skill levels . highly recommended	-1

i bought this my daughter who 2 1/2 . she probably little young it , but reason i got it her because she seems very interested violin . i older daughter , age 10 , who plays violin when she plays , my younger daughter pretends playing " air violin " . since she got this pretty pink violin , she holds it up under her chin pretends play way . she loves princess music very intent what she doing . it too adorable . i afraid bow would become weapon , but she hasn't steered way all . i think she respects instrument . all honesty , violin probably heavier than real violin little cinderella fallen off . i attached it back easily enough . i'm sure when my daughter just bit older we may start " real " violin lessons , but now this perfect .	-1

we grandson marriage , it seems though it long time since we purchased baby toys . when we started looking toys , our first choice experience our children fisher-price . selection toys their sophistication changed lot couple decades since we last bought baby toys . this toy blast . every time you push pad center stable you hear horse whinny . feeding trough side barn makes slurp noise . you get several horses , cart , couple fence pieces , corral piece , bale hay . my only objection it appears there no way connect two fences corral piece one side barn other , so they pretty much connected photograph shows . i guess horses intended run away . i admit i really enjoy horse whinny . our one year old grandson also thought it blast , gets smiles whenever he hears it . he still working exactly how make whinny noise , but he likes it . other hand , whinny drives my wife nuts . we impressed this first purchase little people fisher-price toy plan buy more .	1

puerto rico take you 30 minutes explain it someone . it complex . sure there much more complex games out there , but this probably one most complex popular eurogames market . it this reason it only gets 4 stars . this one greats . if you want game almost no luck tons strategy decent player interaction , look no further . tons options every turn . this slow game bit . great game mechanics everyone selected role affect everyone . this game gets better more you play it same people because everyone begins understand strategy last round first game . bottom line : it better than settlers ? less player interaction , more strategy , slower placed , less luck . add gamers like it ? no way . non strategy gamers like it ? no way . eurogamers like it ? they love it .	1

i happen love webkinz . there lot technical problems but not webkinz side . it depends type computer you . you must computer handle java script ( most but some older computer can't comprehend it ) . sometimes if you trying access sit through aol you may not able because aol hard time handling java script well . i normally access it through internet explorer no trouble all . site lot fun . there numerous games ranging puzzles cards basbeall . there secret recipes children make using there stove . children get express themselves decorating their room pet . you go shopping go hunting gems . there so much it never gets old . i highly suggest buything this someone who knows how use computer . i would not suggest this gift 5 year old but someone around ages 9-13 because site slightly hard navigate ( you get used it ) games challenging .	-1
tons stuff come this set , super price : thomas , cargo train cargo piece , tree , sir topham hat figure , two signs , 3 section bridge , water tower , tracks form figure 8 . if you add up price red water tower , one train attached cargo train , bridge , several track sets accessories , you would price 50-75% more than cost this excellent thomas starter set . this set even worth it if you already other pieces line . my son wanted water tower , i figured why pay price single one , when few dollars more , you get 2 trains , bridge , signs , figure , tree , tons track . while some larger thomas sets don't really save you cash very pricey , this one probably best value out there . one other note , differences red yellow tower not just color . red one , sold itself , train track piece attached it one unit . yellow one this set not track attached , but comes two little magnets front , there one straight track piece two magnets side , so you make it stay put . it may take few minutes when you disassemble it , find right track piece magnet , if you lot track like we , it take several minutes !! way , it better than red one , you place it where you want , even around curve , just using it alone . downside , if you lose magnetic piece track , you won't get it attach anything anymore	1

you play this game regular deck cards . i heard it called " oh hell " , " oh heck " , " up down river " , but its all same thing . you start dealing one card everyone . you go around circle bid either 1 or 0 ( since there only one trick ) . you play trick like any other trick-based game , but you don't play win trick . only restriction you must follow suit . if you get your bid ( 0 valid bid ) , you get 10 points + 1 point each trick you won . if you don't get your bid , you get 1 point every trick well . you deal 2 cards second round , 3 third , etc . until you deal out all cards or many possible number people you playing . you introduce trump flipping top card remaining deck over once you deal . why pay ten bucks this deck when it just regular deck different rules box	-1
we purchased this our boys - ages 5 7 christmas because they really love lego products we got 500 piece set so our four children , ages 5 , 7 , 9 11 could enjoy it together ... once they got started - they something it everyday ! instruction books great visual tool but kids tried lots things their own well . only item i wish different case - it broke first day so we put everything heavy duty plastic bin so it could handle traveling one room	1

i play scrabble all time , but more i play , fewer people i want play . we either all know same two letter " scrabble words " or all words use " " but not " u " , or only one us it extremely mismatched . enter upwards . adding dimension game ( ie , you add letters top other letters ) , you not only change " should " " could " but you change " should " " shield " or even something further afield like " tasted . " course , trick make all adjacent words make sense , too . it takes different strategy play upwards than it takes play scrabble . there so many variations what you seven letters , you aren't stuck playing same words over over . you also not encumbered things like triple word score . i play this adults children it always challenge . i highly recommend it anyone over 7 .	1
i really like it . it makes nature sounds train sounds . it really adds atmosphere train set	-1
this very fun game . it little bit learning curve , but after 30 minutes you really get hang it then you enjoy it . board tiles resource cards beautifully designed , random element board makes game different every time . definitely worth money	1
my daughter received this game some years ago . we immediately loved it still play it whenever we visit her . ( she now her 20s ! ) i bought it my nieces ( 12 , 16 17 ) this christmas , they ( their parents ) love it , too . you move like pictionary ; you win square before you move ahead . different colored squares represent different catagories songs . get your team guess song title you hum , whistle , sing " la-la-la " or charades . it real hoot ... there nothing funnier than watching " singer " opposing team realize song he thought he could hum so well his team total mystery them . ( unless it his panicked , last second switch charades hopes victory . ) younger kids might not familiar some catagories or titles ; we either let them go card where they recognize one , or make separate list songs they know choose . if we only 3 people ( not enough people teams ) , we just take turns rolling catagory humming . if someone guesses song , hummer guesser each get point , whoever gets 25 points first wins . this great family or party game . sometimes everyone laughing so much you not only can't hear hummer , hummer can't even hum ! we really recommend it .	1

ghost rider , demon who inhabits johnny blaze ( others also called ghost rider , but this one johnny ) , hellfire filled demon who takes vengeance evil doers . he flaming skeleton wearing leather riding flaming motorcycle . only ghost rider ( gr ) could pull this look off . figure based movie version but they wisely not really alter gr basic design , he'll fit right your marvel legends icons line . detail sculpting his leather outfit , including different textures his various layers closing top notch . zippers his jacket spikes his gloves look great . his skull excellent flames top nice orange yellow clear plastic look really good . while missing couple points articulation i might liked see , most notably any type cut his upper arms allow them turn , what here really well there still plenty it . joints move smoothly tight enough stay put once posed . he stands great his own looks awesome his flaming demon motor cycle . one his accessories nice long chain spike end he looks great wielding it . but main event his bike which might well its own figure . wheels skull handlebar eye hole covered billowing flame . bike itself looks skeletally organic mechanical same time covered detail . this thing super huge takes up lot room . put gr there swinging his chain this one eye popping figure . this five star all around .	1

dress featured this particular set shows girl flowing blue pink gown ... you get blue pink gown , but it not what pictured box . it sort looks like it , but it flimsier , straight version one pictured . also , my daughter just turned 4 . she petite side , around 32 lbs . this dress just fits her . hope this info helps	-1

i just recently purchased red variant this figure excited pleased both nice looking action figure well piece apocalypse . but i setting him up , trying move his leg it just snapped off hip joint . hence 2 star durability rating . i never this problem legends line before , very disappointed , especially since it variant figure . some superglue fixed problem , but cost some articulation . he my shelf now looks great , but if you're giving toy younger children , cautious . like i said i never any problems like this marvel legends figure before , so hopefully it just fluke . figure still well worth getting , fact i am going pick up green version sometime near future	-1

this marble maze looks so fun cute . however , it actually useless incredibly frustrating . pieces don't fit together well tend fall over when you look them -- much less when you try roll marble through them . also , configurations pictured box don't work all . either our giraffe missing critical piece , or wood planks supposed magically levitate . ugh , i'm returning this immediately	-1

i skeptical this one .. i learned cheaper toy .. less my baby likes it . though he absolutely adores this floor mat . i got it him when he 2 months old . he only 4 months old now but can't get enough it . little octopus make sound when it spins .. but he can't reach it yet . though its hilarious watch him try ! he gets so frustrated beats up other toys , but then smiles end when i go spin it him . i give this 5 stars because floormat itself . i would give it 4 stars but based my baby all babies different . only problems we it , which would make it 4 stars would fact aside octopus there no other sounds , there no lights . my baby loves sounds lights . so if you one those , expect yours not want play long mat beginning stages . ours plays 20-30 minutes , then he wants moved his swing so he look mirror hear music . but you get really good tummy time this it keeps them entertained laying out straight ( instead scrunched up swing so often ) so you get few things around house . oh we noticed our baby play it longer , if we go over play him every once awhile . helping him reach toys , making octopus spin , etc . then we get 20 minutes whatever . so all all ... its great product ... just warned little mirror one fish .. isn't mirror . its one those flashy material looking things baby can't see his reflection it .. cause i cant even see mine it . if toys hanging low your baby , you flip them over top bar once they hang higher , or move baby mat bit .	1

i found this lego set incredibly easy put together if following directions closely . my son only 5 ( just turned ) , so helped where he could -- but there some insanely small pieces this set ! i recommend dumping bags pieces large mixing bowl , then rummaging what you need you assemble ... we close call heating vent , so switched mixing bowl method lego management . now we assembly , which great fun high quality togetherness , my son cloud 9 his bikini bottom set ! he played it hours kitchen table , no waning interest sight . we made pretend newspaper gary sleep , now my little guy acts out all sorts sb scenarios . sb bed so cool , jellyfish aquarium , basketball hoop , patrick rock ... there so many neat little features . patrick swivel tv ! only two things slightly annoy me 1 ) eyebrow squidward tiki house falls off easily ( no big deal ) , 2)sb bedpost falls apart easily ( also no big ) . finished houses smaller than i expected , but doesn't detract enjoyment all . please check lego website suggested retail price decide what you want pay . price quoted amazon third party vendor astronomical -- i got mine toys us paid msrp -- much less than amazon current price . i find it worth every penny am blast listening my son changing his voice all characters monotoning " 70 hours later ... " voice-over guy deadpan . this , so far , our favorite christmas gift . few days we'll put together buildabob , i'm definitely going buy krusty krab set	1

we bought this playhouse our daughter 2nd b-day . first all , let me say it beautiful playhouse ! door-bell doesn't ring loudly play phone rings same way . it very easy build , but it took two people , holding purposes . front porch very roomy but you enter into house it very small inside , 30 1/2 wide 41 1/2 long !!! overall , house quite large appearing you view outside . inside little . i really can't see two children able play house part without knocking into each other . i really liked porch idea but i just didn't realize it took away sooo much inside house section . i really like step2 we several their products but this one go back . sorry step2 !	1
this day age people forget it not what your children watch or play it what parents teach them . these toys fun children play . if you worried what your kids doing than keep eye them . talk them . spend quality time them . this what influences our children most . make sure active part their life . join pta , take part school activities . talk your children . i love my daughter if i am involved her life go church her sundays then this most important thing . why people trying put there opinions other people instead putting their opinions upon their children . quite cunundrum i know . when we stop concerning ourselves what other people doing thinking world better place . our children thoughts their own . bratz dolls no threat our society , just books burned because society problem it	1

overall , i really like this set . cloth chair covers tablecloth look so real . smaller pieces such food molded onto trays so not get lost which i also like . this set so much more detail than any previous dining rooms made fisher price too . although i like all their dining rooms , this one so much more up date looks so much more authentic than others . i would like see four chairs instead just two . if you two children , they don't anywhere sit unless you use tall chairs snack bar twin time dollhouse . they aren't same size , but they seem blend pretty well except height . this only reason i gave 4 stars instead 5	1
i got this my daughter when she 10 it one her favorite games ever since . it even fun whole family ( 13 15 year old even like it ) . good game	1

i got hovercraft my son 5th birthday , even though it recommended 8 over . it some limitations but all those described box , except battery life which really doesn't last long ( 20 minutes ) . he hasn't disappointed it when it runs out power . instructions outside box clearly say it should used ' smooth ' pavement ' calm ' water skirt should periodically checked ( it slip places times but it easy put back ) . if you don't proper conditions , i would avoid urge buy it because it just frustrate you . it little hard steer because you anticipate turn early since air ' hover ' keeps it going longer direction it already headed ( may where 8+ age group figure out ) . we many remote control toys lots disappointed us , but this one pretty good long you use it instructed don't expect things it not meant	1

created makers uno , skip bo great " lets play " feeling . it combines skill , strategy , some cases , lot luck . players try first use up all cards their stock pile playing them building piles numerical sequence , 1 through 12 . end your turn though , you must discard card one your own discard piles ( max four ) . here where you must use all your skills strategy since you able use only card top each pile combination your hand cards deplete your stock pile . cool , huh ? well it gets better ! skip bo cards act wild cards add excitement play . use them correctly you could making all these combinations while your opponents sit there watching your stock pile get smaller smaller wondering your iq must over 140 . nothing beats look their faces you turn over your last stock pile card discover it skip bo card . it like winning texas hold-em river card . ouch ! you awesome fun playing this game . even tough it game numbers ; you not sit quietly while players think . au contraire , talking , laughing making jokes just part fun . what not love this game ? deluxe edition : this edition very nice score pad , card tray game board reserved spaces designed four building piles discard piles up four players . since skip bo played up six players deluxe edition board falls little short . i believe this edition still worth buying . it perfect up four players very useful keeping place building piles if played more . great game , great edition , extremely educational lots lots fun . worthy greatest games ever made award . fun !	1

i purchased anakin skywalker model couple months ago very pleased item . hilt well-detailed , maybe too well detailed , proper weight make it feel like real thing . blade very bright , sounds crisp loud . only problem i saber activation switch : it located right center hilt gets way very easily . you hold saber just right avoid bulbous switch . also , it very easy accidently turn it off while you're swinging it ( very annoying ) . still , i loved it anyway you learn handle it better almost right away . i loved anakin model so much , i just get one : it toss up mace windu model or darth vader model . i chose dark side . when it arrived ups today , i immediately wanted grab some aa batteries compare two sabers . vader model just bright anakin ( it red , not pinkish ) but noticeably lighter weight . also , digital sound effects different than anakin model ( that good ) , but vader saber not loud , it also takes moment longer power up power down . it should also noted blue anakin model 4 different clashing sounds ..... red vader model only one . again , activation switch right middle hilt which makes it awkward handle first , but you learn cope it . i guess it makes them more " authentic " . however , actual lightsaber props used dramatic fight sequences not activation switches middle hilts ( it would difficult coreograph fight scene those switches way , so they removed give actors nice , smooth surfaces ..... you wouldn't able see switches since their hands covering up most hilts anyway ) . all all , i am very pleased vader model well . i recommend filming yourself pitch-black area then watch it your tv . it looks cool ! they worth price ? my opinion ..... yes , but careful them . they not toys . one more thing : few people reviewing these items say sabers louder when they chash eachother ..... not true . you're simply hearing two clashing sounds once which makes it seem louder . sabers don't any sensors know specifically when saber smacks it anyway . strike strike . next step ..... mace windu saber !	1

whole ty series very appealing variety reasons . example , animals well-designed invariably cute . they also just right size small children they make good little presents adults who like stuffed animals , but don't want lot big bulky ones lying around . other words , they make nice romantic gifts christmas , valentine day , etc . big plus this line plush toys incredible softness . they very cuddly they also seem stand up well . if you giving one these small child , it won't fall apart overnight nap material should stay good shape while . i received number these gift over years although i don't keep all them lying around , they bring back pleasant memories . i also given several gifts i never come across anyone who disappointed . while these stuffed animals expensive size what they . i feel they good value money . while you get less expensive products , i think you find they don't measure up ty line	1
my kids got this present , we assembled it , stuck batteries , poured some midnight moo chocolate syrup , sat back watch fountain . screw turned , but nothing happened . then i looked it little more closely . fountain mechanism archimedian screw , it seemed me like screw turning backwards . after some experimentation , i now figured out what went wrong . there big orange flower-pot shaped thing containing motor sitting top yellow base containing batteries . orange piece completely symmetric , it fit yellow base equally well either forwards or backwards ( there almost invisible arrow that supposed tell you which way it goes ) . if you put it backwards , positive negative terminals batteries connected wrong wires motor , screw turns wrong way , fountain doesn't work . instructions don't help much . trouble shooting tips say " make sure it assembled correctly . " they don't say " make sure arrows yellow orange pieces aligned , because it doesn't work if they're not . " i haven't tried it thick chocolate , but judging other comments , it seems like motor too weak it work chocolate thick enough worth dipping . it clearly pretty cheaply made . but it should work . if it doesn't , put orange piece other way around .	-1

i hard time finding dora doll wasn't electronic . i so happy find dress-up dora . she tall sturdy , her outfits easy small hands take off . under her clothes she pink bathing suit painted so she never nude . my 3 year old daughter got this toy christmas it one her favorite toys . because she doesn't prerecorded electronic sayings , my daughter use her imagination play this toy . however , less than two months later , dora hair so severely matted it beyond repair . my children not play roughly this toy - only time her hair slightly touseled when they removing clothes or putting new ones . dora hair currently sticking straight out all directions clumping up all over place . when hair first started getting matted , we brushed it all out , but less than 24 hours later it worse than it before we'd brushed it ! if your children not upset messy hair ( mine aren't ) , it still worthwhile toy reasons i gave above . my children still play her every day , enjoy changing her clothing .	1
my daughter decided she big enough she didn't need night light anymore ( she almost 7 ) , but little nervous it same time . she gotten this bear christmas , sleeps it , so she decided try no night light put bear her dresser where she could see it . she sleeps wand under her pillow , if she wakes up middle night , nervous , she pulls out wand turns bear . it worked like charm	1

after reading several reviews big wheel , i almost left this purchase dust . who wants stuck box rocks some reviews suggested ? however , i am pleased say this excellent purchase our 4 year old little boy . night our big wheel arrived , i insisted we assemble it ... just case our box missing/broken parts or pieces didn't fit together right ... even though we weren't giving this our son several more days . lucky us , we found instructions easy follow , all parts accounted , everything went together quickly easily . we spent probably 30 minutes all ... including applying stickers . not bad considering all experiences i read . best news our son actually able ride while ! even though he tall ( 43 " ) his age , he still needed seat sit closest handle bars so his feet could reach pedals . he able adjust it two more times !! now we see how much wear tear big wheel take ! already it made quite few trips down very rough rocky sidewalk . i'm certain this big wheel going get good work out often ! i am quite pleased this purchase , glad i not deterred completely experiences others .	1
i concerned when package arrived , there four inch tear box empty round hole , suggesting me something else might supposed included . so i put item together , it didn't work . it turns out , when batteries replaced , it one my grandson favorite toys this season . i am sure he would give it five star rating	1
we bought this our youngest daughter , then age 18 months . now age 4 , she still likes play slide . we're glad we went larger 2-step slide instead one smaller one-steps slides . smaller slide would ended up yard sale now . this our first experience chicco product , overall , i'd say we've pleased . except locking mechanism , construction high quality very durable . locking mechanism ( which supposed keep slide folding up itself ) fell apart within just few weeks pounded my rambunctious little girl . this hasn't problem , however , because wide stance slide prevents it folding up itself anyway . when it comes " cute factor , " this slide wins hands-down over all others . however , that adult perspective . our daughter couldn't care less what it shaped like or what color it . she would play it regardless these factors . one other reviewer cautioned letting children play slide unsupervised . i'd say that true , but would apply * any * slide not just this one . our daughter found all sorts creative uses this toy not envisioned manufacturer . she loves jump off top it use it ladder get top her chest drawers . it not toy faint heart -- i'm talking parents	1
all my children enjoyed mighty minds . now child #3 , we missing some tiles so i am ordering " super " so i more tiles different cards . great learning toy	1

grandma bought this my 2 year old daughter hope it would relieve me washing crayon off walls everything else . concept great , however my daughter tries use color wonder markers everything else then she can't get cap back so i find them laying around un-capped . also , i don't think she likes fact markers only work inside lines there slight delay time you color when color appears . we've also tried finger paints my daughter ended up dipping color wonder markers into finger paints - which didn't work so well . i think plain color wonder paper might better than coloring book style pages . i also think it geared toward older child . i think we sticking regular coloring books washable crayons while longer	1
i read reviews others also my sister husband into star wars big time ! i looked his sabor collection directions plainly state .

my son loves these toys ! i purchased them target clearance one dollar 90 some odd cents . what deal ! i went several target stores area found different pieces no more than three dollars . my son 2 � great dexterity start but these taught him even more skills using screw drivers , wrenches other little tools included set . my concern he could possibly fall metal tools hurt himself but now he careful them . i am also not overly pleased play sets but trucks themselves lots fun . play sets seem little cheap but die cast trucks worth money , so me makes up lack imagination designers part . he sit play them hours end , mixing matching different parts different trucks . this purchase well worth money , i just wish i would noticed them before now . this would make great gift toddlers .	1

my 17 month-old grandson immediately fell love pound ball when he opened present after short lesson holding hammer went right performing toy said he would . he no trouble pounding balls through after some iterations , even put colored balls right holes before incessantly pounding them . needless say , it his favorite toy much chagrin my daughter son-in-law . i would highly recommend this toy .	1
i really like this game too . other reviews tell how game works so i'll focus why i liked it . my 12 year old daughter received it christmas gift . we played game hour my daughter wanted keep playing asked when we could play it again so i know she liked it . i found comments each us made some wishes helped us get know each other better - we get so wrapped up everyday life it difficult really communicate . there 4 categories wish cards ( experiences , treats treasures , accomplishments family fun ) . some wishes very " girly girl " ironically her dad seemed end up lot those wishes . so , after we played it first time daughter separated those wishes out so rest wishes would more appropriate her dad . my daughter plans use girly girl wish cards when she plays it her girlfriends .	1
i bought this my daughters birthday when we got it , it piece junk buttons worked one day then next day when you tried push cerain button it would give you different noise or it would not work all , things hard push you really push hard them , this toy not worth it not even amount they asking honest i think it worth fifty cents , i am very disapointed it .	-1

now that what i'm talking ! this x-wing , second ( so far ) three lego produced minifigure scale , far superior one . it represents moment mid-episode when luke swamp planet learning jedi master all jedi , yoda . you get yoda figure , which somewhat rare , exclusive dagobah luke , r2 . sweet ! luke figure pretty neat , you choose top him off his flight helmet or hair . there lightsaber included , which i only assume yoda , because it green . ( luke saber blue this point saga . ) some reason you don't get blue luke saber , i no idea why , but green one near little storage compartment underneath yoda bed ! bed contained within neato yoda hut , which not included latest x-wing set , thus making this one far superior . you even get backback luke carry yoda around while he training , just like film . yoda hut composed quite few tan , brown , green pieces . it completely hinged , so you open it up , roof all , get inside . building it bit chore , it kept falling apart until it made more stable later steps . however , i think patient child able handle it . inside house , there bed , stove , some other trinkets . totally cool . it really increases parts count this se t.t he x-wing fighter itself one finest lego made . i guess that why it completely unchanged recent reissue . if it ain't broke ... mechanism used raise lower wings controlled dial back ship . it effective doesn't slip around . wings nicely hold " open " or " closed " position quite easily , two newer white elastic bands keep tension it . rest ship nicely detailed , lots red markings , some headlights , guns , even few green vines simulate moment when luke crashes it swamp ! how cool ? there storage compartment luke helmet underneath , control stick cockpit , slot r2 . i found this one fun build . lot design repeated later arc-170 starfighter model , so if you haven't built one those yet , this one total treat . lock s-foils attack position , fun	1

barn really cute tall older kids . however , it not " pop " up , there three rods you put out when putting it up down . also , once put together , it stood crooked , so it would not stay up . if you got it just right , it would remain standing , until one kids went into it . i am talking 19 month old , not 12 year old crashing it . needless say , we sent it back look something better . oh , send it back via amazon . company called me back after full week , wanted $15 included returned tent ( shipping you ) . things make you say hmmmmmm	-1

this game seems silly childish first glance but actually much more fun challenging than you would think ... players any age . setup very simple . each person gets animal figure hides it little plastic barn front them . your animal only revealed beginning game hidden rest time . then deck animal cards dealt out completely all players . gameplay very similar multiplayer version slap jack . you flip cards down table one time , when picture your card matches person , you blurt out sound person hidden animal . this where misconception simplicity game starts . it not easy it seems . multiple players , you must remember everyone animal . not only , but you keep your eyes all other animal cards flipped down ... so example , you cow your barn , you match pair frogs person who snake their barn . then your mind begins scramble sorting through all different information very quickly . faster game goes more fun it . whomever loses " blurting " match , then picks up all their cards , well all dropped cards winner . first drop all their cards wins . game actually gets more more complicated each passing game . seeing person who mouse last game may sheep next pig one after . overall game becomes fun time people laughing blurting out random noises ... often times just nonsensical jibberish you scramble make right noise firs t.t his game very versatile . friend mine teacher got set her class rainy days . but we also realized this could great game small children teach animal sounds ... well older children exercise foreign language class	1

general , i love geotrax trains , rate them 5 stars , overall . but this roundhouse major disappointment . some details listed review - but reviewer didn't think problems such big deal ... i . major problems : - they didn't make modules interchangeable other tracks . this means it not nearly versatile other geotrax . you no option connect other tracks ' spokes ' roundhouse . - you need manually turn trains around once they go their wash or gas . - only one train car fits thing goes around , so it doesn't work when cars attached engine . this biggest most frustrating problem . you need unhoook your train engine its cars fool around everything . - it just too big makes it hard store . we getting rid ours ..	-1

hannibal lecter figure we told we would never get . late 1990 mcfarlane toys go-to company paved way figures like this , producing toys like freddy jason when no one else . it under mature action figure series called movie maniacs eager horror fans received 7-inch versions their favorite boogeymen . however , years passed mcfarlane sadly dropped ball somewhere , no longer producing new highly demanded figures , simply rehashed ones we'd seen countless times before . although today mcfarlane still make impressive quality figures , neca company keep eye if your interests lie horror , science fiction , cult films ( mine ) . i not claim know how they it , but somehow neca convinced anthony hopkins sign over his likeness rights this figure , i thank toy god they . first time ever , hannibal lecter presented here , he extremely memorable segment academy award winning film , silence lambs . he sporting classic straight jacket , blazing prison orange pants , face restraint/mask , dolly cart . only cut ankles ball-jointed neck , his articulation rather limited , you might imagine . however attention detail astonishing . mask removable , show off eerie anthony hopkins likeness i rather impressed , despite negativity others . take it me , eyes this figure resemble eyes dr. lecter so well , it frightening . figure made stay attached his cart , which ability pivot back forth , but he removed stand well his own . his jacket nice wash dark grey over it , highlighting all creases wrinkles , establishing nice gritty feel . all together , his clothing hangs off his body frame well , gives off realistic appearance . sculpting paint application very impressive , accurate film . however i few minor complaints . straps his mask very small , soft , difficult secure when putting mask place . it gets very aggravating , especially if you big fingers small patience . also , keeping likeness amazing anthony hopkins , figure features some balding back his head . however , rather than sculpting nice comb-over look clearly separating hair bald skin , there simply flesh color painted square patch directly over full head hair . this doesn't look right , sticks out when looking figure any angle other than straight forward . fortunately it fixed rather easily , any kind black paint or pen . few strands hair highlighted black resemble more natural look . i hand it neca , they began wannabe company , producing figures here there , barely rivaled likes mcfarlane older work . today they first-class , producing wide assortment figures collectibles constantly putting their predecessors shame . neca knows what fans want , hannibal top never-ending wish list . truly amazing figure , only few minor problems . it makes me proud add grand dr. hannibal lecter my collection .	1

puerto rico best all around board game i ever played . balance i would say near perfection all games i've played score always very close . while this game out box takes little while understand nuances rules how take advantage different roles , it very worthwhile rewarding . after two plays , my friends all very into it anxious play again . fifty foot view game looks something like this . everyone board area placing plantations city area buildings . plantations grow crops , you need certain buildings produce/store crops which go city area you eventually want ship those crops(back mainland ... whateva ) that how you ultimately score points . there variety different crops you grow different types buildings which give different type advantages(and worth certain # victory points ) . each person takes turn their turn chooses certain role which how game functions . each role offers different functions/phases game , ie building where everyone gets build building , or captain where you get ship your goods .... player choosing phase typically gets additional bonus which where lot strategy revolves around . some things i like puerto rico , you really don't know who going win until game ends points counted up . this keeps everyone interested playing intently throughout . you also alert each turn take advantage other players moves order successful . also , other reviewers stated , luck simply just not factor so it hard people sore losers or point game flaws caused them lose(or someone else win ) , instead it typically friendly chat how picking strategy seemed make most sense . only real downside this game , there really isn't need much interaction other players , or any direct conflict . those coming settlers catan background , robber phase trading really what makes ... these features lacking puerto rico . some say captain phase like ' conflict ' , but i disagree . this small quibble , allows you play friends non-friends o-o ne getting upset . many say this game too deep non-gamers you may want start off simpler games get up speed . i would actually disagree . i've bought lot games past few months , i think we could played puerto rico right off bat . if you market new board game , go this game ! take quick read through rules , set it up take few rounds get questions out way ... than start over you'll all set enjoy great game .	1

when i first saw this product , i thought it sounded really great . only thing i thought might better would if music would turn off when too much pressure applied . i bought one my daughter try discovered real problem . since music stops whenever there not enough pressure brush , user more hesitant move brush around get all teeth . when my daughter uses this brush , she misses large areas retains much plaque . main cons : -pressure must applied , too much pressure not turn music off . results : many areas don't get clean . too much pressure results gum inflamation , tooth erosion , ultimately lead bone loss periodontal problems . -brush action not most effective removing plaque . summary : manual brush proper technique out perform this brush plaque removal . power brush rotary motion small brush head most effective method plaque removal . test brushing technique periodically using some form disclosing ( plaque staining ) such gum redcote tablets or agent cool blue mouth rinse . place toothbrushes play tunes , your child listen his/her favorite song while brushing brush until song ends . don't forget floss !!	-1

" elevation track pack ( ramps ) " one three track kits offered elevation series . other two kits " elevation track pack ( flats ) , " elevation track pack ( straights ramps ) " . ramps kit great because it includes 4 ramps , which enough track elevate train level 0 ( ground level ) level 1 , level 2 , then all way back down level 1 then level 0 . you need this kit use sky high suspension bridge ( level 1 ) , high chimes clock tower ( levels 1 2 ) . other useful kit you should purchase this one elevation track pack ( flats ) . once train elevated , you want stay level . flats kit includes few straights , just importantly , extra stanchions needed hold track up . straights ramps kit not very useful because it includes only 6 stanchions ( supports hold up track ) . there not enough stanchions use elevation track way it intended . only disadvantage layouts get quite complex because now layout three dimensional ( instead two ) . this may present challenge use up all track pieces build fun interesting layout . you'll run out track go through number iterations , time , get it all connected . all things considered , it great toy very rugged it keep your child interest long time . some great track layout ideas , search " geotrax track layout " ebay	1

i purchased this game after reading previous reviews . i nine year old son six year old son . my nine year old loves this game ! we played it over over during thanksgiving holiday . when i first read instructions , i thought there too many it would too complicated . no . they understood all rules ! my six year old isn't ready mathematics play option , but he loves dragons , knights , sleeping potions , etc we let him play	1
my seven year old niece tea party theme her birthday , so this perfect gift ! she worked it my ten year old daughter , they completed it one full day . finished product great . this not cheaply made tea set that going break first time you play it . my only complaint every color paint too thick so we add water . i should taken advise reviewer only added few drops . i made yellow bit too runny	1
i may not youngest " kid " anymore , but type loves create arts crafts , i figured purchasing this little more than $20 bucks decent price something could make cutting easier those tiny , hard-to-reach places x-acto knives can't reach easily . product relatively solid built very well . i expecting less . though perforating cutting tip which often errs may not most precision tool around , price it expected . but use it ruler you'll get very straight cuts . it also great ' score ' paper where you'd like fold instead cut . unlike previous reviewer , i can't agree cuts ever come out x-acto blade-smooth ; paper fray no matter how slow you cut . however , if you want x-acto-quality cuts you should buy xacto blade . ;) i'm not too sure just how kid-safe this item . oftentimes blade ( which essentially tiny ice pick ) stop exposed position , though it hardly exposed enough cause any serious harm anything but eye . i've touched blade lightly my finger while it activated see if there potential dangerous children , but it would probably take firm press break skin ( course , i didn't want test any further ) . it stated box kids should supervised while using this machine , so don't leave it them while you other things . no matter how safe it may seem , kids always get into kinds trouble you never expect while you're not looking . required two batteries don't seem like they'll last very long , unit specificially says its battery cover " not use rechargable batteries , " so option out . fact there not option ac adapter also counts against it . overall this product great kids ' tool variety projects where you need cutting " where scissors can't . " go scissors where you , then use this those smaller areas . 4 out 5 stars , only due limited power options	1
i bought this my 6 year old daughter birthday june , its entertaining she loves it . cartridges little hard find little pricey . also headphones stopped working it only little over month old . overall she likes i guess i just need get her some new headphones ( which it seems fisher price not sell ) .	1
i only came across this set while pricing water tower different websites , knew it one . i buy track water tower seperately , which would huge waste money . i compared water towers , i believe $25 one 1 piece color red ... other than it identical one set when it comes size weight . i set it up other day " inspect " it , make sure it really what i wanted give ds . track set up very easy only takes minute or two . tracks double sided , which would make it easier him . two tracks road print them , don't look like other side all , but i don't mind . train also moved slowly across track . track pieces fit little snug , which positive negative . it good because i know it won't easy piece slide out place , if it gets hit few times , it harder my son take apart . negative i put it together take it apart because it hard him those ( it isn't big deal all ) . it come thomas engine ... when i reading up this set , i couldn't find anywhere if it came engine . i thought it just came boxcar ( very pleased again ) . box car comes it plastic , not wood like rest , it isn't big deal me , but it may others . i think price set very reasonable . water tower alone $25 thomas engine alone $10 . set comes both $40 . i like think track set only cost $5 , when price broken down individual items . overall i am very satisfied this train set . i can't wait ds open it his birthday . i also can't wait add it christmas . it perfect first train set	1

here example toy great idea but poor product . my son received this car his first birthday . he likes it 16 months learned push button make it go . but after 4 months light use it stopped rolling . new batterys don't help . it sounds like it working but won't roll . dad taking it apart try fix it but we shouldn't resort just 4 months . aside , major downside there no automatic shutdown . if your toddler loses interest toy after few minutes ( they all ) , car continues make noise until someone gets up shut it down ( draining battery ) . seems like small thing but it gets annoying . price , it may acceptable some . aside its problems it perfect toddlers . there just one button push make it go ; push it once it goes forward ; push it again it turns left ; push it again it goes forward again . so it not something you truly " steer " or anything but it give toddler sense control . if they could add auto shutdown feature improve reliability it could great little toy	-1

we bought this card game years ago way interact our children . it relatively simple game few complicated rules challenge younger children . although game competative , everyone scores even if game doesn't go quite your way , you get reward effort anyway . popularity nascar , this game sure hit any auto racing fan . it fast paced so , even if you stopped one many hazards , play continues added excitement . mille bornes teaches how strategies work . there many ways manipulate play plan how you , or your team , finish race first place ! there even ways play allow loser sometimes gain more points than actual winner . see yourself . special car-shaped tin storage container , even when you're not playing game , you play mille bornes	1

expect game last bit longer , obviously , also couple rule changes . because players collect resources greater rate turns , expansion pack rules allow player buy betweens turns , instead just during turn . this makes things bit more confusing , but once adjustment made , game runs fine . if you like game , want add person or two , expansion must	1
i admit this quite possibly best game i've ever played . you time-traveller trying change recorded history fit your history . there 3 ways win : changing timeline suit your history , gathering 3 artifacts your wish list , or amassing 10 cards your hand . also , you break up deck play simple artifact game , which lot quicker takes up less table room . or if yourself , you play solonauts , solitaire version chrononauts . try get 8 time travellers home before deck runs out . it not easy it first sounds .	1
this product cheap all around . after finally getting table together when we tried get chairs put together , predrilled holes help you made wood split . it not safe child . looks very cute , but very poor quality . even wood scraps . you see where they put two pieces together make them long enough legs table . we returned this item still hunt set we like safe kids .	-1
i love this starfighter . i would say this my favorite three new ones ( they're all same model- just matter what your favorite color combination ) . anyone considering purchasing this- photos very accurate depictions toy . it two firing missiles not revealed until you press button wings open up , which great feature . all who cannot find figure place pilot- i found obi-wan figure target exclusive drinking cup only figure who fit comfortably cockpit . he may not pilot head gear- but , he ep . iii figure ep . iii look . i tried ep . ii obi-wan cockpit it just didn't look right this ep . iii vehicle . go target get cup figure- unless you want wait until obi wan pilot comes out later this year .	1
we received this engine starter set year ago . it worked fine while . later it would only work reverse , then few days ago quit working all together . i think my 2-year-old daughter stood it , messed up internal gears . knowing it probably my daughters fault i didn't think warranty would cover it . i went toy store year old broken toy , no receipt , no box . needless say i fully expected buy new engine . my amazement toy store didn't ask any questions or me fill out any paperwork . they just handed me new engine , it . brio may expensive , but i think no questions asked return policy worth money you spend brio trains	1

i'd give this chair 0 stars if option . chair seemed great first helping my son sit upright practice his sitting skills . he started using chair around 4 months old . i very careful using this chair . i only put him it when it floor i always nearby supervise . one day my son reaching toy next chair he fell completely out chair flat onto his face . luckily he wasn't hurt there no furniture nearby him bump into , but this could've very serious scary hazard . chair seems like great idea , but i really want all parents know it not safe . i written company complain am awaiting full refund . don't use this chair your baby	-1
i ordered these my son first birthday but unfortunately they didn't arrive time . even though this item says eligible prime shipping , beware . it only eligible prime standard shipping . not two-day shipping . anyway , once they arrived they great . we immediately starting building he loves knocking down what we create . i know some people said there should more pieces build , but we found it enough . we sat floor creating many different varieties buildings my son so much fun knocking them ground . pieces also perfect our one year old . they're big so i don't worry him chocking since they're hollow light weight i don't worry him getting hurt when he knocks towers . there no sharp corners either . far them not snapping toghether , i like this feature . my son age if they snapped together he couldn't get them apart easily they would frustrate him he wouldn't want play them . i think they're designed very well . i would highly recommend these blocks children who too young mega blocks legos . this great set your child first blocks	1
my 4-year-old son just every thomas brio engine market , including " electric " versions thomas his friends . this one different -- it not move itself electric vehicles . rather , it makes train track noises your child pushes it track . it fun addition younger child set ( one who not ready electric engine moves itself ) -- well great addition older child set it new different . plus , it feels sturdy . i've only it week , but it looks like it last while -- self-propelled electric engines , while they're well-built , no match long-term hijinks little boy	1
i gave two blasters my 10 year old twin grandkids ( 1 boy , 1 girl ) christmas . i included two packages marshmallows them . first , blasters wouldn't work because , believe it or not , jet-puffed marshmallows too big . after someone found bag regular-sized marshmallows , fun began . it took while my grand-daughter get her blaster out hands one " adults , " but she finally retrieved it . i given them much more expensive gifts over years , but nothing ever so much fun these . i gave these toys 4 stars instead 5 because it too hard pump blaster enough get major blast until they oiled pump olive oil . i suggest this recommendation included toys . ps their dog probably overload sugar , chasing eating flying marshmallows	1
i got this alphabet block set my 16-month old daughter ( even though suggested age 2+) . she enjoys nesting toys general , so i knew she'd like these . she also likes stacking blocks up , then knocking them over . when all stacked together , blocks stand taller than her ( she 31 inches ) . i'm sure when she gets older , she'll able use this toy help her learning alphabet . right now , it all stacking nesting . these blocks very colorful i'm sure she'll use them long time ! melissa doug great job this one ! these different than other blocks - only storage space needed largest block - all them fit inside	1

vengeance great action figure marvel legends legendary riders series . one best . it new body sculpt near i tell . articulation very good all joints tight well concealed . his picture package differs little than actual product inside . picture , you see his skull bony tusks growing out his chest bone-colored . but actual product , they purple . i don't know why they , but i prefer bone color instead purple . other than , paint job very good . there lots great details all over this figure . such spikes his shoulder , head , hands bone chains adorn his forearms , belt , jacket . leather jacket looks nice , too . even his character-dedicated vehicle looks great . ribcage flaming wheels really help make it look demonic he . figure doesn't fit well vehicle , but could unique figure i purchased . there two pegs near seat figure placed upon . there matching holes back figure thighs where pegs fit . it takes little manipulating pushing , but you get him there put him some nice poses . i love idea character-dedicated vehicles . it would nicer if they light sound feature or fired missile or something , but this good start . he also comes ghost rider #39 comic book -- which ok showing who what vengeance . but one thing i noticed vengeance purple head tusks comic book , so maybe picture package wrong . ( bone color still looks nice , though ) vengeance seems fairly easy purchase , so getting one or replacing broken one should simple . but , if you deciding whether get one or not , i highly recommend you . this figure very good -- any marvel legends fan would pleased	1
