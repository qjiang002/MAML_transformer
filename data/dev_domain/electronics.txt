i bought this headset retailer ( offline ) , returned it next day . first off , i make it clear i no problems sound . even though speakers could just tiny bit bigger ( they use 40mm drivers ) , sound quality headset just fine . however , when it comes wearing these headphones , only words come mind " uncomfortable sin " . awkward squarish shape cups made it hard get any kind decent seal around ears ( bad seal closed-back headphones ultimately leads poor sound isolation ) . also , i no idea what material they used cup pads , but it nowhere near soft enough ... fact , i litterally couldn't wear these things more than five minutes without my ears turning red ( flush ) discomfort . mind you , i also own cheap pair koss headphones i keep hours time , so my ears definitely no stranger cupped speakers either ... but these things , they just plain hurt wear after very short period time , which isn't good all . discomfort unable obtain good seal around ears ultimately main reasons return . if your ears tough , you should no problem this headset . sound quality decent it should work just fine you . however , if you're looking comfort good sound isolation , you'll want look elsewhere ..	-1

i bought this receiver use preamp my system . i based my decision information stated pioneer web site , attractive price compared some other options i considered . this receiver number good features , but one serious flaw . it not display screen status messages daily operations , like volume sound mode , unless you pioneer display , run special cable receiver tv ( side note , pioneer needs understand we want run less cables our display ) . means you only get see simple set-up screen your non-pioneer tv , which you probably use when you first set up receiver , very infrequently after . ( set-up menu lets you set things like assignable inputs , audio calibtraion . ) sounds like small deal , but many home theaters , including mine , electronics not line site ( mine closet just outside theater infrared repeater system controlling everything . ) this not uncommon , many thier electronics isolated like me or behind cabninet doors , it means i no idea what volume , what sound mode i am using , or anything beyond set-up menu unless i go into closet . bad , bad , bad ! this seems marketing ploy pioneer get you buy pioneer tv projectors , it beyond stupid . if this not case i would rate this receiver much higher , but it serious flaw . it makes using this unit extremely tedious difficul t.t his limitation also means , if you mulitple displays , i plasma tv projector my theater , you need run thier special cable both displays , both pioneer . again , i say bad , bad , bad ! other features stated pioneer website , but they lying when they say this unit screen display , this major drawback users not receiver line site when using thier systems , unless they pioneer display sr+ . ( oh yeah , your pioneer display also equipped sr+ , thier way linking two units . if your pioneer display not equipped sr+ , you again out luck . i mention this bad ?! )25 feb 2007 - addition reveiw : i called onecall they take unit back , but 15% restocking fee , plus paying shipping both ways . while onecall really nothing wrong ( pioneer lying osd ! ) , it one thier vendors not customer fault either customer should not pay this kind fraud . buyer beware onecall , thier customer service this one not good	-1

i pretty excited this player , read it runners ' world . there lot problems it , however . while it advertised sports mp3 player , lot respects it isn't very convenient someone who buys it sports . my issues : - headphones not all appropriate sports , particularly running .. they keep falling off , so i invest better pair headphones . kind weird since it supposed sports player . also , i spent least five minutes everytime untangling them before i could use them . - hard change music while running , it often ends up doing something i don't want it . you can't change music without removing mp3 player armband , which major pain just function bad design you can't tell any picture . - not easy figure out features player , such stopwatch , pedometer . also hard use once you figure it out . - software pain use . - organization songs annoying difficult maneuever player . said , i still use it . there some good features : - long battery life , recharges super quick- very cool-looking player- very easy carry around .. slip it pocket or bag any size . i would not recommend this player if given choice , i would not buy it again .	-1

beware kingston rebates ! course , i hope your experience would differ , if you buy kingston product(s ) , but mine terrible . i bought kingston compactflash card offered $50 mail-in rebate . i promptly ( , day after i received item delivery ) went photocopy my rebate certificate upc code sales receipt ; then sent it all its merry way . yes , i well within rebate period , both purchase postmark date . my purchase valid retailer ( think huge online e-tailer ) . rebate required sending entire original upc label , which like entire outside package my cf card , size 1 � business cards when flattened . no problem . two months later , i get letter saying " your rebate request denied because you failed furnish appropriate original upc code required rebate offer . " well , now what ? i can't re-send original ( it already their possession ) . i called , they insisted repeating what letter said . i re-sent my photocopies they said photocopy invalid proof purchase . after 6 weeks pursuing this , i figured this their scam . they simply wouldn't honor rebate . without original upc my possession , i couldn't really submit their requirements . if you're looking ram upgrade , i'd suggest you look quality company like ocz ( best ! ) , or patriot , geil , or corsair . if you're looking value flash memory card , i might suggest sandisk . one , kingston not make best products , they value-driven products . two , there competitors kingston just good or better value-to-performance ratios same prices . three , kingston not stand behind their customer i experienced . i urge you , please , cautious kingston their rebate scams	-1

these $10 headphones . there nothing amazing them my opinion . i bought them use my ipod when i'm out , or work . right out box , i disappointed fit , i know everyone going different , but me they just aren't comfortable . sound quality clear , but very thin lacking bass . even when i'm pressing them into my ears get best possible fit , bass just isn't good . eq settings boost bass don't help either , often reduce sound quality even more . ear clips don't really seem much either . they kind keep them your ears but don't really hold them your ears all . ear pieces tend get tangled together easily well . summary , i wouldn't recommend these music , but if you want cheap pair headphones listening audio books or some other kind spoken word , they might good-if you tolerate them your ears long	-1

belkin tunetalk fabuous using ipod digital recorder . i very good results recording various music rehearsals ( children choir big band ) without external powered microphone ( sony ecm-ms908c stereo mic ) attached . since i already mic , total cost very low compared purchasing something like zoom digital recorder this type recording . i haven't plugged it into mixing board yet . i suspect it would produce even better recording decent pair mics through mackie 1202 or better . i bought usb power adaptor so i wouldn't worry battery drain . it plugs into tunetalk provides power ipod . no , it isn't good high dollar recorder , dedicated mic-pre pair neumann mics . serious recording requires serious equipment . however , all those other recordings , tunetalk stereo great recording option $60 your trusty ipod .	1

i've used sd-yd250 hundreds times over last 2 years it still shows no significant signs wear . overall , product five star because its reliability labor-saving convenience . i've used it equally baking bread making pizza dough . it also save lot money , provided you purchase yeast bulk ( example 2lb ) . single use yeast packages which typically only buying option american supermarkets cost 20 times more per gram . particularly great savings possible when using it make pizza dough . this takes tedious work out making your own pizza , when dough refrigerated later use , it tastes even better my opinion . like most engineered products our age , this one full cute features add little value , or cause annoyance . yeast dispenser makes marginal difference best . if you use it , you ( most part ) create extra work yourself because you'll clean it later . dozens different bake modes make product more complicated use . they make marginal difference baking results . i only use quick bake mode , which takes 2 hours complete . let say you make mistake start unit using wrong settings ( easy given many parameters you set ) . you just push reset or cancel button start over , right ? nope , no such button exists . then unplug unit plug it back , right ? nope , engineers decided it would cute feature protect against power outages , so unit remembers where it left off . yes , but instruction manual states you wait 10 minutes , after 10 minutes it forget , right ? nope , i tried this , too . unit indeed forget eventually , but it more than 11 minutes . if you plug it back too early , timer resets you wait again . summarize , hardware excellent , software controls it could hardly dumber	1

i bit skeptical this purchase , although i previously owned one first harmony remotes pre-logitech days very pleased it . some reviews bit off-putting , particularly 890 its rf option , so i went 880 i am glad i . despite comments others on-line programming superb - all my components already database . certainly i very familiar process programmed my first remote through 3 evolutions components before selling it total package . any event process hassle free i now fully integrated control my replay tv , cable box , tv , receiver , dvd vcr just i hoped . control process seamless , provided you realize remote sending stream ir commands needs kept pointed system until remote tells you command complete all works great . ( fact remote tells you keep pointing system great improvement over my prior unit . ) my only slight critique remote not similar prompt when you switch off so you inadvertently move remote too quickly leave something should off . however help process quickly resolve this when you switch again . rechargeable batteries good innovation too - i no problem locating unit charging base . overall i thoroughly recommend 880 .	1
this fashionable keyboard spruce up any workstation or gaming environment compared typical ho-hum keyboard . lcd screen nice feature ( toy ) but i find myself rarely using it most apps games don't support it . two usb ports very handy would especially so anyone without frontside usb their towers . it worth buying anyone situation . blue lighting keys make them easier read dim room but doesn't help much truly dark room . macro keys plentiful easy use . all-in-all well worth buy anyone wanting something looks nicer then typical keyboard , anyone needing easy access usb ports anyone needing macro keys . people may also want give new vista keyboard microsoft look	-1
i little tentative order itrip lcd because some bad reviews i read . it seems like there very few people sitting fence this item . buyers either love it or hate it . i leaving trip hoped itrip would arrive so i could use it my drive . luck would it , it my mailbox day before i left . i unwrapped it went out vehicle test it . i plugged it into my 20gb ipod photo right off bat thought i trouble . it wouldn't power up , i tried plugging unplugging , cleaning contacts finally last resort , read instructions . after plugging it you play song before it power . this immediately explains why so many poeple complain doas right out box . i set frequency lowest available fm band presto !!! instant music . i don't live extremely populated area so i can't really comment other stations bleeding through but loud passages loud quiet passages quiet . many reviewers complained bad sound quality but you must remember this . it doesn't matter how great quality song your ipod , you playing it over fm radio so it never sound better than fm radio . i inherited my father ' 91 accord work car when he retired it bare bones am/fm radio tone control(bass treble all rolled into one handy knob !!! ) cheap 6 1/2 inch speakers front doors . when i drive i like listen talk radio podcasts occasionally music . sound quality exactly what i expected , no better no worse . i also tested it my wife ' 01 focus . it nice factory 6 speaker cd system sound ipod just fine . bass still thumped highs seemed just tiny bit off but still not bad all . i am completely satisfied product . one strange thing i noticed may explain why some people complain bad sound quality if you tap itrip , sound comes through your speakers much like tapping microphone . if you lay it hard surface your vehicle you could probably hear it through your speakers when encountering rough road . unless there defective batch sent out , i don't know where all complaints come . i got mine $15 private seller amazon consider it great purchase especially amount money . don't hesitate buy one , it works advertised sound quality what it . if you keep these things mind , you won't disappointed	-1
it speedy space saving inexpensive . i bought this replace my belkin because belkin needed plugged . this one powered your computer so there no extra power cords , which big plus me . only thing i dislike this fact hub takes up two usb ports instead just one like belkin .	1

i like features . i'm satisfied sound . user interface could more intuitive . however , my overriding complaint docking port ( many other reviewers mentioned ) not reliable . connection poorly constructed , so just walking table which it sits often enough make it think ipod isn't there any more . if they could fix this quality problem , it would well worth $100 , but since it very hard get it recognize connection reliably you just can't justify it any price	-1

this review little long-winded , but i am going share you my experiences after burning hundreds dvds . after all , many us archiving data / video we want able access decades into future currently there no other reviews this product site . i used just every type recordable dvd media available concluded fuji offers best value . i recommend you stick fuji dvd-rs made japan . this important since there multiple manufacturers who make recordable dvds fuji ( not uncommon industry ) . end user , dvds different manufacturers ( all under fuji name ) look nearly identical . you might want take time google then download free utility program named dvd identifier . you simply put your recordable dvd into your computer dvd writer dvd identifier tell you who actually manufactured dvd ( many you might surprised brand name disc actual manufacturer often different ) . example , fuji dvds made japan made taiyo yuden ( one - if not most - reputable manufacturers out there ) . fuji dvds made taiwan made entirely different manufacturer . both japan taiwan fuji dvds look nearly identical packaging share common proof purchase code . however , one set note made japan under proof purchase code other set note made taiwan under proof purchase code . other way distinguish packages made japan dvds plastic spindle cover flush against black spindle base . made taiwan dvds black base stick out slightly . i heard some people say digital digital all dvds created equal . this not true . you want buy dvd manufactured quality . you might save few cents buying cheaper dvd ; however , you factor bad burns lost data . cheapo dvds , you more coasters more dvds initially burn fine , but lose data after few months . past two years , i burned over 1,000 made japan fuji dvds only six bad burns not yet experienced lost data any hundreds successful recordings . i use these fuji dvds more than any other brand . i also use panasonic dvd-rs ( also manufactured taiyo yuden ) well unlabeled dvds online wholesaler also manufactured taiyo yuden . fuji dvds attractive silver color top , panasonics attractive gold color top . panasonic dvds also much more expensive than fujis . terms compatibility , i played fuji dvds over 20 different dvd players yet find player not play my video recorded fuji dvd . 50 pack fuji spindle regularly goes sale $20 variety retailers .	1

this very well designed . it give you 4 usb port but two opposite sides . this very clever becase you plug devices both sides . you webcam or cell your left your mouse number pad your right . cord plug hub computer very sterdy yet flexible so you not only adjust hub all kind angles , it would stay angle not twist all around you wires . it also works great if you jsut want charge you usb devices go . it come plug ac adapter so you don't need bring your computer you charge youd devices	1
well , begin , i am complete ipod hater . whole idea wasting buttload money something limited features doesn't sit right me . but after robbing my bro his so long , since i none , it time get something my own . i chose this walkman bean player . size sick ! fits few fingers . also , it sony , trusted company , unlike apple who give you runaround . navigation menu so simple . i didn't read manual i figured it out . only thing i read manual figue how change station radio , but negligible . anyhow , i looooove it . great bargain , sound investment	1
guess you sometimes pick good one over hundreds bad ones ... i might say i lucky .... or price this litte lcd worth price paid ... this lcd filling 2 pairs shoes very nicely ... it used kitchen tv used computer monitor .. very satisfied tv picture .. very clear sharp .. great picture .. good back lighting , not dull or dim some other lcd i've seen ... sound ok but little thin my liking so i added some cheap amplified speakers which really helps .. great computer monitor also .. just clear functional my high end hp monitor .. refreshes 60hz no issues .... would i buy again .. or ... perhaps but i would test it out before purchase if all possible ... there some bad apples every bunch .. overall my purchase this lcd tv complete success my needs ..	1

this 1st ipod i've ever , i've using it constantly since purchase 3 months ago ( gym , work , commuting , planes ) . no real problems so far . size excellent , look sheek , navigating wheel lot easier use than i told it going . battery life not too bad , i would say it used 10 hours before battery picture turns red . i am dissapointed capacity- 500 songs really nothing people who've buying cds 10+ years enjoy variation their listenting sessions . i also dissapointed you can't anything playlists ipod itself- basically everything ( eg , creation playlists , deletion songs , moving around songs ) computer uploaded ipod . recommended gym-goers frequent travelers	1

this card 2 gb ultimate 120x it tested write speed 120 times 150kb/sec which exceeds 18 mb per second . frequently card manufacturers advertise their read speed , which always much faster . analyze your file size pictures you take speed mb/sec tell you how many those pictures you store one second . impacts time pictures . cameras , write speed most important , but speed rating card doesn't necessarily tell you its write speed . music players other devices , read speed may more important . so you might choose different card depending whether you intend use it play music or take pictures . i'm currently shopping sd cards camera capability shoot 3 pictures per second large file sizes . order not slow camera down , i need fast card . i some research realized reviews here aren't necessarily even related this particular card , but all different sizes speeds kingston cards . kingston memory business long time they conservative their ratings . this card #1 my list right now because its tested write speed	1

some people seem issues but i loved mine . i live boston area itrip always worked fine 88.3 - 88.5 range . not fantastic sound but more than adequate . portability huge plus well - i used it playing my ipod over radios hotel rooms when traveling , radios friends ' houses , . itrip considerably more useful than tape player adaptor far more reliable . i never found tape player adaptor worked well consistently . price convenience you can't beat this thing . only drawback it not work newer generation ipods	-1
this review pertains specifically targus pauh217u 4 port ultra mini usb 2.0 hub . cord 2.5 feet long - long enough reach my pc , which sits ground , top desk . it cable which split into two usb plugs - one just transmit data , second power unit . second plug not need used unless you plan using some heavy-duty hardware , if so what you buying hub called ultra mini anyways ? if you insist trying run blow dryer off thing , then it input separate power source , which you buy separately . short , if you old school machine usb ports which inaccessible /inconvenient use , this little hub give you quick access while taking up minimal space your desk	1
you never ask more this product . 2700mah . that huge . runs my discman weeks ( i roughly listen 1 hr everyday ) . digital display very good accurate . refresh feature what makes it different other similar products . now forget " memory " bug your battery . given price , it worth your while	1

i bought this product after reading several reviews here amazon . setup configure it my cable system little tricky , but once we got passed , it worked like charm . i only lost one recording one my dvds . it strange how happened , since dvd wasn't player time . but almost year ago it hasn't happened since then . this recorder intuitive simple operate . conversion video dvd flawless , finalization process easy understand well . i especially like how you adjust recording time . mine currently set four hours . i am totally blind needed product easy me operate without sighted assistance . this definitely fills bill ! if you're looking great product reasonable price , buy this one ! you won't disappointed ! i've converted almost 50 videos recorded several tv shows this recorder ! great buy	1

i trying find way easily carry lot camera equipment quite some time . i tried backpacks , shoulder bags , duffel bags , but none them really worked all well . then i saw lowepro street field system completely customizable pouches , vests , belts , accessories . it works great , you only get pouches you need so there no waisted space you organize them however you want according how often they used ( put frequently used items easier access places . ) variety alone this system worth investment , but quality ease use also very high which big plus . you get case any lens , camera body , or accessory you . i even cases my cell phone water bottle . one word caution , sure measure your lens lens hood backwards if you use them make sure entire thing fit into pouch , because sometimes lens fit , but then lens lens hood not . i often carry 5-6 lenses , extension tubes , teleconverters , extra memory cards batteries , bunch cleaning supplies other gadgets , which weights ton . but when they evenly distributed this vest/belt lowepro system it actually very manageable . only down side everyone staring you because you thousands dollars camera equipment strapped your body . but if you overlook , this way go . i used this system many zoos without ever problems , fact just unzipping single lens switching seems safer me than opening entire bag equipment every time you want switch lenses . many cases also come built rain/snow cover so if weather changes all your equipment not destroyed . you also put just few pouches normal belt when you just going take photos back yard or don't need take all your equipment , which nice . i really can't say enough how much easier this makes traveling lot equipment , if you hopelessly searching better solution , consider this , you won't regret it .	1
after going through reviews , i bought this cf card my canon digital rebel . so far it worked fine , though i don't pretend expert digital photographer . when card empty , it shows 127 shots available . it seems read reasonably fast , though it takes bit longer than i used my point-and-shoot olympus its smartmedia card .	1
got my order quickly found out these cases much better than ones sold here locally , they cheaper !!	1
its very helpfull when you manage several sd cards , its faster very reliable !	1
i make this review very simple . no matter what features you find attractive this remote , its shear size makes thing clunky unuseable . unless you large hands , you trouble accessing all buttons without 2 handing it . ( make sure you go retail store hold it first before you buy it)in terms features , remote only simplest " learning " features . if you want custom interface piece hardware it doesn't code .... good luck	-1
i've it over month now it works well i expected it work . i expecting random quirks here there i continued using it , but none whatsoever	1

first short background - tv i previous panasonic plasma 50 " panasonic rear projection lcd three years old . source materials i regularly view consist dish satellite tv using s-video dvd/wii/xbox 360 using component video . after much deliberation , i decided go plasma over lcd due cost better pq , although cheaper , i avoided lcos/dlp due poor viewing angles other pq issues similar those i my rp-lcd . i ended up choosing panasonic over pioneer models due significantly cheaper price because it only missing some very minor enhancements comparable pioneer models . th-50px60u awesome i don't regret purchase all . i would say it best bang buck far plasma arena . all said , i some advice potential buyers . these tvs most sensitive first 100 hours use still require some care precautions taken during following 400 hours use . reduce likelihood image retention it highly recommended not play video games static status bars and/or huds extended periods ( i'd say 1hr plus ) , use zoom aspect ratio adjust picture so station id logos covered watch letterboxed dvds zoom function during first 100-ish hours . doing some investigation online should lead you breakin dvd used accelerate breakin time slightly make sure all phosphors lit evenly across entire panel . hopefully some you find this information helpful	1

i purchased this card use my fujifilm finepix s5000 camera family vacation . i researched it beforehand make sure i could use this card camera . there " " " " card ( apparently , they save things different format " " card not allow taking videos this camera ) . i purchased " " card , used it mostly take still photos . upon returning home downloading photos ( 505 ) my computer , i extremely disappointed find once i copied them my computer , i unable view them my camera anymore ( i not choose erase them card ) . i got error message camera , my only choice format card ( which meant everything would erased ) . i wasn't happy , but i couldn't view photos anyway , so i format it . one problem . other problem i several photos displayed question marks my computer , no image all . others looked fine thumbnails , but when opened , top half them fine , but bottom half either solid gray , or spliced repeated . it crazy ! these memories can't recaptured , so it very upsetting . i not trust card all , i not purchase one !	-1
this if my first flat screen tv but after much research i determimed this one most bang buck . so far so good , i am very pleased picture sound quality . most reviews i read lcd tvs point out issue black contrast . one thing i increase brightness level almost max order bring out contrast when viewing shows dark scenes but level seems work ok all viewing . i highly recommend this product	1
this uber-sleeve or micro-attache sound , good looking ruugedly constructed - no complaints there . however , attache it comes up short . it so perfectly sized my macbook pro 15.4 " laptop , there virtually no room there anything else . some papers , maybe dvd or two , but that it . there not even close enough space bring my power supply . once already once i left my bag all packed , only discover i also eft my power supply behind . ok , so maybe it just sleeve ... except it ever so slightly too big comfortably fit inside my oversized messenger bag ! what up !! i find i wind up going places two bags , feels bit silly . nice included ( but uneeded ) padded sholder-strap went straight my binoculars . all alternatives i found shopping around online , this one still seems best , but there one futuristic black ? orange molded neoprene skin-snug case merits deeper inspection . perhaps case ( also designed specificaly macbook pro ) more streamlined its exterior dimensions . good news brenthaven edge ii , i know my gear well protected . conclusion : nothing perfect	-1
i highly recommend bose wave radio ii after one month , here pros cons : pros : * excellent sound quality volume . plays full sound spectrum well - deep bass notes high octave soprano . turn volume up " very loud " before sound distortion audible , so it easy listen radio one room while working or while cleaning house . * small space requirements . easily fits top bedside cabinet bedside lamp . remote control right-sized too , only slightly larger than credit card . * good features . alarm clock works well input jack comes handy if you want listen cd or xm satellite radio through portable external player . * ease use . very intuitive easy-to-use design remote control radio , able use everything without referencing product manual . * esthetics envy . this radio looks great , people ask it when they see it . * resale value . you won't find used bose wave radio cheap ebay or amazon marketplace , bose radios tend hold their resale value well over time . * made america . you may feel more patriotic after buying it . cons : * cost . definitely more expensive than other radios , but considering quality resale value , it probably good value overall . if you rewards credit card , radio might obtained ( " free " ) using accumulated credit card points -- many credit card points catalogs ( i.e. , diners club rewards catalog ) wave radi o.o verall , excellent product highly recommended . keep up good work bose	1

i netgear router this wireless usb adapter . i used router wgt624 several months just firewall directly hooked into my computer never any problems . few days ago however i moved my computer decided use this usb card nothing but problems since . half time start up my computer not connected so i reboot . sometimes multiple reboots then it still doesn't work i unhook everything , router , cable modem , etc . i don't know how or why this happens but it seems make everything stuck nothing communicate again until i this . this happened several times so i am not imagining this . i try various things but ultimately i shut everything down actually unplug modem power source few seconds then start everything back up . i cable this procedure they you sometimes if things get locked up , usually when you bad connection . i didn't this when it just hooked into router , but this usb p.o.s. i am doing it every day , sometimes several times day . then it shows connection like 55% router very next room . door open , not 20 feet away . even now i sit here writing this little computer task bar showing my connection dropped yellow . least it hasn't changed red ........... crap , just , not #%^%$ kidding ! ..................... okay , back line . this absolute p.o.s. which i would take back except i got it package deal router i bought it long time ago but never used it till now . when it work it quick . but when key word there . yourself favor , buy something else ! don't corporations test this crap before they mass market it ?!?	-1

i love this product . i purchased edge 305 go new bike , it easy install , decent instructions . it easy get started using it . it gives all information you could possibly want your ride , its simple download . some people might think its too much information , but you tailor data fields displayed see little or much info you want . data ( milage , elevation ) appears very accurate . down side , display hard read sunlight . i've played around contrast tool , but still problems . i also think use instructions could clearer , my first ride , i couldn't figure out why i wasn't getting milage , later realized you turn it ! i'm used bike computers start automatically . changing data fields displayed bit pain , i want timer showing when i'm indoor trainer , % grade when i'm road , its pain constantly switch fields . also , if data field not displayed because you don't need see it constantly , ( average speed comes mind ) you change data fields displayed view info , then change back if you not end your ride . i am fortunate because several people my bike club edge 305 they could answer questions so i didn't constantly thumb through instruction manual . software comes edge very basic , but i no complaints it . all issues i mentioned above annoyances rather than problems i feel this great product i recommend it anyone who not intimidated all features .	1

i found myself position where i needed convert over 50 long audio cassettes several dats cd possibly mp3 later . prospect use my computer not inviting , i need computer other things it would forced me buy large drive deal files . after some research into few cd recorders available judging other reviews here , i decided go this model since it around same price hard drive i would needed . this couldn't simpler device use . especially my dat player , hook up supplied optical cable , adjust audio level record . it automatically creates tracks , either silent areas certain length or track divisions encoded dat . audio cassettes little more tricky automatic track division only activated if tape hiss below certain db . easy adjustment fix . anyway , creation cd couldn't easier : push record ( it activates pause mode ) , start your playback deck , release pause , leave it alone until playback finished , hit stop activate finalization . minute ten seconds later you cd . so hour playback takes hour five minutes create cd . much faster then computer . audio quality excellent my ear . there three issues note . first , unit only accepts music cd-r discs which not available data cd-r discs even nyc . second , unit sometimes not playback just finalized disc goes into error mode , reboot recorder fixes problem disc plays perfectly . i haven't discovered reason but i suspect tdk blanks i am using . third , unit not recognize end last track you recording if you aren't careful you could end up very long final track . it would nice if there option recorder would stop recording if there programmable length silence . i now set cds play any cd player i easily convert mp3 computer when time comes . saved lot time aggravation	-1

i don't much basis comparison , my only other hd antenna unamplified plastic metal 8 " triangle jobbie came my receiver . i researched heavily before settling terk-sp . it works great , but not perfect i might hoped . i live major city where every station hd version , i've always able get them all , but signal typically so weak some stations , they would constantly cut out me . strong outdoor antenna solved problem almost completely . cheap indoor antenna i before picked up all same channels , but sporadic connectivity . i constantly moving it around improve weak signal . real pain . when i got terk-sp , first thing i noticed it pretty light . plastic cover plastic backing even pear-shaped picture-hook eyehole back hanging antenna wall . pretty unique idea . it " amplified " antenna , but refers design . it doesn't plug into wall socket or anything or use any extra power . one thing i really like this antenna way it looks ... like square satellite dish . i live apartment among sea dishes , so unique terk-sp really stands out ( 16 " , it same size too ) . package includes mounting arm adjustable bracket . it not include grounding rod or grounding block ( get both radio shack $14 $5 respectively ) . if you mounting this antenna outdoors , you need them . static electricity builds up inside coax cable ( this true all antennas ) fry your tv ( i discovered this hard way , accidentally touching cable my hand after few days use shocking living daylights out my thumb ! ) your coax antenna cable needs go terk " mounting block " you place grounding rod you sink ground , then run second wire other side block your tv . this protect your expensive equipment . if you keep terk indoors without mounting it , you probably don't need ground it , so i don't blame audiovox not including them . reception wise , quick test , i disconnected my cheapo antenna terk soon it arrived tuned my worst station . i saw immediate 30% signal boost than before one station ! great . unfortunately , don't expect 30% boost * every * channel . more than likely , any station you could get before ( even really badly ) , you'll get good steady signal terk-sp . but any channel whose signal often drops 0% any reason , you're probably not going get terk because 0 times 30% still 0 . when i first installed terk-sp , i even ( intermittently ) picked up entirely new ( obscure out-of-town ) station i never got before , but some reason , i haven't able pick it up again weeks . mounting time took 45 minutes . screw mounting arm post or rooftop ( brackets/clamps mounting terk round post come it ) , antenna arm . then run your cable inside your tv . that it . short answer : this great antenna should work great long you already receive * steady * signal ( least minute or two ) your local stations . terk-sp flat-face design works best areas where it pick up " reflected " signals off neighboring buildings such . i suspect benefits terk-sp might lost if you live middle nowhere no place signals bounce off . also , hd signals very directional , so it helps not live location where you surrounded stations coming you different directions . you need point your antenna direction " generally " right direction all stations . it took two people properly adjust my terk best possible reception ( " little left . no , signal stronger back right . " ) . positioning options left/right , tilt twist ( low number stations taller signals like antenna whose face more * parallel * ground ) . terk-sp works great i highly recommend it , but i don't really know how it compares other antennas since i've never tried them , but i tell you i am now getting strong steady signals stations i received only intermittently before	-1

i older ipod photo got very banged up simple everyday use . scratches dings abound it . new 30gb video ipod i bought also black , which means fingerprints would problem , scratches more obvious . i bought isee so i wouldn't deal scratching -- if i scratches case , i'd buy new case 1/15 what ipod cost . however , i also didn't want my case try " dress up " my ipod . one reasons i like ipod because it ( imo ) best-looking media player marke t.t he isee good case these purposes , contrary earlier reviews , pops off easily , but requires very specific pressure . pulling top case around ' hold ' switch makes case pop off . case only goes one way , so you avoid what happened my griffin iclear , which i clumsily broke attaching back side upside down , effect , locking case such i physically fracture bottom case . won't happen ( thankfully ) isee . isee also clearer ( ironically ) than iclear back side ipod , which i like . unfortunately , though , you might disappointed if you apple universal dock , because you force ipod into dock -- it too wide fit comfortably isee it	-1

first , main con - headphones unfortunately lack good , heavy bass ! main pro - volume clarity nice enough you still enjoy your music block out external noises . they're lightweight ; headband sits comfortably my head speakers fit nicely over my ears without pinching ( even though i always wear hoop earrings - major plus ) . long cord allows plenty freedom volume clip pretty convenient . overall , these fun headphones great use work . style attracts little attention well . :	-1
print server very easy set up , using cd provided . no special training necessary . just follow simple instructions . we bought it because network card our 2 year old hp laser printer failed . replacement (...) , which ridiculous . this product same thing much less . response time when you click-to-print until printer actually responds slower , but only matter few seconds . our small office peer-to-peer network everything going through switch .	-1

if sound quality you're looking equated old mini-transitor radio , you might pleased . even so , you would probably expect pay around $15 product - not something $40 plus range ! like reviewer , i very low expectations such small speakers but apparently not low enough . speakers cannot handle bass all avoid complete sound distortion you need keep volume very low which essentially forces you literally within foot or two unit . furthermore , there no easy way retreive your ipod once inserted ! i feel i deceived 5 star reviews i used make my purchasing decision felt obligated respond . miniblaster good concept poorly executed i'm afraid i wasted my money .	-1
i owned this printer over six months yet any problems it . used daily basis , my printer still original set cartridges still produces quality prints even near end cartridges . photos , images , text always sharp , rich , far beyond quality my lexmark epson printers ' results . even though it advertised photo printer , it works well all types documents prints amazingly fast . printer able print memory cards , copy , scan media while your pc off . " color " " black " buttons producing copies help make copying very simple . these stand-alone features worked well me , but there one minor annoyance : you cannot scan memory card , only pc . other than this , my only other complaints mp500 must usb passthrough port work there slight red tint photos default . after using other entries competing photo all-in-one lines , i recommend mp500 highest am most satisfied this printer	-1

i've never liked universal remotes . it seems like they never power everything up or down properly system multiple components , or you lose functions original remotes . so when i got one my birthday i extremely skeptical . however , next day i programmed remote ( surprisingly quick process ! ) , it now everything my other remotes . it truly learns what you want it . you program individual buttons specific funstion very easily . i tv , vcr , dvd , stereo , tivo all running off this remote , now i want other system my house . i'd highly recommend this remote anyone who currently uses multiple remote controls !	1

this kvm switch very solidly constructed - metal case , high quality cables push button switch ( my opinion , push button switch better than soft switch ) . because its weight , it doesn't get dragged around cables . it works power drawn usb connections , but it also comes its own power , which nice . it also additional usb port which you use share usb device such webcam or usb microphone . what really nice i actually connect this usb port my dell monitor which built-in usb hub , so now i 4 extra usb ports . i " blue screen death " few days when switching computers after installing this kvm switch , but problem went away after i disconnected old webcam connected switch . if you're using windows , it takes few seconds mouse keyboard become active after switching . linux , it takes almost no time . if you find video quality low ( e.g. fuzziness ) , try adjust your monitor settings . when i first plugged it , resolution wasn't good , it looked fuzzy . but after " auto adjust " my monitor , it became very sharp . tech support connectpro seems responsive . i emailed them " blue screen death " problem couple times got replies promptly . their tech support also skype , although i never tried talk him . only real shortcoming this kvm switch it usb 1.0 instead usb 2.0 . windows xp complains this everytime you switch it . i give this switch 4-star because this . btw , anyone know why indicator button shows half-red half-green when it switched it ? it against common engineering practice	-1

though i rated it 1 star , i'd give it none if option . i really don't like write negative reviews , but i feel other parents need warned when product isn't worth price shipping , much less price itself . i thought this would make fun practice piano my three year old son . he began piano lessons recently needs practice fingering motions keyboard . i wanted something small few bells whistles thought this little keyboard would perfect practicing piano fingering . i put 6 fresh batteries it when it arrived ( it not come ac adaptor mentioned instruction manual ) turned it . 3 seconds , there fairly nice song . after it gets garbled makes horrid static sound . i poured over instructions figure out what i doing wrong . nowhere it mentioned it should making this ear-splitting garbled static no matter what button you press . worst part - it probably cost me more ship it back than i'll get refund . this utter piece junk waste plastic . never again i buy item hasn't reviewed amazon.com . save your money , willing spend bit more , find better keyboard . frankly , i can't believe amazon.com would sell this product or not least test it before selling it	-1

first glance , comprehensive feature set these phone impressive , including such perks wall mountable , room monitor mode if you more than one handset , different ringtones , 2.4 5.8 ghz . these same features turn out well-nigh inaccessable , or compromised point uselessness . only main unit wall mountable , satellites not . if your phone jack not near wall you want mount , you no options . this important if you use voip . don't expect mount kitchen handset wall . room monitor , or baby monitor , frankly idiotic . it suggested monitor sleeping baby . batteries grant perhaps half hour eavesdropping if you're lucky enough activate mode first place . you need negotiate menu after menu dig it up , after which one phone emits very loud tone . second phone then rings loudly well , when you confirm it you them beep same time . believe me , baby not sleeping any more . there many ringtones packaged phone , all uniformly universally irritating . best sounds tinny cheap , worst makes you scramble phone just end its metallic shriek . 2.4 ghz grants very little range ; i've lost contact thin intervening wall twenty feet space . my old cheaper panasonic allowed me stroll mailbox without static call . you cannot dial your voicemail speakerphone mode , phonebook speaker buttons tiny , talk button , which also hangs up call , huge placed dead center phone . cough you've hung up . callers need identify themselves now , you confident you no longer recognize their voices . i already mistaken friend voice his sister , embarassed them both mistake , embarassed myself i , normally careful shopper , purchased such techno dud . i warned against uniden products should heeded those warnings . when these phones expire , i go back panasonic . unfortunately , i must grant these phones extra star because they seem built well , although not very rugged . heavy uncomfortable hold , they probably withstand impact well enough i not able justify purchasing new phones anytime soon . update ; spoke too soon . first one broke this morning , fall wood floor . other one managed drop call five feet base . two cans string would better . i suspect rave reviews this phone received because other reviewers haven't tried better phones . this phone ultimately suffers lack ergonomics- uncomfortable , unintelligible , inaccessible . skip it something else	-1
some reviews here negative because mouse doesn't behave properly i.e. makes big jumps , etc . i think this bad rap . mouse optical needs right surface work properly . i tried mine variety surfaces , plain paper my laptop case . some surfaces slick , others textured . mouse worked flawlessy anything texture or design . it worked poorly plain paper or anything else it could not read well . i love my little guy use it quite happily laptop case if nothing else available	1

if you've ever used any sort cassette tape system , it likely you've seen maxell name . this device pretty much must-have connecting any audio signal into your tape player . concept very simple . you stick tape cassette into your tape deck , whether it your car , your rv , your house , your boat . other end cable simple , normal headphone plug . this means you use it your ipod or any other mp3 player . you use it cd players , radios , other devices too . there really no moving parts , no batteries wear down , nothing else . this makes it super easy use , great playing your mp3 music out any car you hop into . you don't wire things up , fiddle radio stations , or worry static . sound goes directly out your machine into stereo tape deck . voila ! i 2 or 3 these around house , maxell one works wonderfully . highly recommended - keep one car , one house , one you when you travel . you never know when they'll come handy	1

i bough this product after reading several reviews other people . pros : toshiba gigabeat really nice design perspective , look feel pleasant . software well designed pretty intutive . though it doesn't click wheel like ipod , but i didnt find any problem using it going through various menus . they all well designed visually much more better than i-pod or other similar players . it takes some time get use buttons other controls , but once you get accustomed then its zip . cons : i returned this player after one week , because biggest killer it battery life , it hardly lasts 6 hours . you cant expect mp3 player last just 6 hour . if i am outta my house , i should able play it least 12 hours ... thats only problem which i find this , which undid all its goodness . overall good player , if you live short battery life	-1

i've used hp a516 compact photo printer month now . i got it sale christmas $50 . what great deal ! few things note : 1 . best photo paper use this hp advanced photo paper . i bought some hp premium plus photo paper thinking since it more expensive , print quality ought better . however , this not so ! apparently , vivera ink specially formulated print hp advanced paper , which produces even-quality laydown ink , no defined edges different colors photo . hp premium plus photo paper showed defined edge blank ink , giving it " home-printed " look photo . hp advanced paper produced photo-lab quality prints looked awesome ! 2 . if you edit or crop any photos photoshop before you print it out , you should save file " baseline ( standard ) " format , otherwise printer not recognize " optimized " file type . 3 . buy ink cartridges paper directly hp site save money . they often great deals ink -- buy-one-get-one free or some other gimick . i managed buy paper ink price so it costs me $0.29 per print ( ink+paper costs ) . pros : - 4x6 photos truly borderless ! you can't tell prints come off inkje t-t ype printer . - photos printed off 1 photo per page , or more fun features -- 2 or 4 photos per page ! you choose same pictures all 4 wallet-sized photos , or choose 4 different photos print size . - you also print any frame mpeg ( video ) printer ease . just play video file stop it frame you want printed . it easy ! only thing resolution quality lower , but it looks pretty good video shot . ( this could improved other cameras , but this what i noticed my canon sd630)- instant photos ! this little printer prints rather quickly hp advanced quick-drying paper , photos ready handling jiffy ! - printer truly compact . it really cute , placed anywhere without taking up much space .	1

so many parents , i believe , don't care if toy educational . they just want quiet object their child focus so it doesn't interrupt mom or dad television show . this really more true instrument than toy . it educational . there manual comes it it teaches you how use it . you , smart parent , want read it first know how use it yourself so you spend several hours focusing your child learning how use it well . if you think music important you read manual . if you couldn't care less , then keep manual your child read his/her own so he/she get best use out instrument when they old enough read it their own . if you're annoyed noises music your kid blast pushing pulling instrument , then don't buy it . my personal feeling kids should given opportunities experience these kinds things , so if you want junior sit corner play quiet video game , don't bother buying this . this instrument also give your child exposure learn how play other instruments well . just like learning language , once you master one you much more easily learn others . same true musical instruments . learn this , your child learned how read music , playing ear , fingerings , chords , etc . so much better than something your child doesn't even use brain cell master	1
past i used backpack transport my laptop my work ( i teach college ) . perhaps it age , but backpack seemed very cumbersome heavy so i lookout nice rollerbag . this one really fit bill . like previous reviewer , i looked ton bags very petite ( 5'1 " ) size weight tremendous consideration . i leaning toward swiss gear patriot kensington bag even went so far purchase them online vendor local in-store pickup . i arrived store before order ready thought i'd look see what other bags store offer . that when i got look this bag ( saw it online , but couldn't find pictures inside bag so i hesitant ) . it exactly what i needed few nice surprises . first , other reviewers spot their reviews . this bag super lightweight , easy roll easy pick up ( either handle or shoulder strap ) when you need ( i pick it up when i climb stairs my classes ) . i love it more feminine looking bag . inside pockets main compartment ( though not rear compartment ) really pretty chocolate brown pinstripe liner ( okay , i like pretty things ) . zipper main compartment opens almost bottom sides bag , which makes accessing your things very simple . it padded compartment your computer rear bag elastic strap keep computer moving around too much . i easily access my 12 " powerbook , but it slightly tighter fit my 15.4 " macbook pro . also , top 2 inches mbp not protected padding so i use neoprene sleeve added protection . this makes bit more effortful remove laptop , but not annoyingly so . nice touch laptop compartment allows computer suspend slightly within bag so computer never touches bottom bag . main compartment also holds all my files class , well my textbook ( paperback ) small notebook . contrast backpack , i easily identify which files belong which class so i don't pull all my folders out everytime . there also room my power adapter my presentation remote case . rear compartment handy other computer accessories like cables , power adapter , umbrella . you see telescoping part handle this section it exposed . this didn't bother me first until i realized when i am rolling bag i actually see into this compartment when handle extended ( when stored there zipper covers handle ) . not much exposed , but if it raining i'll most likely carry bag or just make sure things compartment won't bothered little wetness ( don't let this distract you , bag it otherwise water resistant i don't see it huge problem ) . smaller zippered section lots little compartments pens , flash drive , ipod , other computer accessories . i also keep two glasses cases , my palm pilot wallet this section . i like this section opens up real wide some material sides so things don't fall out when you open it completely . smaller zippered compartment this outside this section great flat things like tissues , post-it notes , etc . top easy access zipper pocket super convenient too ! i keep my keys there ( though wish there key clip ) things like my phone , chapstick , lipstick small bottle lotion . it also great storing boarding pass bit cash when i travel . previously mentioned , this bag fits very easily under airline seats . strap back bag intended allow you place it over telescoping handle roller bag . strap not cover width bag might not fit over some handles . it works most standard ones , but hartmann bag i extra wide handle strap wasn't wide enough handle it . i use piggy-back system take these two trips together ( which makes easier rolling anyway ) . all all , this fabulous bag my needs . price here also excellent . i happy i paid $70 it listed amazon $92 though now it listed $57.89 ! you can't beat price ! i would not hesitate buy this bag again	1

after couple years heavy heavy use ( i travel quite bit through boats , planes , trains , automobiles ) , my old trusty e2cs conked out . they fantastic set headphones but i think i got right headset cord snagged one too many times passing objects . i went ahead upgraded e3gs ( i contemplate e4gs but couldn't justify myself extra $$$ yet ) . these purely replacement e2cs but i like design e3s e4s better ( i looked bit like alien pointy e2s i wonder whether they'd any sound difference . i didn't expect hear any sound difference e2cs e3gs but i . they just sounded richer , bit louder , fuller . soft plugs come them noticably more comfortable me . i always used silicone sleeves but now i'm using little gray ones it comes . overall , fantastic experience these . i mostly airplane travel these really isolate me noise gray foams aren't sensitive transmitting noise rustling cord like some older models . i own two bose headsets too ( older newer model ) . i like them but i always limited space when i travel overall , i think i get more isolation in-ear design shures but there advantages boses ( i prefer them intercontinental travel they're more comfortable over very long distances ) . they're very different headsets just fyi . i hesitated compare all but they headsets . i know these little in-ears either love em or hate them affair . sorry can't predict your particular experience hope i don't steer anyone wrong direction . they worked me i notice difference upgrade e2c e3gs . i wonder if there noticable difference e4gs ? maybe when these snag something one too many times , hopefully few years now .	1
i am sorry see negative reviews this board . i bose speakers more than thirty years . my first set , pair 601 still functioning friends house . my 901 series vi blow away any home theater systems i've heard . direct reflecting sound , there no need center channel , rear channel . you just get realism listening experience unmatched . i two sets acoustimas am-5 i am totally satisfied . i've one set since 1991 tribute quality longevity product . i purchased second set when i finished my basement they nothing short awesome . when i entertain , i almost always get compliment sound speakers . other reviewers commented lack bass . i would just say you really pay attention placement subwoofer . bose intends subwoofer use floor platform send bass throughout room . placing subwoofer nearer corner room sometimes increase bass . i both my systems set up subwoofer corner firing out 45 degree angle rooms totally filled deep rich bass . i always preached gospel putting your money good set speakers . while your other equipment important , speaker system make or break quality your sound . but any speaker system , you finesse placement optimal results .	1

i am par t-t ime musician am always looking something small portable record practices concerts . many years , i used wmd3 sony professional walkman but flipping tape every 45 minutes pain . advent digital technology , i got sharp mini-disc found it very useful . 80 minute discs great sound quality quite good . later , i got sony m1 professional dat . it very good , but i found built-in mic preamps disappointing , despite getting oade modification . recording time increased 2 hours . real drag now transferring recording real-time computer conversion . wav so i could make cds . i recently got r09 . it small very light , much lighter than my dat . it uses sd cards . 2gb sd card , costing $25 , record 3 hours music 44.1 khz ! it also record straight mp3 if you smaller card or need conserve space . best all , there no real-time transfer hassles . just plug card reader drag drop file computer . awesome ! nice thing r09 there variety input options . there mic input line input , there lot headroom input , making it difficult overdrive it . there low cut filter filter out rumble . mic input uses 1/8 " mini jacks supply plug-in power mics just like sony wmd3 pcm m1 . r09 also features built-in mics whose sensitivity adjusted ( high or low ) . during recent practice , i used built-in mics pleasently surprised superb quality recording . r09 gives me option use built-in mics if i don't want take my external mics . some people complained r09 take only up 2gb sd cards . this not true any more . roland recently released firmware 1.10 which allows r09 use new sdhc ( high capacity ) cards . there very reasonable priced 4gb ($50 ) 8gb ($100 ) cards available . r09 very easy use well . interface so intuitive i made my first recording played it back without ever look manual . display bit small , espcially this day age , but perhaps roland it conserve power . because line-in , it very easy now me now convert cassettes , minidiscs , or dats . wav without tie up my computer hours end . ability convert audio . wav without computer very handy . summary , r09 marks major paradigm shift portable recording devices . it now so easy tape lectures , concerts , practices , just anything almost immediately it available burning cd playback . roland r1 m-audio microtrack paved way , but this unit packs needed features ease use right price point . highly reccomended . if you shop around , you get r09 authorized dealer less than $350 , bargain price when you consider what it allows you	1

just got my super fi 5 pro i like them . i owned shure e3c etymotic er4-p . my girlfriend needed new phones , so i gave my shure e3cs bought etymotic . i recently left them inside rental car ( big bummer ) so i needed new pair decided see what else out there . etys amzing clairty high end nice mids . they fit beautifully very easy put triple flanged sleeves . only complaint i bass , while you could " experience " it aurally , you never really " felt " it . i like my bass . so what i read online , super fi would good alternative bit cheaper than replacing etys . after listening jazz , classical , some snoop , stone temple pilots , bass indeed impressive . mids nice , using ipod , you customize sound using ipod eq . i am not impressed highs ( not nearly defined crisp etys ) but highs still there . i am willing compromise bit high end get more bass . fit relatively straightforward stock medium rubber sleeves work fine , though double flange sleeves work , too . i like how easy etys put ( ues require you bit more adjusting you put them wrap wire around top your ear like most musicians ) but i'm sure it become second nature . overall , someone who owned high end earphones got degree music , i think super fi good value . get same bass even better treble , i think you'd need spend twice much playing compressed music ipod , i just don't think it worth it . these phones nice compromise	-1
digimemo 692 digital notepad made sense me several reasons ; 1 ) it cheap - $90 + or - small risk take new technology ; 2 ) if you use it technology fails , you left ultimate safe , low tech backup - ink notes paper 3 ) it lighter easier use when move ( walking through building taking notes , or sitting meeting where laptop would awkward instance ) . main question me how well handwriting recognition could made work . so far i am cautiously pleased . dm works advertised . unit light , pen comfortable hand , writing faithfully recorded .. image computer screen faithful representation page ( occasionally small strokes missed ) , software interface dumping pages pc acceptable - it could smoother but works without any glitches or major hassles . actually , i rarely used it , since most my uploading directly hwr recognition program ( more below ) . it surprisingly good recognizing tables tables/spreadsheets . me , this unit would largely useless without hwr . i found myscript surprisingly good job reading my scrawl ( it scrawl - my handwriting terrible , i often print more than write , but found it reads script well printing ) . if you write neatly whole process much easier . myscript particularly useful if you 1 ) use built training program ( helped some ) 2 ) create lists words ( " personal lexicon " ) shorthand conversions ( " auto replacements " ) . former good aid recognition specialized technical terms , names , etc . latter most useful feature , though . it you create entire shorthand ("" becomes " " " sy " becomes " sincerely yours " etc . ) . best all , i discovered undocumented feature . instead entering shorthands or lexicon words one time you simply open . txt file ( " autoreplacements . txt " " lexicon . txt " myscript folder ) enter these wholesale . i now hundreds . handwritten " wed td " top page comes out " wednesday list . " my old newton learned corrections , so it became increasingly accurate . myscript doesn't ( i asked - nice people who answer my emails told me it trickier implement than i suspect ) . people learn though , so what happens me - i'm sure most people - my own style adapts what system shown it recognize . people good continual improvement machines . this not ultimate system . paper size too small some uses ( unlike some reviewers , though , i found 6x9 pads easy find drug or office supply stores ) . it would nice if system video out and/or drawing table functionality . more expensive cyberpad takes 8.5 " 11 " paper serves tablet , i am told , acecad folks indicated next version digimemo ( " out soon " ) also . batteries really last long time ( 100 hours advertised seems right ) . it would nice if lcd screen clipboard more than show if page written or blank , but thast feels like niggling . this very good device but not all people or purposes . this not you if you need hwr but aren't willing spend time making it work . but ... if you hate taking out laptop meetings or classrooms , if you disorganized like your written notes together one place , if you need draw something shoot it off email ( ability connect mobile web this would killer app dm ) , if you need take notes while standing or walking don't want re-type them all , then this may great device you	-1

i really like this bag - i bought it use college , which i just recently started . it holds just everything i could possibly need , my laptop , my graphics tablet , my books , et cetera . this bag not without its flaws , however . previously stated many other reviews , there no place hold water bottle . flaw its design fact there so many small pockets ! these pockets can't hold more than few things , so you spread your small items throughout them , then when you need something forced hunt through half dozen tiny pockets filled small objects look your flash drive , or your keys , or tampon or whatever else you put there . one last flaw : because it so big , many students sympathise way too many books , bag easily get really heavy . one occasion , i dropped something so i leaned down pick it up , only unable get back up because my bag so heavy ! this probably not problem everyone better shape than i am , but extremely heavy bags tend bit inconvenience most people . overall , this bag really great . i like it , good outweighs minor inconveniences	-1

it worked right get go far recording my vhs tape , very easy figure out . i no problems formatting my dvd ( i used windata dvd-r ) or recording . what i problem final result drops frames , resulting jerky stop-motion look . also , there no way tell how much time you left record until it just suddenly stops recording . seems me dvd should hold least two hours , but it only held hour half . i really excited first when it seemed like it would work perfectly , then so disappointed poor results inadequate information needed stress-free recording	-1

i ordered this device based upon good reviews first model . installation went fine device works almost expected . problem slingmedia , without notifying customers or potential costomers downgraded functionality . new devices ( old models which incorporate new firmware ) now utilize encrypted stream . this breaks programs such " large recorder " which let me record my tv material my review time my choice . since i travel abroad lot , i great need able place time shift . sitting hotel tokyo 6:00 p.m. , i'm not much interested watching what us 3:00 a.m. ! i'd advise looking other solutions . i think it very irresponsible slingmedia introduced this dramatic reduction function without telling customers they would getting less than past	-1

despite sold x-fi card , this particular model not use x-fi chipset . fact it uses variation audigy 2 se chipset . this further confirmed fact this card uses different drivers than rest x-fi line , not recognized x-fi card games . main problem this you cannot uses any x-fi features games like you would expect . try using this card battlefield 2142 you see what i mean . creative labs should ashamed themselves this blatant act marketing fraud . when someone buys ferrari , they expecting get ferrari , not honda ferrari emblem front . but exactly what creative labs here . they marketing this sound card high-end brand ( x-fi ) when it really crippled version previous product line ( se model audigy ) . they must glut unsold chips they thought they could pull fast one consumers this cheap card . i one very cautious before i consider purchasing creative labs products future . buyer beware	-1

musician general audiophile , i large collection , obsession headphones all shapes sizes . these jvc obviously not going sound like $300.00 studio monitors , but they their job very well . dynamics great , smooth curve , ample attention midrange . they're less bassy than their sony counterparts , which actually advantageous , sonys way too bassy . you'll make sure you use right size silicone ear-piece ( 3 sizes included ) volume slider cord great , however cord wicked long ! these perfect replacement crap headphones came your ipod . buy them if you looking earbuds under $30.00	1
i owned previous version this monitor , 213t , 6 months completely happy it . only problem refresh rate bit slow ( i think around 16ms ) . but it wasn't so much problem since i didn't watch much video or play games it . otherwise color viewing angles fine . my other computer monitor i viewsonic 20 inch lcd , which i purchased because i needed fast refresh so i play games . i never liked this monitor though , it always problems recognizing it connection my pc color viewing angles not very good either . plus it weird viewing quality it , like i looking through screen door or something . so when i saw samsung updated 213t into 214t fast refresh something like 6ms , i decided replace viewsonic . i'm so happy i ! 214t bigger far superior monitor than viewsonic , definite improvement even 213t . great color quality , no ghosting while playing games or watching video , really wide viewing angle .	1

i currently use microsoft intellimouse i purchased 4-5 years ago . it most comfortable mouse medium large sized hands . bar none . microsoft kept it sweet simple they winner ! why they ever took this mouse off market , i'll never understand . after getting new pc recently , i decided " splurge " get one these ultra-ergonomic mice . i looked usual suspects : logitech , kensington , microsoft , etc . i disappointed feel fit various mice i tried weren't smooth intellimouse . then , lo behold , i noticed microsoft rereleased intellimouse . great , my search over ! i received mouse today . same design , same fit . awesome . only one problem you manufacturing geniuses ,... scroll wheel rattles unbelievably !!! how bad ? think those old-fashioned new year eve noisemakers you hold small handle twirl around circle . that sound it makes , i'm not kidding . original intellimouse scroll wheel very quiet when use . how could you screw this one up ?! it same product you offered few years ago color black now ! you somehow lose drawings original intellimouse scroll wheel ? you need save extra 50 cents it manufactured somewhere else ? what dealbreaker . i'm sticking my old intellimouse until microsoft gets clue fixes this oversight	-1

i am giving this unit lowest possible score reasons below . fact this product lexar actually named " secure " invokes belief it really secure . however , i discussing this lexar over two weeks now , without resolution . problem encrypted vault ( reason i purchased thing ) not available except when signed administrator . hello ??!! why would lexar build unit smaller than some earrings my girlfriend wears if they not expect it used portable device , meaning it would used many different computers ? so , if you go library , or work network , or your friend billy house , you not administrator , you lose ! only way around this put your most sensitive material right public drive , not use secure features drive . make sense ? i sent software version lexar no improvement , tried all their suggestions , now unit display microsoft windows error screen shut drive down . fair , if you not need access sensitive material any computer ( without admin rights ) then this unit could work you . it works great my home computer , but i just admit portable device i tend want port it around use it other machines cannot . if you need access your data many machines , wish so without admin rights , beware ! i suggest you look lexar website contact them make sure this possible . i'm still wrestling them , am hopeful i take them mat pin them , able actually use this storage device advertised .	-1

i also bought this system primarily bose name quality , it sound much better deeper store , it easy hook up first impressed ease use sound , but then i started experiencing problems unit freezing during movies . only way get it play again unplug unit wall " reboot " then spend 10 minutes trying get back place you left off . after reading some other reviews 321 system , i see this common problem . it freeze some movies not all others , it makes no sense whatsoever . i also own movies my dvd collection it refuses play all , but play fine my 8 year old pioneer dvd system . i am not satisfied this system all consider it way over priced performance craftsmanship . i replace this unit next year , but it not bose . stick speakers bose , not electronics . lesson learned	-1

i bought this simple mount put magnavox 37mf 321 , 37-inch lcd tv wall , or more accurately , my new " entertainment center " i built into standard 4-inch sheet-rocked wall . my new entertainment center only requires two inches living room space , replacing crt tv entertainment center required over 26 inches valuable living room real estate ! this made big difference our 16x18 living room . while there few design features could probably improved , overall it proved up task . it mounts tv nice flat , there seems plenty lateral adjustment get screen level straight . i shorten few bolts hacksaw ; if making few minor alterations such this beyond your capabilities , you probably shouldn't doing this job yourself anyway . if possible get friend help hold tv , especially when making your cable connections tv just before hanging it . i actually managed this myself , but helper would very useful . if you looking fancy , tilt swivel mount lots features(which also stick out further wall ) , look elsewhere . if you just need simple mount hang your tv flat wall , this just thing . overall , inexpensive mount job	1
if it would only cost same sd micro card comparably size capacity , it would almost perfect , i say " almost " because i encountered minor flaw i don't really know if it phone or memory . some times , after viewed many times image it kinds corrupts file but not point image not viewable , but rather it mess up some pixels it or sometimes half image . i've seen this other memories digital cameras , but i can't sure who blame . it include memory stick pro duo adapter , but if you need use it ms reader ( larger original sony memory ) , you still need buy adapter convert ms duo plain ms but many new multi card readers ability use newer smaller ms duo pro , so included adapter enough	-1

this remote unreliable junk ... well ... let me rephrase ... remote itself fine but software controls it absolute garbage which causes remote completely freeze up least once day . if you kind person turns computer hour ... uses remote , shuts off you'll probably never problem . but users pvr software keep their machines up running 24x7 . i this piece work freezing up me least once day . after researching further , i found program computer controls remote goes into infinite loop state where it uses 100% processor . only way re-initialize remote restarting computer but if your computer currently recording something you'll end up corrupting show you recording . after research i found many others web same issue . i'm sure someone read this say " load new drivers idiot ! " ... believe me , i'm up-to-date most current drivers date this review ( feb/2007 ) . streamzap acknowledged problem prior versions driver but it still exists this day . just search internet see . [ ... ] you take my word it , or you take your chances . if streamzap replied even one multiple emails i sent asking help i would happy work them . but i think they know problem out there they don't want address problem . they see numerous postings all over internet other people like me same issue	-1
i waited while before submitting review give this unit good try . i already portable unit ( garmin ) but wanted in-dash unit my other car . time this unit twice much garmin but it also played dvds . i very disappointed once i got this unit which cost twice much portable more than most other units market . biggest disappointment he not guide you fraction well any portable units market . garmin take you right door address you put . this unit ( if it find address ) gets you there says " you arrived .. " . but where , which side street , which building etc . my garmin take me right my own front door this expensive unit gets me area then i am left figure out which building ( all unique addresses ) i am looking . detachable controls unit would make you feel you paid $200 unit . it feels like it mostly plastic it couldn't cost them very much make . radio unit i car prior great detachable unit its own carrying case - you get no such thing pioneer . i thought bit cheap pioneer not even include carrying case such expensive unit . interface unit awkward time consuming . when you put address it apparently searches both state washington ( where i live ) oregon . i called pioneer ask if i could just search washington since i didn't care addresses other states this time when i i could just put state . way , this regular feature portable units . pioneer tap dances around answer but bottom line - no . what you expect only unit market where you put over side road apply parking brakes multiple times before switching addresses . i would get into problems pioneer getting its map upgrades out . again , something i spoke them you should hear song dance they give . however , if only thing wrong paying twice much unit delivers half much portable units i would just complain pionner . save money . if you want good reliable gps unit look either portable units or one other brands in-dash ones . built-in dvd players you get one those put your car fraction price . remember you always take back one portable units but pioneer you put out extra $200 get it installed well so no real taking it back . i urge you shop carefully if you all looking purchasing this unit . positive note , it fun watch screen come out pop up you first turn it . but i am not sure price worth	-1

new ipod video u2 special edition simply brilliant . reason ? well , there more then just one solitary reason : first course , amazing ipod itself . 30 gb storage ( thats 10 more gigs then original ipod u2 se ) , you plenty room upload pictures , videos , music . video quality ipod crystal clear , everything you need make pleasureable viewing experience . however , if you given ipod minimal charge , expect battery life drop significantly while watching videos , movie viewing eats up battery life . course , itunes makes uploading multiple songs videos breeze ; perfect your average joe techie . screen itself given upgrade , larger cleaner screen . screen noticably bigger , creates better viewing current movie played . video ipod also slimmer then older versions ( 1g , 2g , 3g , course 4g ) although paper marginal difference(compared 4g ) , your hand you feel it thinner robust body . headphone jack switched different position , posing troubles your pre-5g accessories . if you accessories you really need , i recommend keeping your older ipod , or consult someone see if location work out . outside box appearance also greatly slimmed down all videos , making it easy take around or great show off tight corners . lackluster accessories included ipod(a dock connecter , usb cable , headphones ) pose disappointment , majority users want wall charger , which included prior versions ipod . however , you may purchase one apple $29.00 . specs nice , but what really makes this one really special ... appearanceapple finally released u2 version ipod video , which , my opinion , beautiful move . u2 se stands out beautifully other 5g ipods ( black white ) , prominent red click wheel dabbed right center . yes , click wheel smallest version yet , regardless it same slick red finish . front finish ipod beautiful more glossy black used gather much more gleam then its older 4g model . front side also less likely gather scratches compared 4th . however , black finish means scratches inevitable , so i highly recommend use some type protection . finally , unlike its predecessor , 5g u2 se giving ultra-nice touch ; black chrome finish backside . this one simple touch utterly amazing , each band members signature shown crisply . compared chrome finish 4g u2 , signatures easily seen perfectly distinguishable . black rear finish also gives more protection minor scratches , which would , overtime , destroy appearance older ipod itself . however black finish hide most small scratches , yet , once again , case needed . closing : finishing note , this best looking ipod ever assembled . small touches make this more distinguishable garner more head turns . ipod also recieve less scratches , which great thing , my old 4g u2 got mutilated matter days . this must buy , regardless if you want stick out , or if you huge u2 fan . package comes certificate free 30 minute documentary u2 , which good deal , we get least one thing free(the older u2 se only came packaged certificate giving us 50 dollars off itunes definitive collection , priced around 250 . ) all all , great buy , if you think it , its not pricey ; only 20 dollars more overall better looking ipod sticks out , more value . also two more tid-bits : charge ipod ; oh yea , when you dont need it , turn off your backlight , it saves lot battery life , majority battery sucking comes light itself . pros : -amazing playback , crystal clear sound-beautiful display , vibrant color both movies photos . -excellent finish , black chrome rear , more glossy black front . -the great click wheel , which still maintains perfect control(regardless toned down size ) . -great movie playback-perfect interface itunes , giving addition music video playing breeze . cons : -more easily scratched compared white ipod . -battery life tends mind its own , going quick die-out , long lasting . -again , battery life seems too dull , die out quickly if not given full charge . -video playback desperately cut into battery life . -for first timers , there no manual included , so optional use tex t-t ype maybe required . -no wall charger/lackluster accessories	1
there awful lot reviews out web kvm switches . usually , more information good , right ? this case , i found so many contrasting opinions any given switch or company i banging my head against desk just trying decide what buy . usually , head-banging doesn't start until equipment received setup begins . this case , i found most head-banging evidently paid up front . i got box , hooked it up two computers ( third way , if changes anything , i'll try repost ) , turned computers . nobody happy anything . first computer didn't seem like display second didn't seem like keyboard or mouse . ( obviously , i couldn't tell whether first liked keyboard or mouse . ) three keyboard lights stuck num , caps , scroll lock , no matter which system kvm focus . note both systems verified working alone monitor , keyboard , mouse , prior my receiving kvm switch . i tried disconnecting mouse keyboard individually switch plugging them back . no effect . i power cycled " visible " computer , no effect . i powered both down , powered both back up , now everything seems fine . don't ask me -- i'm trying not believe gremlins or voodoo . possibly ( ir)relevant detail : when things started working , i realized i powered up first , let it complete boot cycle , then powered up second . it may kvm switch unable convince two machines simultaneously booting everything connected , although this pure speculation my part . i'll probably stick this sequence future ( no , voodoo , no ! ) because i like watch boot sequences . yeah , i'm nerd . system specifics :o system 1 : ( originally non-displaying system ) gateway g6-350 , running windows 98o system 2 : dell precision 330 , running windows 2000 proo monitor : gateway ev700 . curiously , this monitor shipped system 1 , which made initial display problem even more puzzling . o keyboard : standard ps/2 keyboard shipped gatewayo mouse : microsoft wheelmouse optical ( 2-button ) . this usb mouse came adaptor insertion into ps/2 port . i bought it last week because dell didn't recognize wheel behavior original gateway mouse . software came mouse installed gateway , but not dell , oversight . no biggie -- everything i need mouse , it . minor feature complaints :o noted here other sites , layout switch , outputs two long sides , makes bit octopus . if you want access switch , change systems without using hot keys , this might annoy you . o there only one button switch , so you cycle among all ports every time you want change active systems . not only this even more annoying when i hook up my third system , it just plain annoying switch isn't smart enough only switch connected ports . however , hot key functionality makes up this some degree . o ports " numbered " internally such 1 3 one side , 2 4 other . this seems bit bone-headed . o ports not visibly numbered box ( least i noticed , if they labeled , then labels should more obvious)conclusion : i bought this switch because it seemed good combination price features . amazon markdown almost scarily good ; i hoped it meant iogear come out something new , everybody just wanted clear inventory . my research indicated iogear , d-link , linksys usually rated mostly okay users , belkin somewhat below , other , cheaper models not often discussed . aten avocent lines seemed positively reviewed , especially online magazines like , but you're talking big price bump ( they usually eight-port switches ) . i would liked better switching , better cable routing , on-screen display , but these weren't deal breakers -- i knew what i trading off save money . hot key sequence change systems not annoying me -- regular emacs user , i'm used " chording " -- but it may , others . so . . . so far , so good . knocking wood , not because i believe voodoo or gremlins , but because i'm irish , that what we	-1

friend mine i bought printer each same day local aafes powerzone here germany ... he bought kodak printer dock series 3 ( not " plus " one ) i bought selphy cp710 . when we went home , he took pic his kodak camera ( which why he bought kodak dock ) . we printed pic both printers ( i used sd slot selphy print ) , they came out very crisp clear . i personally wouldn't able tell difference these prints something developer . now printers , they both printed image very sharp . almost can't tell difference them except blacks kodak darker , but it not like it horrible selphy . lcd only really useful selphy see images stored card , which you can't kodak ( since it doesn't screen ) ... it too small see any detail since image printed only takes up 2/3 already limited space . anyway , i am very impressed pictures these turn out , plus if you look around , you get cost per picture down 20 cents if you buy 108 sheet/ribbon set . definitely must buy my book	1

when i first discovered this portable dvd player , i impressed how much it met both my normal oddball demands . however , after some time , i gradually became less satisfied it than i first month i it . first foremost , its internal speaker volume somewhat weak , even when volume control set maximum possible level , i prefer not deal hastle headphone wire . my second gripe this model it not play mp3s recorded dvd . dvd5 single-layer discs hold six times standard cd , it unfortunate this model cannot play hours mp3 files recorded 320 kbps constant bit rate , highest quality mp3 file format date . ( please click ' comments ' let us know if incorrect . ) none philips portable dvd players currently play dts audio tracks . if i am road , yet want higher sound quality than dvd standard dolby digital audio track , this feature i miss , but only slightly because only four my most frequently played dvds use dts audio track . i decided send this unit out philips because its finish breaking off speakers arrow keys . this unit made multi-region compatible . disk door open , power up set while holding down osd . when menu appears , change region ' 0 . ' power off set close disc door . its pal-to-ntsc conversion leaves little bit desired if connected tv set . i recently upgraded philips pet724 7 " model . it larger , yet mannageable . it only runs approximately $20 more , but most all , it much better performer than this model . however , if you absolutely cannot dig up extra cash and/or make extra room your briefcase , it not like you purchased total lemon portable dvd player because two good things this model going it ultracompactness stable disc mechanism , so least you this product years come	-1

really , it hard go wrong when purchasing lcd tv . just look something hd , least 800:1 contrast ratio 8 msec refresh rate cheap possible . this very good tv , very good picture , very low price . only major downside this tv only 720p or 1080i , instead 1080p . 720p 1080i fine most applications , including hdtv . but if you want look future , you might want 1080p tv . newer hd dvd systems ( blue ray hddvd ) play station 3 require 1080p best picture . personally , i don't think hd dvd really take off ( but i could wrong ) i am not going get play station 3 , but i would still get 1080p tv , just case . however , i don't think you find 1080p lcd tv anywhere close this price range . other minor downside this tv it little confusing setup . it comes sheet quick setup instructions , but there no paper owners manual . owners manual cd , or you go online view i t.t he default mode this tv normal antenna connection you would use cable tv disabled . so , you go through menus tv figure out how enable antenna hookup . after , you instruct tv channel search , both analog digital . tv comes astc tuner , so you get hd channels off air ( free ) . however , getting hd channels off air difficult . if you get poor reception your area , then you won't able get hd channels . locking hd channels more difficult than old analog channels . if you don't rooftop antenna you house , then you need get rabbit ears . then it like back 1960 screwing around antenna placement get signal . i get best signal old rabbit ears my kids broke off , touching them wrought iron stand . i thinking bringing out aluminum foil . tv also qom tuner , so you get hd channels directly off cable , without getting special cable box . most cable systems , you pick up all local hd stations they offer basic cable ( bay area , it only 5 12 local stations ) . you pick up espn hd if you expanded basic service . only thing you can't get premium channels like hbo . hbo hd you still need cablebox . most lcd tv you get right now , default setup picture quality not optimally set up . this especially true standard analog tv . when you first hook up lcd tv , picture look pretty bad . you need go adjust color , contrast other settings get best picture quality . although defaults olevia better than some others i seen . although syntax olevia relatively new names they recognized one leaders lcd tv . it hard go wrong this tv . end , i recommend choosing size tv you need , deciding if you really need 1080p , then buying cheapest tv you find .	-1

i little skeptical when buying this mouse .. i wasnt sure whether or not i would like colors , or just really annoyed , but i say , its pretty cool little mouse . colors very vibrant ( i'm going post some pictures ) but not too bright where it distract user . it retractable mouse , cord quite short , so desktop useage limited many people , but its perefect laptop if you want something big enough actually able use , but small enough store easily carrying case . mouse moves pretty fast across screen without great deal movement . some people like this , some dont . personally , i like it better than my desktop mouse , which needs great deal movement get it across screen . its good laptop users limited area move mouse . overall , i would say this great mouse buy , especially kid , but adults enjoy it too	-1
i've using this radio few days now really like it . it above average . forget guy says it cheap knobs , plastic case , etc . it really feel sturdy , good selectivity pulls distant stations well . only drawback i wish this radio would some sort memory selected stations . but i easily find my favorites manually . it lot fun quality evident . i would definitely recommend it based price/quality . plus lacking most radios this type big speaker . most short wave radios tiny speaker which really bad . i don't know why they this ??? i would gladly pay more money bigger speaker some sound it .	-1

this one most expensive electronic purchases i ever made but it worth it !!! i don't know why so many people problems . i receive software update last summer repaired weird glitch remote controlling my tivo/directv receiver , but that it . bose very helpful over phone . this system beats any 5-6 speaker system i ever owned but i don't recommend it large room because you depend speakers bouncing off walls since there no rears . i don't know why so many people say it won't play their discs . mine plays everyting dvds cdrs even bootleg dvds !!! maybe they should call bose get free software upgrade . here bit advice before purchasing anything this expensive : go bose outlet store , best buy or sears listen it before you buy it ! i bought mine november 2004 1700.00 best buy when it still new , now it dropped almost half price almost 2 years . shame you bose	1

there still lot love s350 , big full sound , incredible fm reception , generally strong am reception , good rugged looks . but drift minor annoyance . worse , two am stations here los angeles , 1150 980 ( dodgers baseball ) , get overcrowding , meaning two stations playing once , no matter how narrow filter i get this overcrowding . my 40-dollar ge superradio iii doesn't this problem . but ge doesn't digital readout i hate finding sweet spot . so there big digital radio doesn't these flaws ? i hear there . soon there radio available called redsun 3000 , designed same maker grundig s350 ( called tecsun bcl 2000 china ) , which supposed blow away all competition . already redsun 2100 said superior 350 but ergonomic problems . 9-22-06 , redsun 3000 supposed only few months away . until redsun 3000 arrives , you may want look $99 sonido ( made sangean ) . it boasts presets , digital tuning , adds its fm/am tv band , but no shortwave . final point : if you're buying radio your office you use computer , i suggest you get good table radio remote control , like sangean wr-2 or its big brother sangean hdr-1 , high-definition radio . i point this out because any radio i've used within five feet my computer suffers horrible interference . place wr-2 ($159 ) or hdr-1 ($199 after rebate ) shelf or cabinet six feet away or so use your remote toggle preset stations . my experience these remote-control-operated radios well suited computer environments . update 12-31-06 : i've able get rid overcrowding am station 980 turning down am/sw rf gain knob . so i give fifth star s350	-1

i purchased this 3 months ago i absolutely love it . i bought it use my darkroom which small space it perfect . i am really big stereo systems . i don't think it worth listening music if it doesn't sound good . when i thinking getting speaker system i lot research , when i decided go this one i wasn't expecting too much . but i blown away sound , it definitly goes lot louder than i expected . now granted it isn't best but size price i can't complain . there however two things i would change it . base sound , it just doesn't sound way i like but you can't expect too much portable speaker system , i think it would better if they put seaking buttons machine , its fine if you remote you but if its not around then you navigate ipod itself which gets little annoying	1

after bought sony kdl46xbr2 set our primary tv , we wanted smaller high quality set bedroom . however , my wife unhappy mute function sony . this toshiba ( or without dvd player ) seems only one market mute feature my wife wanted . specifically , when mute button pressed , closed captioning ( visual writing spoken word appears ) although it takes two ( 2 ) presses because first press only partial mute lowering volume . when muted , press mute button clears writing audio resumes . sony -- apparently virtually all other current hd lcd tvs market -- require one go through menu turn closed captioning then turn it off , unless one wants both sound closed captioning when mute returned audible . feature my wife likes ability surf return original channel . one " lock " channel viewed , then surf multiple channels return original one click . only real fault i find instruction manual . it not sequentially go through each menu item , but skips back forth . i also think sound level lower than sony , but this most likely relative i set it higher numerical level , but percentage sound level bar , two appear same . other reasons difference may relate room acoustics , location , etc . i " issues " both sets although they imply set chooses correct image format - labeled " normal " , theater 1 " , " theater 2 " , " theater 3 " " full " this set " normal " , zoom " , " full zoom " " wide zoom " sony - neither one seems work . making changes sony easier there one button so directly ; toshiba , one must access menu	-1

i like receiver just fine , except fact i can't find universal remote code it my remote recognize . ( why can't they just publish code manual , right ?! ) unit really nice looking i love fact you dim very loud blue lighting front . however , you can't dim blue light power switch , which kind silly since other lights front panel dim very nicely . frankly , i don't like staring bright blue light while i'm trying watch tv . but i wanted write this review mainly thank amazon jr electronics amazing delivery service . amazon offered free shipping if i selected standard shipping speed which fine , so i expecting product arrive six days . but , i received email jr 2:45 am after day i ordered , saying box shipped , it arrived 10am day !!! they shipped it * overnight * me ups no charge . this really good service . thanks	-1
i can't tell you what you might want buy , but it shouldn't this unit . i've unable depend it since day i got it . i'm quite technical , managed tech support geeks several years , but this contraption tried my patience . it worked sporadically few weeks , sometimes good signal strength , but mostly weak one . well , okay , pc used wireless building our house , so i willing give it benefit my doubt . then i brought pc into same room wap tried tweak fiddle settings both wap pc , hoping zip up speed make connection more reliable . i couldn't even get connected point . updated firmware latest . reset everything factory defaults , then painstakingly entered wpa2 key ssid , plus admin password , all other things like allowed mac addresses , etc . okay , so now i see network my pc but i can't connect . then after few more connection tries , i couldn't even see network , nothing , nada , no dice . so i've gone downhill , sporadic usually slow connection building ... not even seeing wireless network while i'm literally sitting next wap . that it , i give up . i've wasted least 50 hours this device , it definitely not worth money . i bought this because i already own industrial-strength firewall/router didn't need router . maybe that where i went wrong , don't you same thing ! stay away this money time waster	-1

i bought one these units march 2006 response my wife constantly changing room arrangements , subsequently requiring tv work area didn't easy cable access . i looked several units other manufacturers , actually bought one try best buy , which leapfrog , i think . testing unit convinced me concept sound , i would kept unit except it operated 2.4 ghz , which caused interference every time microwave use , or telephone rang . my computer hard wired into network i don't want deal increased security requirements wireless , my phones work fine 2.4 ghz , so i looking solution , but 5.8 ghz . i called rf-link tech support , got all my questions answered placed order through amazon . product worked flawlessly six months then crapped out . crapping out , i mean when unit enclosed space where there exessive heat buildup , unit would stop working after 10 minutes . i contacted rf-link tech support , they promptly sent out replacement unit , explaining motherboard completely redesigned , therefore they sent me new units well new power supplies . replacement units worked flawlessly . although i upset go through return/rma process delay using product until thr replacement received , everything fine now . i would recommend this product anyone who doesn't want expense paying install cable outlets everywhere . those who concerned 5.8 ghz interference , phones , 6.0 ghz phones already available , so no future compatability issues there either	-1

i less impressed new case number reasons : 1 ) additional insulation cause heat related performance issues . 2 ) i trim bottom case sharp knife so it didn't catch when opening closing . 3 ) even after trimming case , recommended speck website , bottom part case still doesn't secure completely laptop ( although this could specific my machine ) . 4 ) additional weight back screen causes laptop shut considerable more force . 5 ) case adds overall weight size . 6 ) case further limits angle which laptop opened . still , i use top part case without bottom part . case provides some protection against flexible nature screen part laptop . if you allow top flex you run risk external pressure push rivets ( ones attach apple icon ) into back your display . this cause little dark spots your screen don't go away	-1

i love these headphones . i use them night bed when my girlfriend sleeping she doesn't hear thing . sound surprisingly great headphones very comfortable . line sight flexible - so you off side still reception . headphones don't look or feel cheap , not too heavy transmitter base looks really sleek . batteries last long time before recharging all you turn them put them they turn off soon you take them off - very cool feature . price great too considering quality features - shop around you'll find better prices . extra features these headphones i use occasion because they work best specific content : srs surround sound works great digital music movies feature surround sound . vibration " rumble " function works great dance hip-hop music , movies lots sound effects explosions ( like stars wars ) video games . one note : sound good source . reduce background hiss - turn up source audio not headphones volume . meaning , if its connected your stereo or tv - it work sort amp , so turn up volume there first before raising volume too high headphones . i no problems background hiss . pros : - sound great ( clear , loud , good bass treble)- comfortable- infrared = no tuning or inteference ( within line sight)- srs surround sound bass vibration function ( nice extras)- easy on/offcons : - infrared short range- line sight ( lose signal quality if base view obstructed)- kinda bulky looking ( looks aren't everyone)overall : price , features , quality sound looks there no better choice if you're looking short-range wireless headphones	1

i researched many dlp projectors , before buying this one . i believe i got best bang buck . it very versatile product . i am using it both home theater portable projector videos slideshows . positives : 1 ) price , good price 1024 768 native resolution . 2 ) 2500:1 contrast ratio , one highest this price range . 3 ) 2000:1 lumens , i play it bare , flat white wall , it looks clear crisp any movie theater , can't wait get my " screen goo " paint , my wall . 4 ) operation noise , fairly quiet normal mode , economy mode it ultra quiet , can't hear projector all . 5 ) keystone works great . i my projector behind me shelf , near ceiling , it creates angle projection . keystone flattens out picture , so it looks like it should . negatives : not many but , few minor annoyances . 1 ) adjustment arm it not centered . why , i don't know . ceiling mount , it would no consequence . 2 ) lens cap , everytime i remove it , i refocus , minor detail . 3 ) it composite video , s-video , but you buy adapter component video . right now my component video adapter back order . however , i am using s-video , am very happy clearity my movies . i doubt if i could tell much difference component cables but , would like see . summary ; i paid less than $800 it , delivered my door . i play it 96 " diagonal . you cannot buy new plasma , dlp , or lcd tv , this size screen , price . i don't believe giving 5-stars product , unless it ultimate , every way . so , few minor annoyances , i give this projector strong 4-star rating .	-1
i am big fan ergonomic keyboards . you know ones split keys . my wrists hurt times typing work . well , i say i've using this keyboard week without wrist pain . i think flat design helps my wrists i no longer need wrist supports . my wrists flat desk keyboard . so helps awful lo t.t his comes all batteries you'll need get started . mouse recharge . keyboard won't . keyboard needs 4 aa batteries . so far , i no idea when it going die but i keep spare batteries case . feel keyboard more like laptop keyboard than traditional keyboard . there very little down stroke when you press key . no too springy either . function keys top not really keys but small depression you lightly touch . took some getting used . i'm not 100% sold design . i use arrow keys lot my work they're much smaller than most old keyboards i've used . there times where i've thought returning old keyboard just because . but i still like feel enough give this chance . mouse works fine . it mouse . it no logitech laser mx but it not bad . action fine . it nice keyboard mouse drive off one little bluetooth usb key . overall , i'd recommend this few reservations . if you're super sensative ergonomic keyboards don't like regular keyboards , avoid this . also , if you need 10 key or use arrow keys lot , this not keyboard you . beyond , you've got stylish cool keyboard good mouse	-1
my setup includes home-built windows xp intel mainboard power mac g5 , both fully updated . i'm using usb mac keyboard sony dvi monitor . everything worked flawlessly . manual isn't bad , but could better . i can't help wondering if some dissatisfied users haven't failed read manual closely , thereby missing detail or two . beyond plugging cables , little setup required . i make setup change accomodate mac keyboard . default , ports configured auto-detect keyboard types when connecting windows pcs . mappings keyboard types enable you enter any keystroke either type keyboard . example , my mac apple key executes windows menu keystroke when windows pc selected . only thing i'd love see switching optical audio . i 5.1 speaker system , i switch inputs systems manually . 2-channel audio switching works fine , however , that all specs promise . unit includes cable upgrading firmware . since mine works fine , i haven't looked see whether any upgrades available , but those who problems might check . i've worked several kvm switches over years . i very impressed this one . it compact , reasonably priced , includes required cables , worked well out box . i recommend it highly	1

i suspect lot negative reviews people axe grind blu-ray vs . hd-dvd battle . however , it now looking likely there no battle , most studios announcing intentions release movies all 3 formats . what made me take plunge netflix now offering good range both hd-dvd blu-ray discs . picture quality this player simply amazing , almost cinematic quality . uncompressed 5.1 channel output sounds great too . even standard dolby digital seems sound better than my old player . player very well built quite cool looking . it seem like current releases even better picture than early ones - like copy fifth element bundled player , this looks slightly lower quality than , example , babel ( just released ) . negative side , what most people referring long load time fact , boot up time . switch boot up player takes 25s . once booted load time movie fairly normal . i don't see boot up time big problem . nitpicking aside , once you've watched couple blu-ray movies you won't want go back dvd	1

i purchased this software more it street mapping detail than topographic mapping . living out here rural ky i yet find backroad or country highway isn't accurately mapped this software . even local bb , restaurants , filling stations poi ( points interest ) database . simply amazing . you easily define waypoints build routes . if you plan any kind road navigation your magellan handheld gps but also want additional features topographic mapping then this software get . i mention version 1.0 appears pre-date explorist series because there no built-in support direct download explorist . it takes extra step using magellan conversion manager software load regions into your explorist . not difficult all . 3d view option somewhat useless , it often not depict physical world closely enough meanigful . ability select regions downloading gps seems limited rectangular selections only . this works well enough most cases but irregularly shaped terrain it causes you select lot more area than you really want , which consumes more gps memory . maybe this limitation how mapping software works but freeform selection tool would nice addition . aware converting regions download takes lot computing power memory ! converting entire state like ky takes several minutes my 3ghz computer results 55mb download file ! overall this product well worth price	1

first all , i see there bit controversy out here hiss , whether sub worth money . i hope clarify this simple terms . begin , i audiophile quality system . conrad johnson , tandberg , nad , celestion components , yet moved into new home , i didn't want see all those components speakers my living room new wood floors . i hoped this system sub would fit bill , but rather skeptical , after reading reviews here . so here my vote . get model 2 , get sub . it all worth it , but you'll never " hear " it , until it set up properly . first off , i'm ham ; anyone tell you , you're only good your antenna . i used roof mount full size fm antenna my baseline reference , but didn't want it my roof . i replaced it quite nicely radio shack 15-1859 $24.99 . however , like speakers , placement everything . i put headphones tuned it difficult station , then moved antenna until it clear , so i could move free unit without front speakers listen . wa-la .. after few minutes testing , i attained absolutely noisless signal it ; perfect spacial seperation . next , i found speaker placement very critical set proper soundstage , get " it intended heard " seperation . i buy sub , but now , leave it turned off . also , don't rely leaving balance centered . i tweak it , so don't afraid . try putting some andres segovia keep adjusting balance until you hear " open ambiance " auditorium he played . listen attain spacial result . then you're set . now turn your sub . also , those who say sub isn't needed . fooey . it well worth money , provides third leg triangle truly present what this system . once all set , knock yourself out . it no brainer , yes , again ; sub " required " well worth it . references what this system , try patrick o'hearn/metaphor , andreas vollenweider/book roses , tower power/soul vaccination ( live ) . they let you hear what this baby . kinda like driving porsche straight road 40 mph , saying " it not hot " . context everything . hope this helped . again , what i found necessary , signal quality , speaker placement/balance adjustment , without sub ; then sub added . me , this system keeper , keep my former audio system packed away now . me , unobtrusiveness ; " invisible " components , " coming out ? " performance , coming out top , winning big . go it . it rare find , great value	1

sangean mmr77what most impressive this radio its relative freedom power issues . this radio very conservative its power consumption whether one using external 3-volt power source , set " aa " cells , or supplied 2 " aaa " cell internal-rechargeable pack . reading pre-sales description this radio one may mistakenly assume it plays only thirty minutes internal rechargeable batteries . fact what claimed one-minute cranking dynamo results 30-minutes playback . cranking two minutes result one hour playback . longer you crank longer it plays . when fully charged internal rechargeable pack operate radio reasonable volume level all day into nigh t.t he radio built-in replaceable " aaa " plug-in battery pack similar those found wireless phones . these batteries recharged dynamo . this pack accessible replaceable , after 300-500 recharge cycles , removing six-screws back case . further two " aa " batteries easily replaceable through access-port rear cabinet . radio also powered external source , solar-cell , wall-wart , or what you , through socket located under splash-proof cover left-side radio . dynamo handle sturdy . left-side case partially cylindrical shape . left-edge speaker grill actually rubber grip . radio well balanced easy hold while cranking dynamo . dynamo cranked either direction facilitating use either right or left handed people . lefties not able see green-led which illuminates indicate one reached adequate dynamo cranking speed . minor inconvenience . bottom case four rubber-pads which when combined radio weight cause it grip well flat surfaces . no tipping . overall build quality , fit finish , this radio very-good . splash-proof earphone port located next external power-port . both earphone channels driven , monaurally . radio internal speaker only two-inches diameter . this not boom-box , but sound emanates speaker very accurate within its effective range . classical jass music sound fine . if you heavy rock-listener you may yearn more oomph your everyday listening . primary purpose this radio provide information when lights go out , but it makes useful everyday radio well , previously mentioned exception rockers . there small incandescent bulb illuminates slide-rule tuning-dial provides enough-light externally small-tasks such reading your watch or business-card . lamp illuminated through small push-button front cabinet . there small push-button top cabinet . this button activates chirping sound through speaker . sound similar smoke detector , but not loud . this not seem like very useful feature but perhaps some you think use it ? switch top radio selects am fm bands . switch back radio selects internal dynamo powered batteries , or replaceable " aa " battery external power options . most importantly , addition all above , this radio very good sensitivity selectivity characteristics . analog-dial radio tuning may new experience any you raised digital-dial radios . vernier slide-rule dial this radio relatively small so one tune slowly deliberately isolate stations . however , once station tuned-in , one rewarded solid drift-free reception . audio free noise or distortion , surprising fidelity , good dynamic range , within limited range small speaker . i recommend every household one these radios , trunk car . when disaster inevitably strikes prudent use this radio source current information could allay further personal-suffering , or loss life	1

how many pictures it store ? it most commonly asked question digital camera enthusiast but usually question most difficult get straight answer . well , considering i worked memory industry over 7 years i help clarify this perplexing question so unbiased i since changed industries . fujifilm 64mb xd card , like most 64mb cards , store average 71 pictures when used 2 megapixel camera , 53 images when used 3 megapixel camera , 32 pictures when used 4 megapixel camera , 25 images when used 5 megapixel camera , 20 pictures when used 6 megapixel camera . these numbers based off assumption you going shoot your images highest quality jpeg setting available camera understand they estimates may off much 10 percent due numerous factors including complexity scene shot compression algorithm used your specific camera . i truly hope this review helpful you determining whether this card right capacity your specific needs	1

i'm really happy a/v pack , it works exactly advertised . my only gripe , reason why i only give it four stars , sync cable it comes no longer than your standard sync cable , meaning you set you dock fairly close your power supply . but something should mentioned all official zune accessories i've used so far very high fit finish , dock no exception far more heft than it first appears . tiny details built into accessories just fantastic like , this case , magnetic remote ... brilliant	-1

sony portable minidisc piece pure digital craftsmanship . i recently bought one store i believe this best things i ever bought . it weighs 4 ounces very compact . each disc store five hours music . best thing this player it records its own music . mini disc inside protective case so it makes it virtually impossible scratch i t.t he cd-rom comes player two different programs it use . first one called md simple burner this allows you burn straight your player without any delay . software finds names song burns name artist , album , individual track . simple burner also lets you put songs its own group name entire disc including each group . second program sonic stage takes it step further . person personalize name each song such " my favorite ' or give it dates when song actually came out . sonic stage lets you keep media library , buy download music many other things . this only program i know would let you remove certain songs without erasing entire disc . i would recommend this line players any person run most day but really enjoys their music . if you not totally , computer savvy this you . it truly worth cost . phillip alexander	-1

i ordered this television high hopes , knowing despite reports firmware problems other defects i would luck out save bundle . but you get what you pay . every sharp aquos lcd tv manufactured before april 1 , 2006 shipped bad firmware . what this mean you ? me , it meant 15 minutes after unpacking tv turning it , it turned itself off never turned back again . resets , system resets , power cycling , unplugging components didn't help . my tv completely bricked . search turned up threads websites like avs forum other owners sharp tvs d4u d6u series all reporting similar power management problems almost immediately after purchase . them , fix visit sharp authorized service center either firmware replaced or physical replacement boards inside tv . i say " visit " because sharp not cover in-house technician visits tvs under 32 " , fact they could informed me before letting me wait 1 week tech visit would ultimately canceled . so here i am , 10 days later hundreds dollars poorer no tv show it . instead , it sits authorized service center ( because sharp obviously not vet its service centers make sure you get good service them either ) . i'm willing bet all inventory d6us tigerdirect selling fire sale prices produced before 4/1/2006 . check serial number your tv if you order one . if it begins 501-512 , 601 , 602 or 603 , immediately demand firmware upgrade sharp ( 1-800-be-sharp ) , regardless whether or not you're experiencing these issues ; you eventually , hopefully while sharp warranty still effect you .	-1

i bought this alarm clock today ( april 7 , 2007 ) bed , bath beyond $10 . i wish i seen reviews first . i bought it because product name , small size variety options . unfortunately , i realized it wasn't great buy when i brought it home ... spent few hours trying keep battery certain position so clock would stay . connections appear very sensitive battery doesn't stay place . clock light pointless . it supposed help you see time dark , but unless you clock certain angle everything appear blurry . actually , screen blurry most positions even light off . alarm , it pretty quiet . if you're sound sleeper or live noisy environment , this not clock you . you'll only hear alarm if you sleep it under your ear . final note this product : clock almost hour without any problems ... but only battery cover slightly open . if i close cover all way , clock shuts off . if you want alarm clock last awhile , i suggest buying something else . you get less than you pay this model .	-1

if you want budget home theater system under $200 there probably not many systems better then sony ht-ddw700 . this system ideal small rooms such bed room or tiny living room . considering price , sound quality actually better then expected me . tiny cube speakers presents pretty good clarity . they may look like cheap computer speakers but they aren't bit heavier then they look . center channel may little underpowered since dialog during dvd movies sound tad soft little too low . surround effects during movies dolby digital dts very good though . if set up properly speakers handle surround effects very well . some minor complaints speaker wire attached speakers very thin . they fixed can't replaced . also , if you want heart stopping bass then this system might not you . 8 " subwoofer okay considering price system . it currently better then any other sub included home theater system under $200 . it isn't powered , very light ( only 9 lbs ) you pretty close actually feel bass . volume would cranked up extremely high sub actually rattle your walls . receiver comes 1 optical 1 coxial digital input 4 rca analog inputs . it should enough most cases . extra digtal input or two wouldn't hurt but again system under $200 . setup couldn't easier . you just hook up included microphone , place it your listening postion press button remote . system automatically sets up speaker distance , delay volume levels . receiver comes basic pro logic ii music move modes upmix your stereo sources . it also other sound fields effects enhace sound but they don't really seem enhance sound much if all . basically , if you want home theater system small room under $200 then there isn't much better then sony ht-ddw70	1

i researched tvs long time before i ended up buying this set . it helped costco offered coupon $300 off price ($1000 final price ) . i thought i may not like tv , so i decided buy person opposed online help potential return . however , there no way i am returning this tv ; it awesome . picture great , just sd . strech feature makes regular 4:3 picture fit screen not look distored . i worried buying 37 " tv then watch black bars sides avoid distortion . but there no need this tv since sharp figured out how strech picture without distortion . dvds look incredible this tv well . what even better built-in hd tuner . i debating upgrading my cable hd package , but i decide spend $13 " rabbit ears " target . oh my , once i plugged indoor antenna let tv track digital stations i amazed . analog station popped up like fierce snowstorm winter , but when i went up hd digital companion station , i couldn't believe my eyes . incredible hd picture rabbit ears set my desk ... indoors no less ! why would i upgrade my cable tv hd package when they can't offer local stations hd ? especially when they free simple antenna ! i told this possible , but quite frankly i skeptical . not anymore , i am so glad i got sharp built-in tuner . i seriously considered just buying hd ready tv monitor upgrade through my cable provider . boy am i glad i didn't . if you market very nice tv easy use provides great picture , i would highly recommend this set .	1

so this controller looked pretty sweet me so i bought it over rumble pad . i liked idea fans wicking away sweat , i tend get pretty white knuckled my controllers . i bought this controller specifically star wars battlefront 2 pc , it works like dream . i also like x-box controller layout ( offset anolog sticks more ergonomic ) than ps2 style controller logitech rumble pad . it also better grips than ps2 controller . only things i think bad it following : 1 . it not modeled large xbox controller , but rather regular one , which ok most people , but i big hands i get bit cramped up if i play way too long . 2 . i slightly dissapointed lack custimization software available this pad . i saitek cyborg evo joystick you create custom profiles every game you want use it then set profile before launching game . this isn't issue battlefront 2 since it very excellent game control configurator , but i could see where if game didn't good interface ( or maybe older games ) this pad could suffer this regard . 3 . this isn't so much issue me , but i would assume lot game play turning off fan , fan motor likely die sooner than pad wear out . i don't care too much , because fan more novelty me than anything . i still use it even if it die . overall , great controller , i actually would give it 4.5 rating , but isn't option here	1
case very well made sturdy . unfortunatly it too small my sony 7 dvd portable player . returning it amazon quick easy . i wish it would fit .	1
when i first got wireless network home i purchased kensington wifi finder . it worked fine . but time went i saw these smaller versions come out chrysalis development . i heard they more powerful more versatile . so i bought one . i not disappointed . since it same size my keyless entry remote my car , it fit perfectly my keychain . also it much longer range than others . but best all , it directional . meaning i simply turn my body while holding down button leds change instantly signal strength increases or decreases . what great product . i love it !	1
i purchased this gps back april 2006 very happy it since . it not perfect , but you remember this not dedicated street navigator or hicker gps , it hybrid two there compromises . car : it accurate maps routes quickly 90% time . other 10% time it either looses signal , outdated maps ( my update ordered it way i type ) , or just slow processing some reason . this 10% time i'd say only 2% time this actual problem me . rest time i able simply guess what i needed next or it didn't matter all . i not found perfect way fixing slow route calcuations , but vast majority time this hasn't issue . foot : one features sold me this fact it long lasting battery it waterproof . both qualities needed used hiking . only catch you turn off lock roads , otherwise you get some really confusing directions ! also it difficult program destinations coordinates opposed addresses , but it ( put address then change everything including coordinates confirmation screen before hitting route ! ) . boat : haven't tested this i don't boat , haven't purchased water based maps . overall i'm very happy this looking forward map update . i wish it little faster route calculating map drawing , it easier imput exact coordinate points . it still better than buying/lugging around 2 seperate gps systems me	1
this my first plasma tv i love it . we bought this put icing cake after remodeled our complete house . tv sounds great , looks great . hdtv stunning ! i am very pleased my purchase would recommend this tv anyone	1
i've held off reviewing this item until i actually got some alerts - i got plenty them over weekend , so here it .... there seem lot complaints this hard set-up - so many , after no problems setting it up myself , i'd worried i'd something wrong . over weekend , number thunderstorms tornados rolled thorough my area - using s.a.m.e alert system my county - i received notification each warning . i purchased this radio specifically s.a.m.e alert system , living central mississippi , we get tornado warnings all spring - i didn't want 2am alarm tornado 3 counties north me . my one beef unit radio reception - even included external antenna , it spotty - especially weather radio reception . i'm not sure how far i am nearest weather radio transmitter , but living suburbs madison , i can't too far . if you're rural area , i'd definitely look into getting external antenna ( it port better external antenna than telescoping antenna included )	1

this solid device , i like included software burningb dvd well	1
i purchased this my teenager use her ipod nano . i shopped around while before i finally decided this one because it came losts accesories she uses it everyday all time says it works perfectly . i've only it month but it holding up hands teen no complaints so far .	1
works it should . it enough my needs handles simultaneous activity all ports well . not unbearable dropoff performance while say , transferring huge files external hard drive , while burning dvd , fiddling ipod . if you're like me you need your laptop little more without adding desk clutter uneccesarily , this should suit you fine	1

although i prefer akg k701 most my listening , this competing entry beyer so close it almost coin toss . ( one recent comparison headphone artcle came up dead heat . ) this surprising , considering dt880 one most reasonably priced major mid-priced headphones . bass full but nicely textured - not touch bass bloat found here . highs detaied never seemed sharp me , overall sound offers huge soundstage . instead music top your , these beyers lend perceived distance few feet ; ths makes classical music sound doubly elegant , surprisingly makes rock music grandiose appealing kind way . these headphones don't require headphone amp , but certainly profit one . 30 ohm version makes more volume , though 250 ohm version standard , best most daily listening . dt880 sounds great , but lacks tad k701 high-end sparkle . conversely , beyer value , comfort , workmanship can't help but impress . this phone labored under shadow akgs senn 650s , but listeners always impressed dt880s sound . it may your best value mid-priced , all-purpose headphone	1

i purchased 2gb elite pro sd card but found out my older simpletech flashlink card reader not able recognize card under winxp sp2 without most recent simpletech drivers . i don't card reader my computer , but pictures recorded it my digital camera viewed my pda so i assume it card reader . shortly afterwards , i also discovered kingston makes combo kit includes their usb 2.0 sd/mmc reader bit less price than card alone . i also noticed atp line 60x 150x sd cards . i no experience their products , but their sd cards potted versus placed plastic shell . they tout their cards more rugged waterproof . i'm very careful not any flash cards fail me , but rising capacities smaller form factors , i consider atp cards future .	1
logitech scored big plus this item . important thing you really need processing power device run properly . first review really unfair . logitech not hide fact you really should using nulooq g5 processor . it says so right box . i'm using it g4 1.8 ghz i feel i'm behind bit power . review nulooq g4 800mhz ludicrous . course it won't perform rigid standards todays graphic professionals underpowered box . hook this thing up your updated mac you'll see it shine . my workflow streamlined i enjoy more tedious tasks more than i ever . good job this one . i recommend it highly	1

when i started looking mp3 player my main concern ability play songs very high quality level . ipod consideration , top rated sony mp3 player . however , i didn't want get what everyone else after bad experience unnamed sony game console , i thought i would try something new . if you asked ten people who cowon , i would say probably nine ten couldn't tell you . it very sturdy same general shape/dimensions ipod . clearly designed compete apple , iaudio x5 some very valuable aspects : -superb sound quality , especially something weighs under 8 oz . ( i am currently using full size stereo headphones because they more comfortable)-rugged all metal construction overall great feel-simple design intuitive joystick/buttons ( i found joystick quite easy use after 10 minutes ; converts ipod may take some getting used to)-a plethera options : mach3 bass , surround sound , pan , wallpaper , 5 band equalizer , fm radio , voice recorder , surround sound mp enhance-the ability play video-a 14 hour battery 3 hour charge time-very powerful , i normally listen level 20 or less 40 volume levels it-priced same equal or lesser mp3 players-extremely easy program use transferring any type file iaudio . it drag drop system ; it took me seven minutes transfer all my 3.5 gigs music . -everything you need included box - earphones , usb 2.0 transfer cable , cable , 4 port attachment bottom player , charger jetshell software-great storage space ( 20 gb ) which used store much more than mp3s there some negative attributes iaudio x5 however : -the most glaring problem i in-ear headphones ; they not fit all way more than uncomfortable . they also assymetrical length cord . i consider myself average size ear canals so i imagine this major problem other users . i suggest cowon completely redesigns these . -because brand widely unknown , price may scare some away even all features reviews . -no place online buy mp3s particulary this player ( however i read somewhere there would soon one just like itunes . ) this my first mp3 player i am extremely happy purchase even price , because i would rather pay more quality . iaudio x5 all around outstanding media player i believe start make name itself once word gets out . if i rate everything came box i would give it 9.5 out 10 because earphones . other than this mp3 player close perfect .	1

well , i ended up buying mine closeout radio shack $149 .. i love mine ... sound really great , price awesome ! i use mine dvd , my tv regular sound all tv i watch , also tuner listen radio/ cd surround sound . some buyers talked whine speakers ... i don't know if this helps or not , but i share- i extra wire bundled up speakers i not put all wire anywhere near speakers or head unit . i thought bundle wire near speaker might cause interference , so if you whine , make sure extra wire not near equipment . mine not make any noise standby , or skip all either . i am very happy mine .	1

okay , this not review product itself . but , i stronglyencourage you consider not getting n.e.w warranty . they arereally not business fix things but make money not fixing things . if you anything device not working ( e.g. you dropped it , forget it they aint gonna fix/replace it whatever . ) they very sparce network repair companies so if there no one who fix it your area you ship it them virginia(of course you pay shipping ! )lastly , they tend screw over their repair companies so some cases they refuse repair items covered under n.e.w warranty or they take forever repair it since they know n.e.w take months pay them work they . if you want nightmare warranty then all means go it	-1

i bought one these when they clearance less than $30 it works wonderfully . lot complaints out there because people don't know how use this device correctly1 ) you approximately 30 seconds change batteries . once aaas out unit , memory kept alive through use capacitor . i know , i've tried it myself . so don't wait until batteries dead change them . defeats purpose . any electronic device , you should spare set batteries hand . 30 seconds lot time . if you can't change batteries 30 seconds , well , then ... 2 ) little humming noise i've experienced only when backlight . this nothing more than stepped up voltage powering el backlight . 3 ) there onboard file manager if you can't find file you're looking . you even assign each file folder under which it should appear ( limited extent - works better program files ) . if doesn't work , then synch software should display your file . 4 ) i scr***le-like game , pacman , periodic table elements , few songs my 64mb mmc , some books free off internet , lots other neat little programs . everything works fine . music quality amazing something i think slower than my 386dx . ok , it not good , but less than $30 it makes one cheap " mp3 " player . 5 ) character recognition system my opinion , much easier use remember than other pdas ( palm comes mind ) . it more closely matches how normal people write . 6 ) you backup all your files 64mb mmc . way if you forget change batteries few months , you always restore system mmc , which much faster more convenient than reinstalling scratch . again , all it takes standard backup , like you would pc . all all , this great device . there lot free software out there this device , if you know how use it correctly , it should joy	1

minor problems , but very good so far . zire71 , moved up little . this one should shrine built if it ever dies . syncing , use avantgo free service all news , sports , magazines like cnet , pcworld , rollingstone , yahoo , bloomberg , seattle pi much more . syncs addresses calendar using outlook its main database . patience bonus ; when putting videos it , it take up 15 minutes or more . music bit faster , real takes care all . camera very low quality , washed out , poor resolution , poor definition edges , blurred . hard shoot good one , but sometimes ( rarely ) it okay . expect lot touch up when you download pics onto your pc . videos washed out , sound quality okay , distorts badly high volume , like idling hotrod 20 ' sounds like pure static . but camera very handy if you left your digital camera home . i.e. car accidents . voicenotes hangs computer when syncing , i don't use vn anymore . realplayer works great , sound quality excellent sony earbuds . 150+ songs , 60+ pics 30+ vids 1mb sd card w/360mb still free . mediaplayer works great , just drop videos onto desktop converter into palm they go . longest video i it 10 minutes . wifi would nice but that available different model . maybe card coming . software little disjointed , would like databases calendar tie together better . it could benefit lot more automation . calendar invaluable , haven't missed birthday , anniversary or important biz meeting yet . contacts uses outlook its server . windows apps documents-to-go makes it completely win compatible . freezes crashes probably 10x 2 years , up running seconds after reset . far fewer problems than my buddy $500 win handheld . he often must redock reload all his software contacts . huge problem when you're not near your pc , totally cut him off one time , no contact info . see quirks below . age battery may pushing 2 yrs old , battery life down 5 days off charger . durability no glass screen break like old series . bounced off cement floor shirtpocket more times than remember . screen covers must . keep forgetting remove pocket while sandblasting , powerwashing , walking work rainy days . sand once wedged sd card inside , pulled it out needle nose pliers , surprised it still works . power washed entire side building it pocket , set it sun dry it out , still works fine .

my wife came up idea placing all my dvds binders ... i rejected idea first , but then saw her point how our family room started look like video store . now our shelves more space doesn't look so awkwardly colorful -- binders actually match color scheme our house ! i know other review mentions binder doesn't stay closed , but that only if you fill each page two dvd discs -- meaning every dvd other reviewer two-disc set . if you fill binder up its capacity , i see happening -- but if you just your average stack dvds , this product you ! best thing these binders : it highly unlikely anyone ask borrow dvd -- especially those " never-bring-them-back " friends ! without covers , they can't!five star product ... all way	1
this product simply not work . i purchased this item month ago back up my software my old pc ( because i buy new pc ) . after backing up all my photos , music , files extra using trusted drag-n-drop method it seemed though files loaded successfully hard drive . i restarted my old computer verified files drive . everything seemed ok . i then went my new computer upload files but it said files didn't exist . it panic time ( because i already reformatted my old compuer ) so i just lost all my files . i went wd support i told only back my files up using their software called retrospect . if i used drag drop , then who knows what happen . i enraged . external hard drives supposed simple , like portable usb drives , but wd made simple process more difficult it needs . i never recommend or buy western digital product again	-1

i really enjoy idea this item it definitely save some careless people headaches . however , i two macbooks my home gone through six these adaptors eight months , which breaks down 1.33 month ! cords consistently separate connecter . i suppose if your laptop remained desk you didn't travel lot it'd last longer . they need reinforce wire where cord adaptor tip meet . i would not buy one these extra one , because it highly probable you'll issue if you buy them over counter you only get 14 day return policy . least macbook purchase it covers you one-three years depending if you bought applecare .	-1
i owned this tv few weeks very pleased it . only complaint i internal speakers not powerful . normal viewing it probably very good . groups or people watching sports , etc . or room higher noise levels .... you really need external amp speakers . output tv not volume controlled or amplified so external speakers aren't enough themselves . again , very happy picture , tuner , etc . actually , it auto-tuned/setup digital channels through my normal coax-cable without digital box my cable company . this pleasant surprise . i pay hd my cable company so signal sent my home but surprised i didn't need digital box them well .	1

this product works ok basic gigabit switch . it looks very nice home office , not get hot . however , i bought it not nice looks , but looking great functionality . unfortunately , it turned out nothing but trouble . gs608 advertised support jumbo frames ( packets size big 9kb - 6 times more than standard packet 1.5 kb ) . properly configured network clients jumbo network easily reach transfer speeds up 80mb/sec more . but standard packets network barely work up 20mb/sec . so , this switch certainly work faster than old 100mbit switch , but hardly 2 times fast , when jumbo frames it would 8-10 times faster . when i noticed gs608 supports jumbo , it huge factor me go ahead purchase it . i wish i knew it all marketing lie ! upon receiving product i so excited so i disposed packaging ( i know - stupid me ) , only find out day later jumbo not work ( i am senior network engineer , i use jumbo work great success more expensive switches ) . so i could not return or replace product , my multiple calls netgear support resolve this very frustrating led nowhere - they just could not ( or rather would not ) understand what i am talking . so i am stuck now basic gigabit switch , when similar model ( not even pretending support jumbo ) could bought much cheaper other vendor who not false advertising . you decide yourself	-1

microsoft wireless optical elite less than satisfactory purchase me . although i like feel keyboard , i am still trouble getting used layout , found it easy hit thumbwheel left side , causing screen scroll unexpectedly . i've found placement layout group buttons right main keys , containing delete , pageup pagedown buttons , particularly troublesome : i always seem hitting wrong key , sometmes brushed delete key while typing , usual unhappy results . driver constantly telling me i low signal strength , even though wireless receiver within 2 inches keyboard . replacing batteries not helped . i've also found it tends skip characters while typing . mouse bit better : it feels comfortable works expected , no surprises . all all , although better than keyboard my laptop , this not product i recommend , particularly given price . some lower priced wireless microsoft keyboards used friends family seem work better , laid-out better , than this " top line " model .	-1

i bought one these circuit city $99 . i live st. pete/tampa area . auto station find not very effective . i found clearer ones manually searching . when it connected your ipod , it definetly slows down menus . buttons icarplay 200 also very unresponsive . i would press change station button , nothing happened , then press it again , then it would jump twice . so my advice patience when navigating icarplay menus . sometimes i could get it work acceptable amount static , but then unit would randomly stop working , i get blasted noise my radio cranked up . you cannot adjust volume icarplay , only your radio . i returned unit , i am process getting pioneer head unit built auxillery input front panel . i cannot recommend this unit . it also looks cheap price point . it looks like it should cost $25 dollars . one postive note , it charge ipod fairly quickly . also my wifes car , where she factory stereo static wasn't quite annoying . i amplified tweeters which pick up everything , including static . i also thought putting unit closer stereo would improve sound , oddly it doesn't seem make difference . you could also look one wired ipod adapters such pioneer cd-ib100 ipod adapter .	-1

i waited until i finally received working model post my experience logitech . first , let me begin saying now i working audio station i really love it . product deserves excellent ilounge review it received . sound great . it audio port s-video out port back . i cannot life me understand why there $300 units made apple bose nothing more than some speakers . additionally , am/fm tuner works well . i really only use fm tuner but found it good - better than i expected but not perfect . however , once again , most units this price point not any sort am/fm tuner sacrifice i not willing make . all these reasons i really like audio station . however , if there even product market these characteristics ( am/fm , s-video out , audio ) i would taken my business elsewhere second . my experience logitech terrible . first , i brought home unit best buy early february found it one bad batch went out best buy stores ( see other reviews this page more details which units problem buttons not responding ) . after buttons front unit didn't respond i got online read reviews posted here amazon well logitech own website where they finally admitted this flawed product . i then contacted logitech see product sent me part warranty . representative logitech told me i would better off taking my unit back best buy . i realized i knew more problem audio station than customer service rep after only 20 minutes poking around online . i told him apparantly bad batch went out best buy stores last thing i going waste my time returning product best buy only bring faulty unit back home . i also told him i'd read audio stations coming directly factory reportedly working fine i wanted one those . after some time phone we arranged my unit picked up then i would receive new unit 10 days . 10 days later i called . this first time i found out unit out stock my order backorder . i furious i call find out item backorder . not only this first i heard problem but there nothing they could me . i told first week march they would recieve some warehouse . i waited . 8 days into march i called again . order hadn't made it warehouse . small order due arrive but it not guaranteed i would get one them . again , i very displeased but there nothing i could . this first time customer representative seemed know what he talking actually served advocate me . their credit , i recieve unit out first batch . it arrived relatively quickly works fine . however , it terrible , terrible experience way . if you buy one these , i guarantee buying directly factory . logitech not seem inclined recall their bad units appears content letting customers deal their problem . if you buy best buy or amazon , careful - you may receive one flawed units who knows how long it take replacement get you . it basically took logitech 7 weeks get me new model . i've never so much trouble giving company $300 my money . i plan never shop logitech again	-1

i used microsoft streets trip , then i bought this program . some respect it better other respects it not . this program designed stand alone gps system where microsoft st general purpose program lots commands options . map system better microsoft , but guidance system better iguidance . it 3d views , better voice better user interface . all all it worth buying if you laptop or pda gps receiver it gives you cheaper way solve your gps problems . i used pharos , holux globalsat gps receiver . three i like globalsats bt-253 best . it not lose signals whereas pharos seems lose signals . it may little more accurate because number satallites it get 20 channel one . far map accuracy uptodateness maps , i really don't know areas other than mine . it seems very uptodate sanfrancisco east bay area	1

this great looking case good price . it doesn't add much bulk my ipod 30 , which great since i always it my purse , pocket , or gym bag . i dropped ipod off treadmill couple times ( whoops ! ) both case ipod still doing fine . i say though , case screen pretty prone scratching ( more so than ipod itself ) , so i'd probably remove case watch movie ipod . also , i belkin line-in my car , which , rather annoyingly , doesn't * quite * fit ipod case . so , i remove case line-in my ipod car . but , all things considered , this good buy	1
it not prettiest case my ipod , but who cares ? it going keep it scratching/breaking when i eventually drop it ! main selling point me there also protective plastic layer over screen protect screen during collisions well . not many ( if any ) other cases . plus , you see colors through silicone . i thought pink/blue/green ipods way too bright my taste , but this case could easily blunt those colors	1

these speaker stands ok . they're solid seem well built . my only problem higher you extend them , more prone they leaning . not big deal , you just adjust center gravity your speaker . i would've given stands 3 stars but i gave them 4 because they're such good relative value . speaker stands so overpriced . that what i like these : you don't feel like you're getting ripped off . just don't expect super high quality .	1

... system my computer pda ( dell ) because whenever i use " full base " preset mode my winamp listen pop songs ( just test bass ) such thongsong sisqo my hump black eyed pea bass became extremely gargled ruffled unclear . but when i sacrifice bass setting more flat setting it sounds great . my boyfriend computer , though , it worked fine ( gateway tablet pc ) so i am thinking it not headphone problem bass but rather , sound card my systems . nonetheless , after trying this one , shure e2c-g , etymotics er6i , i think sound system this set somewhere shure etymotics all levels ( lows , mid-range highs ) . shures , i found awesome bass , but lacking clarity mid higher notes ( i am no audio expert so please take this grain salt ) while etymotics almost no bass me ( i am not bass head either since i enjoy classical music , techno ( such taq ) video game/anime music ) when i tested bass thongsong sisqo my hump black eyed pea , but little too high pitched hurt my ears . this one seems smoother , in-between sound , but order give you guys better idea i'd probably need invest better sound system go it . i still wish it little more bass get " kick " my pop music when i listen hip hop rap . so far i think it keeper , though . i look forward wearing it airplane this summer way asia	1

before i bought this product i found it difficult find reviews nat . geographic topo state software well maptech terrain navigator software , so i am giving this input future customers . maptech provides demo . i'd say i prefer maptech 3d nat . geographic 3d version . nat . geographic provides more features such greater grid spacing options . but don't expect either print resolution regular 1:24 , 000 usgs maps ; both software brands default larger scale get kind resolution clarity least ink jet printers . national geographic topo 50% default setting results approximate print scale 1:31 , 000 which results very good clarity . however even 1:24 , 000 they legible ( although bit fuzzy ) . they both save you money verses buying regular topo maps ( after 20 or so store-bought maps considering your ink paper costs ) plus they give you advantages if you use gps unit especially overlaying grids , trail markers , etc ., printed-out maps . but don't forget it takes more than ( 4 ) 8 1/2 " 11 " printouts match one regular store bought 1:24 , 000 topo map	1

my epson printer finally broke down . physical damage not repairable . i wasn't particularly happy it nor price ink cartridges . i needed new printer fast . some searching internet came up canon ip4200 . i bought this printer amazon $62.00 including shipping . i thought it would cheap stop gap printer until i found good printer . well i don't continue looking . this printer it . it easy set up if you follow quick guide . i went ahead updated all drivers immediately , which simple easy canon web site . manual well written grammar correct , unlike many manuals printed overseas . first thing i print sample page . fast warm up , extremely quiet extremely fast printing . what beautiful copy . next i tried print couple photos using sample photo paper supplied printer . took minute print . prints look every bit good what i would get photo lab . very impressive . addition software very easy use . i not however install web print program , i felt i didn't need it . couple pluses- printer closes up when not use . this helps keep dust minimum . addition when printing it extremely quiet , particularly when compared my epson . big plus haveing paper cartridge which allows me keep letter size paper always ready use top auto feed open different size paper . ink comes 5 cartridges so you only replace one cartridge time . this may or may not cost savings . all all i am extremely impressed this printer . i owned computer printers since mid 1980 , everything dot matrix laser printers . i know technology changes but this printer far best i ever owned . i highly recommend this printer very small business , home based business or home use . you can't go wrong particularly inexpensive price . only fault , which i knew going into deal printer not come usb cable . i extras so it wasn't big deal me , hot swappable you probably one hanging around device . only other problem unlike my epson it not automatically tell me ink level . but minor nit pick . you tell i am highly impressed . lets just see how far ink goes . this printer a+ my book	1
previous model , 101 excellent pair headphones would only set you back ten dollars . sony replaced 101 110 . 110 same good quality sound previous model , but it smaller . even standing still , headphones slip off my ears causing me constantly adjust them . i don't know if it smaller size or angle headset , but fact it won't stay my head makes it totally worthless . i many other kinds headphones never run into this problem before , so it faulty design , not shape my head . i would stay away this model	-1
this seems great router ! it easy set up initially , enough bells whistles savvy people go ahead improve they're security later when they're ready . default setup quite secure , then , if you want poke hole through protection , you fine-tune it more , set it so someone could access specific port your system outside . speed-wise , it seems doing what it supposed , which arrange gaming packets pass through minimum time . vonage packets well routed , also . logs show how many attacks thwarted ... you won't believe how many " messenger " attacks there , plus attempts hacking into every port you imagine . this gives you good sense router doing its work admirably . add this pretty lights , you really great router ! ; -	1
i using canon i550 several years now printing calendars my family around xmas time . each calendar 13 pages i print 20 them ( 13 20 2 sides = 520 ) high resolution . i use lot ink canon cartridges easy refill . print head died i550 , so i searched new canon similar ink cartridges refill . several pixma series cartridges look same small difference they chip them . instead doing visual check cartridge determine if ink low , chip tells printer driver after so many prints . lame , but manageable ! i550 1200 nozzles ( if i remember correctly ) ip6210d 4800 ( again , if i remember correctly ) . anyway , i expecting prints much better than i550 . prints seemed same , so extra nozzles didn't seem make much difference . form factor same , but there lot more buttons features available . i don't ever print directly memory card , so lot features i don't use . i also hoping print speed borderless 8.5 11 prints i use calendar would faster . this printer doesn't seem print much faster than older canon . overall it good printer , but quality probably isn't much better than one lower end pixma printers	1

short : don't buy pair these expecting use them next five years , they simply aren't engineered well ( details follow ) . buy them if you want cheap pair headphones easy carry around , comfortable , block outside noise , sound grea t.t he long : i've owned two pairs these headphones over past few years . my use consists primarily listening music . i'm not throwing them book bag every day , they usually stay home computer , except occasional road trip . second pair recently broke ( point where it not worth repairing ) , so i decided take it apart see if i should purchase third pair . said , here how they fail : 1 . ) volume control cord breaks , result , one or both speakers cuts out intermittently . eventually , there no sound all . this happens consistently . first pair , i tried soldering wires back -- this lasted few hours , until it broke again . problem weight cord pulls directly fragile solder joints -- they inevitably break off , no matter how gentle your daily headphone use . only solution cut volume control out cord tape wires back together ( i've this once each pair ) . unlike volume control , cord properly connected , requires great deal force remove it ( accidentally or intentionally ) . 2 . ) wiring headset breaks , right speaker works intermittently , then fails . this not yet happened my first pair , which i am still using ( albeit , taped-together state ) until i purchase new set headphones . i stopped folding/collapsing it try prevent it failing before i buy new pair ( not same ones , i've decided ) . headband , curved piece springy metal stuck two pieces foam-like material . this metal piece four holes drilled it ( very poorly ) , wire right speaker woven through these holes . result whenever you fold/collapse headphones , wire rubs against sharp metal edges , insulation wears away . eventually it cuts through wire ( which actually * taught * headphone extended-most position ) , it not possible remove replace wire without cutting re-sewing headband . wire i removed broken pair worn down bare metal all four locations where it woven . despite these engineering oversights ( failures ? ) , headphones last year before modifications/repairs required , sound above average ( bass actually pretty decent ) . they easy carry don't require very much power get loud . just don't expect miracles lt ; $30	1

this product replaces 5 gig creative micro which hard drive broke 1 year after minor drop . zen easier download . 2 gig space allows me hold up 5 audiobooks some music . battery lasting 10 hours . sound quality better than micro i appreciate former comments unit not lose its place if unit shut down while playing rather than hitting pause/stop button , which start beginning book or song . i few encounters unit freezing up . i control frequency freezes allowing unit " think " after i touched button or control . it little slow respond commands . if i'm pressing button more than once or hitting back button command get into system controls , i wait until unit gets window i want before telling unit what . no freezing	-1
our unit purchased replace 3+ year old garmin geko 201 geocaching . geko great , but tiny screen " shrinking " due my middle-aged eyesight . also , it getting very tiresome manually entering caches into unit . i considered cheaper garmin legend , but found display less readable than geko . also , it came serial cable , not usb , so i would buy adapter or expensive cable(s ) get it interfaced my notebook . word interfacing computer : prepared work bit accomplish this . usb cable came my sony digital camera worked fine . however , usb drivers garmin website not automatically install set things up . i run driver install executable , locate drivers , then manually run xp hardware install wizard point drivers . not too bad if you experienced , but might challenge if you aren't " techie . " i then setup configured " easygps " interface unit able load . loc files geocaching.com, we off races . this so much easier/faster than entering coords hand ! unit performed well our field tests . color screen bit harder read than geko bright sunlight . also , i found unit would " flip-flop " display when i standing still . no big deal , just start moving it settles down . many useful geocaching specific features . overall , i'm satisfied build quality features .	1

i bought this midi controller mainly playing virtual synthesizers , but uses it hardly limited . it works great so far , just plug it that pretty much it depending program . it very light slim , which makes it very portable . research i've , this seems new model replace oxygen8 , which very similar but lacks 8 programmable buttons slightly heavier . i would highly recommend this anyone who starting get into music production programs like reason , fruity loops , etc or anyone looking good little midi controller . this price you can't beat quality functionality	1
theory , you don't need this device . you've bought hdtv screen , it got input your existing dvd player , you'd think your swank screen electronics would good job dvd signal give you pretty good picture , but they don't . fact it looks worse than your old tv . ok , well , you've also got stylish new blu-ray or hd-dvd player . maybe problem interconnect your old dvd player . your new stylish hi-def dvd uses hdmi -- surely either screen itself or swank new dvd player make sure your dvd looks good your new screen -- but it doesn't , fact it still looks worse than your old tv . practice you really may not need this device . one scenarios painted above may true you . your display or your hi-def player good job taking dvd content upsampling it hi-def screen . perhaps there screens or hi-def players market today this , but i don't own one them . i state certainty base playstation 3 sony kdl46xbr2 not such products . play dvd straight xbr2 , or through playstation 3 xbr2 you want your old tv back . ( well , i . maybe anything looks better than your old tv . ) if , like me , you find your existing video library intolerable your new hi-def rig , then you should consider this player . like other reviewers , i am very pleased it . it makes content watchable . there two provisos . first , you read instructions . dv-981hd not automatically detect output your screen favorite format . read instructions , hit right buttons , or you not get any improvement because dv-981hd output 480p your screen it usual lousy job upconverting . second , no amount processing going take old 480p signal make it look good 1080p signal . you own casino royale dvd , you see it blu-ray store or buddy house , dv-981hd not going make up difference . reasonable expectations . this product good job making your existing dvds look pretty good your hd screen , but they still going look bad comparison right after you've finished watching some 1080p flick . that why you bought your swank new hi-def player first place . here net . if you existing dvd library you want view , not find your current gear produces good picture your dvds , you reasonable expectations what your dvds should look like -- then this player you	1

i work higher education within media services . i've contantly looking reasonable " clicker " control ppt . it easy find/replace aaa batteries first all . you use mouse function double click your file bring up powerpoint . once you're , you push side wheel start , flick it up or down navigate through your slides . then you just hold it down go back edit screen . i tested this laptops both xp 2000 , unit running under minute without me doing anything other than just plugging receiver . also , i wasn't sure when i purchased it but you reset ' id ' number avoid crosstalk units . i don't two yet , so i'm not sure if they retain their new ' id ' after unplugging ... most units i believe . only minor gripe you perform secret handshake activate laser pointer , but even pretty easy . great little device , nice carrying case , perfect price range	1
we spent 6 months trying decide if we would use portable player enough justify purchase , if so , which one buy . bittorrent user , i lot divx files already , so when i saw player capability this price , i pulled trigger . very good decision . we've using player heavily month now , we very satisfied , often wondering why we waited so long buy one . we got it before long roadtrip ( 7 hours each way ) , it made travel much more pleasant my 4-year-old . he actually looked forward getting back car so he could watch his shows ! i able fit 10 hours kids shows one dvd-r using free divx software player/burner windows . phillips portable played all dvds , dvd-rs , dvd-rws we've thrown it without slightest skip or freeze . i can't even say our full size home player . it feels very sturdy , held up perfectly so far even hands rather rugged 4-year-old . battery life very good , but i don't any specifics . longer than 5 hours , least , which seems good me . included adapters allow you use it plugged wall or cigarette lighter without battery attached if desired ( much lighter way ) . car adapter cord long enough reach dash back seat big vehicle , but probably not third row mini-van . screen not huge , especially when viewing 4:3 aspect content . 7 " diagonal measurement really only applies 16:9 ( widescreen ) content . built-in speakers ok sounding , suprizingly loud . there 2 headphone jacks , which outstanding feature so you don't use splitter . included av cable lets you hook it your composite inputs your tv or vcr , so you use this your home entertainment center . i considering buying both home divx player , car video system . this player satisfies both requirements much less than i planning spending either one . this qualifies best consumer electronics purchase i've made last 2 years -- very pleasant surprise	1

omg , i got these headphones they suck !!! i am not even kidding , they probably worst headphones world worst headphones i've my life ... first all , when you listen music there loud hissssss noise backround , second , these don't even fit over your freakin ears ... haha , also , they tooo bulky , you can't anything them ... sound quality ok ... but if your looking noise cancelling headphones , i dont recommend these , i recommend sony fontopia headphones or 120 dollar sony noise cancelling headphones ear buds not too bulky ( availible brookstones ) ... now those what you call great , these panasonic earfones just horrible compared these , it only takes out like little noise , but sony 120 dollar ones brookstone takes out 70% noise ! that amazing , it probably why they so expensive ... well i leave but this my advice you don't ever ever buy these headphones your life !!! they horrible !!! hope this helped	-1
this 32 " lcd aquos quite possibly best size/quality/price combination market . picture clearer than i could ever hoped , better than much more expensive ( heavy ) plasma screens . sharp also managed get close true black possible lcd , colors vivid true . setup couldn't easier , there more inputs ( 6 ) than most people devices input . importantly , there two hdmi inputs so digital cable dvd no longer make analog losses previous gold standard component inputs . hdmi , everything that digital stays digital , all one cable . plus your video games hooked up two component ( or two composite ) inputs . screen size , those tempted go larger should remember two things : 1 ) resolution 37 " screen same 32 " , resulting larger picture but one which more pixelated ; 2 ) picture so clear , you view screen quite clearly much farther distance than you would imagine . combine all this sharp emmy-winning pixel technology refresh rate only 6ms , opposed 8ms most lcds this range -- meaning virtually no lag even fastest action pics or sports events -- you tv virtually no flaws . two 10w speakers more than adequate until you get your optical dolby surround system set up	1

first rule microphones , " no one microphone perfect every purpose . " rule two , " experiment different mics different applications find your signature sound . " i've used shure sm58 their ancestors relatives back 1968 . i primarily used them broadcasting recording spoken word content but i used ( still use ) them singing some back up vocals . sm58 one thing well vocal performance when used very close mouth public address use . some people , me included , actually sound better more comfortable live performance setting when using mic , shure sm-57 . sm-58 very good vocal mic some people probably best choice . example , anyone who not resist putting mic right up against their lips while singing probably want sm-58 . people softer or weaker voices want sm-58 . sm-58 highly directional noticable yet manageable proximity effect ( which means bass increases closer you get . ) this mic not pick up well much over 8 inches away . reason so many singers think you supposed shove microphones practically inside your mouth because ball type shure vocal mics require you get them very close or they don't sound right . other hand , sm-57 sounds best several inches away user mouth works fine up 12 inches away . while sm-58 certainly number one professional pa vocal mic , there precious few other uses it because it colored sound prominent frequency response boost upper midrange plus sound source very close before it picked up clearly . it works ok conga drums like , but sm-58 last thing you'd want use mic sax or guitar . personally these mics not best my mic technique or basic nature my voice , but some people they sound great . live vocal mic works best me shure sm-57 windscreen . however other people sm-58 works better . it depends your voice what you want mic . if you very deep voice , sm-58 might second best choice after sm-57 which better low frequency response . one certain advantage sm-58 excellent gain before feedback capability . this mic turned up louder than almost any other mic without annoying pa squeal . advantage sm-58 it still available ( slight extra cost ) built-in on/off switch . sm-58 ball shaped grills very sturdy even if you should dent one you get replacement which screws right ten dollars . i've seen sm-58 dented , rusty , dusty , smoked up , spit into , pieces missing slammed into hardwood stage full weight boom stand adding mass fall yet i've never seen but one stop working malfunction due on/off switch got dirt it . all pro-line shure mics top quality . pro line shures also hold their value well . if you buy one decide you don't like it , you get what you paid it ebay . i would compare many mics possible before buying one . senneheiser evolution mics sound really good too worth look . sm-58 number one on-stage vocal mic forseeable future because most people follow crowd instead actually trying out different mics picking one works best their particular voice . these things so durable even if they stopped making them today they'd still around 20 years least	1

first off , i need let everyone know i ended up buying this tv local store not amazon . i'm writing this review because i used reviews amamzon help me make my buying decision am appreciative reviews other buyers during my research . bottom line , one other reviewer stated , you get what you pay . i took my three small children into local electronics store , while standing front wall tvs ( both plasma lcd ) , asked them pick tv best picture . not surprisingly , they all picked pioneer . anyone who kids tell you they really say what they think . tv best picture far . there no comparison lcd tvs either . don't let anyone try tell you lcd longevity or picture quality . i easily see pixelation fast moving images when i checking out 1080p lcds . there also alot talk concerning plasma burn-in issues . this may issue past but i've no problems all . during first 100 200 hours viewing , just go user-defined settings dial down brightness contrast . also , go power set " save2 " avoid stationary logos much possible . after this break-in period , you put settings whatever you like . absolutely five stars	1

i originally purchased 56 " samsung 1080p dlp ( hl-s5687w ) amazon . unfortunately , i one few who could see rainbow effect single chip dlp color wheel . rainbows very distracting i couldn't live set . amazon couldn't anything me such exchanging set different model . fortunately , samsung willing work me gave me option exchange/upgrade different set . i chose go hp-s6373 couldn't happier . i am really into picture quality , this set best i've seen anywhere . i 65 " crt rptv three half years , although it isf calibrated , samsung plasma looks much nicer . when i decided get new hdtv five months ago , i went through two sony 1080p sxrds ( kds-60a2000 ) , both ended up green blob problems . then i tried samsung dlp , which rainbow effect i mentioned earlier . i spent so much time researching hdtvs , sony samsung models i tried arguable two best sets available time ( i spent way too much time avs forum ) . anyhow , i am very happy samsung hp-s6373 . it minimizes two big concerns people plasmas - glare burn - using filterbright plus automatic pixel shift technology . you still see some reflection brightly lit room , but there no silk screen effect ( sse ) , which very noticeable sxrd dlp . i'd rather little glare instead sse . both sony sxrd samsung dlp 1080p sets . i understand why higher resolution important , especially 1080i/1080p material but i honestly tell you my 1366 768 plasma looks much nicer than either 1080p set . granted this may due my 12 foot viewing distance , but ultimately best picture up viewer 1080p sticker doesn't necessarily mean picture quality one set better than . i constantly found myself tweaking sony sxrd samsung dlp sets get best picture . i used service user menu tweaks recommended settings cnet avs forum , but never completely satisfied . hp-s6373 plasma didn't look so hot out box either , but after setting it movie mode ( no other adjustments ) , it looks amazing . it probably not completely fair compare rptvs plasma , but i am just providing my opinion based sets i've . reviewer mentions build quality leaves much desired . i haven't owned any other plasmas , but compared rptvs i've owned , this set pretty solid . tv level stand , so perhaps reviewer bad stand . only annoyance i set i hear slight buzzing noise when volume muted bright image displayed . i can't hear it where i sit haven't noticed it during normal viewing . i just read complaints buzzing some samsung 50 " sets , so i listening it . i get within couple feet set hear it , like i mentioned , it only audible bright images . compared much more significant green blob rainbow problems i previous sets - this non issue . sorry write so much , i just figured i would share my experience incase anybody else much trouble i've finding hdtv they happy . most people ( including my wife ) would completely happy sony sxrd or samsung dlp	1

i bought this printer because it recommended consumer reports magazine . it prints well , scanner copier good . it also prints good photos . this price , this good printer .	1
this affordable microphone perfect complement my olympus ws-300 digital audio recorder . i took it me overseas reporting trip , it functioned very well . i used it settings both crowded noisy , quiet solitary . mike handled everything well . clip sturdy never caused problems during my two-week journey , which i used device nearly every day several hours day . wind guard ( small round styrofoam-type covering ) worked well dampening extraneous noise . it picked up primary speaker voice easily . when i worked translator , i clipped mike his lapel it able clearly record his voice . interview subject more difficult hear , but that expected . extremely long cord positive people using video equipment who want stand long distance away subject . otherwise , i suggest you keep wire tied up rubber band or provided twisty-ties . i can't comment battery life small watch-type battery that included . i also purchased cheaper lavalier mike ( no wind protection , short wire ) but i recommend paying little extra this higher-quality gear . it well worth your money , sound quality very noticeable compared my built-in olympus mike . ( keep mind this monaural mike , so you don't get stereo sound .	1

now it up running it so reliable easy use we don't even think it . it great really fast fax machine also doubles usb laser printer copy machine . three " heads ups " you : first , there might learning curve if you've never owned fax machine before . you put this together it takes few minutes . pieces seem flimsy you might wonder if it going work but once you get it together if it works fine . second , manual printed very small font that hard read even my reading glasses . third , this machine you get " starter toner cartridge " good 300 pages . get " real " toner cartridge you spend well over hundred dollars . toner cartridge costs more than half price machine . you may also buy usb cable . so , toner cartridge service contract ( which i think you're foolish not buy ) sales tax my state included it upwards $500.00 get this thing up running , but now it faithful servant just sits there works . so far so good .	1

while not flawless setup , this server substantially more trouble-free than netgear ps330910 parallel print server . netgear would inexplicably stop working occasion one or more printers one or more computers small home network -- so printer would work one computer not , while printer would work all computers , while . after year messing it , i finally replaced it d-link which trouble free several months . only setup second printer bit counterintuitive ( need add printer name where instructions not so instruct )	1

i use recorder recording law lectures . sound very good , recorder good capturing voice distance . i olympus ws-320 before there huge difference . user interface uncomplicated . design nice but not luxurious . this recorder also important features time/date stamping , naming folder files very fast rewind function . some reviews critical battery door . personally i think it unusual but not impractical . my opinion it not weak link . it certainly better than olympus ws-320 . recorder bigger than most voice recorders . but size should not scare anyone . recorder small enough . my only critical comment recording light . it so bright . i wish edirol made software upgrade would enable me turn it . but it not big problem . i solved problem covering it up tape paper . i am very satisfied this recorder . i not think there better recorder my needs .	1

i always fan sony because they make quality products " user-friendly " . why i state complete shock this little blue cd walkman made sony , because it other end spectrum compared what they usually manufacture . first bad ... control buttons ( sound , changing tracks , pause , etc ) tiny nearly impossible read . i found myself hold cd player up my face find right button , i not any vision problems . little lcd screen hard read well . next , sound quality poor cheap " watered down " feel it . then there stock headphones product comes . these cheap don't fit well . i bought yellow " psyc " sony walkman couple years ago , one 3 times product this one . sound near-perfect buttons easy see use . headphones fit well whole package lasted no issues all . i wouldn't write sony off simply b/c this product , but i would definitely some research prior purchasing walkman them .	-1

i bought this product my tivo it broke within few weeks . other reviewers said , rj45 connector incredibly fragile it really not question if it break but when . i recommend netgear fa120 instead . instead flimsy flip-up , you plug cat-5 directly into sturdy box , it puts less pressure tivo usb port . how big company like linksys , all it money brainpower , delivers such obviously inferior product beyond me	-1
lets face it , you're not buying nike + ipod its stopwatch feature , you're buying it all other wonderful calculations it . after couple weeks , system pretty much waste me . i wear sensor shoe pouch which designed sensor ( nike likely never make shoes fit my 10eeee feet ) . i read reviews shoe pouch system works fine . here some examples my results : 80 minute easy run , appx . 6 miles , system reported i run 1.26 miles . 25 minute easy run , appx . 2.5 miles , system reported i run . 21 miles . 2 times around same track , fast pace , system reported i run . 21 . 24 km ( same lane ) . nike admits system 10% off before calibration . i couldn't get it calibrate because it kept indicating i not gone far enough ( although i ) . nike + ipod forums , i've seen good deal complaining system often off 20 - 30% or more , even after calibration . my results seem much worse than average . i'm used good bit " odd behavior " electronics software , so i'm willing take good bit stride . nike + ipod , however , performed far worse than anticipated out box . me , nike + ipod essentially stopwatch linked my ipod nano ( which makes it good deal harder use than stopwatch my wrist ) , nice voice , give me feedback how much time i've running or how much time i left . since many nike + ipod website features distance sensor ( log your miles , challenge others , etc . ) those features worthless me . i'll still use it until battery runs out ; why not ? i'll glad update this review if it starts working better . but so far , i think two stars generous .	-1

i found really good deal [ ... ] this monitor , i say i no regrets buying this 22 " ' economical ' monitor ! i've looking large lcd screen while , but prices good 22 " monitors pretty steep , until i came across this one . monitor itself bright , crisp , clear option set it 1680 1050 ( looks ) fantastic ! i'm also gamer , so far games i played ( prey , rtcw , half life 2 , splinter cell ... etc . ) , all look great ! i notice " backlight bleeding " ( which everyone feels compelled mention ) , but that only when booting up or something requires dos mode , basically ... it really doesn't bother me all . bottom line , if you get this under $300 ( including taxes/shipping ) , then buy it !! it well worth it	1

i bought this cleaner replace old maxell manual cleaner served me very well . i doubtful it would work because price so reasonable . though it worked majority disks i've tried it , this cleaner lite users only . if you often encounter disks require more intensive cleaning , then skip this one . those lite users , i would recommend using spray glass cleaner rather than included spray . regular use this cleaner eventually required you purchase new cleaning pad . problem you'll buy entire accessory kit full things you most likely never need just get one little pad . i'm not fan hidden costs . honestly , i haven't found replacement pad pad yet i anticipate i'll eventually just throw whole thing away get cleaner . tadaaa ! now you're back where you started .	1

i purchased this clock replacement older timex travel alarm clock i lost . while this model functions basic level , it disappointing overall . reviewer mentioned , this clock gains time quickly . after just couple days it minutes ahead actual time . if you only use clock weekend trips this probably won't much inconvenience , but longer trips or regular use home , this bit nuisance . i honestly say my entire life i never any clock , watch , or other appliance so poor keeping correct time . i also disappointed quality indiglo backlight this clock . my last travel alarm , well my indiglo watch , indiglo backlight bright makes characters easy read dark . however , this clock indiglo backlight feeble comparison . it just bright enough qualify usable , but if your eyesight isn't great combination weak backlight fact you probably aren't wearing contacts or glasses middle night may make this clock difficult you read . far user interface concerned , time display very large , but other on-screen items , such " alarm " indicator , not necessarily obvious quick glance display . indiglo button , you see picture , middle face unit . my last travel alarm placed this button top unit . if you imagine trying illuminate your clock pitch dark room , you probably guess which location more convenient . fortunately , all buttons you need set clock easily located lower half face unit . setting time/alarm clock pair up/down buttons move time one ( if you press release ) or 15 ( if you hold ) minute increments . this particularly useful making small time adjustments backwards . overall i very disappointed this clock . it lacks some ease-of-use features i'm used , it suffers poor craftsmanship . it relatively inexpensive it hasn't technically broken , but if i could go back time i would most certainly purchase different travel alarm	-1

sonic impact t-amp amazing product , even more so considering selling price . it main selling point device enable portable music player play through small set speakers , but it also developed cult following among high-end audio crowd . more second . t-amp small , smaller than you would think looking photos , very lightweight even when loaded eight aa batteries it takes power it . two battery compartments actually take up most space inside t-amp case , amplifier itself so small if you placed it centered top standard business card you would still 3/8 inch border around all four edges ( yes , i this , measured ) . t-amp very simple operate . connect pair speakers terminals back , plug whichever music player you like into back using standard 1/8 inch stereo plug , turn it you listening music ! black circle front case t-amp only control , which both power switch volume " knob " . knob actually flush front case , which makes it easily operated your thumb , feel perfectly natural ipod owners . there also provision external power supply back used ac adapter . t-amp run long time battery power , most people skip ac adapter . couple potential drawbacks , which minor enough considered " nit-picky " , speaker terminals only accept bare wire , it needs fairly thin ( 18-gauge ' lamp cord ' would pushing it ) , people expecting t-amp very loud may disappointed . 15 watts rated maximum output , so expect it able deliver 8-10 watts real life . sound : better speakers you plug into it , within reason , more you expect blown away quality sound . if you efficient loudspeakers , 90db or higher , t-amp fill medium-sized room wonderfully clear , detailed , undistorted sound unless you try push it past it power limit . i said earlier , this little amp developed quite following audiophile crowd , group not impress easily , especially something sells this cheaply . understand , we talking people who won't bat eye spending hundreds dollars one set interconnect cables , not mention what kind money " good " ( their definition ) amplifier cost . yet , many these same people posted bulletin boards all over internet singing praises t-amp , comparing it favorably high-end amps selling over 100 times cost t-amp . yes , 100 times . i am musician training/trade , i also work repairing high-end audio equipment . i skeptical first all hype audio discussion boards , but i figured 30-or-so dollars wasn't too much spend satisfy my curiousity . i amazed what i heard first time i tried t-amp . it good enough people may want careful what signal they feed into it because , most part , what goes into this thing definitely going come out louder other end . if you never able tell difference sound high-bitrate mp3 low-bitrate mp3 same song before , you able t-amp . fact , you able tell difference high-quality cd player " normal " cd player playing same disc . it good . t-amp built tripath t-series amplifier chips , success t-amp caused higher-end audio equipment manufacturers take notice . it not uncommon now find higher powered versions t-amp chip selling stereo amplifiers costing well excess $4000.00 . if you decide try one , you won't disappointed , unless you wanting something insanely loud .	1

i've owned many supposed " universal " remotes over years - they all disappointed one way or several . my needs fairly simple ... device turn on/off amp , tv , cable , vcr , dvd cd players . also duplicate many their separate functions . this surprisingly inexpensive remote it all . functions it doesn't duplicate automatically , it learn other remotes . it also learn operate series commands push one button . instructions fairly easy understand , i am completely satisfied . i never would imagined such cheap device could operate so comprehensively . i'm very grateful other reviewers here rating this so highly . i probably never would considered this one my own , their recommendations saved me good bit money	1

i'll make this short sweet - zen vision : terrific ! i'm techo challenged resistent newfangled gadgets but i enjoy this quality mp3 player . i good deal info digging comparrison shopping before settling this 30gb audio video player . i appreciate easy use gigantic screen design . i love terrific sound quality . digital photo display fantastic . this overall outstanding mp3 player . i despise ipod . i dislike scroll wheel navigation especially . i also resent overwhelming presence ipod . it seems " popular " i'm not into status symbols . besides , creative zen offers so much more . it clunkier looking than sleek ipod nano such but it packs lot good features . i said , i'm keeping this review brief . botttom line i really enjoy this fabulous player think it currently best deal . it worth good look if you're looking around nice , multi-functioning player . i love it	1
this gps works very well . i bought it mainly hunting , but wanted background map so it could useful while driving . i've only found one error map , road mislabeled , but it not enough throw you off track . once it good satellite link it almost impossible lose link . even cloudy days or cover trees ( or roof car when it sits cupholder ) it hasn't lost track . navigation works excellent " mark " button front makes it easy create point interest , no digging through menus find this operation . just push button go . my only complaints heading feature only gives degrees , not cardinal points ( north , south , east , west ) it doesn't record maximum or average speed , something nice trips . but these no reasons not purchase this fine gps magella	1
i only this 4 weeks , so i not tried out all possible combinations , but so far it meets all my expectations it lives up other reviews i read it before purchasing . this my first true a/v receiver ; i older onkyo amplifier provided good service over 15 years . i also upgraded my speakers 2 positions 5 front l/r , rear l/r center speaker . i fluance sv-10 onkyo added av-sc two av-bp2 speakers . room small enough i not need subwoofer . vsx-1016 configured route low frequencies two main speakers you choose bi-amp those speakers if you not want use 2nd zone feature . sound phenomenal . i not made jump large flat screen yet , so i cannot evaluate hdmi connections yet or any hd performance . cd dvd performance very good . after i used it more , i submit update . based performance value i would recommend this others	1

i bought this machine replace sportrak made same company 2 years ago . i liked features unit itself : larger screen , much brighter , better battery . it main problem it not compatible large library software maps ( mapsend ) made same company i purchased sportrak . there no bridging software make images compatible . you basically forced buy same maps again higher price . seemed unfair me so i returned it	-1
first off let me tell you what equipment i'm running it . it basic set up :d lp tv , sony dvd player , directv dvr , pioneer receiver . hdmi only running dvd v.v ery basic . first all programming via web breeze really . no hangups so many mentioned . i 20 minutes . basically long you get names model numbers your equipment you ok . i called direct tv get exact model number my dvr . after programming , oh i dsl internet , so it wasn't slow , remote immediately took over my others . it worked right off . some mentioned syncing problems . if you don't leave remote facing devices long enough when you use activity selections(watch tv , watch dvd , listen radio etc . ) then sometimes it turn first couple components not other , but help function quickly takes care this . you also get it all back synch if you simply press device button turn off other equipment then start new activities button again . i haven't really problems reading screen many mentioned functions pretty easy come soon you get used layout remote . it turns itself off after two hours non use when you pick it up it turns itself back . reason behind this particular remote purchase me ease set up activities buttons layout . i wanted something would user friendly so when i someone watching my house they could easily perform basic functions system like watching dvd without hitting wrong buttons messing up presets such receiver or things like tha t.t he only reason i don't give this five stars remote feel bit fragile side if you kids i could see them dishes out some mean punishment this thing . instance if you press soft number buttons harshly they get stuck under casing . this happened once . not big deal but still . i would say this not child friendly remote let them use ones came devices instead . other than . great product so far so good	1

i tried kensington it worked right out box ! there very minimal static . fm transmitter , really strength proven only when it capture active channel ( called capture effect some background noise due other transmission ) this transmitter without any problems ! transmission frequency very stable well . you hear audio clip certain high pitches ... but this again very typical any modulation-demodulation scheme . i not expect cd quality ( it never cos this analog ! ) but audio qualiy great	1
this product worth every dollar . it audible ready so i listen my audio books listen my music . fantastic !!!	1
these phones great ! i'm not audiophile , but i appreciate good sound . stock ipod buds average best , they hurt my ear something awful . so i tried some sennheiser buds ... better sound , but painful ears again . so i started searching some in-ears . you may or may not know , quality in-ears expensive . i saw couple reviews these jvc decided give them try . again , i'm not audiophile , but these sound so good ! they bring music my ipod life ! i jam loud i want ( i know , i know ) not disturb anybody . comfort ! omg , it feels like nothing . they light air ! they come three sizes plugs so you get best fit . search in-ear phones see how they supposed fit . if you aren't getting good bass , it because you don't proper seal bud your ear . regarding durability , i've them six months not problem yet . i'm not most careful person my electronics ... just so you know , i need new screen my ipod :( these phones everywhere my ipod still like new , no static or anything . i'm going order couple more pairs just case jvc loses their mind stops making them .	1
cable seems well built length great . connectors appear high quality . unfortunately , i use cable hook up dvi output my powerbook hdmi input my philips lcd tv picture off-center edges cut off . i don't know if this computer fault or tv fault or cable fault ( missing signaling lines or something ? ) so i'm hesitant give it 5 star rating . sorry	1

i tried this out slim out my collections which grown too unweildly , like many others here , i'm sure . :) what i really like these besides slimness how it locks . case lock really simple , two clicks corners slotted grooves edges . i'm fine this opposed those additional hinges which flip over edge . it not guvmint secrets locked away . i've dropped these accident , normal waist height , it didn't pop open . that all you really need . inside locking . i like this one very much well since it easy utilize . there ubiquitous circle middle , but right side , when you push down center , it like opening box center edge moved away , disc free removed . otherwise , it stays nicely . i've transfered my normal dvd sleeves into slim ones shaving off 1/4 off left right . full width 10.5 " , so you play around your own which side dvd sleeve content you want keep . bear mind though keep titles spine , you let spine b/w 5 " 5.25 " mark . if anyone wants get me some birthday gift , aug 13th , feel free click my wish list . :) clear ones though , i don't know why coloured or black ones more expensive . it doesn't matter , i've got sleeve artwork inserts them , ones i use my productions , clear ones allow additional space info artwork around disk edges	1

i use this xbox 360 gaming computer graphic work . first off , it 1 1 pixel mapping , which means , your picture complete down exact pixel . hardly any monitors this feature this screen size . ones nearly double price , even then there only 3 models i know , 2 them around $2000-$2500 , other around $1800 . back 12/06 . what this means under grand , i beautiful 37 lcd computer monitor , dwarfs my two samsung 20 inchers retail over $500 each ( because resolution ) . i deal colors fine image details , computer monitor , it unbelievably great . gaming ... i connect my 360 vga cable , set resolution tv 360 1080p voila . awesome . i just bought ghost recon 2 ( graw 2 ) , which supports 1080p . it beyond description . gears war beyond description even though it not 1080p game . if you wondering it affected my kills/death ratio graw ... they gone 10/10 15/5 . sometimes even 20/5 . you see enemies you would never able see regular screen . this only tv i know you get 1080p throug component cables . yes right . i've never tried it , but it supports it . ghosting ... i've yet notice it any game . speaking connections , this everything , vga , dvi , s-video , composite etc ., but only one hdmi . could problem when you get more than one hd device , but i wouldn't hold against this product . movies .. i not watched many it yet . not watched any hd movies it all . i can't comment , but i notice some motion blur close up man face when he interviewed during special feature " making star wars . " other words , it wasn't shot like normal moview would . i've never seen anything during normal scenes . picture quality nice , but i really can't compare it because i don't know what hd movies look like . put it this way , it plenty better than my previous tv movies . television ... it doesn't come tuner , but you get one your cable guy form cable box ( or satellite ) . i not watched any tv it . i can't give opinion . overall , this probably one best purchases i made long time . price , i don't think you go wrong . i am considering buying one so i dual 37 . screens , already would , but they jacked price up right after i bought it . bottom line if you looking gaming tv , this it hands down .	1

when you move significantly above $100 mark headphones , one naturally expects superior sound build quality - things found competing phones like grado sr125 , alessandro ms1 , or even sony mdr-v6 . one thing , body these headphones made relatively flimsy plastic , lends little way confidence product . sound - part matters - may impress neophyytes their strong bass , but balance richness tone sorely absent . perhaps that why may triport owners find themselves defecting other products . bose earned name through aggressive advertising name recognition , but if you're savvy shopper ( willing look some superb competing headphones ( sometimes half price ) , you your music better place	-1
listen up !!! these babies some best my experience , which rather limited . i say , though , i've heard some things songs i didn't realize there , instance : song , " downward spiral , bottom " , nine inch nails off , " further down spiral " amazing song anyway , when i heard it through these phones , i heard sounds coming , not only my right left , but underneath me , within my head , well undefined place away me . it weirdest thing . course those sounds came me right left , but headphones brought out those strange dimensions music . all frequencies superb , bass full . good metal , country , really anything not too soft , it open design , so real quiet music tends drowned out outside noise , like my vacuum . one caveat : cord substantial , 10 feet long . i would rather 4 foot cord or so , but that simply because i use it my portable , not my home stere o.o verall , very good comfortable headphones . get ' em !!!	1

sport bose bashing aside , keep mind these relatively small enclosures two 2.5 inch drivers crate rear sound stage much larger than their size might suggest , so without overly fussy placement . there always seems someone out there who sets their surround settings " large " , pumps up bass , then complains two 2.5 inch drivers small vented plastic enclosures " no lows " , sound distorted . neither vcs 10 center channel or 161s play ear-busting levels -- trade off small drivers small enclosures , theatre surround settings bass management must set accordingly . doing this , bose 161s ( especially when paired vcs 10 ) produce clear focused dialog convincing surround effects smaller rooms . you " better " ? sure , larger enclosures , bigger drivers play louder lower but doesn't mean bose don't deserve consideration basis good performance given their style size . if you throw little money issue want really exceptional performance relatively small speaker enclosures , consider legacy audio victoria speaker system very good multi channel theatre amp separate processor like those offered adcom or parasound .	1

last reviewer stated center channel speaker " barely audible " speakers " sounded horrible " . there nothing wrong these speakers . they made high-quality components probably your best bang your buck . first , first reviewer probably trying listen stereo sound through his surround sound system . reason there very little sound coming through center channel probably because receiver makes center channel phantom channel , where left right signals stereo sound combined put through center " filler " speaker . or ... if reviewer hooked up his dvd player receiver using just two rca inputs , he get stereo sound here well , even though dvd encoded dolby digital surround . receiver try make stereo sound into surround using dolby prologic surround when given stereo inputs , this less-than-digital performance , sometimes needing some extra tweaking receiver order get ample dialogue . bottom line : everything depends receiver connections you using your dvd player receiver . if receiver not quality , it may not put enough power into speakers , or it may put unclean power speakers causing them distort . if you not using digital coaxial cable or optical cable your dvd player your dolby digital receiver ( make sure it decoder ) , then sound most likely stereo sound synthesized into doly prologic surround , which simply mixes channels into center , where some dialogue could lost . if you right equipment you know how set it up correctly , you love these speakers	1
i bought 10-pack tdk tapes april , 2005 - boxes say : " tdk - superior quality - standard t-120 " - " vhs standard grade " - " videotape everyday repeated use recording " . tapes work so far , grainy blurry pictures colors not vivid sound quality horrible distorted . packaging not up amazon standards . video tapes not wrapped or protected inside box this probably why i least 1 broken tape ( plastic cassette broke off ) . they not protected box all . i'm very disappointed these video tapes . not sure if " tdk " going down hill or if all big name brand video suppliers lowering their standards . this first time few years i bought new vhs tapes they low quality i would expect generic no-name brand tape . since i need video tapes now , i forced order tapes other companies . i trying some other brands see if tdk standard tapes only brand name tapes lowering their standards . i'm going try some maxell rca standard tapes hope better luck	-1

truth , i'm cheapskate . this particular model happens cheapest they stock my local office depot , so i've kind loyal logitech customer years without particularly vested brand itself . first , good part : mouse very comfortable hand . while not ergonomic , it works perfectly if you mousepad built-in wrist support ( common freebie tech tradeshows -- testimony my cheapness ) . installation , there no installation -- plug it into usb port you're ! control good crisp . wheel gets job . it should also noted it doesn't come any bells whistles -- all . other mice multiple wheels , built-in scroll buttons special keys everything except fetch you coffee . this model only comes two buttons wheel , period , but if you're like me you'll just appreciate simplicity . bad news buttons wear out within 6-9 months . this especially notable left button , which gets most wear . 6 months , you start pushing only towards outer edge click register . 9 months , you press pretty hard . if you make it all way year , you're stuck hammering upper-left corner like madman every time you need click something . that only bad thing it though , price it easy enough up new one when old mouse starts showing signs wear	1

i bought this amazon half price local retailers . arrived two days amazon prime free shipping . mount good , simple sturdy . i put it into studs left right sides . fit tight studs extreme edges mounts openings . others stated , find measure stud locations . not much room play if your studs aren't standard distance apart . i would not use it drywall alone 50 " plasma tv . if you light weight lcd you might able get away mounting it dry wall . because my stud location i off center 6 inches my prime location wall but i got over it quickly . once placed you slide tv left or right couple inches but no more then . you also take tv off wall mount change connections if you need too . easy , just lifts off , but takes 2-3 people my heavy 100 lb plasma . no room fingers behind tv . i would buy it again	1

past 5 years i built system composed polk speakers front center channels , but never got around puchasing rears . i instead used pair infinities i received relative no cost . those rears both blew after several months annoying flutter sounds , i made decision get some new rears , preferbly polk . i wanted speaker sounded great , yet didnt blow hole my pocket , leaving me regret . so i what i loved ; research . when it comes home theatre equipment , i find alot joy research well shopping best price . if your fan electronics , im sure many you relate . so , i came across several polk models worthy buy , one them seemed expensive , other too cheap small . m30 perfect size price . i took stab it without even listening it , because i trust polk audio . once i installed them listed , i blown away . they needed little fine tuning , but thats it . i could hear every detail 5.1 surround without over powering . they sounded much better than my old infinitys . bottom line , buy these , they perfect addition your home theatre	1

so far these overlays great investment . after month or two use , i feel totally fine carrying my black ipod video around otherwise unprotected . kit includes cleaning wipes , lint free towel dry . cleaning wipes you probably better . right light i see oily sheen under film . but 98% time i not notice it . otherwise overlay excellent way keep ipod feeling " naked " while same time preventing scratches both front back ( two overlays included package )	1
love double screens , this best investment we made long time . great thing this dvd player you use it anywhere - hook it tv , use it car , or just house extra player when two kids fighting over what move watch ! glad we bought it	1
initially this unit seemed work pretty well . i wasn't thrilled copyright protection issues or extremely slow time load , but i decided try work it . six months , this player often arbitrarily decides not record sometimes , it often stops recording regular tv programming ( my wife favorite soap ) due " copyright issues " - completely ridiculous ! now this unit not output any audio signals all . stay away this piece garbage . i used respect sony quality - i never buy them again	-1

this tv incredible value ! i've owned it over 6 months never one problem . initially , i installed my subwoofer it , but sound speakers come set so good i rarely turn subwoofer . picture excellent all angles . people who see this always assume i paid much more it . yes , you'd probably get better paying 5 times this price ... but technology improves so quickly ( this one upgraded downloads ) , why pay more . i mine living room since i sit closer tv there . my bedroom , which larger i'm further tv , i'd probably go up next largest size . i love this one lightweight enough move ease ... myself . it world improvement if you still watching tv one those large square box , heavy weight tvs . price low enough when new technology requires me replace it , i'll feel if i've gotten great value money spent move next upgrade	1
we got this bedroom tv so we could watch dvds together after kids go sleep , it fantastic ! there essentially no setup , plugged it right directv receiver it looks great . we also got associated mounting arm easily mounted it wall giving us extra floor space . overall , this great deal -- this good size average bedroom . i think 37 " version this might overkill	1
i am using this my children cd-rom games . it also holds dvd cases nicely . my children 3 , 5 7 tend not put discs back when they them or can't find games they want play . this storage container makes discs easy find clean up . it also sturdy much nicer appearance than some other storage solutions . i leave them shelf it keeps things orderly while looking good	1

i like fact you could change fan speed . 2 available rpm choose , i use low browsing high gaming or when i'm defraging my hd . temp drop noticeable . some people mentioned fan noise bit loud . when you it high speed , fan noise noticeable but i don't think it bad . blue lights pretty nice too considering i white laptop it glows over my lid . definitely recommended people who would mind little fan noise not willing pay like $40+ cooler	1

i initially dismissed this product because it looked cheap , seemed priced accordingly . but after reading some reviews , i decided buy it risk whopping 24 bucks . it great buy . what it - it switches your vga monitor two computers , your usb keyboard usb mouse . it two buttons device control switching . it two usb ports go your keyboard your mouse . it three vga ports . one goes your monitor ( you use cable you already ) . two go your two computers . interestingly , kvm-to-computer cable , special cable included ( two them ) , also carries usb signal . cable splits computer end you connect vga connector usb connector their respective ports your computers . what it not - it not switch audio . it not designed switch additional usb devices , although it may work some devices not need high bus-power , if your keyboard acts unpowered hub . device itself powered computer usb bus it not separate power supply . this exactly what i needed . kvm stands keyboard , video , mouse . that all i wanted switch two computers ( mac linux pc laptop ) . i considered other kvm devices , they more features such audio switching special software , but they cost much more than this simple device . package comes software switching , but it windows only . docs say it hot key , scroll lock key hit twice succession , controls switch . however , it not work me , probably because my mac keyboard which not dedicated scroll lock key . however , device sitting next my keyboard , i just hit appropriate button ( 1 or 2 ) switch . it quite small . switching nearly instant . what could more simple than ? few things i tried ... it works fine 1600x1200 , 75 hz . my normally used mac resolution 1280x960 75 hz . my linux laptop old only externally output 1024x764 60 hz , which also works fine . i not see any degrading picture quality going through this kvm . my monitor 19-inch crt . summary , trendnet tk207k 2-port usb kvm switch works great great price . if simple two-way kvm vga/usb what you need , i recommend this one	1

i never give out 5 star reviews , because i never feel any product perfect , or complete . but i say , this definetely best ipod case out there . my first case agent 17 ( or it 18 ? ) ipod photo , which i " thought " i liked alot until i opened case found ipod screen all scratched . since i bought video ipod , i gone through least 3 cases , read extensive reviews least half dozen . what convinced me buy this these : ( 1 ) it currently top rated apple store , ( 2 ) myriad color options , ( 3 ) it belkin , which very respectable company , one first jump wagon ipod accessories since its revolution . i am glad i bought it , even though most reviews hint natural scratching outer case . well , i don't really care long ipod itself protected . that reason why i bought it first place . case comes ready both 30gb 80gb sizes ( they supply extra bigger back case 80gb , which what i ) . case fits perfectly , even protects wheel ( option not available most cases ) , there gaps every single outlet ( hold , earphones , dock ) so you needn't take ipod out unless necessary . color awesome , which tempting me go ahead buy case switch two . it sold via jr huge plus . their shipping time excellent . couple days latest . go get yours . you not disappointed .	1
i purchased my eton here amazon $99 received mine several weeks ago great anticipation . wait worth it , since digital tuning very good reception make radio well worth price paid . i own large collection shortwave radios feel this radio competes well some my classic 70s/80s era receivers which extremely selective cost more than eton/grundig hardware . only minor dig i cheap nature tuning knob desire venier tuning control . i fudge tuning bit fine touch , but it take some attention , especially some stations drift out . casual listening , this radio extremely stable very good field use trips . i fired mine up out box immediately impressed solid feel large high-quality antenna . leather grip heavy-duty feel more than compensate my tuning knob complaint i feel this unit competes well my smaller grundig radio sees active use when camping hiking . i am uncertain if am band tuned using ferrite internal antenna this model testing unit external antenna see if dxing am stations possible this model ... it probably standard ferrite antenna but it sure would nice find i extend function s350 this pleasant hobby dxing remote am stations . one other nice modification would eton evolve s350dl support simple circuit memory stations . it would logical thing would worth few extra dollars some more intelligence built into rig . overall , $99 i spent , very good deal radio i'll own very very long time . if this your first shortwave radio , it good purchase good introduction hobby	1

after jumping then off this system band wagon 40 times last month , my wife i finally decided get this system . when i decided i finally going break down get some speakers , cause ones my tv going out , i originally saw this system infomercial fell love it , just because it simplicity . after reading reviews online , i admit i leery it , since it didn't really shine some people . but after visiting factory store this last weekend las vegas getting hear this system , i realized what it , it outstanding . first all , if you wanting full 5.1 or 7.1 system , don't buy this . if you want run wires get true surround sound , this system isn't what you looking . know what you buying people . but if you looking adequate solution better sounding tv , games dvd , then this system you . these little speakers subwoofer able bounce sound off walls make you feel like you surrounded sound . we big living room this set up , it works great . 15 25 room vaulted ceilings , it still sounds great . we watch mission impossible ii our first full length movie it delivered like theater . we then put grand daddy tests me . jurassic park . t-rex scene clear loud scary ever . set up really easy too . took me 2 hours , but because i really careful keep my cords organized also really lazy not pulling tv out wall . dvd until runs well my direct tv xbox . i can't wait load up game see how sound . far regular tv viewing , we watched grammy last night , you could hear crowd noise like it around you , not just coming you . all all , this unit exceptional . what it , it great . true , it isn't same true surround sound system , but i don't think it claims . we bought this system starter , cause when we build new house we going run speaker wire true system them move this one our master bedroom future use . we used this 10 year old tv too , it like tv brand new . we plan adding 46 flat screen near future , so i only imagine experience get better . my recommendation , take these reviews ( even mine ) grain salt . try find factory store where you go hear them person , then come here buy if you want . they also great deals refurbished systems , which carry same warranty new systems . you save 300 bucks just buy one someone returned because they didn't like it get same warranty .	1

these great headphones . i am very picky sound but not want pay high prices . therefore there compromise , but not much . these sound great all types music go louder than many over head phones . i compared it 5 or 6 other headphones below $30 . i compared against jensen full size headphones i put aside comparing less than one minute . then i compared against phillips hsp2500 . [ phillips sounded louder but bass muddier . music vocal didn't separate clearly . ] again , i compared this sony mdr-xd200 . sony mdr-xd200 louder due its sensitivity but didn't give clear sound . only headphone i liked besides these koss ur21c but lacked loudness long cord . $7 above average sound quality , you never go wrong . oh yeah , it very comfortable . i wear these work long hours doesn't hurt even my glasses	1

i bought these speakers originally replacement pair weathered boston acoustics attached our overhead lattice back yard . these speakers very detailed i hear components music within tracks i would not expect able hear outdoors . said , bass extesion not great , but , given frequency range , i didn't expect it . i ended up reconditioning boston speakers also hooked these up . combination their bass extension ( must 40-50hz ) detailed polks extremely compelling , making outdoor listening surprisnigly good . even though one might pay more lower extension polks , it probably worth it if you like music . these good price , but limited . that not critisism , i knew this when i bought them ; i just hoping physics changed since last owner house bought bostons !	1

i've using this phone 2 years now ... fuming cheap nickel cadmium battery amount time well ! when i purchased it , this panasonic top-of-the-line phone . so naturally , i just assumed they used nickel hydride battery -like my last panasonic phone : kx-tg2550s . i didn't even notice battery right away . but when i finally got around opening up back handset , i * horrified * see nicd label ! since ' memory effect ' nickel cadmium batteries well known , using one something like cordless phone inexcusable ! this because it recharged frequently , usually never fully discharged -and unusable when it . [ ok , so you still use speakerphone base , gah ! might well just plug regular phone ! ] those haven't battery issues probably singing different tune after number months when nicd battery power output nosedives . since i've better battery performanace , there aint no going back ! there no other reason decision use such inferior technology , except save few bucks . or more likely , since panasonic replacement battery costs $20-25 , cash because they need replaced more often . [ absurd price because all battery consists -i took one apart- 3 aa size batteries ] fortunately , energizer now makes nickel hydride [ nimh ] replacement battery this phone , search amazon energizer er-p511	1

cd-rs much needed thing me . even if i still my music ipod , i still lot documents my computer . i definitely big enough hard drive store all my weird documents online-schooling such . but sometimes i go library or use different computer or so . i prefer using cd-rs rather than jumpdrive because they easy forget don't store very large amount -- which i believe it should price you paying those things . cd-rs less costly i don't need many , just few basically " just work " . these sony cd-rs just ! whenever i'm shopping cd-rs i look see what most inexpensive reliable brand . i most luck cd-rs sony , maxell , philips -- all three which decent manufacturers . tdk never seem burn speed they advertise . imation just seem coasters . memorex cd-rs paint always seem chip off just months after use . so i try searching those three brands . almost everytime sony always sale way below list price . i don't really need jewel cases either since i no desire keep my old documents -- least those date back months ago . jewel cases seem much more inexpensive when i don't buy them cd-rs . i suppose companies add them your cd-rs so you find them " value " . using sony cd-rs easy . i just like i any cd-r , burn my files through nero . i won't say these completely burn free , but even great maxell couple mess-ups every once awhile . but whether i'm burning music ( whatever reason since i now ipod ) or burning important documents , these cd-rs very trusty very little burn errors . maxell slightly more reliable than these , but price i can't see how you go wrong . these cd-rs also seem last fairly long me . i couple discs dating back early 2004 seeing some minor scratch top disc , but it certainly nothing unusable . some discs dating back then actually pretty good condition compared my tdk imaton discs . some reviewers complain data-loss after year or so after burning , but i yet notice this . all my cd-rs sony seem play fine any cd player i use my computer whatever age disc . bottom disc doesn't scratch easily other brands but collects fingerprints fairly well , which again why i like using jewel cases . also , cd-rs very clean-cut , meaning they lots room write . overall , these sony cd-rs work just fine me . they don't show many burn errors last good long time , plus sony name . they aren't quite good maxell cd-rs , but get job cheaper price . general , good " gets job without spending tons " cd-r . 4 stars	1

hdtv well packed worked just fine . picture fantastic over air hd stations , but not many true hd but merely digital low def ( most day ) . remote control very weak i rebuild it better performance . speakers put out such loud treble pops especially womens voices people cover their ears , so i reroute sound through headset jack my stereo . i could routed it differently through other rca jacks , but olevia their infinite wisdom made volume control not work such instance . i control ' headset ' volume remote however , though it dummied down nearly bass free sound . my last support letter olevia their abyssmal speakers received no reply . tv good value what it , but like any product , many shortcomings , tv stations even more it seems . they all abusing their hd bandwidth multiple copies 480i low def multicasting rarely use their bandwidth high definition . let hope us government demands they transmit least one hi def channel out their 5 or 6 broadcasting options . cable companies , beware , watch out missing dolby stereo jpg like image compression	1

this awesome scanner . compact , powerful , loaded features . easy use right out box . scans police frequencies , too ! crisp clear sound quality . this my 4th scanner i've ( i'm fire-medic)and it wonderful . but if you're so freaking inept you can't function without using computer find your front door or if you're so nieve you don't even know if your local pd scrambles their radio signals or if you think programming this unit more difficult than dialing cellphone or if you're so stuck yourself you can't miniature nascar logo your scanner ( which , way , every picture ever produce this unit ) , then this unit not one you ! ( i believe they still make play-doh . ) my guess your cousin your wife one same . but if you want quality product you'll happy you bought , this you . once you take it out box , just go [ ... ] click your state city you'll all frequencies you need . experiment different frequencies , well . enjoy	1

i looking small inexpensive pda ( windows pocket pc ) i would use reading books , playing few games , keep my contacts . there only few like available us . ipaq rx4200 just came out i decided give it try . my previous pda dell axim x3 . it smaller than most pdas , especially screen ( only 2.8 inches ) but it well build very comfortable hands . reading books rx4200 very comfortable ( i use haali reader - excellent free program reading books ) . screen bright - imho better quality then axim x3 - pda very comfortable hand , especially landscape mode . stylus good size , only issue it placed bottom left corner ( if you hold pda landscape mode ) it little difficult take out . overall i like it lot - due its size build quality . people who want play games it - there might issue - there no directional pad all this pda , so basically only games played it those stylus .	1

while it appears i finally this switch mostly working , i say i'm very dissapointed it performance . iogear usb emulation keyboard mouse works very very poorly . keyboard mouse plugged into correct keyboard/mouse usb ports i would continually slow/stuck keyboard really poor mouse behaviour . i work around this plugging my keyboard/mouse into rear usb ports , thus bypassing keyboard emulation . this works although you wait all your usb devices re-enumerate every time you switch computers . while my mac powerbook works fine dvi switch , my pc quite often problems recognizing dvi monitor when switching back it . unplugging reconnecting lcd dvi connector into switch seems bring it back life . no idea where problem , but i dell 2001fp monitor , windows xp sp2 ati radeon 9800 ( everything running latest drivers/firmware ) . how iogear could shipped product this broken beyond me . unless they release firmware update fixes these problems i only recommend people stay well away this product	-1

i only ever owned color ink jet printers such epson brother , but i must say , laser printing , hp takes cake . i own hp laserjet 4 plus ( monochrome b/w ) it worked great me 6 years plus . this new machine definitely major improvement . first off , it very easy set up you choose whether it run off usb port , or you network it through your system . i personally it connected my wireless d-link router i 2 windows pcs , 1 toshiba wireless laptop , 2 wireless macs networked all them able pick up hp provided hp software disk all able print it . it also prints so fast remarkably quiet . it monster machine size ( prepared nice big space it , both heighth , width length - it ( wxlxh ) 18.00 " 16.00 " 15.00 " but remember , you need room feed front it , you need room wires back ) . it takes 4 different cartridges ( cyan , magenta , yellow black - cmyk ) so this costly . cartridges run $80 each , so it costs $320 replace all them , however , they last whopping 2500 pages each color . it would take 5 ink cartridges each color last long . when toner low , you get warning . you even view printer network any connected computer see exactly how many pages left each cartridge ( based averages ) . bad : i'll try not leave bad comment this final thing say , however , it quite lousy paper feeder . i may doing something wrong , but i've found you only print one piece paper time . sometimes i print out lot stuff one-side paper , then , when i'm looking it , i turn paper over , place those manual feeder , then use paper again more printing other blank side . you can't really this . far printing business cards , or cardstock , it not best . you can't simply lay paper tray then printer print it . you insert paper special way , wait printer " suck " paper , then once it it , it able print . it print generic avery labels okay though . all all , it great . oh , there one astounding point i forgot make : it prints both sides without change paper around or anything , called duplexing ( sorry , i didn't know these terms before ) . example , i 14-page document print out , so i just went ' finishing ' tab selected ' print both sides ' wahlah , it printed 7 pieces paper , two-sided absolutely flawlessly , without touch or insert anything . i eventually printed 200 double-sided brochures shiny color magazine type paper , printing perfect . if you don't need this printer network , you don't need duplex ( double-sided ) printing , get much cheaper hp 1600 color laser . otherwise , color laser printer under $500 able networked duplex among other things , it really great deal all around , thus , it gets 4 stars . i deduct one star bad paper feeder , but aside , it superb . get yours now - cartridges already it full-sized ( not sample cartridges ) , so it ready go . you may need network cable , but it come usb 2.0 cable just case you don't one . enjoy thank you reading	1
i purchased this radio primarily shortwave use week ago radioshack $50 , it my first . other reviews consistent its performance am/fm bands - strong impressive . shortwave reception also good , but there limitations which may or may not reflect radio itself . it important read introduction shortwave featured instruction booklet , so you know where start . here some other lessons learned . i just returned business trip outside boston , where i unable tune any shortwave signals my hotel room second floor near window . i listening night tried all 7 bands . home , i only able tune two stations sw1 , also during night time period . this disappointing . however , last night i hit paydirt . i took radio bedroom , second floor our house , found many stations several bands . addition number us stations , i heard stations western europe , cuba , what i think korean station , also what sounded like russian or some eastern european language . since our neighborhood consists closely spaced houses , i guess i should not surprised poor first-floor performance . not sure what problem near boston . i like volume dial one side radio , tuning dial other . way , you scan different frequencies , you adjust volume background noise increases or fades . one thing i noticed digital display displays 0.5 incremental changes frequency , but i think it tunes more finely than this . i might hit . 5 mark , tune ever so slightly , hear something different even though digital readout not change . since it analog tuner , i suppose this makes sense . unfortunately , i already grown impatient radio before first positive experience described above . haste , i decided get different radio instead , just ordered kaito ka1103 . those considering several models , i digress share results search portable sw radio good sensitivity until $150 ( street prices ) . reviews radios found eham.net under " reviews " " receivers general " there select reviews other sites such radiointel.com . top contenders $80-$150 category ( street prices ) sony 7600 , sangean ats909 , grundig yb400 , kaito ka1103 . grundig s350 also popular , but i saw one radioshack it quite large . i read every review i could find , narrowed choices kaito sony based performance considerations . then i phoned universal-radio.com after talking sales person , settled kaito $90 ( they sell both finalist models ) . sony may slight edge holding signal , reportedly built like tank , but kaito significantly cheaper (...) . addition , kaito comes charger , rechargeable batteries , external antenna . sony features none these . univeral radio told me charge sony offer extra money junk , they sold there own custom built units . radio made shortlist kaito ka1101 . several reviewers commented they really liked model . (...) i also learned recently there book called passport world band radio considered indispensible learning what sw stations out there where when find them broadcasting . they also lots radio reviews . (...) . here some links you might want check out : reviews http://www.eham.net/reviews/products/8http://www.radiointel.com/reviews.htm (...) if you strapped cash , also consider grundig fr200 fr300 (...) . both offer am/fm . fr200 offers sw1 sw2 fr300 offers weather bands . tuners analog function well . these considered ' emergency radios ' such offer other things . addition radio functions , they charged using attached hand crank ( or run aa batteries ) . hand crank charge cells phones ( multiple adaptors included ) . fr200 white led flash light , red led flasher , siren , also weather alert . latter interesting . you radio silent , but set ' alert ' setting . if weather alert sent national weather service , radio beep . kind cool . however , we found they issue these alerts 1-2 times week , response what many people would not consider real emergency ( wind gusts up 25 mph emergency ? ) so , i turn off alert function unless i know there possibility serious weather conditions	1

all who interested mz-rh1 , i recently this item purchased japan silver . black model same , some ways better only due manual english . machine itself , there clear definition per sony maturity its years since inception minidisc . after purchasing 10th anniversary n10 model , then it stolen , i hesitant purchasing model fear there update better . mz-rh1 , i no fear this model define sound reputation minidisc rest its years . it clearly lit oled screen side player simply brilliant , conserving battery life while displaying necessary functions player . one downside lack group button . those familiar minidisc know sonicstage stores your music groups , pressing group button skip groups so you find album you looking . this missing player itself , but it handily found remote those who choose use it . those us who really take our sound quality seriously , this player/recorder most clear balanced sound i ever heard any minidisc , quite arguably any recorder . sony not hesitant create this model portable recording studio . i am impressed sound , which rivals compact disc quality , it levels line out never distort . not mention new version sonic stage much more user-friendly than before , compability apple's; finally ! i now record my brother dj mixes into my mz-rh1 , then copy into sonic stage , burn cd ( files recorded hi-md discs saved sonic stage wav . files ) , then share friends . it quite simply portable recording studio . thank you sony creating music recorder finally satisfy your demanding customers .	1

just recently purchased this amazon , few hiccups shipping but these things happen , since price online great shipping free it doesn't hurt bad overlook mishap . it hard begin praise quality sound picture your going get amount money you pay this htib ( home theater box ) system . i am far no expert but i worked car audio industry 5 years now few friends expensive surround systems so i know difference quality sound , decent sound bad sound . there noticable difference quality this high end stuff which expected , but price your paying this sony system can't beat . set up breeze connecting everything very easy . sound crisp clear . i got my 42 lcd tv few weeks before this while i watching movies off xbox360 . picture great but sound really didn't add up . this system provided sound level quality equal picture . there few times when i jumped up while loungin couch cause sound so real . also if your gamer pick up optical cable 360 run it through this system it broadcast games 5.1 digital which change your life . if your gamer digital cable , you'll need pick up digital coaxial cable well otherwise you'll switch optical 360 cable if you want watch cable 5.1 picture wise dvds look great , i tell noticable difference quality upscaling vs watching dvd reg . player . bear mind it not going look like hd dvd or blu ray movie but its pretty close should satisfy most people . now addressing some critics out there . it load really slow it hard keeping track discs . my point why would you 5 dvds loaded first place you only watch one movie time , unless your marathoning sopranos or sergio leone movie night there no need . i've keeping slots one two open dvd leaving other 3 music which seems divide things up makes it more easy keep track things . sub way loud . i'm amazed sony didn't put control knob sub box , my previous cheaper phillips system well my computer speakers . this reason why its not five star system . contrary other claims you adjust sub . you go setup menu customize setup ( this after you auto cal . ) sound quality music isn't greatest , cds sound pretty good but if you hook laptop up digital music volume pretty low . when its all said , quality you get this system well beyond price tag . it few kinks doesn't sound like ultra high end system , but you really don't need something like your house unless you huge home theater room anyway . styling this system retro pretty cool speakers look great , picture sound awesome	1
i use it computer monitor , playing xbox , watching digital cable . it well worth its price highly recommend it anyone . excellent picture quality . only one problem ; one four holes used mounting tv wall stripped out very easily . makes you weary just thinking putting it up . if you , buy original manufacturer mount instead aftermarket .	1

this dock waste me . it came home av pack . i wanted durable zune case would look good protect screen same time . toughskin case all three exactly what i looking protection . only down side toughskin case zune not fit this docking station while it case . i believe engineering problem docking station . this not bulky case , it fits zune perfectly , however , even removing insert docking station , zune not fit dock while case . why they didn't make docking station would accommodate zune fitted case , makes no sense . no one going want take trouble removing case each time they dock their zune . they should take these docking stations back customers who feel i replace them their expense something works ! toughskin case , i highly recommend it ; other cases just didn't seem offer this quality protection while also nice professional appearance .	-1

works feels just like laptop keyboard touchpad mouse . while touchpad little imprecise and/or touchy , it no more so than what you would find laptop . i use it conjunction my home theater pc which displays big screen tv , it works great set up . i give it only four stars due its high cost given its lack advanced features or technology . i mention i somewhat concerned confused when i received product box stated " mini keyboard " . you read elsewhere , there " mini " model many people trouble . after contacting amazon what i thought shipping mistake ( receiving identical item when quickly re-shipped ) i determined comparing model numbers dimensions adesso site i received correct model spite confusing " mini " designation box . all all , quite satisfied product amazon customer service , what essentially non-issue .	1
gaming , steelsound 5h usb v2 best i used date . they comfortable , cover entire ear ( but don't give you headache like other full-ear headsets ) , sound great ... after adjusting equalizer bit . straight out box , games sounded extremely " tinny " , microphone had/has very annoying high pitched noise sounds like electronic interference . after checking friends who also use this headset , after bypassing usb dongle , you see microphones poor quality comes usb attachment . after teammates ventrilo complain annoying feedback noise , i spent hour adjusting microphones volume usb soundcard drivers , ventrilo . those you also this problem , raise your microphones volume soundcard control , lower your volume ventrilo / teamspeak / whatever you use . even after tweaking it , there still buzz , but i'm told it isn't annoying . if it weren't , this headset would get 5 stars , but poor quality microphone input usb device drags it down bit . aside , amazing sound after you go mess equalizer . music , games , sound great	1

i bought this scanner when my old faithful mustek gave up ghost . i like this one because it sleek turned it side if space problem . i also like it button functions , since it makes it very easy someone like my mother , who just basic computer user , scan . sometimes she make copy something instead getting her car going staples pay nickel copy , she now put it scanner glass push " copy " button . not speediest way make copy , but still faster than driving copy center . anyway , one reasons i bought this particular scanner negative/slide scanning . i pretty disappointed , like previous reviewer , find it not easily slide copies , yet functionality so . ( you scan positive transparancies ) . attachment filmstrips bulky , but easily attached , it wants you actual 35mm film strip . this problem if you only partial strips or non-35mm strips . however , i am happy say little manipulation , you actually all above plus slides . however , doing slides means you probably never again show them projector . you must remove slide it mat place it glass inside filmstrip attachment then scan positive . same goes partial strips non-35mm . scanning software actually each frame individually , so it doesnt matter if you only one shot or strip 6 . if you not intending sit down your whole slide or negative collection one sitting , you fine this . however , if your main intent slides easiest possible way , you should investigate other scanners	1
who doesn't love music their shower ? i originally purchased much pricier player sharper image , which stopped playing within first month . luckily , still under warranty , i got replacement . this one stopped after four months ... no longer under 90 day warranty . so then i research this one one . i love it . it much more compact than tsi model , significantly sturdier , hangs anywhere your shower well free stands unobtrusively anywhere else , less expensive , easy use program , latching door you know keeps water out . just all around nicely designed , user friendly cd player	1

epson r2400 purely photo printer . sure understand this before you buy . so if you planning one printer think this it . . . think again . k3 inks not compatible plain paper any documents you print plain paper horribly color shifted distorted . it took three calls epson replacing icc profile before they would finally admit problem k3 ink compatibility plain paper . all magazines raved black white printing quality . not . least not premium quality photo paper . perhaps some more expensive matt papers . i saw very little improvement over my epson r320 . now if you going use it strictly photo printer then this very nice printer . biggest drawback you not find ink cartridges any major store such staples . stock ink guarantee there not apply items not carried strore . this hint #1 . hint #2 if you run out ink weekend need something monday you sol . only option you order ink online . trust amazon they find deliver . however if some reason your lucky enough large pro photo store near bye they may cartridges . cartridges certainly dont last very long $12-$15 each eight them your burning $100-$125 set . bulk ink tanks coming out but i doubt k3 inks imitated . if you stand ordering everything online only looking great photo printer than this may just ticket you . however $850 i fully expected able print documents pictures plain paper . i haven't happy this printer i plan replace it soon . amazon able locate ship ink only reason its still here .	1

i really tried like via michelin , bought it every intention loving it march 2007 . but i feel compelled tell most you " keep shopping . " i bought it due excellent price , small thin size(compared garmin ) . i thought " how bad it ? " i ordered it it shipped my door , then took off 3400 mile trip it . this because my other gps units other cars , other family members already other trips . i bought this one budget gps , optimistic it new sirf-iii chip . but before long , i hated this unit , all criticms other reviews came back haunt me , i tell you it below . first , please note there few positive reviews this unit .... but you noticed they mostly all people who no experience " other " gps units ? or they didn't spend much time it before they reviewed it ? or they haven't experience gps 4 years .. which like century terms how fast this technology changing ? positive reviewers , if this their first " newer " gps if they comparing it car navigational gps 4 years ago , then yes , it quite bit better . but compared new units like mio 310x or tom tom one ( both which i own ) then viamichelin " horrible " user interface , horrible use roads . tomtom mio , often finish what you typing you , they intuitive programmers polished them . but viamichelin very non intuitive , absolutely dangerous try use fly . sure , we not supposed use them while we drive , this one it truly dangerous even when you learn complicated system . so most time , you pull over work it . but it no fun , even you program it , if you go screen it " loses " it you program history all over . you soon frustrated how many steps this unit takes anything , how " lost " it often gets . i try give you pros : pros : small form factor , decent screen , sirf 3 chip . navteq maps . four hour battery life . good price sirf-3 chip unit . cons : horrible non intuitive software program , clunky , multi step interface make your life horrible if you rush or emergency ... or even if you not hurry . horrible speaker .. volume so poor speaker so poor , you can't hear it any road noise present ... seriously ... turn speaker up all way while driving .. it crackle illegible . i read this review , but honestly didn't believe it until i owned it . third , unlike any gps i've , this one literally tells you " start driving " before it tell you which way go , when you've routed it nearest store , etc . think ! it means sometimes you 50% chance making right choice which way go ... then if you guess wrong , it tells you turn around go other way ! seriously ... one feature should enough make you say " no " most gps least tell you " turn right " where you parked or " turn left " but this one say " start driving " without any direction .... because it can't seem route until you drive onto road . it can't it parking lot ! it already satellite location ... that not it .. it software bugaboo i think built into programming . it makes you " start driving " because it can't find your location or know which way you going .. until you start it routes direction you traveling . bad software design sure . when you go canada , you installed ( sd card ) canadian map .... very inconvenient when you cross border . navteq maps could not find many locations coastal maine . literally , we driving coastal roads it said not exist . i found it very slow recalculating trips when you missed turn ( much slower than my mio 310 which purchasd last year , or tom tom one which purchased this year ) this recalculation problem busy city traffic , caused us miss several critical exits . want find poi run ? forget it . too many steps illogical organization compared other major brands . it often could not find even local walmarts ... one there 20 years . i'm serious . i parked front walmarts it could not find ... very old walmarts . sure , garmin , tomtom mio not list all walmarts , but least they get 4 or 5 out 7 my home town . not so via . several towns maine connecticut , i parked front rows old stores there years . punch local stores difficult use poi list , it can't find any them . also , punch or look stores like nearest walmart .... mio tom tom no problems finding several .. or nearest ones it knew your location . but via , it within certain distance you .. or it not show up existing . so .... you then figure out next town search location , try find store . very , very clunky .... can't tell you how much trouble . it so simple other units , you get spoiled garmin or tomtoms . this one makes it so hard still can't find poi . no gps finds all stores .... there limit poi , course . but it seems via programmers spent their time gathering addresses bank atm not restaurants , shopping , etc . believe me , once you've used it trip , it organized make you believe programmers never actually used gps themselves before . i can't say enough how " difficult " interface .... when you go " back " or " forward " screen , it often loses where it ... you start all over again programming where you going , going through multiple difficult steps . when you lose power , again , you start all over . when i bought it , i read some negative positive reviews thought .... how bad it ? i thought complaining people probably not techie complaining no reason . wrong ! experienced gps users ones know just how clunky bad this software interface compared sleek garmin or tom tom interfaces . example : one trip , my daughter began throw up , we find emergency medical treatment facility .... this clunky interface made it very difficult locate one . when you panicked , you want quickly find nearest hospital . this unit makes you put town , etc . if you further than miles or so ... like when you interstate .... so you literally guessing which town search find hospital . which horrible . i this happen before mio , 3 clicks bam you searched found nearest hospital ... one more click you routed nearest hospital . truly , i am sad not recommend viamichelin . i really recommend you " pass " like some other reviewers suggested . i recommend you buy more rapid , easy use mio great screen , blazing fast sirf 3 calculating chip , loud-clear-speaker . if you tech challenged , buy garmin or tomtom their awesome easy use software interface . but don't buy this bad speakered , horrible interfaced , poorly designed , buggy unit . paper , it looks like killer unit . but reality , it unpolished clunky paper tiger horrible use . finally , there " fun " factor . tomtom one fun . mio fast fun , pleasure use ! even newer garmin fun their simplicity ( i hated screen some old garmins . ) but viamichelin x-930 no fun programmed .... it not pleasure use , although it take you across country . believe me , pleasure low price quickly fade once you start working unhearable speaker , unpolished , unfun , clunky , interface poorly organized features disorganized poi menus . polished quick intuitive menu where garmin tomtom shine . only thing better viamichellin screen sirf-chip ... some older garmin use older satellite gps chip than viamichellin , but new tomtom via use same gps satellite chip , but faster software routines cpu chips . but even use sirf-3 chip via michelin , cannot make up poor software menu design . theoretically , this thing should blazing fast , but it much slower than my tomtom or mio . only thing better this unit than mio , via smaller thinner . maybe navteq maps might slightly better some locals . but other than , mio wins hands down , far faster , better easier use gps my opinion . if you looking software ease , go garmin first , then tom-tom , then mio , via last . if you looking value great unit then go mio 310x , it killer unit it hackable . but if you looking simplicity i programming where you going , go garmin first , then tom-tom . i tried you mr. viamichelin , but you need go " finishing school " like other gps students . you just too unfinished rough	1

my opinion : i own ton panasonic equipment , most recently dvd recorder . i using sony dvd-rs no problems , but , panasonic person , i figured panasonic must better . order save few bucks , i joined panasonic club panasonic website , ordered spindle these same type dvd-rs . i this 9/20/06 . i made several phone calls emails find out where my discs , , believe it or not , nobody panasonic could tell me why they hadn't shipped . then , i promised they ship , but i never got them . after talked into placing duplicate order panasonic rep , i didn't get order either . i finally received one order 10/16/06 . they so poorly packaged holder broken . now , i finally my discs . guess what ? they only 1-8x speed ( sony discs 1-16x speed ) , my thermal label printer wouldn't print them because finish . i assured i could print them thermal printer . i burn couple movies , they worked , but i saw nothing special i report . it gets worse : i logged into my panasonic club account , saw two charges i hadn't made : one $ 10,017 one $915 . i fell off back my chair . this day nobody called me , but i managed get some email responses , i told i would watch my credit card - that just what i need ! you know , sometimes you buy brand think great things how wonderful company it , then one day you some dealings realize how wrong you . i'm going back sony , let me tell you , amazon customer service blows away just every company i've dealt ( sorry preposition ) . i should bought amazon .	1

amazon great shipping this product , but i eventually returned it due several problems . they also great return -- they paid return shipping i got full refund . i never tried any recordings this card using media center software part windows mce . i using it snapstream beyondtv 4.1 . if you record using anything but best ( dvd 720x480 ) quality level it would crop out part picture . this known issue apparently driver issue . latest hauppauge driver not solve problem . other problem i several times when i recording two programs same time , one recordings nothing but static audio portion it . i don't know if this problem card or beyondtv , but i think it probably due card . i don't know if i defective card or if this just problem all these cards . i also not impressed overall quality video this card captured . i hauppauge 250 350 cards couple other pcs , video quality they capture noticeably better than captured 500 card . after reading some reviews , it sounds like this case 150 card also ( 500 card basically just two 150s placed one card ) . beyondtv works great 250 350 cards none issues noted above ; but i also only one tuner card pcs i use these cards , so i can't comment how well they would work dual tuner setup using beyondtv . i returned 500 card , i instead purchased two visiontek xtasy theater 550 pro cards . thus far i'm not any issues them beyondtv i hauppauge 500 card -- i record lower quality level no cropping , i've no audio issues so far . quality video also far superior captured 500 card ( although maybe not good captured hauppauge 250 350 cards ) .	1

not buy this system . money there much better systems out there . i bought this my family room mainy small size cube speakers . main problem system ( which bose corrected way ) " acoustimass " component ( bose fancy name subwoofer ) not active ( or powered ) which means base totally inadequate overun cubes which no mid or bass ranges . result you get very " tinny " sound out most applications including dvd . i ended up getting sony active subwoofer it sounds much better . hindsight i would bought different brand than bose , but already much invested bose scrap system completely , size cubes nice . still pissed i spent much money substandard system , but hey , got sucked into bose marketing machine	-1
claiming this fan " 3-speed switch lets you balance quiet performance maximum cooling " , very misleading . low , fan barely moves any air . high , it still doesn't move much air , incredibly quiet , nearing silent my opinion . if you looking high performance fan turned down while not under heavy loads , this not fan you . 3-speed switch useless , there no reason run it anything other than high	1
i purchased md781 + md71 expansion phone after briefly its predecessor md681 . i really like md681 but i could never locate one its expansion handsets ( everyone online/offline constantly out stock ) . overall i'm disappointed this new model after two weeks use i am already looking phone . handheld phones : i like them more than any other phone i've tried . unlike most phones these days they're big very solid feel them ... it just easier hold onto phone like this longer conversation . buttons nice size easy use . hands free/speak phone handheld works well . one person handheld line sound pretty good , but two people handsets you get significant background noise so bad it hurts your ear it hard hear person other end conversation . shared phonebook terrific idea but it could better . it few clicks slow access ... almost quick old rolodex hand ... or copy number local units phonebook ... which defeats purpose . answer machine : once you play messages you no longer visible indicator how many messages , if any , system ( it just me or poor design ) , so if you listen messages when you partner isn't around you need leave note them check messages . quality voice messages bit grainy . i also like how handset docked older m681 ; it laid base so you option wall mounting base ... md781 sits up base like some sort obelisk .	1

i bought this backup drive several months ago my home business after iomega backup drive i using crashed took my backup it . maxtor software installs automatically when you plug drive so part really easy it took just few minutes . initial backup really easy went pretty fast too . so far , so good . problem once initial backup takes place backup function doesn't backup new or updated files ! scheduled backup doesn't work all . light flashes so you think it working but it doesn't backup any new or updated files . synch useless too . it like backup function . it synch your files one time but then after it doesn't synch any your new or updated files like it supposed . it like it takes snapshot your computer specific time that it . get around fact it won't automatically back up my files i manually transfer my files every few days or so which real pain i remember what files updated and/or new . i would not buy this product again . it not automatic backup drive , it just external drive back up one time but then isn't reliable all . if you need backup drive look elsewhere . sorry say , this one complete waste money .	-1

this perfect little tv/dvd little girl room ! picture great hello kitty pops screen certain commands ( volume , channel change .. ) . my daughter age 4 loves it . i would given this product 5 stars but there couple drawbacks ... remote control so many buttons they very tiny , very close together . i barely read what each button because labels/print also very tiny . this annoying when my daughter darkened room i turn bright light just find pause button ... other thing i point out bugs me you can't eject/or open dvd player unless tv dvd mode . other words when i go put dvd , i can't just push " open " . nothing happen . you find right button , choose " dvd " choice 3-4 things , only then tray slide open . all all , these things would not prevent me buying this tv again ... although it would nice if they come out w/ more kid friendly remote bigger buttons/symbols small child recognize ... one great thing i want point ou t--t here fast forward scan you watch it fast forwards ( something not all dvd players offer ) this great when you putting dvd your child they want skip all those pre-movie ads .... you ff right beginning movie !!!	1

this particular cam some issues but long you understand how configure it , it blow you away . i've heard people complain dlink they get ball tech support , autually their tech support sucks but i don't need them . this not plug play device so study online manual carefully . when you actually learn how use it , you won't buy anything else price . if you tech savey , you really enjoy product . i nine cams installed three locations . using their ip software you view upto 16 once . reason i'm back , this site , because i need order two more . i return my first one but it pre-production unit somebody forgot timing gear . dlink sent my replacement direct . oldest cam worked flawlessly year now . one last comment , next closent cam panasonic but equal quality you pay 50% more less features	1

i dvd scratched during shipping . one repair kit nothing help it . i considered using skip dr. , but i never cared what it disks . my church media center uses optifix system , so i decided try it , too . scratch gone , dvd plays no problem whatsoever . i'll admit not all scratches repaired this way ; some scratches cannot repaired all . i just know it worked great me	1
i impressed this controller first , found it feel comfortable , work well . it played once while month ( total 10 hours max ) . some time after , next time i went use it , it would only go left game used left joystick . i could not get it center ( or even stay still ) , it would just keep either steering car ( like burnout3 ) or whatever left joystick would game no matter what . i tried it several times , it never worked since . i fire it up once while see if it still doing it , it . i am very dissapointed this , i pretty careful getting this newer version logitech controller . i think i paid $45 locally it , i just bought pelican extreme edge radio shack clearance $19.99 works feels good , but less than half cost . i don't really feel like going thru warranty claim , if it even covered , but it still annoys me every time i look it my xbox ' drawer ' extra stuff . i going go totally wireless ( 4 units ) luckily didn't run out buy 3 more these logitech controllers . i instead bought some extra microsoft controllers , they still one best feeling controllers out there . if pelican holds up , ( model pl-2050 version 2.0 ) i might go get some more if i find them locally .	-1

brilliant images . highest quality . you simply cannot beat this system price . also , this particular projection tv handles non-hdtv channels very well - not all hdtv models this . fact most channels not available hdtv yet , so it nice high quality tv deliver non-hdtv channels you high quality rendering . this tv very well . yes it nothing like hdtv , but all same they fine job this model	1
this system quite sleek , easy fit cluttered living room . assembly takes two minutes . instructions very clear . sound amazing , especially when you put your favorite loud , bass-heavy film . why then i give it one star ? it skips . like nobody business . first , my wife i thought it disks we putting many them scratched . but then we put new disks . no difference . when exactly it skip ? impossible tell . sometimes little . sometimes every frame ! sometimes it'll tell us disks bad . then next time we put them they magically work -- until they skip . so i called philips they said not only would we pay shipping , but they could not guarantee they would fix it , it would take up month before they'd ship it back . save your money ! buy someone else	-1

i used half these batterys . mostly clocks different items around house , but also i used them flash my camera they held up real good . i lot rechargeable batterys , but these better because they last lot longer . often rechargeable batterys only last few months if long . alkaline batteries me last up year longer . if amazon went back free shipping these then i would buy them up give them friends gift or prize . i not know what shipping , but it may still worthwhile . i just know so far these batteries held up real good i would highly recommend them .	1

i've got lite-on dvdrw sohw-1673s burner ( revision js02 ) my fast g4 mac running os tiger burning toast titanium 7 . although my burner nominally 16x-capable , it only burns 6x my setup , probably due slow ( ata 33 ) bus it . i've used number different brands 8x 16x disks , both +r -r , verification failure rate less than 2% -- so few , fact , i often don't bother verifying video dvd anymore when burning tdk or maxell discs . ( i always verify data dvd , since errors those not ignorable . ) but memorex , i've gotten 20% failures , including couple aborted burns ! one case , disc blank band two burned ones ! memorex discs i'm referring manufacturer id " cmc mag , am3 " . according videohelp.com, these sold under least 7 different brand names . reviews there rather mixed , which not imho good enough ! i not , btw , any problems memorex dvd+r discs i've tried . but i stopped using them because one my players won't recognize +r format	1

first all , let my point out mine came demos crimson skies mech assault full version xbox classic arcade . mine new certified microsoft box , etc . maybe they just updated games . anyways , it my opinion better deal buy 12-month pack , but i decided 3-month just because i've got 2-month trial already didn't want 14 months built up . box : there communicator headset , 3-month subscription card , game discs , several manuals connecting xbox live . communicator : purely awesome . i read many people comments saying it breaks little clip . i grant it clip thin could potentially break easily , but it not uber fragile . don't afraid put it . headset weighs next nothing really comfortable . it great outgoing voice quality great sound quality through speaker . xbox live itself : you broadband ? you router switch or hub if needed ? if answers both yes , you need xbox live . it incredible . buy this or 12-month kit if you just starting ( but don't forget start your account first free 2 months . after you live already , renew subscription card	1
i bought blue logger both street atlas 2005 sa2005 hh my dell x50v . no problem blue logger gps but my complaints follows : 1 . delorme not include blue logger manager software hh . now they want sell it separately additional $39 . very weird marketing strategy indeed . 2 . software pocket pc very difficult use , not very intuitive . it seems hand held software developed afterthought software pc . it poorly designed , appeared not fully tested normal users prior releasing market . 3 . it very cumbersome slow determine route . even 620 mhz axim , it slow . worse yet , route often wrong . example , this afternoon i use sa2005 determine route friend house . i followed route , i would come dead end street back track 10 miles get correct route my destination . luckily , i decided use my paper map . later , i tried microsoft mapping internet it actually gave me correct routing . last week location , sa2005 found wrong location given address which would take me 4 miles off . luckily , i knew where it ignored routing sa2005 hh . 4 . many other mapping softwares hh allow one use it 1 hand often finger . but not sa2005 hh . after 2 weeks using it , i found myself going back my old paper map . example , if i not calculated route just simply use gps map travel , software only show street i but no name given no street name shown upcoming cross streets . it not help when you lost . 5 . sa2005 maps seems several years old not very up date . i guess that why delorme not want clearly advertise this issue . i am seriously considering giving up sa2005 consider this my $50 learning mistake , looking microsoft street trip 2005 or later 1q 2005 , iguidance who supposed latest map . i am not alone this several other users also complained delorme user forum . i wish i read forum before buying delorme software . well , live learn .	1

i read all 181 reviews decided half reviewers not get model i . or else they wrote their review too soon . i bought mine june 2006 . it failed before store warranty ran out . one down . replacement lasted month or two before it hung wouldn't boot . two down . sandisk honored their 1 year warranty prompt free rma . one also failed . three down . they replaced it both m230 2gb c150 . c150 hung after 2 weeks . four down . i using m230 two weeks now hope it lasts until c150 replacement arrives . i gotten quite good rma game intend keep playing it either until my warranty runs out or i get one those other people rave . i don't think i'll buy sandisk - unless it free lifetime warranty . i suggest everyone failed m230 exercise thier warranty rights . sandisk needs know true reliability their products .	-1
i purchased one these when new back 2004 . unit worked ok me , main quirk once every hour or two , i go through 3 - 5 minute period bad reception , presumably it shifts one satelite . i unable utilize fm modulator it weak , but went hard wired connection my radio using cable purchased crutchfield . my main issue this unit there newer units available same or slightly more money , which replay options better displays . i would consider those options before purchasing this unit	1
i bought this same brand discs sometime last year this very site . i very pleased purchase then . i didn't one problem discs . i bought pack recently i've using pack i just bought . all discs messing up me . i understand few problematic discs but this insane whole pack discs every single one them messes up you . i wish i could send these discs back get refund . this purchase scared me away anything else related memorex . i thought memorex very reliable brand they would make sure they sending out top notch items consumers . i guess i wrong . apparently you get what you pay . don't fooled good price . you'll just out your money stuck discs wouldn't even worth using frisbee . find brand use avoid this brand	-1

ok - here what you get : 1 power supply brick1 ipod dock1 3-foot cable connect power supply brick dock1 3-foot cable connect dock stereothis version kit compatible 3rd 4th generation ipods ( those dock connector bottom ) ipod mini . although dock connector electronically same all these ipods , dimensions ipod itself differ model . thus , dock comes different plastic tops different sizes ipods you snap right-sized top your ipod ( check size carefully before snapping cover - it goes easily , but it doesn't come off easily ) . cable connects power supply brick dock special apple firewire-to-ipod-dock cable , but cable connects ipod stereo system nothing special , just standard stereo minijack plug one end two rca phono plugs other . you get compatible cable many different vendors many different lengths ; which my case good thing because 3-foot length kit too short . kit good buy ? well , it depends . if you price all components kit separately , you find kit cheaper than individual parts , even if you replace stereo cable i . but , question , you need buy all parts . let assume moment you fact want attach your ipod your stereo consider what you might able without :( 1 ) power supply brick . your ipod dock fact work fine without plugged into power supply . trade-off without it you drain battery ipod while it plugged into your stereo . you get dock stereo cable substantially less than this kit , so if you're ok battery issue , you save money not getting kit . ( 2 ) ipod dock . you plug ipod into stereo without dock . same stereo cable connects dock stero also connect ipod stereo . there two disadvantages this : first , dock gives true line-out , meaning volume control ipod doesn't affect volume coming out dock , so you just use stereo volume control control playback volume . audi o-o ut jack ipod , however , affected ipod volume control , so if you connect it stereo , you careful fact there two volume controls system , which annoying best , there might some risk your stereo if ipod volume too high . it also worth noting if you power supply brick , you not need dock recharge your ipod - brick plug into ipod directly . if you ok audi o-o ut thing ( whether how keep your ipod upright without it ) you save money not getting kit doing without dock . ( 3 ) power-supply brick dock cable . if you don't brick , you don't need cable ; if you brick , you need cable or brick isn't going you any good . if you decided you without recharging ipod while it connected your stereo , you skip brick this cable both . ( 4 ) dock-to-stereo cable . this thing you can't without if you want connect your ipod your stereo , but you lot choices vendors if this all you're getting . even if you aren't getting dock , cable would connect dock stereo same one would connect ipod stereo directly . one more thing consider your ipod might already come one or more these pieces , if you aren't using them elsewhere , you could use them part your stereo set-up just buy any other pieces you need not get whole kit . me , i didn't any extra pieces i wanted works - recharge ipod not worry double volume control , so i got kit . i also got navipod ir remote ( which you get right here amazon ) so i could control it remotely like rest my stereo gear . make your decision , just figure out what you want , what pieces you already , what you might willing live without then make your decision . hope this helpful	1
i record dvd movies hobby am always looking better media , software etc . - i'd using ridata some time w/ next no coasters but figured i'd upgrade go memorex this time around . big mistake . they skip , pixelate freeze up . i recopy least 5 out last dozen or so movies i've . it compatibility issue i could understand , but it appears strictly problem quality media . i'm going back using my cheap disks ! lesson here : " if it works , dont fix it !	-1

this card 2 gb ultimate 120x it tested write speed 120 times 150kb/sec which exceeds 18 mb per second . frequently card manufacturers advertise their read speed , which always much faster . analyze your file size pictures you take speed mb/sec tell you how many those pictures you store one second . impacts time pictures . cameras , write speed most important , but speed rating card doesn't necessarily tell you its write speed . music players other devices , read speed may more important . so you might choose different card depending whether you intend use it play music or take pictures . i'm currently shopping sd cards camera capability shoot 3 pictures per second large file sizes . order not slow camera down , i need fast card . i some research realized reviews here aren't necessarily even related this particular card , but all different sizes speeds kingston cards . kingston memory business long time they conservative their ratings . this card #1 my list right now because its tested write speed	1
i bought this memory card my camera sd500 . first , i very dispointed when i only see 1gb my laptop . after googled around , i realized i need update my laptop sd reader driver recognized sd card over 1gb . i'm able see full 2gb after driver update . just make sure you update your device/laptop firmware/driver first	1
i use this conjunction sandisk ultra ii 2.0 gb compact flash card . i like it , but flash card doesn't slide easily . sometimes it get stuck halfway , if unit not designed properly sliders card offer enough give slide card left or right pins . add insult injury , both reader flash card manufactured sandisk . therefore , they should work seamlessly together , but pathetically , they don't . i'd much rather pay more reader worked great , rather than save few dollars reader makes you work every time you use thing . comparison , my camera accepts card perfectly . there no give all , but instead effortless process . not quality reader . other than , it works expected . surprisingly , reader doesn't topple over easily i thought it would . it stands vertically looks like it might fall over when trying slide card . sliding card 2 handed process , so one hand holds unit while other slides it . removing card extremely easy . that one-handed process . " eject " card pc drive then remove it . data transfer card pc very quick . overall , i'm glad it , but it annoyance use it . i hate card getting stuck halfway reader	1
card works great my camera . what more there say	1
i little tentative order itrip lcd because some bad reviews i read . it seems like there very few people sitting fence this item . buyers either love it or hate it . i leaving trip hoped itrip would arrive so i could use it my drive . luck would it , it my mailbox day before i left . i unwrapped it went out vehicle test it . i plugged it into my 20gb ipod photo right off bat thought i trouble . it wouldn't power up , i tried plugging unplugging , cleaning contacts finally last resort , read instructions . after plugging it you play song before it power . this immediately explains why so many poeple complain doas right out box . i set frequency lowest available fm band presto !!! instant music . i don't live extremely populated area so i can't really comment other stations bleeding through but loud passages loud quiet passages quiet . many reviewers complained bad sound quality but you must remember this . it doesn't matter how great quality song your ipod , you playing it over fm radio so it never sound better than fm radio . i inherited my father ' 91 accord work car when he retired it bare bones am/fm radio tone control(bass treble all rolled into one handy knob !!! ) cheap 6 1/2 inch speakers front doors . when i drive i like listen talk radio podcasts occasionally music . sound quality exactly what i expected , no better no worse . i also tested it my wife ' 01 focus . it nice factory 6 speaker cd system sound ipod just fine . bass still thumped highs seemed just tiny bit off but still not bad all . i am completely satisfied product . one strange thing i noticed may explain why some people complain bad sound quality if you tap itrip , sound comes through your speakers much like tapping microphone . if you lay it hard surface your vehicle you could probably hear it through your speakers when encountering rough road . unless there defective batch sent out , i don't know where all complaints come . i got mine $15 private seller amazon consider it great purchase especially amount money . don't hesitate buy one , it works advertised sound quality what it . if you keep these things mind , you won't disappointed	1

best ever , i tell ... my choice 9x12 format decision taken based my traditional arts background , since i make oil paintings traditional lineart drawing concept arts , i use very much wide strokes combination " wrist arm wide motion " . so this tablet well suited this task not too much exagerated size not too small wide movements . 6x8 wacom tablet would more restricted me , but those who like small area usage drawing painting this 9x12 digital adjust so you work it 6x8 , but remember space your desk , it not ' mouse pad ' definitively , get 19 " monitor screen - flat it down table , that almost same space you gonna need . way ... those thinking something different wacom tablets ... don't think ! wacom only one you trust 100% , no doubts , i've tried many ... if you don't know wich wacom suits best you , i suggest you go www.wacom.com , they questionaire there help you out , but it simple : if you pro ... get this intuos3 or better intuos available , that hardcore professional choice , if don't need much pressure sensitivity , make ' lighter ' work , go graphire , if you pro want something work milimetrical accuracy like architecture or technical design get cintiq ( this one top expesive one ) . other application work perfect it too , like 3d software , i use xsi , max , maya , zbrush(this one only wacom please ! ) , modo many other applications composing editing like combustion premiere , it changes way you work better productivity , believe-me . pen tilt great " painter " software , what you maybe would take day finish you seconds literally , wrist sweep tilting pen you create amazing effects one second . also reduce stress your hand arm caused mouse , it improve your life quality not harming you like mouse when you get many our computer . besides it programmable buttons it smart scroll , so you may use you mouse only games after . important point - usb cable huge enough so you work confortably away your monitor screen tablet your lap if wish so . finish : i love my 9x12 wacom , if you buy it you love it too , give it accessories so this babe get happier * lol*a travel bag , replacement tips ( nibs ) kit , sure if you or need ... buy other pen like 6d art pen airbrush so you make extraordinary artworks . hope this helps your choice . best regards ! eduardo . janiszewskicg artist animato	1

most anyone tell you , these speakers excellent sound if you're just going set them up your desktop , then i'd give them 5 stars . however , design wall mounting these horrible you can't ceiling-mount them . logitech not make separate mounts these no " universal speaker mounts " work them . if you want see how they mount , go logitech website , go product support enter wall mounting . some might argue they're computer speakers , not home entertainment center speakers , but $300 , i expect little bit better design	1

this little reader fast easy use usb flash drive . pop your card , plug it , wahlah , all your files shown . transfers very fast easy . it uses standard usb cable , so it likely you could use same cable variety devices ( mp3 player , camera , cell phone)the device somewhat flimsy , however front always snaps off when you try open unit rather than working like hinge , it should . this somewhat annoying reattach hinge everytime , so it gets 4 stars . still very good buy , especially price	1

this product stinks . typically , documentation not written standard english , but some cyber-patois no civilized person understands . their support material exhaustive exhausting solves no user problem . i bought it primarily book reading , so far , not able access single one . quot ; desktop managerquot ; tells me quot ; synchronizationquot ; went ok , but proves false . stories i downloaded nowhere found . i look under franklin reader find nothing . i look under mobi reader find same . i don't need calculator , or memo book , or solitaire game , or voice recorder , or mp3 player , or phone book . i wanted portable library fiction , nonfiction , whatever , this gadget not give it me . if you remember seinfeld episode which foreign professor threw electronic organizer out window , you idea what i feel like doing this thing . i bought it clearance company ebay 50 bucks , so it not huge loss . but i want ebook reader . apparently , there lot ebooks online taking ( or buying ) , but i'll never see them , not franklin ebookman anyway . i'm certainly not going search device . once burned , twice shy	-1

all right , i've wanting share my experience while , so here my story : i interested buying 50-55 inch flat panel tv my living room - nothing smaller . viewing distance tv 10-13 feet . it either going lcd or plasma . i researched market several months , reading reviews , comparing tvs store , etc . i finally took plunge decided this panasonic beauty . i love it don't regret it one bit . if picture quality your top priority , then this tv meet your expectations if not exceed them . colors very natural - it not too bright artificial-looking like some other tvs i saw . i think this advantage plasma over lcds general , i noticed lcd artificial colors effect during my comparisons store . contrast excellent . this actually charasteristic i didn't consider too much , but realized during comparisons how important it . some other plasma lcd tvs poor blacks you could obviously see when you compared panasonic them . i tried tweaking settings other tvs it didn't get any better . you actually see details dark areas panasonic which very important movie watching . watching non-hd programs also quite good . i say quite good because none tvs out there display non-hd content 100% perfectly . but panasonic it better than most . hd programs - incredible ! you actually feel you there . dvds crystal clear well . sports fantastic - no blurring . tv extremely wide viewing angles . trust me , you so much fun watching tv this ! tv speakers more than adequate . i bought surround sound system , but i only turn those when i watch movie or big sporting event . regular watching shows , news , sports , speakers great . finally , i'd like address issue " burn-in . " lot people get scared buying plasma because they're afraid ghost images appearing after static images display screen while . well , i've using this tv four months now - it everyday . i watch shows , sports , movies ( black bars ) , even play video games it . i don't any trace burn-in . course , sensible , don't pause image 24 hours . i read panasonic handles image-burn very well , so this reason buy this tv - especially if you're considering plasma .	1

i purchased hp 8450 year half ago . i see complaints other reviews speed cost ink , but if you send photos off photo lab , not only would it take more time money but quality would not any better . i find print quality good professional lab i used , if not better . i print around 30 50 photos month , mainly sell customers this lot more economical than lab . if you looking wal-mart quality go wal-mart . but if you looking professional quality i not say enough hp 8450 .	1

this set impressive . my husband i somewhat limited size/brands lcd units would fit our family room entertainment center . we like our tv hidden when not use our entertainment center won't accept tv wider than 39 " . last year , perhaps 18 months ago ? we purchased 32 " lcd fit , but we couldn't use our tivo it some reason . we also thought picture looked too small compared our tube flat screen sony . we quickly returned i t.t his month costco coupon book offers this set $300 off savings , so it $999 out door us here oregon . sharp apparently changed exterior dimensions aquos line since we last shopped low behold , we able purchase 37 " instead 32 " . we've ditched our tivo our local cable company dvr w/hd we happy campers . very easy set up two hdmi outlets , one our dvr/cable box one our dvd player . like computer lcd monitors , you tweak your monitor settings , so take time this you won't disappointed . true diehards paying professional calibration but we're happy both digital hd picture quality simple tweaks . sound impressive well . i truly feel like we've got surround sound , without actually home theater set-up . we're very satisfied picture quality , sound quality sharp interface . fact , we returned our local costco warehouse picked up set bedroom .	1

this mouse incredibly difficult use . there actually only one button : whole carapace mouse . so your hand can't really relaxed when you're using it , you continually concentrate order get true right-clicks . order get true right-click , you want grip mouse -- but only place it affords gripping without tending cause false-clicks two little pads right left side . alas , if you grip those ( default mode ) , you get expose , which interrupts your attempt right-click ; if you reflexively follow through click , most time you'll get switched application ( because hey , you just clicked app window expose screen ) . scroll ball nice idea , but it half size it needs order afford decent amount control . without , you get all kinds false directionals ( scrolling right/left when you're trying scroll up/down ) using scroll-ball center-click tricky : often not , even after you configure scroll-ball click " button 3 " , you often not get funky " mouse scrolling " action ( icon appears screen you scroll currently focused document moving mouse pointer -- not crazy idea , but totally counter-productive when what i wanted open clicked link new tab ) . basically , this fussy , fussy device difficult most people use . but since looks so beautiful , they'll blame problems themselves give it high rating anyway .	-1

part my review based fact parts missing when i opened box , manual ( antenna , video cable who knows what else ) , but i able download pdf version manual survived install process . surround sound good compared panasonic sc-ht940 . but when i saw heard onkyo 5.1 hdmi htib w/ single disc dvd hts894 few days after getting samsung , onkyo won hands down . samsung suffers poor manual if these things ( htibs ) intuitive not many connections . i am technical person nothing manual intuitive other than page numbers . i liked tower speakers , but aesthetics aside , sound more important than looks . speaker wire very cheap , but sound still good despite . lack connections hurts samsung well hdmi pass-through . bass good surround sound excellent . but reviewer mentioned out box config bad . cnet tips helped setup . i loved fact it comes changer opposed single disc player . question if you're going spend thousands dollars hdtv , why skimp sound system . overall samsung sound system very good , but i chose upgrade . sound like beauty ear beholder , my ears onkyo system delivers higher highs deeper lows yes it cost more .	1

i case logic cd wallets 7+ years ago still good shape ... despite abuse i put them through . i bought this one only because cd collection expansion . i find simply wiping off outside cover wet sponge keeps it clean . nylon covers really hold up over time . remember- " 128 cd capacity " refers cds without their accompaning booklets . it really 64 cds booklets .	1

i ordered one these because my receiver only 1 optical input i needed second input my x-box 360 . i also ordered 2 relatively cheap optical cables parts express seller well . this splitter no optical connector end so short optical cable + longer one run one inputs 360 also necessary . other input used oppo 970hd dvd player i already cable use one . it pretty straight forward how use splitter . time spent hooking this up maybe 10 minutes max would've probably even less i quick access back my receiver . originally i no idea something like this existed i stumbled upon this product accident . price more than reasonable save you buying new receiver if you need second optical input . i've mine week not noticed distortion or changes sound quality . highly recommended	1
little dipole antenna comes most stereo tuners barely adequate fm reception . big outdoor fm antenna pain put up aim best reception . terk tried step into breach fm 50 amplified antenna . this amplifed folded dipole fully enclosed weather-resistant . it also mounted indoors , but length nearly 5 feet , it doesn't exactly blend drapes . but you're interested performance , or you wouldn't considering spending nearly 70 bucks this thing , would you ? well , amplifier low-noise type , filters out-of-band interference . gain somewhat variable . said , let talk briefly afc most radios . most tuners built lock onto strongest signal , if two adjacent frequencies . likewise , if filters used most stereos nowdays bit wider than absolutely necessary , order provide higher fidelity . if you trying pull weaker station adjacent stronger one , afc fight your efforts . amplifying signals only makes things worse . amplifiers more beneficial picking up weak stations not stations adjacen t.t he amplifier terk fm 50 turned off . folded dipole element itself , my opinion , excellent fm antenna . it pull weak stations right out noise . amplifier less effective , my opinion . if terk offered just antenna , sans amplifier , good price , i'd give it 5 stars . it good . but 70 bucks whole shebang bit steep , i think , what you get . if you're near city , you probably going leave amplifier turned off most time . you only get full benefit your 70 bucks if you live fringe reception area . one final minor gripe : your purchase doesn't even include coaxial lead-in cable . you'll go your neighborhood electronics store buy . quality , 5 stars . overall value , 3 stars	1

i using this over month now . got it lt ; $300 , which less than most standalone auto gps systems several pdas . pros : -excellent value money . -performs all basic functions good auto gps system , some added ones . warm start times good . -everything you would expect windows mobile pda there . application performance fairly good . cons : -not fast many dedicated gps systems . there times when issue , especially when initially calculating route or recalculting you go off track need know which turn take quickly , traffic . -software interface much room improvement . e.g. not allow you move map see whats around when showing route map . you flip through some screens access . when addresses added contacts contact list , not attempt locate address . it manually located map . -cold start sat acquisition take while times . receiver not so good . -no built connectivity ( modem , wi-fi , bluetooth)bottomline : highly affordable gps pda functionality , one best values money , but not excel either	1

i bought $170 belkin bluetooth gps last year . bundled software quite useful but map display not detailed ( doesn't include rivers , water bodies parks ) enough compare ms pocket streets . it forced me put both programs my pda . one day i cut into website iguidance found its user interface almost same belkin . so i learned belkin software oem iguidance ( rev 1.1 ? )the best iguidance : very clear voice guidance . it advises you next turn many times -- few miles away , 2000 feet , 200 feet ( when you must turn right away ) . i once tried delorme , it told me only once -- many miles away that it ! i only need my ears when driving iguidance . it good safety everybody . if i miss turn , it re-calculate new route tell me what immediately . no panic . improvement iguidance 2.1.2 over 1.1 map details now rival ms pocket streets but w/o railroads . i think railroad useful landmark location reference . connection bluetooth gps receiver also improved . it takes much less " clicks " hook up bluetooth gps now . map data updated . i see newly built highway exit added . map details ms pocket streets still best . but ms two fatal shortcomings . 1 . no voice guidance . you keep staring pda display while driving ? 2 . it locks up time time . ms program freeze pda you must reset pda get it back . i've never experienced similar problem iguidance . " points interest search according your current location " feature iguidance also better than ms . what bad iguidance ? lack routing options . doesn't support voice commands . short , iguidance no-frill but useful tool	1
driving my car , working out gym , walking my dog doing chores around house , i spend least 10 hours week listening audio-books [ ... ] lectures teaching company . over years i've tried tapes , cds variety book readers including ipod zen . no book reader i've found works well this model c140 sandisk . it small , light , inexpensive , easy control , makes bookmarks reliably , makes it easy load unload audible books , makes it easy manage mp3 files using windows explorer . this player takes ordinary aaa batteries you get anywhere . my gym displays several tv screens " hamster room " uses short-range fm transmissions so members pick up station they want watch . so when i see tv program i want i switch over , it lets me quickly easily switch sansa fm tuner keep running . when sansa battery goes dead -- once every 12 hours -- i it takes seconds put aaa battery . they're cheap when i've forgotten put one my pocket , i've gotten replacements road-side convenience stores little convenience rack gym , but i've always able keep listening . audible recommends you download audio-books sansa level 4 format . level , sound quality excellent although , admittedly , player cannot turned up loud enough pound your eardrums unless you plug it into external amplifier play it through good set speakers . i got model c140 replace older sansa e140 i used two years . older one never gave me any trouble but this one said improved operating system making it easier control . i debated getting c150 twice memory only $[ ... ] higher price , but largest books i own ( biography harry truman fantasy book storm swords ) each over 40 hours long , either one fit c140 enough room left two ordinary length audio-books . c140 delivered all i hoped then some	1

first , clarification one listed features . it noted unit stop recording after 5 seconds silence -- this digital only feature not apply analog recording . i'd thought this great feature case i walked away while recording lp , but that just not case . second , it consistantly detect insert track while recording lp or tape ? no , though i it work perfectly few occassions . what frustrating there no rhyme or reason it . it hasn't always dependent sensitivity level set detecting tracks , or condition lp any scratches it may or may not . nothing obvious . positive , i haven't it set erroneous track marks during quit passages , i personally haven't any issues adding tracks manually . quick-start recording guide they provide -- oversized sheet connections 5-step recording process -- once patronizing confusing . i'm all simplifying while still covering bases , but i need line drawing shows finger pressing power button help me turn it ? doesn't " press power switch " cover it ? i mention this because instruction manually adding tracks that same guide far self-evident . their instruction " press track increment button " manually add tracks , but there no drawing finger button . there also no track increment button , no it not skip button . it record button , logic escapes me . you find this out owner manual , which really should read before recording anyway . it short uncomplicated illustrate handy features it . ( mentioned review , you choose analog or digital source you're recording ; default unexplicably set digital ) . quality recordings analog digital quite good . i'd planned getting new equalizer adjusting bootleg tapes upgrading my turntable etc ., but i've become more procastinator than technophile , decided bite bullet this teac . aside missing little high-end , it doing great job converting my records tapes so far . sure it'd great if track detector worked better , but i went into this not really expecting it perform too well , so i'm not disappointed . i wanted uncomplicated machine would solid job converting my records tapes , that what i feel i've got . yes i babysit recording if i want guarantee proper track markings , but that not completely unexpected . , they say , your results may vary .	1

i bought pair january loved them . sound lovely everyone describes . however , there something seriously lacking build quality . soft wires felt flimsy me when i first opened it , but i thought i'd just take extra care . 1 month careful usage , plastic-covered wires earbuds downwards became so weather-hardened i could almost use them chopsticks , makes it so earbuds popped out slightest motion . 2 months careful usage , wires half-ripped plug -- which i repaired best i could unsightly electrical tape . however , 3rd month , left bud fell completely off . i am very disappointed -- it one best-sounding phones i've ever ( i've owned both grado s60 s90 , sennheisers ) , but man , they need something making this baby last	1

overall , helix lives up new generation xm recievers . i especially like option able store my own mp3s unit well recording xm content either time frame or song song basis . only problem here sometimes fades cut off when recording song . those us familiar xm know units not work well indoors unless connected antenna home kit . car antenna seems work fine , par my delphi myfi unit . built antenna helix marginal . i able get decent signal positioning unit , however , when walking or moving reception definitely intermittent . this where my pre recorded mp3 xm content comes handy . i would rated unit higher if helix not falsely advertised able transmit fm receiver both home car docks . prior purchase , i even went far downloading manual which specifically states unit this feature . this simply not true unit transmits fm car dock only . i am enjoying helix , but object purchase fm transmitter home use .	1

i read reviews belkin n-1 networking family scared leave my pre-n system behind . however , my pre-n router died true their word belkin promptly replaced it . this point i willing invest belkin n-1 laptop card just see how it performed . fact i bought 2 . i installed one card couple year old dell which upstairs location while router downstairs . laptop reports very good excellent signal amd " 300 mbps " - it noticable faster pulling files other network devices . other laptop bit older gateway . it too upstairs , directly overhead router . it not report strong signal but seems get job reports faster than " 108 mbps " sometimes " 300 mbps " . while i not experimented placing stronger signaled dell location gateway see how it performs , i suspect difference attributable gateway older technology . greatest challenge i setting up network security . i succeeded security mode wpa/wpa-2 personal ( psk ); authentication wpa/psk ; encryption technique aes ( i could not establish connection my computers using tkp encryption technique ) . summary , setting up network took some effort familiarity networks - how set change properties network connection both laptops browser interface router . once network established its performance reliable faster . all-in-all i would not make investment surf-the-net but if you access larger files , like photographs , computer or network drive , you notice difference - if bandwidth hardware you using par n-1 capabilities . make this come true me i upgraded nic my computers which hardwired router 1gb technology . upgrade worthwhile given my network drive , where photographs stored capable transfer rate 250 mbps my zip drive usb 2.0 . other words , all my hardware capable faster transfer rates .	1
after breaking my cx-300 due it thin cord i decided try out er-6i . those clearest treble i've heard , but lacking seriously mids bass regarding music my ipod . putting it into sound source back home them sounding better , but they weren't good what i would using them , on-the-go listening . so i decided take look these . bass these equivalent cx-300 or slightly better . mids treble where these headphones head up cx-300's; much crisper , clearer , sound more " alive " . thicker cord step up cx-300 , where you could hear everytime cord rubbed against your shirt . noise-cancelling same cx-300 , maybe few decebels more if any . case 3 more pairs buds nice addition compared cx-300 which only come different fitting buds . i own pair quietcomfort 3 home , i'd say these perfect compliment on-the-go listening . my only hesitation giving these 5 stars treble isn't great er-6i ( but er-6i don't overall quality , least my ipod ) . definately use smallest buds work your ear . i've used small buds both cx-300 metro.fi 2 , great results both . it allows monitors sit inside canal , getting better overall sound . i'd recommend these slightly above cx-300 , but both pretty good deals give you great mobility while maintining audio quality . i'm still trying break-in these headphones , but right now , they're sounding great .	1

car charger works just fine . good price . haven't tried ac adaptor yet	1
let me start saying i love these speakers almost more than ipod itself ! i searched every store could not find product all these features ipod shuffle ( 1st generation ) . price also very reasonable product built this well . i've used these speakers indoors outdoors least year now always get compliments friends , family , strangers how good sound coming these speakers . i use speakers outside our deck all summer long enjoy able listen my ipod without headphones . i get much more use my ipod this way . i've taken speakers beach everywhere you could imagine . included carrying case power cord great i use those all time . it definitely important me able use batteries or power cord , this product delivers ! normal aa batteries last very long . it also terrific when plugged into ac ( wall outlet ) it charges shuffle while you listen music . there many other products like this stores , but they sound horrible fall apar t.t his may best product i've purchased last 5years !! i can't recommend it enough ! it also works anything mini headphone jack too ( like any mp3 player or portable cd players )	1
i used these headphones consistently past four years - they far most comfortable headphones i ever worn . aside unique tactile feedback they give , one principle reasons i like them they no block ear canal result you wear them still hear clearly anyone insists talking you while you wearing them	1
ever wonder how many amazon product reviews submitted corporate shills ? case dgl-4100 , i'm ready guess it 85% . okay , i'm not totally serious serious estimate . i'm just disappointed product . i'm not gamer , perhaps that why dgl-4100 didn't work me . i like download tv programs via bittorrent . i download whole seasons time , which runs into multiple gigabytes . you other bittorrent enthusiasts may know , average home network router tendency freeze when bt pulls too many connections through it . i find it very depressing get up morning ( or come home work ) find my downloads stopped short many hours ago . some months now i've search affordable router avoid this problem . considering what i've spent so far , perhaps i would've better off buy something expensive capacious start . any case , it difficult derive any sort consensus router efficacy web . there probably more than few lying corporate shills floating around cyberspace , but mostly there well-meaning people who report good or bad results without taking into account operating system , exact router model , broadband type , bittorrent client , or size torrents they download . i mildly excited find so many positive amazon reviews dgl-4100 . perhaps , i thought , router built high-performance gaming would account connection issues similar bittorrent . right now , cognescenti reading this little tale woe probably laughing their butts off . let me cut chase here . after i hooked up dgl-4100 started two bt downloads ( one mere 1.5 , other 22 ) , everything looked fine ... three hours . then silly thing froze me , happened linksys netgear routers ( wired wireless ) i've tried . i obtained latest firmware it ( january 11 , 2006 ) , installed this , tried again . results similar , except now i noticed router freezing me even during bt-free web-surfing . regardless my bittorrent client ( azureus , utorrent , bitcomet)or its settings , results didn't improve . if you're gamer , maybe you'll roll dice dgl-4100 . if you're bittorrent enthusiastic such myself , you should probably keep looking	-1

hi , i'm vince radioman i've large collection radios i love compares share my thoughts . eton 10 ( e1 e100 ) vast improvement over old grundig line radios . you immediatly see feel difference quality how radio made . it robust memory ( 500 presets ) complete functionality including wide/narrow band selection interference filter which seems work well . tuner sensativity dynamic range very good considering price . it antenna trim feature which pleasure not usually available radio this price range . i enjoy am dxing good results , not quite good sony 7600 or sangean ats909 . sangean priced way above 10 but sony 7600 just bit more but ssb which 10 not . 10s cosmetic design /sleekness wonderful i've said earlier ... well made radio !! control buttons bit small cause issues those us large hands , but not show stopper . my actual rating here 4 half stars , i really like this radio but its not sony , it some hiss selectivity issues , but none less very good buy money .	1

echo most recent review here , i'm something audiophile myself , also sold high-end audio products years ago , buti getting annoyed my new compaq pcwith basic realtek97 onboard audio wasn't even close quality i hearing my newsony dvd player matched set good thx/dolby alteclansing surround speakers , just no comparison . but spend $200 sound card pc that'snot high end anyway absurd , yet i wanted make pc 5.1 digital out capable , boost general stereo audio , when i found out aurilium i jumped it . i got mine two weeks ago i think moneyit really great device , couldn't easier set up , looks fabulous sleek , it even reminds you if speakers aren't configured right , or if you need enable ac3/dolby digital pass-through external dolby decoder or receiver , which really useful touch . software simple , intuitive , helpful easy navigate use . i don't know how philips makes this usb-bus powered , but it works damned well sound card doesn'trequire its own ac power source , although most internal cardsdon't anyhow . test playing new copy dvdof 2001 : space odyssey remastered 5.1 sound , which sounded devastating my main sony surround system , it sounds just good now pc dvd player throughthe aurilium , digital out or not , both methods sounded great . i can't recommend this more highly , wise purchasefor those who want good audio 5.1 digital surroundsound music , movies gaming , budget . plus you don't open up your pc or laptop install it , something i found just icing cake . if you want audiophile high quality go buy yourselfan onkyo or harmon kardon surround system $1000 klipsch 5.1 speakers , but if you , why bother pc audio anyway ? quality pc sound aurilium aces . i also impressed thorough , easy understandnature instructions software help menus , they really cover almost everything you would need know operate card set it up optimal performance	1
i purchased this radio use my garage/workshop . reception good , sound quality very good small portable radio .	1
player perfect money : small , light , good sound quality , only needs replace headphones ... radio ok , but there no memories available store my favorites ... overall very good player . software ( sonicstage-connect ) much more solid than previous version , works fine , it cannot compared itunes ( like many itunes fans like do)does its job pretty well ..	1
i've seen number negative reviews this product , however i think their problem their particular player not model itself . i've my creative zen month now i take it everywhere i go . it works beautifully ! sound quality amazing it so easy use ! my only wish price gone down before i got it it now $20 cheaper . when i first got it it took me bit figure out how manage playlists such but all worked out . i one scare when it froze second day use . reviewer sited same problem , frozen no sound . i don't know what they're talking " waiting 3 days battery die " though . player stuck it only took number hours it die . once i recharged it it worked perfectly i haven't problem since . i use it every day walking classes ( i'm college student ) . my final comment this : price it currently ( $79.99 ) it steal . it works like dream , sound quality beautiful it simple operate . i certainly recommend this product anyone . i went ipod ( which never worked ) creative zen it like breath fresh air	1
i case garmin gps it just belt clip you slide off your belt , unfortunately , it come off your belt ( which it often ) you lose your gps unit good . this explorist case comes real nice strong wide secure strip you undo your belt loop your belt through , so when you out hiking , you don't keep checking afraid it fell off your belt , because there no way this case come off without you taking your belt off ! nice ! it not just loop string or rope either , it better described belt or strip tough material attached real secure case . true , you can't quickly slide case off your belt clip , but why would you need take case off , you take gps out when you need it case stays belt where it safe can't get dropped or lost . $7 this great case . i get gps out quickly easily . i like secure , yet easy open zipper opposed velcro flap my garmin case . only negative i would i would liked padding bit thicker , but i suppose i always slide strong piece leather or something into it inside better protect gps impact case . there enough room this still able get gps unit out without problem . what else you buy only $7 today ?	1
i purchased these set together 6 additional expandable phones . they work great . we large house 6 bedrooms range very good . these phones come great features . i am using voip service these units so far i no complaints . one features we really like intercom . i dont go upsairs get my daughter out bed morning . i just call her	1

it so hard find decent sounding clock radio . this one fits bill ! full rich sound built rear firing subwoofer port . easy controls set two alarm functions . you crank it up any bedroom activities . much better sound than tinny sounding tivoli . much cheaper than bose competitive quality . you can't go wrong here	1
these best headphones under $5 i ever bought , only thing wrong them cord little short , but they fit nice tight around ears so they sound great	1
not buy this your xbox . it sucks . unit functional ( well , not defective ) ' dialing ' unit it able communicate ( w/o wires ) my computer . first red flag when xbox not recognize dwl-g820 wireless adapter . this normal . it configured ip address , which ridiculous because wired router connection normally plug play . however , no amount configuration xbox dashboard would allow xbox connect wirelessly . this even assistance tech support , which spotty best . folks nice enough , but getting through take very long time . i'm okay networks - all my other stuff works great - but definitely not expert , i could go changes i made . i won't , though . if you prefer painless set-up it probably best match brands when designing wireless network . i'll give d-link benefit doubt admit i using router different brand , but all configuration options both ends , this should not matter . oh , i read some earlier reviews i agree this thing runs real hot . who knows what that'll product longevity because i don't plan keep it . if i ever got it function properly i small children , then i'd probably mount it out their reach	-1

when i first got this device it okay it i liked it record xm which i find really awesome . but if you subscription music fan ( napster , yahoo places like ) then here down side this product . if this product supported subscription based music it would gotten all 5 stars but it got 4 but overall sound quality great menues great battery life awesome memory awesome but mp3 subscription music * point fingers down * not good . hopes samsung release firmware update support subscription music cause i don't wanna wait song i want listen play xm so i record it so 4 stars	1

i bought m-audio 49e usb controller keyboard my mac month ago . i'm adult returning piano after many , many years since those dull piano lessons kid . i bought piano few years ago it sits our living room . i'm graphic designer/photographer spend most my waking hours front my mac . i played around garageband thought usb keyboard would allow me sit here my comfy office chair practice while my husband watches tv living room . i miss rich sound real piano , but this keyboard great casual re-beginner practice . nothing fancy , no myriad buttons displays distract lot fun change combine instruments garageband , which excellent software . natch . what else would you expect apple ? m-audio keyboard light , durable , simple sits neatly above my keyboard drawer front cinema display ( which also acts handy music stand ) . only negative i possibly come up springyness keys curve get used . not ever played expensive keyboard , it easy get used this one . practicing simple songs , i no problem missing octaves , dedicated buttons make them easily accessible . my purpose , this keyboard perfect price doesn't break budget	1

fine product what it says . only way i know using one my brother got months ago . he ordered his cc i ordered mine amazon , he using his months while i sit wait amazon . funny thing it states it stock but mine still not shipped . amazon change " stock " " preorder this item " then back " stock " . my order before it went preorder so if it stock now why hasn't it shipped ? according other reviews i am not alone . anyway , samsung decent unit considering there really isn't much competition . however , amazon gets -1 star this one . circuit city , here i come . i may pay little more but least i'll get it	1
after using this product 3 months i am yet find something wrong it . we using it ms streets trips . it works flawlessly . it gets fix ( cold start ) any setting - urban canyon settings , high speeds freeway , wooded areas , inside my apartment . it even works if you keep it glove box your car . we driven through tunnels . it loses signal few meters into tunnel ( not surprising ) gets fix flawlessly couple seconds leaving tunnel . software no trouble communicating reciever . we tried it 2 different versions ms streets trips three different laptops . basic knowledge bluetooth pairing set up breeze . battery life exceptional . it comes complete kit ac charger , dc charger leather pouch . you can't ask more . it really compact ( smaller than most cell phones ) not too heavy either . other gps reciever i tried delorme eartmate . delorme would never fixate signal when driving ( cold start ) . we always pull over get fix then start driving . delorme always lost signal if you drove 3 or 4 storey buildings . hardly described urban canyon ! it horrible !	1

i primarily run outside this great product . it stays my arm i no problem accessing wheel . there 2 flaws , it weather resistant but not waterproof . i never use it anything harder than light rain case very snug so stitching gets stressed . i've mine 4 months i use it 4-5x/week stitching started give one spot . i restitched it , but i would've expected it last longer .	1
i bought this product gift some friends - following directions carefully , they only able get one speakers work intermittantly - after i got speaker system back them , i gave it try - bad results , worse this time - only static one speaker - i double checked make sure i installed everything correctly including making sure correct power adapters attached speakers - no go - , then , when i went return it company whom i bought it canada , i got royal run around - finally after lots phone calls mail issues ( don't get me started " customs " issues ) i returned product got price speakers back - however , no refund shipping either way which amounted $89 total - so ... two things : [ 1 ] product shabby not worth price ( go sharper image buy theirs - better product , cheaper price ) [ 2 ] never buy anything amazon.com not american supplier	-1

i purchased these speakers amazon thinking hmm ... buying speakers online without even hearing them first . needless say , i more than pleased . replacing my now retired polk audio front channels , these jbl e10 just what i needed -- provide good quality sound enough bass balance other speakers . also my setup pair bose 210 rears which work amazingly good , polk audio center channel . others complained high upper range these speakers not great , but if you adjust treble settings your receiver bass ones , you really get it just right any type music . fabulous speakers , even better price ! would definentaly reccomend even purchase set formal livingroom	1

these rca headphones ? what happened quality products they used put out ? i tell you right now , these aren't it . many letdowns very few if any advantages these earphones . spend your money get something else . first problem these earphone how they fit feel your head . since phones not feature swiveling feature like seen most other headphone sets , you put them your head they feel like they're going fall off . you constantly adjust tuning dials achieve constant clear signal . signal becomes distorted or can't recieved all if you go far upstairs bedroom which directly above transmitter or anywhere range . other problems reception include popping noises static within very short distance transmitter . automatic turn off feature which makes this model poor choice . if sound source too low , such certain scene movie or something , headphones shut off within 30-60 seconds . this usually come big surprise you when volume level changes you hear loud static coming speakers which cause most people jump fall out their chair surprise . last problem these headphones battery cover very hard get off back again after replacing batteries . due way headphones attached so tightly band . you fight cover get it up through band . save your money go something else	-1

gps works great ! said , i'm disappointed 5919 overall . i could not get free map updates tomtom because hp not include navigator 6 product code 5915 . hp support promised they'd get maps post them 5915 users , but hasn't happened after several months promises . wireless worked only non-encrypted networks , even then , only 1 day . i perform soft-reset least three times day because system hangs . mp3s play fine . it play video , albeit they very choppy . usb connections computer seem work only after loading very latest ms activesync , only after soft-reset . even then , computer recognize device very " iffy " . unit great idea if you travel -- maps , email , internet , music , contacts , appointments , etc ., but if it doesn't work , it becomes paperweight . i've read dozens forums others complaining same issues . hp support so far nothing but lip service . my recommendation--don't fall marketing hype , this unit still lot bugs worked out	1

this kit absolutely horrible . first off , scratch-free cloths it comes aren't scratch-free all . they totally scratch cd . " step 1 : scratch removal " not scratch removal all . it supposed sit 5 minutes , then you wipe it . i let it sit overnite once scratch still there . after you apply junk , instructions say apply " step 2 : cleaner , polisher , sealer " . this stuff practically water . it doesn't work all . after you cd should like new . i don't think so ! holder you put cd while you're cleaning it too flimsy . only good thing i use " scratch remover " small scratches my digital camera , cell phone , psp , other electronics . not buy this unless you like ruining cd . last word : i hate maxell .	-1

i agree previous reviewer - there lot static interference these things . we actually hardly ever use them reason - our house small enough we hear music other room through walls doorways , least it doesn't sound like am radio stormy day . also , they huge " wall warts " - big converters (?) cords . finding inconspicuous place plug them impossible , since all inconspicuous places behind furniture , which can't put close wall anymore size things plugs . i guess you get what you pay - i would paid more if i known how bad these would	1

i would give this 5 stars but few things : - included earbuds uncomfortable fall out my ears during exercise- syncing sometimes buggy- you load all podcasts manually- podcasts seem ordered date player , no matter how you arrange them itunesrecent releases itunes solved some , but not all , sync issues . also , i read some workarounds podcast ordering problem , but they involve rebuilding your library , furthermore what i've read they're just temporary fixes . apple needs fix this . still , small form factor , cool design , easy-to-use controls make this great product . i sold my 4g 40gb ipod right after i got this , i no regrets .	1
i love it two different modes- you shuffle your playlist or just listen it order you put play list your computer . i also like fact you don't fuss batteries , charge lasts really long time . it very compact , clip holds well . it doesn't take long synch my computer i thought it would , it doesn't take very long charge ( couple hours ) especially compared how long charge lasts ( my sister-in-law using hers least hour every day over month still hasn't recharge it ) . this product gets two thumbs up me . only downside you may want consider ipod nano instead if you want more than 250 songs there	1
this all-in-one printer revolutionized my home office . only $100 , i high quality printed documents , copies , scans photos home exceed capabilities many small businesses . pros : print quality excellent fast . black text works well , several people commented high quality color photos printed just plain white paper . scan quality quite good , easy use . photocopy functions easy use , color copy surprising bonus . many offices very expensive professional printers don't copy color , yet this little $100 machine copies color so well it nearly impossible tell original copy . other nice features include very helpful utilities software included , particularly arcsoft photo studio . i like fact it only needs two ink cartridges instead five so it easy maintain . nice touch handy little slider props unit open during maintenance . cons : my largest complaint this unit high cost replacement ink cartridges , which cost $25-30 each high quality retail replacements . only few months i've spent more than twice cost whole printer just ink . it seems it requires ink changes more quickly too than other canon hp printers i used . other issues , size little wide awkward it feels slightly off-balance weight . print tray should longer support paper -- instead , paper bends backwards awkwardly slide out place . i also wish it could hold more paper . overall : aside cost ink frequency cartridge replacements , i am very happy this printer . previously , i thought home photocopy machine unnecessary ( somewhat decadent ) luxury , but i've surprised many times how very useful it . technology amazing ! printing , scanning copying everything advertised high quality speed . i really like this machine	1

radio arrived right beginning i could tell sound far superior realistic table radio i using . old radio very muddy sounding while tivoli very clear . instruments background when listening realistic now front center . improvement dramatic i'm glad i spent money . added bonus , it 1/8 input jack so i use my ipod it . here few misc nuggets info . amazon comments said am radio reception bad , well you add fm reception if you rely internal antenna . one area realistic beats tivoli hands down . good news tivoli comes external antenna you plug made huge improvement . it comes unusually long extension cord . wrapped up it almost 1/2 size radio itself ! fairly inconvenient when trying keep it tucked behind radio table top . i also read base emphasized too much but so far i it seems fine me . perhaps because i listen jazz which not boom boom some music . one last interesting item , radio very small but also very heavy side speaker . apparently there quite magnet there ! if i critisize it any way i would mention again huge power cord i would also like some type tone control . so , conclude i would say it one darned expensive table top radio $120 ( now sale $100 course ) but it sounds very very good such small box . fact , my wife commented it didn't sound like sound coming little radio all . i don't know i would go far but it fairly open given such small source . dav	1

i received this speaker gift xmas . when i first plugged it , i experienced same problem other people complained ... voices seemed weak difficult understand . i turned db level all way up it became tolerable , but still not very good . i then happened across website discussed speaker placement . it suggested placing center speaker directly above or below tv ( duh ) , but also said make sure it reasonably level tweeters side speakers ( within foot ) . i made this adjustment wow ! it like night day . sound incredible ! those you who problems might want try something these lines , those you checking this speaker out stores should make sure everything aligned properly when you listen . hope helps	1
before buying this product you absolutely go web site try find out if they support your printer . their web site absolutely atrocious . it so slow constantly refreshes so it almost useless . they link back box list compatible printers so go directly it . i hp g85 officejet multi-function printer setup not work all . tech support useless . they kept trying ask me what brand computers i network what my isp . none this mattered except marketing department . it drove me nuts . after 5 phone calls i finally got hold technical support person confirmed my printer not compatible . separately , even if you compatible printer you should aware serious bug software if you use 128 bit wep security your wireless network like we . unless your network uses key 1 ( 4 ) you cannot hook print server into your wireless network . there radio buttons support other keys but they not work . tech support acknowledged issue . all all horrible experience . it shame because their wireless routers almost decent	-1

mousepad side things , this double-sided mat high quality all way around . it aluminum surfaces attached each side thin , but sturdy aluminum plate . i use speed side since it smoother , razer deathadder i also recently purchased . amazon sold out these -- razer store them . wrist rest also just high quality . it actually uses memory foam cushion which much more comfortable than cheap gel material typically found mouse wrist rests . it also dip middle making it very comfortable long gaming sessions . keep this mind if you're considering gaming mousepad . wrist rest optional , but it adds stability ( it large rubber mat + rest , mousepad sits top mat part )	1
unit satisfying advirtised all ways . i thought max volume limitation peak not close what unit could produce , ( maybe least 20% more without distortion ) volume control not go farther than allowed uni t.t he clock dark useless , it not bright enough see any distance . lastly , their no audio out port allow any singals 3 audio sourses play well through excelent speakers shelf size transmited source , it computer or sound sytem . headphone output could used computer input use , but this signal amplified . strange how this missing audio out port some lesser systems , not this one . ( there audio port , but isn'nt sort useless , if this unit 3 good audio sources ? )the unit size fine office , liv room or den not sound sytem giant party , only background music . treble control would also useful , additon bass boost least 10 % , but i suppose bass background more pleasant than treble boosted signals . overall , unit job my studio , price far above others qualtiy , size performance . i assume equalizer would driven price up , well higher max volume level . ( i would paid extra $20 . ) you get what you paid , this system fully advirtised corrrectly	1

we're small graphics agency generic 600x2400 scanner multifunction doesn't come close cutting it our needs film or artwork . this great , inexpensive addition 2400x9600 resolution . would bought brother if they'd similar standalone product , but canon decent alternative twain ocr . software install little quirky if you're experienced user don't want install entire package . it shut down ( winxp ) , so you're left no choice but install it all . we're adobe shop , frankly , don't need everything included ... so , uninstall some software . just annoyance , not big deal . more inconvenient , we use surge protector/power strips , canon still uses big 1990s wallwort covers perfectly good outlet . i'd like see them upgrade bit standalone transformer like pixma ip90 or brother machines	1

cowon iaudio x5 heir iriver player - high-end , get-out-and-push type player people who fussy their music , who don't mind managing it closely . sound excellent , this main selling point . many players referred " portable stereos " . this machine truly . where sound ipod extremely good , iaudio clarity lively presence sets it apart . iaudio boasts some sophisticated audio enhancement technology , but honest , plain sound so good you really won't need fiddle it all . good headphones you hear cough violin bow , or pick out each instruments brass section . it worth ripping your music higher bit rate enjoy improvement , or use uncompressed flac instead mp3 or ogg . luckily , there 60 gb drive your large , high-quality music files sit . controls easy enough manage , though it take little while get used them . all content organized file structure , just like folders computer . when connected computer x5 shows up extra drive , so you copy back forth easily . you transfer any type file you like using file manager , if you don't mind using expensive player storage device , you carry your work files back forth well . music , user interface also file-based , x5 not keep internal database like ipod or iriver . it read id3 tags tell you what file , though it also appears ignore unicode tags . this means you're confined albums ( or folders ) , possibly file names . so , if you want follow particular thread or particular genre , this means extra work . best way listen non-album-based way compile playlists , either creating them computer programs such winamp , or through mastering somewhat quirky dynamic playlists . ( dynamic playlist function doesn't recurse correctly , so you add one album time . ) terms amenities , cowon provides set software tools you use rip transfer content , though you'll probably your own favorites , which you continue use . unlike ipod , you're not constrained your choice software . most useful cowon utility would video converter . device itself attractive , light sturdy . external connections handled proprietary ( easy-to-lose ) detachable connector block . you might want order extra put it away , case these things ever turn out hard find . alternatively , cowon makes dock , which most convenient way set things up . it inexpensive , though it optional ordered separately . screen small , but very colorful pleasing , you choice what information appears during playback . my personal opinion movies belong big screen , so perhaps someone else comment video capabilities . demo looks convincing enough , but again , my interest iaudio ... well ... audio . i bought x5 after many ( happy ) years ipods , no other reason than see what else out there . it always good try something new , sometimes you're pleasantly surprised when you depart norm . iaudio takes some getting used , but overall , it impressive enjoyable machine . i like fact it different , wow - it really sound good !	1

when my toshiba vcr remote starting giving me problems , i decided look into universal replacement . i don't care their usual bulkiness , so this one stood out because its slim-line design . reviews positive price unbelievably low , so i took chance . it even nicer than i'd hoped . it slim , so it handles easily ; it light , buttons well placed . its programmability learning capability allow it anything your other remotes capable , you pretty much place these functions whatever keys you wish ( read instructions first--it easy . i believe reviewer who complained unit only controlling limited number functions not fully read instructions utilized programming/learning capability . i'm impressed what it , which includes everything my vcr remote ) . keys reusable devices ; , key that set up particular function one device totally free new setting when you switch device mode . it isn't backlit , which not particular problem me , but might feature someone else needs . i bought second one . i purchased " 6 device " , then bought " 8 " second , i tell you only difference them two additional device controls --- there no other added functions " 8 " --- but , it didn't need any ( well , maybe backlighting thing ) . i haven't it long , so i can't speak durability , although i dropped it couple occasions it unfazed . it actually seems very sturdy . i guess i'm trying figure out why such low-priced remote so nice . i can't . if you're looking simple , but effective , universal remote , or just replacement or extra one , you won't disappointed this purchase .	1

i'll never buy branded power adapter laptop original manufacturer anymore . i like extra plug - one keep home one keep my laptop bag so i don't constantly grab cord . since price less than buying real sony , hp , or whatever ac adapter , multiple plugs it more flexible , this great choice . when you outgrow your laptop , you still use it . note : don't buy car/airplane adapter only . their little bit cheaper , but most time you'll still want carry ac adapter so you'd end up stuffing both regular power adapter car/airline adapter into your bag . better just buy one " all-in-one " like this keep your original power cord home extra . i haven't used in-line splitter charge cellphone or pda . i'm not sure i find useful since i carry my actual cellphone charger cable anyway - i wouldn't trust not it	1

i got this special amazon ($99 +free shipping ) , which only reason i purchased it . klipsch , i think , little crazy their expectation this system worth $299 . why i think this ? well , terms bang buck , this system falls short - especially when you consider unless you digital source this essentially 2.1 system . 2.1 realm , you find many systems higher per channel wattage than this far less cost . if cost okay , you certainly find more feature packed systems price . any number well-equipped bookshelf systems come mind , including some excellent offerings onkyo denon . i can't comment 5.1 capabilities . if you don't need features , prefer quality volume , then read . audio performance redeeming factor , there gmx d- 5.1 holds its own against traditional audio systems , trounces most other computer audio products . 3 " main driver satellite , this system reasonable chance midrange performance . midrange , while admirable , still sounds anemic comparison my reference speakers due falloff mid-bass frequencies . satellites rely sub help here , which course leads muddy imaging particularly noticeable male vocals . tweeter blends well midrange gives good high frequency definition without too directional , though it might too prominent frequencies above 8khz some listeners . sub gives exceptional performance audiophile , provided you aren't kind person who accepts nothing less than pair 12 your car . notes distinct completely lack rumbling or booming quality ubiquitous low priced . 1 components . extension admirable 6.5 " driver , though output limited south 40hz . system claims 108db spl , while i'm sure possible , anything above 102db it starts losing its charm . this undoubtedly due 1% thd found 10 wpc rated output . 2%thd sub much less noticeable . fit finish exceptional , particularly subwoofer . satellites distinct " ikea-new-age-lamp " feel them , but sub very traditional matte black solid construction . i don't any problems overgrown hockey puck control panel . it fits nicely my desk , though it isn't ideal small workspace . it fit atop sub , should you choose place accessible area . $100 , this system performs exceptionally , overall sound quality far better than most comparably featured systems . advantage diminishes regular price , gmx d- 5.1 melds into pack .	1

when you look picture sony mdr-j10 headphones , you probably think " great idea ! " i certainly , i thought they'd answer my annoyances earbuds falling out while i run . well , that partly true . over-ear design ingenious , there no slippage whatsoever , which refreshing . but design also its most major flaw : most headphone speakers which project directly into your inner ear , but placement speakers this set such they face forward into tragus ( projection cartilage sticks out your ear ) , which means sound inherently distorted . you adjust placement somewhat but , me , it feels like i'm simply choosing less annoying variation distorted sound . what more , overall sound bit tinny weak my tastes . i realize these very inexpensive headphones , but even running , i can't cope such thin-sounding music . after trying these , i switched back earbuds i already owned found it less annoying they fell out occasionally -- after all , they sound great when they stay , which more than i say sony mdr-j10 headphones .	-1

i'm not sure why other reviewers such trouble bass response . i placed both speakers six feet apart foot wall behind them overwhelming bass preponderance . fact , when i equalized sound using pink noise generator , it required significant bass cuts achieve balanced sound still floors vibrate every drumbeat . perhaps it reflects difference taste other reviewers . regardless , these speakers sound excellent my house ( old house , hardwood floors , large rooms ) generate plenty volume while maintaining clarity . price , including shipping , i would recommend them anyone space need speakers this size	1

i purchased this westinghouse 37 " 1080p monitor ( lvm-37w3 ) because i very impressed its ability used both high-res monitor work but also hdtv play ( xbox 360 ) . product itself pretty good -- picture great , colors wonderful . but if you any kind problem this product , it game over . westinghouse digital no online support speak . i've sent numerous emails through their site received no responses over month . i finally got contact customer service agent through my extended warranty service it turns out westinghouse no local technicians even examine your machine . you ship it them ( your cost ) them examine , they said it take 6-8 weeks or more before they get back you . this policy completely egregious -- 2 months time fix quickly depreciating machine it costs customer shipping ?? little research you see all customer service horror stories this product after people it while . go real manufacturer local repair technicians	-1

this cable isn't cheap . so why pay so much it ? why not just buy cheap s-video cable ? because quality suffers . they don't just jack up price no reason . gold tipped connecters , more shielding interference , thicker wire , better quality materials used provides better picture . colors more vibrant , whole picture more defined . you get what you pay , this monster cable definitly proof . i this cable it worth it . monster all way	1

i mixed feelings this product . idea behind it fine -- keep all your cds/dvds one place , away too much handling . problem sony implementation mediocre best . user interface * terrible * ; so bad you almost can't believe they'd release product like this . you need keyboard anything reasonable , " load info dvd " feature barely works . when it , it wrong uneditable . remote control so poorly laid out it almost comical . most important button , get list your dvds , labeled " folders " tiny bad location . plus once all your dvds loaded , then what ? you only support one tv ... i other tvs dvd player car , so i either unload them ( device forgets everything ) , or copy all dvds i need use multiple machines . if you not sure whether get this , i'd consider buying your movies itunes using appletv , or some other similar model . you might also consider any fair use provisions let you keep copy dvds you rightfully own permanent insertion into this device ( although interface still absolutely horrible ) . if remote user interface actually functional elegant , i'd probably feel differently this product	1

purchasing this cable set , you limiting your options . you now must use your a/v receiver sound whenever you play game because you loose analog sound connection you 400 ( analog sound comes out same port video ) . spend 10 dollars you save inexpensive optical cable you now best both worlds , you option using tv sound or a/v receiver same quality video . i say video quality my 62 " hdtv improved dramatically addition component ( red , green , blue ) video gamelink 400 over composite ( one video cable ) connection comes ps2 . however if you're kind person who thinks 450 must better because it bigger number than 400 , it probably won't matter you anyway ..	-1

i bit apprehensive after reading all these negative reviews , but i thought i'd give it try myself , return it if it didn't work ou t.t urns out i am pleased . main thing i bought it watch downloaded avi movie files my tv over my wireless network , it job perfectly . i surprised quality picture . no video pauses or skipping issues . i haven't it lose network once . it simple set up . while it wasn't detecting my wireless network , but then i realized it wasn't units fault , it my wireless network . i just needed reboot router . after it effortless . if main thing you purchasing this video playback , then buy it . it works great . but if your main objective music or photos , it somewhat sub-par . its not unusable , it just could use some improvement those areas i'm sure there better units out there music player . i think lot negative reviews result people setup problems giving up , or people who wanted use it mainly photos or music .	1
usual , sandisk give us great memory card , used all memorystick pro compatible products , like my sony cli� peg-nz90 my sony cybershot dscs60 .	1
after reading other reviews , i decided go ahead get these . especially what they cost , they get job . like reviewer stated , make sure hammer carpet spikes into base before doing anything else . take your time assembling them . drive screws just enough stick out top bottom pieces then line them up holes supports before driving them rest way . otherwise , you risk splitting wood ( or whatever you call what they made out ) . after assembly , careful when moving them carpet or you easily snap spikes off ( it happened me ) . my stands partially hidden behind some furniture so they not noticable . if yours going out open , you may want spring higher end model	1
garmin , edge 305 heart rate/cadence , set standard literally eliminated competition . only thing others this point copy attempt duplicate . we ( 2 ) hr cad . both used flats los angeles county hills orange/san diego county . gps never failed work . actually nothing edge 305 failed work 1000 miles each . you program screen display multiple items glance see all your desired information . i monitor speed , distance , elapsed ride time , time day , hr , cad calories . heck , edge 305 better than bike ! training software also outstanding . only negatives nothing actual computer performance my opinion include : * price-this toy aint cheap . * size-relatively big bike computer , but very light . * battery-our units both safe four ( 4 ) six ( 6 ) hours .	1

i really trying hard love this headset because sound awesome . but ( this big but ) - i couldn't get satisfactory response microphone . problem seemed it never close enough your mouth due it completely separate unit . you supposed clip it your shirt or mount it your monitor enclosed clip device . mic separate it so far away i either set my sensitivity up so high it picked up everything room , or else i yell get it hear me ( then it still picked up lot background noise ) . i take set back get one attached microphone since i mainly play online games my brother-in-law he simply couldn't hear me all this microphone . ( i tried every combination settings various control panels , both game within windows creative control panels . ) pros : - awesome sound- very comfortable- three piece unit ( so you use headphones your mp3 player)cons : - separate microphone poor qualityhighly recommended if you don't rely voice chat gaming ( unless you play your closet )	1
this adaptor fantastic . we actually get better speed -- 115 mbps -- than what we get ethernet adaptor directly , which limited 100 mbps . it pick up signals least six houses away don't even show up my laptop , which intel 2200bg card . easy install even when switching new computer . our nine months old we're still very pleased . definitely good bang buck	1
i decided dust off my old technics direct drive turntable play some records family room kids . i connected it my system , rather high-end naim audio preamp amp kef speakers , it sounded just like you'd expect typical turntable would sound when mated high end audiophile type stereo system . i some research found shure cartridge ( m94 type purchased several years ago ) really didn't get very good reviews , so before buying new turntable i figured i'd try just upgrading cartridge . i chose this one because all rave reviews because reviewers went out their way say how bright " cd like " this cartridge made their records sound . this exactly what i wanted because my system already excels base midrange , i didn't need cartridge emphasizes what my system already good , but rather what it not so good . so i bought this cartridge carefully set it up according instructions . careful get overhang close you specs your turntable ! i washed off played old andrews sisters greatest hits record 70 . horns jumped out me old swing music just rocked my world ! difference this cartridge made like night day . now i've got cheap old turntable wired snooty high-end british system it actually sounding pretty good .	1
i wanted like this product . i really wanted like this product . but i am severely disappointed . when i purchased iaudio this past summer , i quickly learned my unit problems . when i moved mp3 file onto player , 85% time there would these weird skips electronic noise associated it . sometimes deleting reinstalling file helped . often it didn't . so i contacted their customer service , updated firmware instructed . problem still there . so i returned it cowon , they insisted player fine . i sincerely doubt random electronic noise feature , but once they say there isn't problem i don't know what else . so they sent it back me . i've tried it out again , problems remain . lark tonight , i looked them up better business bureau website . their rating . go figure . i would not recommend this product	1

this one great radio . this my 2nd one . i've my 1st one five years purchased my office . great sound , reception great outdoors	1
this unit works great . good buy money . i gave it 4 stars because my situation i use static ip addresses rather than dhcp dynamic addresses . unit intended users dhcp where your system obtains ip addresses auttomatically . there no written warning or instructions it won't work static ip addresses . i called linksys tech support tech very helpful . even though they no written documentation static ip , he knew how it he worked me through it ( which i wrote down all steps ) . most regular home computers use dhcp would no problems this	1

i picked up this receiver $200 plus $40 shipping . price it hard go wrong unless receiver just doesn't work . good thing receiver work works well . auto calibrate function excellent it kept me go through menu enter distances other characteristics speakers . just start calibration , walk out room come back few minutes . component video switching work well although consumer electronics companies ( sony particular ) made huge mess connectivity standards . there so many issues what works what anymore . too many connection types , drm , etc . i would really like plug any device into receiver send all video out tv . truth i can't plug s-video my dvd player composite my tivo into receiver it shown s-video my tv . everything input must s-video or composite but not combination two . but back receiver . it good number audio modes movies , music games . music doesn't sound very good me but could something my speakers . i set my small speakers " large " receiver so they would output more bass surrounds . i 250w sub but getting more low frequency sounds satellite speakers helps fill out midrange . this more issue small speakers than it receiver . i couldn't comment correctly audio performance unless i large set stereo speakers . i couldn't get any output pre-out jacks receiver . this disappointing because i specific use them mind . i also couldn't program remote my tv or dvd player . i fine this issue because i bought universal remote my entire system . one other issue i receiver i didn't like am/fm/xm all selected input same button . makes use universal remote much harder . i would rather button select fm input select xm . , i never know whether i'll getting am/fm or xm when i hit tuner button . i also remove analog audio inputs my dvd player order receiver use digital coax connection instead . i didn't expect receiver default worst audio connection available . overall , i'd recommend this receiver someone who looking buy one this price range . it good selection inputs , good sound performs expected	1

patrick miller " sauropod " already said it better but here take : . if you going buy receiver always go manufacturer web site , click support download owners manual . it tell you far more than amazon or any web site . i this jvc , sony , yamaha onkyo . . also decide if your real priority sound or if you really care video upconversion .. video upconversion really provinceof dvd player or tv . i not think it important receiver . . anyway my priority sound quality . tv boring me . manuals i downloaded all different receivers showed onkyo much more thorough technical specifications . others not , though they hiding something . also very noteworthy , if you take close look , this bottom line onkyo very similar amplifier specs top line model . it also vast majority sound processing modes . so this choice .. i tempted buy jvc because it only one five band eq unlike all others which only bass treble . jvc also more attractive functional remote control sound level each speaker without using onscreen menu . jvc also nice feature allowed usb connections computer . jvc would won if they better amp better speaker connectors back - they only ones used cheap push clamp connectors .. yamaha also good deal around $300 because it preamp out connections but it too seemed lacking .. i figured $200 today delivered this good deal money i saved i could use buy one new receivers hdmi 1.3 year when they relatively debugged ..	1
if your looking small necklace style mp3 player you cant go wrong iaudio t2 . i use it everyday work most time i dont even know i'm wearing it . it size makes it very unabtrusive no cables get tangled up . battery life decent 10-12 hours per charge . it its minor problems though . it sounds very good , but supplied headphones could better . thats also problem , if you use pair headphones you lose its necklace ability . navigating takes some getting used well . dont let negatives turn you off however . it very good product	1

i read some reviews this reason i'm writing this . i purchased two these units almost 3 years ago they operated flawlessly me . i them connect together no-delay feature there no gap music . soon song ends one cd deck song starts other . i 390 cd each unit . during christmas holidays they full , 400 each . reason i take christmas cd out sometimes i like play both units full random , all disc , shuffle . who wants christmas music all year long . both units operate advertised . so if you like me couldn't decide which cd put smaller cd changer ( i 5 disc changer ) , or though cd you wanted hear . now problem solved , i access 800 cd .	1

i would very wary positive reviews this product . i find it hard believe such piece garbage could thought so highly . first off , you must hold top down get item laminated through machine . this would minor inconvenience if this only problem . really bad news laminate bubbles horribly , it hazy rather than clear . how anyone would use this photos beyond me . next , magnetic backing doesn't stick all whatever your laminating . it just falls right off . there absolutely nothing worthwhile this piece junk . i bought this based reviews others here . shame them misleading people this way . if you want use this arts crafts type toy pre-kindergarteners , maybe . serious use , never . spend extra money get quality heat laminating machine	-1
i wanted keyboard use w/ my media center pc , which hooked up my tv my living room . like others mentioned , mouse pointer device not work well . but if you change mouse setting control panel slowest or second slowest setting you find it easier navigate . just sitting your couch mostly using media center or doing light computing this fine . mce remote functions keyboard very handy , keyboard works great , mouse pasable . but if you trying any kind activity requires extensive use mouse then this definitely drive you crazy	1

i purchased this cable so i could watch satellite tv my portable dvd player my computer . you probably need adapter convert rca-style connectors mini connectors most players . there doesn't appear any loss signal quality , even though cable very long . video wire pretty thick , so probably helps . nice cable good price	1
these speakers rate 5 stars ! very clear midrange treble . tight relatively deep bass . these speakers very good imaging sound ' dynamic ' . efficient so not lot volume needed make them play loud . speakers sound best ' loudness ' but require no other treble or bass adjustments . they listened least 1 hour per day . i am average hearing . speakers mounted stands which 4 feet off floor . these speakers receive my full endorsement great sound . bic dv62cls ( center speaker ) reported leading consumer magazine others whose opinion respected sound even better deeper bass but twice price	1
note : this copy review i posted red model this radio . old ( silver ) grundig/eton s-350 phased out . ( see my review s350 ) . eton s350dl series replacment ... more this , visit website " passport world band radio " ( passband.com ) under " receiver news : update edition 2006 " ( near bottom page ) . s350dl ( headphones eliminated package , see s350dlr , s350dlb s350dls ) then drop same price old s350 . right now , some older stock s350dl ( headphones still included ) sold off cheaper than normal price ... shop around . i not own s350dl , but it reported this model reduces " drift " problem observed s350 , provides stereo reception through headphone jack . perhaps eton now offer this radio more colors , since it dropping silver model ... nice " electric blue " or " emergency yellow " like they use some other models ( crank-power pocket ) would go well blue display illumination	1

i've using this mic couple years record round-table conferences , hearing room situations phone depositions - sometimes distances 15-20 feet or more ! only wear tear i've noticed sticky underside mic , which helps keep it place surface , partly torn off . not really problem . sound quality equal , if not better than , more expensive mics i , some costing over $a200 . added bonus labtec 333 no battery required , which means : ) you don't remember turn mic or off ; ) no fretting replacing batteries or not sure if they running low ; ) no unwanted feedback into some equipment , sometimes caused powered mics . pricewise , i personally don't think there better mic market .	1

i like look my macbook pro , so i keep it ( fairly ) clean am very careful it . however , keyboard one those problem areas hard clean , particularly notebook computer . i looked several more intrusive ( adhesive ) scratch-resistant solutions , but i found protouch best option me . because my main focus keeping system clean , i wanted able remove it , clean it off , put it back , while knowing whatever dust , gunk , etc ., it collecting wasn't getting into my keys . protouch works fabulously this purpose . silicone not quite transparent , but pretty good job letting macbook pro color shine through . some reviewers complained mbp keyboard difficult see cover some conditions . i no such problems , least far protouch concerned . mbp keyboard , because its keys designed allow light through , hard see low-light conditions -- this unavoidable , not really fault cover . remember clean it regularly , though , or oils such protouch transfer screen . it reversible good cleaning monitor , but still disappointing	1
i submitted review earlier ( follows ) . however , i've become very disappointed operation this unit . specifically , it stops showing remote temperature frequently . nothing wrong remote . i remedy problem removing one battery main unit , then replace it wait it correct itself . ** end edit ** original review follows still applies . rri installed unit just after denver christmas 2006 blizzard . i used standard batteries remote but still able read -11 deg . later , unit stopped transmitting ( see other person review ) . i replaced remote batteries it worked fine since then . i might go lithium batteries next time . real drawback , my view , smooth , curved display cover . it reflects light all directions makes it difficult read unless you move around or move very close . product would better flat display cover and/or etched cover ( reduce reflection )	1
i using this mouse work since it came out . after many miles use , scroll wheel finally started fail . i now spin wheel several times before screen actually scrolls . best feature this mouse battery life . coworker who swears his logitech mouse would change his batteries every couple months , but i usually got least ten months out mine . i even took dating batteries when i installed them , just rub it . this mouse bit heavy not slide well some , but overall i would recommend it . going try rechargable logitech next time around	1

i've 2820 month now taken several trips , some where i've known route few where we charting new ground . most part street pilot performed well we got destination . however , when i used it guide me locations i'd previously it didn't always take me way i thought it should . eventually street pilot recaluated route would catch up way i going which during past travels i determined fastest way . regardless it performed very well . one case we tried program garmin location it didn't recognize , even though when we got there it all streets etc . provided acurate directions other locations spot . i e-mailed cartography department advised them what i saw they prompt responding solution when i programmed it , it got me location i looking . i noticed if your programming alternate route use cities data points route garmin wants take you center city you use data point . i'm sure there way program garmin so it doesn't , but i haven't time figure out exactly how level trip programming . if fact there isn't way you'll just get used hearing speaker continually say " recalculating route " . thats just minor annoyance benefit street pilot . sometime you may need search cities near where you want go get directions . i looking tierre verde florida , but needed type st. petersburg . regardless it worked cartography department quick respond . overall i'm impressed garmin my next purchase xm receiver manuver me around traffic tie ups . this product gets my recommendation .	1
i am returning it . bluetooth signal keeps fading out every 45 seconds or so . when it worked , it great , but not single song went without dead air problem 3-4 seconds then it would reconnect start playing again . i contacted logitech customer support they sent me email 3 days later suggetions completely different product . then i called long distance them stayed hold 14 minutes only told it sounded like it defective i should return it . not very satisfying customer service experience ; i high hopes this product ; i may order one later see if my luck any better then .	-1

this warranty purchased through amazon , but it actually distributed company . when you search tv warranties amazon , you see 4 warranties appear same , but different prices . i called company sells these warranties asked what difference . they told me there no difference $119 warranty $499 warranty ; they cover exact same thing . girl i spoke even asked her manager he said there no difference . warranties tricky item review , because it all looks good until you actually need it . so , this one , i suppose only time tell . one difference amazon warranty electronic store warranty amazon one not replace first bulb tv ; but i figure if i need replace bulb within those four years i still saving $100 because i get new bulb around $200 .	-1

my home theatre reasonable system any measure better than most . however , my wife re-arranged living room furniture one stroke my cherished system made redundant . my two rear wall mounted speakers now my left no possibility mounted somewhere else . it time look polk yamaha products . unable audition polk surroundbar yamaha ysp-1000 a/b comparison , i consequently decided purchase both , idea i would eventually keep one sell other . i now both units 10 weeks when doing my a/b comparisons , both systems set up so one speaker sitting just above other , playing same material instant a/b switching via remote control . note - it takes quite few readings instruction manuals eventually understand how set them both up properly . after comparing lord rings , pirates caribbean , pink floyd pulse variety cds music videos , my assessment : 1/ . both products produce satisfying sound field effective watching movies ( albeit very different ways ) . 2/ . my living room ( which pretty " live " ) my equipment polk , they both sound remarkably similar . this big surprise me . cds some music videos , most noticeable differences sound mostly due subwoofer performance . 3/ . either system produce effects equal 5 channel system discrete rear speakers ? course answer " no " . neither these systems produce rear surround effects distinct those generated rear surround speakers . but so many ways this question misses real point issues these products successfully address : 4/ . let me rephrase question : both systems produce big sound field envelopes you , similar what one might experience real cinema ? answer " yes " you hear convincing surround sound effects intended movie producers , immerse you into movie thus enhance your enjoyment ? once again answer " yes " . 5/ . if you want decent home theatre sound but cannot install multi-speaker surround system or you simply don't want , then these products solution work . 6/ . after reading forums net , i idea polk going sound better than ysp when it came music . actually cds etc , they both sound same , similar tone , both produce big sound , go loud each other ( very loud indeed ) . nothing distinguish one really better than other , assuming polk coupled quality surround amp sub . surprise here yamaha it myriad " tiny " 2 watt amplifiers comfortable really loud sound levels . 7/ . which better ? both plus minus points so it isn't clear cut . yamaha ysp-1000 matching yst-sw225b 150w subwoofer : -plus points : -+ guaranteed great sounding home theatre system . yamaha engineers made sure . + in-built power amplification ( this termed ' active ' speaker generally desirable configuration)+ decent pre-amplifier functionality eg volume control ( db level displayed ) , bass treble control , audio video input selection ( selectable 4 sources ) , auto-room equalisation , plenty surround sound modes , ir signal pass-through , remote control capable macros etc . fact ysp-1000 remarkable amount technology literally stuffed into it . + more effective producing distinct surround sound effects than polk , especially when set up it " ideal " configuration . ie centred against wall square room . + ysp effectively compensate corner position ( contrary notion ysp works well only when ideal environment)+ remote control other manufacturers products . + all you need extra dvd player tv . minus points : - requires side rear walls . - looks bulky industrial , my opinion not attractive addition any living room . - titanium colour ( more like dark grey ) not good match most silver big screen tvs . - remote bit frustrating times , too easy wrong control mode , eg you find yourself changing tv channels when you may intended change surround mode . - no hdmi input/output- cannot transcode composite component video signals . you committed all composite or all component input / output video signal pathway . ( not really problem if every device you connect ysp video inputs composite video out . )- on-screen menues only available composite video . so if you decide go all component video pathway best picture quality , you then lose your ysp on-screen menues . - no s-video inputs - probably impossible owner tell if any 40 speakers/amplifiers inside cabinet failed need replacing . - should dvd player built . polk surroundbar : -plus points : + looks great , visually complementing most big screen tv sets very nicely . + not require side rear walls your listening room . + similar yamaha respect it capability produce big , convincing sound field . + would make excellent choice " all-in-one " right/centre/left front speaker conventional surround system . minus points : -- requires investment 5 channel home theatre amplifier plus subwoofer- not guaranteed great sounding home theatre system . polk full potential could easily compromised `weak link " resulting poor choice ancillary equipment . - surround effects never really localised , rather you hear them originating hazy , general area , comapared yamaha which creates more convincing localisation effect . 8/ . conclusion : good looks - polk surroudbarfor rooms without side or rear walls - polk surroundbarfor square or rectangular rooms , even ysp corner - yamaha yspfor " most bang your dollar " - yamaha . ysp both sound good ( remarkably similar ) probably end up costing same set up once you add necessary ancilliary equipment polk . my particular situation i am trying rid my living room many boxes possible . consequently , if polk managed squeeze pre-amp power amp into their surroundbar charged accordingly , then polk would my first choice . it just looks much better than ysp unit . unfortunately they haven't , so yamaha stays i'm now selling off polk my existing denon amp , bw sub anthony gallo speakers	1
if you've seen this piece local stores you've probably heard they come assembled . well , amazon version requires assembly . while it wasn't too difficult or time consuming ( maybe two hours including disposal/organization packing materials ) , it would nice know it . aside assembly , quality look cabinet great . definitely worth sales tax savings get it through amazon - plus you get feeling accomplishment once you've put thing together	1

this single device could potentially everything i want .... if it all worked . ( rev ) . specs great which what made me buy it , but like most d-link hardware , it very poorly executed rushed market . major issues : 1 ) occasional ' freezing ' random disconnects several moments while browsing folders2 ) no option automatically boot back up after power failure3 ) upnp-av not sort alphabetically . this makes playing entire folder alphabetical ( or chronological ) order impossible . 4 ) tech support seems focused turning around emails ( albeit slowly ) , not doing any actual tech support . 5 ) extremely noisy fan ... i mean ridiculously noisy ! 6 ) no option edit email server port number email alerts7 ) overall poor quality , should lot more testing before released public . not bad price , but if you don't need all these features one device , look elsewhere	1

this television outstanding picture quality considering it price . you can't find better value than this tv this price range . my xbox 360 looks fantastic over vga . some older lcds you worry ghosting lag , but i not encountered any problems it . now complaints ... ready realize how bad standard def looks ! once you've seen things hd , you won't able look your grainy sd signals same again . also , channel changing bit laggy ( minor annoyance . ) menu also bit wonky difficulty navigate , but it it job fine . i would like few more controls over picture . i like you update bios via usb	1

i am not technophile , but after 8 weeks looking all options pricepoints , i knew much more than people retail stores . i first bought 46 " sony aquos it terrible variety reasons , most notably it really bad vertical horizontal banding , extent i started noticing flaw tvs wall retail stores - there simply no excuse kind thing leave factory . there other user-unfriendly issues too so aquos went back . i've this 6 weeks it great . swivel plus , though i disregarded my purchase . on-screen navigation friendly logical , puts controls your hands , versus some dynamic brightness default parameters aquos which bothersome . i haven't time figure everything out it yet , but it hooked up my 10 year old onkyo stereo , it all great ! amazon service delivery went fine . buddy mine analyst major bank followed amazon years , pushed me go ahead take leap big ticket item purchase . i am amazon fan until they cause me otherwise	1

first all , thanks amazon not listing dimensions this ... it 38mm deep , not 25mm like other 120mm antec fan my case . only reason i bought it cause i gift cards needed one , so i thought why not put antec fan my antec case . wrong , it waste my gift cards . it just too loud . i sonata case this loudest thing there ... it even hooked up psu fan controller power cords , which supplys minimal power . it just too expensive noise . dont even think connecting it regular 4-pin connector , i tried this it sounded like jet engine my room ! it probably woke up my neighbors	1
i bought this magellan 3000t took it still box vacation melbourne fl . i read directions plane it seened very easy set up . so i go set it up my rental car . i take out power cord it doesn't look right . side plug goes into magellan isn't round shape like it should . it shaped like trapezoid like end cable goes usb computer magellan . i accidently plugged it into usb port magellan . i'm lucky i didn't fry thing . well i called magellan customer service i spoke someone country ( outsourcing ) accent hard understand . i explained box came wrong charger . representitive hard time believing me . i read serial number charger cord her she placed me hold . she confirmed i received wrong cord . she said she would ups it me i would receive it 5-7 business days . i explained her i vacation needed use it now wanted it overnighted me . she refused . after getting rather firm her ( put it nicely ) , she put me hold again . she returned after 3 minutes said she would send it ups 2 day my hotel . i agreed would ok . well tuesday friday it still not there . i checked out hotel monday called customer service soon i got home . she gave me tracking number which indicated it delivered friday . i told her hotel sais they never received it . i called hotel again they checked again said they don't it . well magellan customer service tells me i sould track it down ups . i told her go track it down herself it would easier me return magellan place i bought it . just purely bad customer service . i lug this thing back forth couldn't even use it . i also got lost driving disney drove 40 minutes out my way . i am completely fed up magellan . i only gave it 2 stars instead 1 because maybe it would worked well if i could turned it , but i'll never know . well i ordered tip my igo charge magellan it works fine . price i paid ($250 ) i'll overlook my frustation say pretty nifty , if you don't mind paying extra few bucks charger . first time i tried update software program locked up . second time charm . i see others complain it not able play music function gps same time , who cares . i bought this so i won't get lost . i ipod listen music . why people so hung up electronics multi functional .	1

this 3rd gps unit i owned i am bit disappointed . first off , " intergrated traffic monitoring " means unit shipped garmins add-on gtm12 device . this device not integrated needs attached 370 operation . bluetooth integration useful , but volume quality built-in speaker not great , making it difficult hear callers . units detour feature also more limited than other units i owned . instance it not allow user view chosen route exclude road . you only able exclude road you currently driving . other than , maps fairly up date , poi database lot information screen pretty decent most light . finally , like most other units i used , it tendancy pick routes not optimal . example it may route you through middle city because it shortest distance ( mileage wise)to destination . this fails take into account multiple traffic lights inherent congestion add huge amount time trip could much quicker if route chosen . if you must nuvi , save your money buy 350 ... added features 370 not worth added cost	1

this product would answer all my problems if it weren't few fatal flaws ; 1 ) it not support ' multifunction ' keyboards ... their technical support informed me this includes any keyboards include volume control , internet buttons , etc . you know , kind come most modern pcs sold today . i don't use those buttons keyboards cheap - i'd willing just buy new one except : 2 ) mice wheel buttons not supported ( according their tech support , this also constitutes ' multifunction ' device ) ... so if you gamer ( or just like wheel button ) , prepare replace your gaming mouse plain vanilla 2-button mouse . 3 ) their tech support pretty awful ; they seem checklist devices unsupported ( despite pretty standard most pcs market today ) , seem more interested finding reason why your configuration unsupported ( thus ending call ) than actually working you . my mouse working both pcs but just little choppy one , but once support person latched onto fact it wheel , they unwilling waste second talking what might causing problem if anything all could fix it . it too bad , it even slick looking little device . i give it two stars because it indeed switch back forth two monitors	1

first , i purchased my 276c september 04 which means i've using 3 months . it purchased replace my garmin gpsiii i used around 6 years . gpsiii still works great but no detail maps available no turn turn directions , but basic lat/long it still works perfect . i compared 276c garmin quest , magellan roadmate 700 , garmin street pilot series . i wanted it portable . meaning i could use it car , boat , or walking/hiking . basically i wanted able use it just anywhere , just like i used my gpsiii . this quickly narrowed my search down 276c quest . others mentioned above strictly automotive gps units . besides size , i couldn't find anything quest over 276c . 276c certainly bigger but i liked additional screen real-estate . 276c purchased automotive adapter everything i want it it well . however , i 3 complaints keep it getting perfect score my book . these not really any particular order importance . #1 proprietary memory stick only go up 256mbthis memory stick holds all map data helps you find addresses specific sites . one comes automotive kit only 128mb . you can't just go get one these anywhere because it proprietary design . 128mb one i enough storage download all map data austin , texas las vegas , nevada . we drove vegas austin november 276c worked great . i wish it wasn't proprietary design or i wish they least offered larger model would hold entire us . #2 cheap , cheap , cheap car adapter . i read this review site before i bought mine . they right . threading holds fuse place plastic . pulling unit out car power plug puts stress threads . mine broke last week but quickly replaced authorized garmin dealer . this item you can't just buy anywhere because car adapter built speaker . i don't expect new adapter last long either . i move mine cars several times week . #3 file this one under very picky . if address your destination one way street 276c try route you around block so you come back down one way street . this fine except when location really corner one way street entrance side street . unit literally route you right past side entrance next street allow you go up few blocks so you come right back down location one way street . i don't know if automotive only gps units would handle this situation any better . that it . we drove over 3000 miles our trip november used 276c extensively whole way . regards , alan	1

note : this copy review i posted wr-100b , which appears nearly same ( check both listings best price ) . i live oregon , which not noted severe storms , but i really caught " off guard " last week when severe thunderstorm large amount hail blew through . severe weather occur almost anywhere ! shortly after storm , i ordered one these weather alert radios keep me more aware any local hazard could pose threat . radio itself quite sensitive , provides reception several more distant weather stations not picked up less sensitive receivers such general purpose ( am/fm/tv/wx ) sony 410 ( see my review sony ) . big deal here weather alert function ... radio set silent until it receives specially coded message noaa weather station . radio programmed respond " codes " one area or several , so you adjust your " zone protection " suit your needs . when warning affects area you programmed ( setting specific same codes ) detected , loud alarm or flashing light or voice alert sound ( your choice ) . if it desired hear weather report , just push " weather " button unit listen ... very much like those old radio shack " weather cubes " very popular 20 years ago , but better reception . everyone should one ( or more ) these	1

i find it strange memorex dvd-rw reviews here favorable , while same time memorex dvd+rw reviews complain bad media . last year i bought memorex ram disk well memorex dvd-rw disks use my toshiba d-kr2 . i believe i only one bad disk out 10 or so i used . they lasted over full year through dozens dozens recordings eventually degraded , no complaints here time i probably would given them 4 stars . however i recently bought pack 5 memorex dvd-rw only 1 5 formated ( hence rating here ) . i also recently bought pack fuji ram disk first two i tried not work failed several tries formating . unfortunately , i bought these best buy which notarious their lack customer service they refused accept returns these . so , what going here ? why we letting these manufacturers get away selling products sometimes work some machines fail most time others ? where six sigma attitude when you need it ?	-1

grundig g1000a good beginner sw radio . it relatively cheaper than other grundig models , such e5 , e10 , e100 intended demographic lightweight , travel , light usage , and/or beginner sw radio . grundig g1000a wonderful overall simple figure out . you just chuck guide away , except shortwave section , you figure out all dials within 10 minutes , alarm time switches just like any standard alarm clock , use dial right frequency , one left volume . there connections left off switch ( which very tiny ) right . dials well placed good grip , making them easy turn . off switch easily accessible . it may little hard adapt if you've used previous radio different positions dials , but it isn't hard adjust . helpful alarm clock sleep option built . sleep option makes it possible so radio automatically turn off within set amount time 1 1:59 minutes . alarm turns radio , so you listen whatever . important : you must first disable alarm pressing alarm on/off switch then if you want turn off radio , then you . this neccesary because radio not turn off because alarm still " going off . " people just getting hang sw radio , there guide helpful sw frequencies per band it . audiolistic point view , speaker this radio not so great . if you really wanted get great sound , you would just get some good headphones or better speakers . but remember , you listening radio , which specially fit programs such bbc npr , which don't lot music or anything requires high quality speaker . i give it 4/5 because it not over top radio . it works just fine meets all my expectations , but personally , i use 5/5 something totally blew me away .	1

i bought this mount fairly heavy ( @100lbs . ) mitsubishi 46231 lcd screen - this mount could easily take twice weight . mount well engineered plenty adjustment wall stud spacing . i left plenty cable length so we could just pick up screen , hang set , tuck excess cable wall . worked like charm due simple design mount . two different depth mounting bars included - if using smaller bars keep set closest wall ( 1 inch ) , your outlet directly behind panel , you need wall hugger plug adapter . i would buy this product again	1

after thoroughly researching , i walked into circuit city expecting buy sony 26 " model kdl-26s2010 . however , after comparing 26 " kdl-26s2010 32 " kdl-32s2010 , 32 " model better value . consideration feature called wcg-ccfl described spec section . after side side comparison 32 " kdl-32s2010 ( no wcg-ccfl ) 32 " kdlv32xbr2 ( wcg-ccfl ) , wcg-ccfl produced noticeably superior picture , mainly due higher contrast ratio deeper blacks . i didn't mind paying slightly higher price improved picture . also , salesman suggested i compare sony comparable samsung several hundred dollars less expensive . samsung picture appear slightly better me , but sound little thin compared sony i also liked sony aesthetics much better . one other point others might find helpful ... i get cable service but they only offer 2 4 major networks hd . so , i purchased philips hd antenna(model phdtv3 ) apx $50 ab switch alternate cable air sources . after autoprogramming two sources separately , i now receive 17 hd stations over air ... free . switching cable air 3 step process involves selecting input or ab switch , selecting cable or air menu settings then selecting digital/analog remote control . this sounds little confusing , but it actually easy . worth effort i now view hd programming all 4 networks , 2 cable 2 over air ( not mention other 15 " air " hd channels ) . finally , i strongly suggest hooking up surround sound system so your ears just entertained your eyes .	1
got one jan . 2007 . overclock it 3.4 default voltage daily use . it screaming fast rock stable . compared e6300 , multiplier e6400 8 , so e6400 much easier overclock . 400mhz 8 = 3.2 . this means pair normal ddr2 800mhz memory overclock this baby 3.2 . my experience , e6400 also overclock better than e6600 , although it $100 cheaper	1

system where i store backups archives failed . i needed some way access data 300gb drive there . not time or inclination troubleshoot system , so elected try nexstar lx external enclosure . use week now . installation - could not easier . manual comprehensive includes photos could better , but adequate . includes screenshots software setup explanation each screen . step-by-step good complete . nothing missed , nothing left question . space inside enclosure tight . but , there enough room install drive route cables . one photo illustrates exactly how fold data ribbon so it fits snugly neatly . functionality - good thing : includes usb 2.0 port so you use it like normal usb external drive . plugged it , powered it up ( ext power supply ) using ( good thing ) power switch . stood right up under winxp pro sp2 ntfs formatting . so i able grab critical backups data temporarily move them drive my system . beyond compare ( http://www.scootersoftware.com/)was great here . when complete , used tray icon remove drive power down . removed usb cable installed network cable . note : while powered down , i made point entering nexstar lx mac address my router mac address filter table . this not covered docs . so if you any peculiar network settings , like this , docs not address them . when i turned drive , i followed instructions open web browser page enter \\storage url address line . opened up login dialog box configuration pages . not really much here . i try exiting after i completed see if it would recognize ntfs formatting . it would not . so i re-enter nexstar config utility format drive . took couple seconds 300gb drive so guessing it " quick " reformat . i used included smb server screen create folders . again , could not easier . just experiment , i password protected one . still very easy . use - folders created i ready start using network copy/move files nexstar lx drive . i set up shares systems my network use folders nexstar . easy , worked very well . i used beyond compare copy files folders my internal drive over nexstar check everything " same " . i'm pretty much ready settle down normal use . fact i manually weekly backups work notebook last night it like using shared drive my desktop backups . folders recognized , backups moved swiftly everything worked advertised . notes - when i using usb connection , fan so loud , i sure i would need hearing protection same rooom it . i'd read this other reviews . i removed cover see if would help . it not . course , i move case around change usb network cables connection . after i , it whisper quiet . case plastic . i little leary this . but it sturdy not really " chintsy " . very nice finish ( i black case ) . i wonder if i not shift something around when i moved case unplug usb connect catv may rubbing fan . now it no louder than simpletech usb drive next it . if it continues perform it now , i'll very happy solution . addendum : 03 nov 06 - i originally wrote this 26 aug 06 . since then , nexstar lx performed flawlessly . , it very quiet . i left default setting let drive sleep when not use . so when i first access drive there momentary delay while it spins up . once it , it runs just fine . i am backing up several different categories files ( my shareware library , mp3s , images , etc ) almost every night week cobian . this combination i dreamt . i could not more pleased . i could not recommend it higher .	1

i'm not big writing reviews , but i certainly enjoy appreciate reading them , so i figure it only fair i give back bit . let me preface this review , saying i'm hardly videophile . i lot research before making this purchase spent lot time lurking avs forums , but before , no idea what black crush , mura , handshaking , clouding , stuck pixels , banding , etc . etc . let alone how identify them . personally , i happen think lot folks over avs perhaps too critical . my amateur eyes i , however , very satisfied set recommend it anyone looking high-quality , reasonably priced lcd ( kudos amazon once again offering great service basement prices ) . proscons excellent picture audio quality - rich , vibrant colors , good contrast sharpness . i used sound video disk callibration tool tv really seems nice job little tweaking factory settings . standard definition broadcasts , while they can't touch their hd brethren , more than adequate my purposes . we farily inexpensive polk surround sound system set up , but speakers tv sound pretty good themselves ! stylish looks - tv looks great living room comes useful stand those who arent interested wall mounting . intuitive onscreen menu remote interface - tweaking factory picture settings must , tv makes it pretty easy task so . i also bought logitech harmony 880 universal remote use most time now ( which i also recommend ) but included remote solid . i wish it buttons go directly source you want use ( hdmi1 , hdmi2 , etc . ) . only thing i don't like set - it more my setup than flaw tv - there glare fish tank our living room . lcds usually better than plasmas glare department but this one specific panel which gives screen pretty ' pop ' but also heightens reflections . it only noticeable me during dark scenes , but when i notice it , sometimes i trouble refocusing picture . also , set seem some trouble details dark images ( black crush i referenced earlier ) . over avs forums , there lot complaints hdmi handshaking problems where screen flicker or drop out every so often , but i haven't any issues . i've connected time warner hd-dvr box sa oppo upconverting dvd player ( recent amazon purchase which im satisfied ) using cheap hdmi cables ( yes , also purchased amazon - no wonder they just reported great quarter ! ) . i not however yet ps3 ( its wish list ! ) which seems where most handshaking problems coming . anyway , wrap up , i'm very pleased purchase . it great option those who looking lcd set around this size that future-proofed hdmi 1.3 1080p	1

( i packed it great lots padding ups wouldn't picked it up if it thought it wasn't ) . now i am out $235 extra costs although ups gave me $100 back my damage claim without checking it out . they then sent me supposed " new " replacement only worked black white-no color picture . they offered 3rd tv but after first 2 , i screamed hollered , no success niko , but tiger direct people nice enough return my money after hearing my problems manufacturer . ps their remote sucks you find no code works your cable/satillite remotes so you use both-if you get tv works great , but if it breaks down---don't expect help	-1

this tv lot going it . nice looks , good picture . if you want replace 27 " tube tv , this set you , 4:3 image 27 " this set ( unstretched ) , you won't damage it watching black bars . course filling screen movies hdtv gorgeous . here some many positives : +strong digital tuner ( brings every digital channel la radioshack table top antenna pointed through multiple walls ! )+amazing hdtv picture digital tuner+many inputs means plenty options ( i mine hooked up my laptop via vga , my satellite via rca , hdtv antenna via coax)+satellite hooked up over 50 ' rca ( composite ) cable looks clean progressive dvd . means very good color decoder scaler . +good dvd upscaling , though i notice slight jaggies when compared hooking up computer set native resolution display letting computer scaling . considering how much more processing power computer , you can't fault tv . but if you htpc , dvds look their best played through . but there minuses : -red bias color decoder means you turn color setting down below optimal compensate . looks good , but could better . i may go into service menu see if this fixed manually . -horrible analog tuner . satellite sent over channel 3 , which looks great other tv sets , looks bad this set , but same picture sent via composite rca looks amazing . -fussy menus , could more logical , functional . -no direct input addressing . -no direct digital tv addressing . you must use auto setup , which time consuming , add channels it missed if you didn't your antenna pointed well . then you go back delete channels you don't want second time . -can't get black blacks without compressing darks . this typical lcd problem , though all companies claim fixed it . none seem yet . -smart stretch pretty " dumb " it noticeable spot where picture stretches . not fluid like panasonic smart stretch , course , some brands don't it all , but still could improved . after owning panasonic plasma setting up my sister panny plasma panny lcd projector , i know how smart stretch supposed look ... ;) -why remote so huge !!! why it so limited what it operate ? you program satellite tuners , example , but not directv or dishnetwork , two largest us providers . why some important buttons , like sleep , hidden behind door unlit ? light button doesn't glow dark , sleep button unlit . it if sharp doesn't understand why remote lit begin . -buttons top set means if you set top dresser or other tall piece furniture , you can't see buttons all . would better side set . but none those minuses worth looking elsewhere , sharp outclasses all others , especially this price . so buy this tv what it best , don't expect black blacks or good analog tuner , you'll happy	1

lc37d43u my second sharp aquos this year i say i cannot think any reason purchase any other brand lcd television . when i purchased other one ( 26 " )8 months ago i not hd yet only bought tv because physically it fit my needs so when i got hd boxes comcast last month it sort gradual transition . 37d purchased replace 32 " crt my basement . i prepared hd box getting rid damn coax cable plugging hdmi cable when tv arrived set it discovery hd channel . plugged tv into power strip , hit power button almost fell over how gorgeous picture . almost every other person reviewing lcd hd , i say sd tough look when switching hd channel , but 5 minutes after channel change picture standard channel still looks substantially better than crt ! i also want mention 6ms refresh rate . i know lot people don't put any credence this , but i see lot complaints ghosting reviews i read other ( mostly 8ms)lcd . i watched 20 minutes hockey game last night which substantially more fast paced than any football game you could watch it clear , vivid completely lacking any ghosting or weird imagery ! 6ms refresh rate ?? i'm no expert , but it seems like valid feature me ! pros : -2 hdmi inputs ( finally i take advantage this my dvd player)-easy use remote-default settings options any configurable criteria . mess around picture , volume or input settings make mistake ? hit reset button start over ... beautiful !! -sturdy constructioncons : -switching hd sd sd hd channels takes little longer than i would like image needs resize , but switching hd hd sd sd fast you would normally expect . this may normal , but i not see it 26 " . -the remote not any codes i could find control motorola cable box comcast hands out hd . ( if anyone out there knows fix this i would appreciate it)again , this my second sharp lcd 9 months i would recommend this brand this model anyone wanting solid , quality lcd tv !	1
i way too many tvs my home ( including two other samsungs ) but i needed small tv guest bedroom . our cable provider provides all local tv channels ( including all hdtv channels ) basic cable , clear -- without se t-t op box . catch , course , you need tv built-in atsc tuner recieve those channels . this one few small tvs i've seen atsc , although most it end year . setup incredibly easy - plug power , connect antenna ( or cable ) let tv its thing . my samsung found all available channels added them its memory 10 minutes . i am also impressed this tv flexibility -- it accept just any type input signal , including hdmi ( 3 ! inputs ) , component , good old composite video . picture quality very good , built-in speakers surprisingly good . i also like samsung new all-white case design . i older 23 " samsung ( also white ) my office , this set much nicer looking .	1

many radio fans familiar legendary grundig satellit line shortwave radios , dating early sixties ... e1 satellit 900 , even it advertised magazines 10 prototypes ... eton took over finally released it early august 2005 ... after satellit 800 mess , i wasn't expecting much , but after couple days ... its winner , just ordered second one sharper image they seem only one them ... here few observations ... e1 arrived almost hour ago , playing it ever since ... if you radio enthusiast , stop whatever you doing , order one before stores run out ... this one very special radio ... i now understand why pc two already ... whatever shortcomings eton marketing dept certainly made up engineering production depts ... most you already know " features " , so i'll comment my impressions things i've noticed ... - fit finish ... beautifully detailed , operating radio ... i see no fit finish issues all ! - sound ... full treble bass not distort sound normal listening levels ... would describe it " crisp punch " . - display ... awesome ! ( sorry jay , nothing compare this one ! ) . very clear bold dark readable digits evenly backlit light gray background , dark gray digits -- unlike tiny scrawny faded v21 digits . when off , there clock well over 1.5 " tall digits ... turning it puts tiny clock upper right corner , station number shrinks 3/4 " . i should mention there continuously variable contrast knob located under battery door ... station visible across room ! - tuning ... smooooooth tuning ( no notches ! :) depending band , 3 different " speeds " -- slower speeds add digits after decimal point , greater accuracy . - dx switch boosts 10db -- enough bring one my favorite low power big band fm stations ... really makes noticeable difference ! - all jacks left side except xm antenna jack which all itself right side ... interestingly , xm jack located what appears removable section radio two visible screws backside -- maybe future upgrades ??? - almost every feature some type adjustment via screens ... example , you adjust amount time snooze/sleep switch , well so many more features . i'm sure i discover much more tonite when i get more time play ... who knows what i find owner manual ( very clearly laid out i might add ) or dvd ... hardly wait xm antenna see what other tricks this radio up its sleeve ! ray	1

i've using this player nearly month now truly love this unit . it physically very small ( many ways it smaller than ipod nano ! ) sound quality quite good even headphones creative provides unit . inclusion built-in display very useful , especially when you configure internal features unit . because it device works under microsoft " play sure " specifications , you also play back drm-protected . wma files downloaded many commercial music web sites such ones offered wal-mart yahoo ! music . i would recommend couple things though -- consider getting rechargeable aaa batteries since unit use up aaa batteries fairly quickly also maximum sound quality , get good " ear " earbud headphone such panasonic rp-hje50 available amazon	1
yes , you use ordinary mini-dv tapes this camcorder but there two good reasons paying more : 1 . video encoding format hdv cameras ( mpeg2-hd ) problems recording fast motion . this leads " drop-outs " but you reduce these using better tapes . 2 . different tapes different lubricants . if you use different tapes your camcorder , you end up jamming your tape transport . decide one product best suits your needs stick it . this tape special lubricant so it probably not good idea mix ' match it even other sony tapes	1
