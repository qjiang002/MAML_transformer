elle used great fashion magazine , but no longer . ofcourse , there too many adds ( but then , that what pays mag ) . i just wish elle many other fashion mags would quit presenting all these articles ( hard hitting type ) serious subjects not belong fashion periodical . i buy elle " fashion/beauty advice " not read some pseudo intellectual writer hard hitting political agenda . hard hitting news items i read wall street journal , atlantic monthly , watch fox news .	-1
i haven't received this item . it almost two months	-1
can't give review maximum pc . never received magazine . instead i sent men magazine fhm . please send my maximum pc	-1
why ? because it underestimates our intelligence ! it nothing natural health . it advertisements . it empty , completelly . more : it looks like woman magazine but i believe clever woman would feel like i feel now , angry ! i paid something i believed but it not . ok , we make mistakes	-1
i've various times subscribed stuff , maxim , fhm magazines . stuff only one i ended up not resubscribing . it its moments photography fine . i would describe it maxim younger brother . it whole attitude seems like younger sibling popular kid high school , this kid then tries hip just funny , etc ., but it forced very juvenile . it just snarky predictable after awhile . other hand , i'm not 21 anymore either , maybe if i my 20 i would find this height humor	-1
this magazine recently ( april 05 ) featured what they felt 100 greatest movie moments all time . number 1 sing-along scene magnolia . other moments top 10 included credits austin powers 3 one eugene levy quotes american pie . keep mind , these 100 greatest movie moments all time . this mag/rag nothing more than film section fhm stretched out full-issue length . utter trash	-1
i'd always heard interesting articles this magazine . but mess ads people magazine gossip lands ( big , heavy thud ) my doorstep every month most worthless magazine i've ever made mistake purchasing . it pretentious tripe aimed small group nyc media insiders , self-regarding movie celebs , those people who'd like part world . even when they occasionally hit compelling subject , writers so narcissistic truly repellent . it'd more accurate simply cut " fair " out title	-1
i've people subscriber 2 years now i quite agree majority reviewers ... same celebrities , different week . if it isn't tomkat/kitten , it branjelina or benifer 2 . oh , we cannot forget " mrs. oops , i it again " spears-federline . very little real people/human interest stories anymore , very little ... actual magazine , it seems i've become , through no choice my own , one people quality control employees . after subscribing , i informed customer service my allergy their scented inserts . i told note would made my account i would no longer receive inserts my magazine . here where my job qc employee came , my remove these inserts several times first year , then again second year which i made call customer service . they apologized . stated there note my account regarding my request then they offered extend my subscription two more weeks . next problem part my " new " job requirements ... reassembling my magazine . i received least 4 or 5 issues people put together either backwards , upside down or half magazine front other half flipped over back . order read enjoy these issues , i remove staples , try rearrange pages then line pages up staple holes reinsert staples . again i called customer service complain . again they apologized then offered extend my subscription 2 weeks . i've since written cancel my subscription . i've not heard word back people inc ., regarding this . we'll see how it turns out	-1
i subscribed this magazine year found it waste money . every issue girl bikini front ( can't woman look sexy anything but ? ) every issue claims " best ever exercise .... " ok .. what last 10 issues claimed same thing .. those exercises no longer " best ever ? " i didn't like fashion sections , i also don't like how there really aren't any articles . when i subscribe magazine i'd like able read it , not just look pictures . only thing i liked it success stories .. even those seemed repetitive ... we only allowed fruit grilled chicken ?	-1
my subscription year . but subscription office stopped sending magazines even before subscription expired . i would suggest people subscribe good housekeeping directly instead	-1
this worst magazine i ever subscribed too . i hated it so much after first issue when new ones came , i thru it right trash . here why : 1- ad after ad dietary supplements ( like dexatrim stacker ) which i think cheapins creditablity magazine b/c true health doesnt come bottle . 2- many pics overly built up women ( think fitness competitions ) ... not something average women aspire too ... too me , nasty looking . 3-the information it general information anyone common sense already know ! my advice you , avoid this magazine , unless you like body building or like looking body builders	-1
this kind impulse buy me i didn't get what i thought i would get . i thought it would clear concise magazine what up coming tv movies . instead i got indepth ramblings actors directors . if you want pick up magazine find out what coming up without fluff filler ... this not mag you .	-1

i subscriber time over 15 years before reader my parents ' subscription . it pains me say this magazine forgotten what it . frankly , only issues worth their salt those resulting major world event such natural disaster or terror attack ; such events seem energize otherwise listless staff seemingly bored editors newswriters . newsweekly obligation go beyond newspapers -- use extra couple days provide more balanced analytical view . unfortunately time fixes its editorial position beginning story -- any future coverage designed prove time initial position correct . immediate taking editorial position then carried into all future coverage event ; stifling analysis preventing any analytical development beyond first few stories --" we told you so , we told you so . " even worse , coverage lengthy story peters out until something sensational happens which point sensational event becomes ultimate interpretation entire story . can't magazine occasionally admit it wrong rather than turning its eye away story continues burn ? out sight , out mind mantra ... fact , i sometimes debate whether decline this magazine mirrors or outpaces general decline our media ; newspapers failing , television news can't seem get away gory or sensationalistic , even academic journals specialized themselves into irrelevance . we seem greater appreciation comedy than analysis . neutrality dead . frankly , i don't care so much any perceived editorial slant i fact magazine increasingly boring irrelevant . time used excellent coverage trends events outside united states -- no more . iran building nuclear weapons but merits occasional blurb world summary page . african states making vast strides towards democracy , we get article nigerian computer fraud . russia emerging turmoil perestroika its painful transition much teach costs value democracy , but we seem focus only latest roadbomb iraq . japan , one world most influential cultures , week i originally wrote this review ( see 12-month subscription ) merited only snippet regarding royal marriage analysis foreign intrusion into sumo wrestling . somewhere wide world fascinating place or culture which time could send correspondent bring place people alive its readership , instead we get tabloid excrement nature joel stein puerile take pornography social deviants . but most damning fact after reading time one asks : how hell our world become boring ? time try emulating economist rather than enquirer ? someone needs step restore proud tradition complete in-depth coverage -- educate reader world which we live ; don't wait until either natural disasters or internal politics shine spotlight any various cultures countries which real interesting events take place every single week . time history potential five-star magazine , if only it would just focus finding reporting news	-1
admittedly , i am slightly older than " relevant " demographic . but i'm not 40 yet ! so there number things here some appeal me . i applaud magazine attempting address culturally important issues . still , magazine suffers it unrelenting fawning over whole post-modern vibe it own sense self-importance beacon charismatic hipness . ( " hey , look out , world ! we jesus freaks ipods too ! " ) usually , more something or someone sweats proclaim their own relevance , more danger there they become irrelevant . so , like it spiritual cousin " charisma , " this magazine suffers somewhat shallow perspective life culture . it trumpets its ability ask " tough questions , " even it follows relatively safe , politically correct post-mod/charismatic/hipster wannabe party line . i mean , their idea cutting edge put bono cover . if you want cutting edge , put libertine adam clayton cover ask him bono faith . now , i would read article ! ( i am major u2 bono fan . i'm not knocking him ; just lack imagination " relevant " . ) there also way too much emulation world perspective generational heritage . " hey , we're young , we're smart , we don't need anything way our geezer parents it . " i guess little gray hair or wrinkles doesn't cut it today paris hilton culture , but i'd like think it might little different culture shaped biblical values . actually , " relevant " seems little afraid say what " biblical values " ( beyond obvious politically expedient ones ); it all seems amorphous here . i've never fan whole " what hot/what not " ethos . , i'd like give little more respect today christian young people think they could handle something didn't fall into same faddish trap . i am hopeful they may get it right yet " relevant " . times , they seem tantilizingly close . but it takes more than slick hairdo , male earrings , chin stubble , idolization youth , culture icon quotations , psycobabble " cool dude " theological lingo make one relevant	-1
i agree those who didn't care it . only thing i liked one article written dad who skateboarding his son . it witty , insightful inspirational . rest mag just seemed totally irrelevent my life . it aimed people who dry-clean their childrens clothes . anyone ? i don't want my kids concerned clothes money . few issues i read made me mad depressed . i've never written review before but felt compelled so regarding this lame magazine . give me break $400 cashmere hoodie my son ! my son likes his vilified character t-shirts what matters . he not reflection my style , he reflection his own . get over yourselves	-1
when i first heard there american version l'uomo vouge i really excited . i thought " finally american men fashion magazine that'll edgy , risky , creative original ! " i couldn't more wrong . this magazine virtually indistinguishable lackluster men magazines gq , esquire details . european men fashion magazines works art cutting edge photography , bold reporting beautiful advertising . you won't find any this men vouge . editors this magazine greatly insulted intelligence american readers . if i could i'd give this magazine negative 5	-1
recipes included good , but this not " cooking " magazine . this women fitness magazine disguise . while i am all magazine focuses overall health fitness , it shouldn't advertise itself cooking magazine . there way too much other junk . if i wanted makeover or exercise routine , i don't expect go my cooking magazine get .	-1
this magazine just dares people pick most boring , pretentious , or ostentatious feature within any given issue . " town country " extremely old money venture , while it some good useful articles ( lovely advertisements things virtually nobody afford , ) much magazine essentially centered very elitist worldview grows very tiresome rather quickly . " town country " initially recommended me because ostensibly good coverage travel architecture , two areas i great interest . applicable aside , when i read list tips offshoot " town country travel " publication ways ease stress long range flights , i realized there reality check due when one first tips always fly first class , ignoring fact vast majority readers would rather buy car what typical first class ticket europe or asia costs . i mentioned , there some good articles , there occasionally better more useful offshoot publications like " town country travel " eminently more readable ( although they still insist advertising things like seven million dollar vacation homes coast , etc . ) i say photography always good , you believe if it appears here it finest most fashionable available : hyacinth bucket would , no doubt , like seen reading this magazine . despite occasionally worthwhile features , i find " town country " excessively pompous , therefore i recommend finding publication focused whatever area interest you , whether it fashion , society , or travel .	-1
... because that all this magazine : advertising vehicle aimed kids who aren't old enough discriminate ads actual content yet . don't fooled venerable " national geographic " name : this publications pays only briefest lip service educational content . when my son received it gift i shocked see ads virtually indistiguishable articles . fact , ads often much more visually interesting . photos excellent , i must admit . but layout jazzed up point absurdity , if designed play kids minuscule attention spans . science facts sound , but again , articles cut absurdly short , more like squibs factoids than actual articles , if editors believe kids couldn't possibly focus one topic long enough actually read more than 250 words it ... or maybe because they didn't want distract kids all tantalizingly lucrative advertising stuffed onto every page . editor parent , i am appalled this magazine would not recommend it anyone . national geographic should ashamed itself pushing this kind junk young readers . avoid this publication like plague .	-1
change good ; however , sometimes change very bad . earlier this year pc mag decided become magazine masses instead providing technical information their longtime dedicated readers . before change this magazine i would keep year or so refer back content ; now i skim it 5 minutes don't feel there reason keep it any length time . longtime subscriber ( 20 years ) i not re-subscribing magazine . i wish them luck , but i believe they lost sight their subscription base chasing broader base subscribers might disappoint them	-1
this probably best music/movie magazine out today . however , you go borders books or barnes nobles get it $8.95 or something . this deal bs	-1
" spin " accurate name something like this -- lot hype , innocuous but rather tepid rock magazine . if rolling stone dirty old geezer rock magazines , then spin teenager who tries hard convince you he cool name-dropping strokes . spin covers some same turf rolling stone blender , but less lasciviously -- lots coverage popular bands . some them quite good -- hives , example , or indie newcomer steve burns ( who quit his job " blues clues " after hearing flaming lips album , reinvented his life rocker ) . unfortunately they overemphasize whatever bands hot moment , then overemphasize them again -- well tacking them up whatever " coolest " / " best " lists they chalk up year/decade/century/history rock . indie cred maintained few half-page articles potentially hot bands like comas metric , but this info halfhearted . it like they're reluctant tear themselves away articles better-known bands , regardless talent . writing , however , certain affliction lot major rock magazines : need cool . their writers always trying funny , but rarely come across way . it seems silly strained , like soccer mom wearing spandex tube dress . even cd reviews mediocre . however , one recent highlight dave eggers ' columns -- witty , funny , little bit skewed . fact , they often best things entirety magazine . one problems emphasis stuff hollywood . scarlett johanssen wonderful actress , yes . but she doesn't sing , nor she appeared music-based movie -- jack black yes , scarlett no . what up party coverage tv starlet mischa barton mtv couples ? check out sublimely indie mags like chord , filter , under radar online kludge in-depth looks some worthy bands . spin ? it still trying convince us it cool , but eggers only regularly cool thing it	-1

far writing concerned this top notch rock magazine . format appealing pages not marred one too many ads . plus cd comes each issue ; this might help justify cost . original cd priceless real gems average music listener may not heard . they choose theme run it , creating eclectic mix artists illustrate their theme . take example few months back when it legendary tracks studio one jaimaca where it featured little known artists among reggae afficionados like ernest ranglin , michigan smiley next giants like bob marley , skatalites complete view important record label reggae . i really enjoy monthly features including tributes those passed away month entitled " real gone . " old rock stars going faster than they seventies ! other good features brief reviews music indexed filter reissues , reissues extra , tracks , buried treasure just plain filter albums(current stuff ) . depth articles cover subject very entertaining what actually drew me mojo intially information . there one draw back us subsrcibers , it long way acros pond problems occurr . last year my problems follows : receiving my issues two weeks after stores copies , missing cd . their credit both problems solved spite send three issues so i would finally get my ripped off cd , it stole twice ! subscriber beware . sending it clear plastic words cd inside just invitation thief . otherwise it maybe best rock music magazine out there i defintely recommend brits perspective	1

this light colorful newspaper . i remember when it first came out . idea it would national newspaper cover united states whole . it way gives local news regards all ' sections ' country . reporting itself clear very readable . paper lacks weight depth . it lot variety its features , clearly attempts entertain reader somehow make news more palatable . it not great newspaper but it often features fine reporting . there times when it better job than more prestigious papers .	1
i once asked regius professor hebrew university cambridge how he stays abreast fast-moving developments biblical archaeology , field investigation related but decidely peripheral his own work . ' i mostly read bar ... ' , he said , unexpectedly low-brow response hallowed halls great university . ' then if i want know more topic , i move more scholarly publications . ' it vote confidence magazine (* not * academic journal ! ) i've read years found equally useful maintaining generalist knowledge area investigation - let address elephant room - most us come out religious interests . bar effectively combines well-edited prose leading scholars due general-interest attention color photos complementary resources like slides ( past era ) phenomenally well-produced videos dvds . issue pulled random my shelves ( november/december 2001 ) contains articles entitled : -excavating philistine gath . we found goliath hometown-the monastery cross . where heaven earth mee t-t he rise fall dead sea-is it or isn't it - synagogue ? addition , usual suspects appear issue issue interesting columns add color commentary polemical field where personalities well artefacts theories loom large . you'll want ignore over-heated reader responses one brand disillusionment or . but you'd wrong heed some reviewers ' critiques political headbashing goes among archaeologists . when elephants this kind collide , it usually over ideological argument matters . it us no good deride such battles mere politics . bar good sense play both spectator provocateur role such infighting over complaints readers who wish things more placid around here . they not . things we continue dig up rocky ground israel , jordan , lebanon , egypt other locations continue insure we never fall prey boring consensus regarding history these great lands faiths they engendered . read bar if this sounds remotely interesting decide yourself	1

i'm liberal , i've devoted reader tnr since 1950s . yes it liberal magazine . it excellent investigative work . i not noticed much change its politics past 50 years . some other readers mentioned tnr stand israel . this stand there since martin peretz took over magazine 1974 . peretz never supported right wing israel , but he certainly supported israel right exist . i remember one his early exposes time magazine its very one-sided reporting israel . this respect , tnr very different nation . but tnr support democratic candidates ? usually , but not exclusively . tnr not like dick nixon , course . after peretz took over , tnr supported carter president 1976 . next , i think it backed john anderson . carter foreign policy obviously started annoy tnr . tnr always backed clinton , gore , kerry . it backed kerry even though it little suspicious his attitudes israel . war iraq , tnr initially took colin powell his word weapons mass destruction reluctantly backed war this reason , after which it felt cheated . if you want left wing antizionist magazine , you won't want even read this . you'll want nation . if you want neoconservative magazine , you'll want read this , but magazine you'll really want weekly standard , or maybe commentary . anyway , i always read tnr , i highly recommend it everyone	1

fine cooking takes somewhat consumer reports-like approach cooking , much manner cook illustrated . but there several key differences set fc apart make it superior ci : 1 . fc , not all voices sound alike . ci , every article , no matter who writes it , sounds though it written same person . i understand why they this ( keeping focus food not personality , maintaining consistency ) , but it gives magazine creepy , musty , claustrophic , stepford wives-like quality . this magnified fact there no " outsiders " allowed into ci kitchen -- no visiting experts , no star chefs , just ci staff their identical voices . 2 . fc there no christopher kimball essays : ci bow-tied editor fills up entire page already thin magazine folksy , prairie home companion-like homily why owning large , upscale farm rural new england makes him morally superior everyone else , replete recurring cast curmudgeonly cranks crackpots -- all which absolutely nothing any food issue , or lives anyone else planet , possible exception martha stewart . it embarrassing , self-indulgent soapbox . but he leader cult , so don't expect his sermons dispappear any time soon . 3 . ci advertises itself " ad-free " -- then proceeds glut its pages print ads blow-in cards touting ci cottage industry recycled books . i'd rather peruse offerings fc advertisers , whose products least potentially useful me . 4 . fc no constantly recycled material . such supposedly modest operation , ci puts out staggering number books , many them single-topic tomes borrow heavily recipes already printed magazine , well other , previously published ci books ( there evil twin " america test kitchen " series books dvds ) . you're likely find same pie crust or tomato sauce recipe 16 different books . incestuous nature this recipe factory casts unflattering mercenary shadow across ci mission . 5 . fc offers superior quality production methods . glossy paper attractive , full-color photos fc put ci faux-downhome matte paper hand-drawn illustrations shame . 6 . fc much more variety . fc also its own group regular contributors , but they supplemented each issue experts variety fields culinary arts ( who write their own unique voice -- imagine ! ) , giving magazine broader scope much fresher feel than ci , which tends stick standard set all-american classics , which they recycle every five years ( how many times you revamp " secrets macaroni cheese " ? ) . give fine cooking look . it hands-down best food magazine home cooks	1

i am big fan british publications such economist financial times because they tend offer more balanced global perspective news . articles here short sweet . why i so suprised how thin newspaper when i got my first delivery . this good thing when you busy , but sometimes i found myself wanting more in-depth coverage . this where wall street journal ( wsj ) tends shine . plus , wsj more articles addressing one lifestyle , i.e , personal journal . also , op-ed pieces undeniably left-leaning but bit more balanced whereas wsj tends pretty conservative one-sided . although i really enjoyed newspaper , i cancelled my subscription because horrible delivery service . one final note , prepared salmon pink color newspaper . i know they want stand apart other publications , but it makes newspaper look like it stuck attic 10 years makes it kind hard read low light settings .	1

i found cat fancy magazine mostly advertisements breeders advertisements than real meat information cat owners . i'm also very unimpressed their cat channel online board they advertise cat fancy cannot recommend it others . they seem poor management their online board especially weekends so inappropriate posts stay there long time professional magazine advertising their own online board their magazine should their online board perfected before offering it . also cat fancy pushes ridiculous high renewal rate their magazine , but if you go onto amazon , you get renewal rate almost half cat fancy renewal price . so i come conclusion cat fancy magazine , their poor online cat channel board high renewal rate cat fancy charges , they not interested keeping their readers or online members .	-1

it beyond me why any pre-teen or teen would want read this kind magazine . i reading this magazine couple weeks ago ski trip because my 13-year old friend happens get it her mail . truth , this magazine lacks substance . i don't see why people even care what jojo friend thinks her celebrity , how mk recovering hospital anorexic or what jesse mccartney marital status . leave celebs alone ; let them live their life . i've seen same things printed this magazine over over . this magazine shallow downright materialistic ( i.e. some articles i seen various covers " get him anything you want ! " , " what jesse mccartney nickname ? " " terrified alone ? " ) . i don't like most magazines , but if you want mag real substance , look forth seventeen or cosmogirl ! magazine . preteens -- skip this magazine . editors write level 2nd graders understand . read anything but this -- your local newspaper , even national geographic ( one my favorites ) . this magazine $17 10 issues--don't you think that bit pricey ? if you're parent , please don't buy your daughter this mindless garbage . can't you find anything decent your kids read ?	-1

i subscriber time over 15 years before reader my parents ' subscription . it pains me say this magazine forgotten what it . frankly , only issues worth their salt those resulting major world event such natural disaster or terror attack ; such events seem energize otherwise listless staff seemingly bored editors newswriters . newsweekly obligation go beyond newspapers -- use extra couple days provide more balanced analytical view . unfortunately time fixes its editorial position beginning story -- any future coverage designed prove time initial position correct . immediate taking editorial position then carried into all future coverage event ; stifling analysis preventing any analytical development beyond first few stories --" we told you so , we told you so . " even worse , coverage lengthy story peters out until something sensational happens which point sensational event becomes ultimate interpretation entire story . can't magazine occasionally admit it wrong rather than turning its eye away story continues burn ? out sight , out mind mantra ... fact , i sometimes debate whether decline this magazine mirrors or outpaces general decline our media ; newspapers failing , television news can't seem get away gory or sensationalistic , even academic journals specialized themselves into irrelevance . we seem greater appreciation comedy than analysis . neutrality dead . frankly , i don't care so much any perceived editorial slant i fact magazine increasingly boring irrelevant . time used excellent coverage trends events outside united states -- no more . iran building nuclear weapons but merits occasional blurb world summary page . african states making vast strides towards democracy , we get article nigerian computer fraud . russia emerging turmoil perestroika its painful transition much teach costs value democracy , but we seem focus only latest roadbomb iraq . japan , one world most influential cultures , week i originally wrote this review ( see 12-month subscription ) merited only snippet regarding royal marriage analysis foreign intrusion into sumo wrestling . somewhere wide world fascinating place or culture which time could send correspondent bring place people alive its readership , instead we get tabloid excrement nature joel stein puerile take pornography social deviants . but most damning fact after reading time one asks : how hell our world become boring ? time try emulating economist rather than enquirer ? someone needs step restore proud tradition complete in-depth coverage -- educate reader world which we live ; don't wait until either natural disasters or internal politics shine spotlight any various cultures countries which real interesting events take place every single week . time history potential five-star magazine , if only it would just focus finding reporting news	-1
i flip through time every now again barber shop . sometimes there good bits they using keep interest people who want progressive social change , people who sick power corporate elite violence our militarists . most part , since time receives most its revenues big business advertisements , it can't challenge establishment it needs . so instead i read magazines like , utne , mother jones , progressive , sun , earth island new internationalist	-1

this magazine just page after page hollywood p.r. agencies releases . unbelievable . why didn't i think it ? i know all magazines look editorial content outside sources , but other than few pages very subjective movie/music/book reviews , this magazine just re-writes prints hollywood press release after hollywood press release again again again . this magazine must not staff writers , but must employ army copy editors manning warehouse dedicated fax machines or e-mail inboxes . funniest thing this magazine how first few pages may dedicated typically obsequious press release provided , say , tom cruise management company/major film studio/hired pr flak fawning over cruise or his newest movie - then you turn movie review section where some clever , sassy , wanna-be hipster movie reviewer proceeds tell you movie absolutely sucks . uh , okay - wait , didn't you get press release ? if you tivo extra theme entertainment tonight your ringtone , this magazine right up your alley . otherwise , don't waste penny this nonsense .	-1

" ) while i'm using magazine means teaching media literacy , we certainly not resubscribing . content , it seem informative , especially beginning rider , though writing not particularly compelling . articles hard find amidst all marketing , making it visually confusing . while my daughter picked up her first issue " ask , " sat down not get up until she'd read it cover cover , she picked up " young rider , " glanced through it , tossed it back down not yet returned her first issue . this child who horse crazy -- not much testimonial horse magazine	-1

i'm one those people who always looks up product reviews before buying anything , so it leap faith i bought natural health magazine without reading anything it . friend suggested it , since this particular friend never led me wrong before , i caved bought july/august 2005 copy immediately . let me start off saying i'm extremely picky person . i extremely high standards every purchase i make , i absolutely not cut manufacturer any slack if i find fault . now i've gotten out way , i mention i thoroughly impressed natural health . long ago , i subscribed new age magazine ( now known body soul , which i not care ) . it among my favorites solely due its wide variety content true-to-focus natural lifestyle tips advice . i cannot stand redundancy , incorrect information excessive advertising . i found natural health much more long lines former new age magazine , filled dozens little gems make it worth much more than $3.95 i paid . give you idea what magazine includes , here small sampling articles i found july/august issue : small articles include : - " bee or not bee " , breakdown aromatherapy ingredients include bee pollen , royal jelly , propolis , honey , stating just how effective natural these ingredients . - " how i get relief pms ? " experts ( including naturopath , gynecologist dietitian ) answer this question excellent responses . - " medicine cabinet : attack weekend warrior " natural remedies aids those like myself who love weekend warriors . - " clothes pose " great yoga gear ! - " medical breakthroughs " - " healing supplements : 8 ways beat anxiety " - " fitness fix - knee savers " longer articles include : - " healthy appetites : savvy strategies eating well " delicious , healthy recipes tips . - " good medicine : clean , healthy mouth " well-researched article " mercury fillings , fluoride toothpaste best at-home remedies " . - " five paths peace " five simple meditation techniques . - " eat beat heat : yin foods " more great recipes ! - " sacred spaces " - making your home your personal retrea t.t his only sampling ; fact , that less than half magazine alone . some articles fairly short , but provide just right amount information get point across . my personal favorite last page , " make one change " , where this month change " upgrade your z " . it included simple tips i able implement immediately . amount advertising seemed slightly less than usual ( probably same amount you'd find yoga journal , but not nearly many oprah magazine ) , they seemed line natural health focus . judging past reviews natural health , it seems magazine bad run 2003-2004 timeframe . let remember magazines change editors frequently . i found none past complaints true this issue , but may not so future issues years now . me , i want subscription asap	1

" other popularized pseudo-science , i am incredibly thankful scientific american still true scientific method .	1

fine cooking takes somewhat consumer reports-like approach cooking , much manner cook illustrated . but there several key differences set fc apart make it superior ci : 1 . fc , not all voices sound alike . ci , every article , no matter who writes it , sounds though it written same person . i understand why they this ( keeping focus food not personality , maintaining consistency ) , but it gives magazine creepy , musty , claustrophic , stepford wives-like quality . this magnified fact there no " outsiders " allowed into ci kitchen -- no visiting experts , no star chefs , just ci staff their identical voices . 2 . fc there no christopher kimball essays : ci bow-tied editor fills up entire page already thin magazine folksy , prairie home companion-like homily why owning large , upscale farm rural new england makes him morally superior everyone else , replete recurring cast curmudgeonly cranks crackpots -- all which absolutely nothing any food issue , or lives anyone else planet , possible exception martha stewart . it embarrassing , self-indulgent soapbox . but he leader cult , so don't expect his sermons dispappear any time soon . 3 . ci advertises itself " ad-free " -- then proceeds glut its pages print ads blow-in cards touting ci cottage industry recycled books . i'd rather peruse offerings fc advertisers , whose products least potentially useful me . 4 . fc no constantly recycled material . such supposedly modest operation , ci puts out staggering number books , many them single-topic tomes borrow heavily recipes already printed magazine , well other , previously published ci books ( there evil twin " america test kitchen " series books dvds ) . you're likely find same pie crust or tomato sauce recipe 16 different books . incestuous nature this recipe factory casts unflattering mercenary shadow across ci mission . 5 . fc offers superior quality production methods . glossy paper attractive , full-color photos fc put ci faux-downhome matte paper hand-drawn illustrations shame . 6 . fc much more variety . fc also its own group regular contributors , but they supplemented each issue experts variety fields culinary arts ( who write their own unique voice -- imagine ! ) , giving magazine broader scope much fresher feel than ci , which tends stick standard set all-american classics , which they recycle every five years ( how many times you revamp " secrets macaroni cheese " ? ) . give fine cooking look . it hands-down best food magazine home cooks	1
