i bought sr-60 after lenghty review internet . my goal find best available headphones low budget ( around $80 ) . i very satisfied sr-60 . sound great , confort incredible . since sound not contained they may somewhat annoying surrounding non-listeners . so if you looking first quality sound , low budget headphones don't care much looks , these ones go .	1

you want cheap fender guitar you buy their lower notch brand squire . you want their lower notch picks , well unfortunately they dont exis t.t hats where these come into play . they cheap somewhat durable . celluloid picks tendencey snap right across middle though . they wield great sound if used right like any other guitar pick great potential . looks nice but i like signature real fender pick . after all these fender pick shape size . i say buy these price steal . i say avoid these if you plan play metal . ( very nice feeling pick	1
i 3 danelectro fab effects pedals . sound i get this overdrive pedal much more than i thought i'd get my starter collection . couple , more expensive effects i purchased , made brand , don't seem any better than danelectro fab . casing heavy duty plastic , not metal so i'm not sure how well it would hold up stage use or someone heavy foot . comment this pedal waste time reviewer , most guitarists already know they need purchase ac adaptor power source . consider it learning experience . once you buy adapter sure pick up multi-plug cable if you want more than one effects pedal . this allows you hook up several more plugs one ac adaptor . i now 5 effects pedals hooked up one energy source . bought mine guitar center so i don't know if amazon carries them . radio waves everywhere travel great distances depending tower they come . i used get woman talking truckers over her cb radio through my stereo . talk friend who electrical engineer or someone electronics store suggestions cut down or eliminate radio interference	1
this cable works fine . no degredation sound . this expensive cable but quality good matches grado ear phone	1
when i ordered plusdeck2 i wasn't sure how well it going work . well i must say it works great easier install then i expected . i think hardest part installation finding desktop pc free 5 1/2 inch open bay . i like most people now only use laptop , but i old hp desktop running windows 98 . plusdeck2 easy install i no problems it running under windows 98 . i no problems conversion mp3 it even special feature audio books . this good product works advertised .	1
this wonderful little headphone amp ! finally , i practice/play any time i choose , i don't worry bothering anyone else . unit distortion effect echo effect . i love quality echo effect so much , i actually used it stage few times place my ( much more expensive ) rocktron short timer digital delay . others mentioned , i replaced headset quality ( but not expensive ) sony set . but , this price , it hard believe they include headphone set any kind ! don't listen those who criticize its potential " live " or " one-stage " use . it not meant ! if you use this practice or entertain yourself , without interfering other people room , you going thrilled . i also lay down chord tracks , inexpensive cassette recorder , practice playing lead . if anything happens this little amp , i quickly replace it . i encouraged all my electric guitar students purchase one , i'll giving them gifts friends who play . less than $20.00 , danelectro e-studio 15 , tremendous bargain . features , flexibility , functional design , quality product just outstanding . you just can't go wrong	1
introduction owner manual states it perfectly . rode said when looking good camcorder microphone , they either horrible pieces junk or super expensive professional models so they decided design mic this purpose . this model strikes perfect balance . quality this mic excellent . it very sensitive good directional properties so it rejects noise side quite well . although not meant picking up sound long distances it quite well 20 feet away maybe more . mount attached mic so this only way you use it it made mount standard " shoe " nearly all camcorders . it mono microphone but it stereo miniphone jack plugs camcorder mic jack feeds audio into both channels . after trying several inferior microphones i delighted stumble upon this mic . it good value excellent microphone camcorders	1

i using shure sm58 microphone over two decades live performance . it simply best affordable microphone available lead or backing vocals . it so durable , you could literally use it hammer then perform sweet ballad no ill effect . i never one break down hundreds shows . my current primary sm58 couple dents rough use rough venues but sounds just like it brand new . only reason i've ever replaced one because they stolen . if you're just starting your professional career , this microphone you need . if you're seasoned veteran music biz , you've probably already got one your gig bag . get shure sm58 , don't use some crappy thing costs half much , you won't get enough level into board . your sound guy thank you , they know just exactly what expect . any other comparable quality microphone cost you least twice much	1

well , i started kay $1.99 special they play good too but once i saw how fun harmonica is- i stumbled onto little better harmonica , old , old hohner american ace it played so easy , i get top line hohner got this special 20 key " . " it take little while break special 20 before it played easy sweet it step brother- american ace . it more contained , refined sound than other two i mentioned bends well . i still find my american ace bends easier but it probably 10 years old reeds weaker than my brand new special 20 . i am still curious lee oskars but history hohner , average $7.00 cheaper than lee oskars , fact it made germany , i opted special 20 . awesome harmonica awesome price . they also short waranty unlike other brands .	1
