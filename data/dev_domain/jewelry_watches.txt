though evenly matched , color amethysts much lighter than product image . both stones feathered areas visible blemishes though these aren't apparent if you wearing them . quality you'd expect mervyn or sears sale . not terrible , but not great	-1
this ring not look pictured . it arrived today ( almost 3 weeks after i ordered it ) extremely thin , tarnish marks , metal filigree crown shows up only random places . it looks like it came out vending machine i'm obviously pretty disappointed . i won't buying anything this vendor again	-1
these diamonds shouldn't offered this size jewelry . imperfections them seriously hinder sparkling characteristics diamond known . great price - but you get what you pay	-1
i recieved it promptly , but it didn't work . i took it walmart get battery they recommended going jeweler . i , buying battery twenty dollars still cannot get time set right . i've read manual over over . my sons same . it looks nice but doesn't work its very aggravating . i wouldn't recommend it	-1

it tarnished first day broke third day . it trash where it belong	-1
packaging bracelet came quite upscale , nice black leather case , much nicer than bracelet deserved , however . bracelet itself light weight heart attached ridiculously cheap . it not rounded pictured , but flat like dog tag ( only much smaller ) . i'm using mine base charm bracelet but i would never wear it itself . i understand though it not expensive bracelet weight probably right . 925 silver price	-1
price its not bad , but watch you get what you pay . band felt fake , watch itself too think my taste . i ended up returning watc	-1
heart pendant not look pretty picture , there this gold topaz covering both sides totally ruins look normal swarovski crystal , other words , no colors shine all . same thing other sites like $1 . speedy delivery only positive	-1
i think picture better than real thing . gems actually pretty decent . they good size hint color . however , setting so deep so bulky when earrings , you can't see sparkle stones . if setting daintier stones more color , these would look great . but they , earrings look like blobs , not tanzanite .	-1
i got this watch one week ago . its very good looking watch . its $85 but looks like $150+ watch . all my friends asking this watch it catches others eye very easily . it upper dial ( number 05-15-25 etc . ) rotates clock wise ; this functionality keep time accurate while fast driving . its bit heavy , but now i am used it . i would recomend this watch everyone who like heavy looking watches their wrist	1

nice watch keeps super accurate time . however , it very basic showing only time date . it would nice if it backlighting , but hands glow dark some period time . it little tricky pick up time signal so i would recommend finding place your home where signal strong leave it there every night .	1
sometimes , you realize you need watch but don't want spend fortune , something that'll last long , solid , yet fashionable easy use . this watch it all , many times girls stopped me see this watch , it sophisticated , stylish , only $85 no matter where you go . metal stays shiny , glass , virtually scratch proof . days week , military time , day month ( problem this it not know , if month 30 days or 31 , so u set it yourself sometimes , but rarely , worth effort ) i highly reccomend this watch everyone	1

this watch lightweight elegant appearance . but clasp loosened repeatedly ordinary wear . i returned item credit	-1
strap/links these g-shocks quite oversized : when i first got it , i could fit watch around my legs ! ( you'll most likely get links adjusted ) . ironically , four side buttons watch small . so even if you huge wrist , you'll probably trouble pressing buttons ! ( not huge fingers ) *** beware *** picture shows four side buttons watch silver , but left right side buttons this model actually plain black ! it quite misleading ! silver side button actually mtg920dj model ( which 2005 version ) . according casio , mtg920da actually released 2004 black side buttons . if you search casio website , it only display mtg920dj ( their most recent version ); most websites still sell mtg920da just taking latest mtg920dj version picture casio website . mtg920dj seems same features this one ( mtg920da ) , except four side ( left right ) buttons silver . those you wondering three circles watch : first one very left basically wannabe-analog display - basically , every five minutes , bar increases ( or decreases when it gets full ); it just mostly there cosmetic reasons . second one middle battery status ; it ( low ) , ( medium ) , ( high ) bar would display one those areas . if you get out sun lot or know area your home where sun shines lot , then you won't problem battery ever going below high . moreover , it power saving feature ; watch go into sleep mode ( display off ) when it completely dark area long time . finally , third circle very right where it tells you what options enabled/disabled . it shows spl ( split time stopwatch ) , dst ( daylight saving time ) , sig ( hourly signal ) , alm ( alarm ) , snz ( snooze ) , auto el ( automatic electro-luminescent backlight - backlight turns tilting it certain degree towards your face without manually press backlight button . ) keep mind , synchronizing atomic signal not instant : it usually takes around 3 minutes ( least me , i live california . ) if you're busy area or near electronic , it might difficult ; try again or move different area . moreover , it should show you strength/level ( 4 levels ) signal ( while you're synchronizing ) satellite icon watch . there also feature automatically synchornizes you while you're sleeping 2:00 am , 3:00 am , 4:00 am , 5:00 am . therefore , it not always necessary syncronize it yourself because time you wake up , it should ready go . overall , this watch attractive fun wear . atomic radio signal feature very cool ; official time great - right precise second ! i've this watch months now , i enjoy wearing it daily . this watch lot feature - except , it pity it *** not *** countdown timer ! pros : - cool design - water/scratch resistant ; g-shock known their toughest watches . ( update : i've worn this watch daily almost year half now not single scratch - still looks brand new ! )- solar power ; battery life excellent ; never power ever go below high . power saving feature . - position time date easy read one glance . - metal strap - display world time local time cons : - side buttons small tight press ( must use like very tip fingers ) - atomic signal takes too long manually , it usually not possible synchronize while wearing watch ; if you're inside home , it usually best take off watch leave it near window . - alarm beep little longer perhaps ( even my inexpensive timex watch would beep it would gradually beep faster , which i actually like bit better . ) - no countdown timer . ( how could they forget this ?! ) also , try research other models instead finding out hard way ( like i side buttons ) before purchasing .	-1

i got watch off amazon birthday gift i must say i'm impressed . it looked good picture here , it looks even better person ! i read arm hair pulling problem i don't any problems but that probably because i'm only 15 i'm asian so my arm hair isn't exactly long so i no answer . my arm only 2.5 or so inches wide so i'm skinny needless say , watch still fits me fine after removing some links . time accurate what i tell , but i little trouble setting date , wouldn't turn past thursday first though i got it fowarding time next day . i don't know if it problem or not since i haven't read guide yet . thing i'm impressed fact this watch solid titanium . even middle links . many cheaper watches hollow inside links , but not this one , it solid titanium all way through . others said , markers really very bright dark , i tested it completely dark room i able tell time no trouble all . i would recommend this watch anyone looking stylish watch that not too pricy . it great everyday wear so don't hesitate if you think it too formal . if i , 15 year old thinks it not too formal , it probably isn't :) . hope this helps some your decisions	1

this really great watch . i am firefighter i need watches stand toughest environments ..... i always wear g-shock . already owned g-shock before buying this watch , i know this thing last me lifetime . great thing this particular watch not only it durability genuine g-shock , it also great looks . i wear this watch nice outfit people think i'm wearing really expensive watch . little they know i only spent less than $100 it . some other cool features this watch auto time setting via atomic clock especially solar power . all my life i dealt watches need battery replacement , after wearing watch long time screws back cover become permanently attached case , battery replacement becomes pain *$% ! this watch other hand you never need worry batteries ..... simply put it window sill when it says it needs charging . lastly , i love light-up feature . no need fumble any buttons watch light up read time dark . watch smart enough sense ambient light its solar cells know if light-up feature needs activated . so if you out sun look your watch , light doesn't come . also , great feature light also it never drains battery . if you happen drain battery ( which would like never happen unless you've living dark like year ) , simply place watch under desk lamp or window during day . darn thing charges itself if you walk around without front watch covered . i love this watch grown ever so confident casio it life g-shock watches . you never go wrong this watch	1
my boyfriend just got me this necklace i love it ! very beautiful piece jewelry . i've gotten lot comments it just few days ! :) very happy .	1
i surprised how well it worked ended up buying second one . it costs only fraction price others same thing . while it cheap plastic case , it doesn't look bad virtually noiseless . if you very heavy watch i would recommend single winder version since watch angle flatter ( heavy watches cause verical two-watch winder bang around little ) . my winder running non-stop past couple months no problems . this device good value what you pay	1
nice product . works very well . bit large ... smaller version would easier leave out countertop	-1
good quality jewlery . timely manner shippping . good company buy	1
instruction manual not very accurate . watch seems work advertised . one reviewer here mentioned they couldn't pull pin out adjust time , per instructions manual . i same problem , but what they forgot mention you turn pin counter clock-wise , then pin pop out little , then one pull pin out adjust time . when you , you reverse . so far , i am happy my purchase . smart looking watch	-1

this my second skagen . it much thinner than my older watch . 7-year old watch still works perfectly , but i wanted new treat . i think this watch great in-between formal informal . goldtone really sparkles crystals face add touch elegance . one features i like most skagen mesh bands they adjustable . amazon price great ! i highly recommend this watch .	1
great watch everyday wear . not fancy , but works very well easy read . this watch bargain	1
this box great budding watch collector , but aware larger men watches like seiko monsters tuna cans , or anything 40mm+ don't fit well this box . they accommodated storing them loose compartment without pillow , but tends defeat appeal storage system this type . more average-sized men women timepieces , it excellent choice , quality much better than expected this price point	-1
excellent service , fast delivery , worth every buck you spent !!! i able buy this seiko very very low price ! its sleek fashionable , perfect gift my wife valentines day ! you wont regret buying this watch ! =	1
this really good-looking watch . unlike other bracelet watches i , this one not snag hair my arm . face slightly smaller than most standard mens watches , which makes good fit me because i'm thin . matte color dark gray face give very tasteful look works just any occasion , either dressy or casual . i liked this watch so much when i lost original one i replaced it exact model . ( i bought original 3 years ago department store $240 . )	1
nice watch , advertised , only issue band clasp isn't real secure releases easily	-1

i got this well under assumption it wasnt high end watch . after wearing invicta while this feels like gum wrapper my wrist . when i received it , i noticed small scratches all over crystal . nothing deep , but they really pick up glare . atomic signal , i am unable get it pick up one . memphis , tn , i think i should range , all my atomic clocks sync up fine . i tried it facing 4 different directions also tried it outside eliminate any interference house . still no good . basically i spent 30 dollars cheap watch doesnt even backlight . lesson learned	1
heart bracelet came off after second day wear . i not recommend product , but delivery service well	-1

i just ordered received this automatic watch winder ( garinin model win2gr , two watches ) used it week ( i am using it wind invicta automatic breitling automatic ) . unit pretty well all plastic , " cheap " - yet " solid " - look feel . still , it work advertised , this , not appearance , primary reason i bought it . so , price , i give it one thumb up . few minor points note , however . first , i large wrists , so removable expanding watch restrainers not expand enough restrain watches securely their slots . this remedied placing two 1 " self-adhering felt pads ( available local hardware store ) top surface each restrainer . but this then created secondary , though less serious , problem : front door winder now not close all way ( comes within � " fully closing ) . not problem unless you live exceptionally dusty environment . second , some reviewers noted noise problem this unit . however , i found mine runs very quietly . i keep it next bed , bottom my nightstand , quiet night i just barely hear low purring sound motor inside unit . even then , you really focus your attention order hear it , , my view , only picky critic would find this soft noise least bit disturbing . finally , there switch selecting direction which watches rotate : either clockwise or counterclockwise ( they linked , so both rotate same direction all times ) . what not made clear why winding direction important . if my watches supposed wound only one these directions , how am i know which one it ? furthermore , how i control winding direction when i am actually wearing watches ? finally , what if invicta needs wound clockwise but breitling should wound counterclockwise ? i arbitrarily selected one directions moved ... both watches still work just fine . closing , note there some humorous statements one-page instruction manual . unit identified " time tutelary " ( which name also appears logo front unit pictured manual ) . what " time tutelary , " anyway ? instructions state , " please pull off adapter when winder not using , " , " this product provides maintenance or replacement service within one year purchasing date . " i know what meant here , but still , this case either poor english or poor translating ( or both ! ) . further warranty statement itself , note there outlined box bottom manual which stated , " invalid without representative official stamp . " problem , there no stamp box ( or anywhere else matter ) , so only reasonable conclusion there no warranty this product . i also ordered second winder , garinin single-watch winder , model win1brg , present my son . i mention this note operation manual accompanying this unit states , " using timer recommended this product . this ensure your watch wound properly extend life your winder your automatic watch . average automatic watch should wound four hours day . " ( note no such statement accompanies two-watch win2gr winder . ) first , this 4 hours-maximum-per-day claim true ? second , if winder automatically rotates one hour then rests next three hours , it winds your watch total 6 hours per day , so extra two hours winding really all detrimental watch ? , if eliminating those two extra hours winding each day ( using timer ) actually " extend life your winder , " it doesn't seem say much quality designed-in reliability product ( not mention adding expense hassle ownership ) . bottom line : if you want quiet two-watch winder works advertised , but don't want spend lot money ( don't mind plastic look ) , this winder should trick .	1

i bit hesitant buying this watch replacement my stainless fossil i've many years , but after wearing it awhile now i'm really happy purchase . i'd read watch difficult read all but perfect conditions , but i found this completely false . i've no problems whatsoever reading dial all sorts different lighting conditions . other problem i've read other reviewers concerned band , namely difficulty adjusting band band comes undone easily . while it not easiest thing , i didn't find it overly difficult adjust band . within five minutes quick look skagen website , where directions readily available , i band just right length . i also haven't any problems band coming undone it feels very secure .	1
