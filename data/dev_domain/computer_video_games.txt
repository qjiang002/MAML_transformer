no way change inputs your tv . dvd functions tv functions accessed alternatly pressing " tv " button but there no way tell which romote aligned . therefore when you press power button you no idea which you powering on/off , tv or xbox . if things couldn't get any dumber , if you press eject button while remote tv mode it doesn't work . eject button only designed work xbox yet it disabled when tv mode ? there also no option program receiver . many others mentioned , this remote looks nice but people who designed it must drunk . not buy this remote unless you like wasting your money garbage	-1
opening cutscene introduces you blinx cat , supporting cast particulars his upcoming adventures , i found myself trying wrap my brain around basic premise story . idea secret , off-world clan humanoid cat creatures , armed souped up vacuum cleaners , responsible development dispersal time itself every known plane existence map . it seems time , when compressed tightly enough transported said cats , takes form one five different brightly-colored shapes . if these crystals left out open too long without properly introduced flow things , they turn into monsters . i could go , because game certainly doesn't stop there , but i think you get point . i like think there fairly thick line drawn cartoony fantasy super-detailed realism . generally , lot physics environmental details taken granted realistic game , because they're almost exclusively set photorealistic , lifelike location . cartoons , other hand , generally don't worry themselves particulars primarily concerned delivering good time . how much fun would wile . coyote cartoons if every time lead character suffered grisly fate , it strictly obeyed laws gravity aerodynamics ? blinx tries straddle thick line delivering story that overly detail-centric environment that right out kid show . result tale comes off way , way out left field almost completely abstract . it focuses things would better left viewer imagination ignores importance good underlying story way . beneath needless discussions why there monsters world , how time compression works how cats actually responsible all we hold dear , actual plot almost laughably straightforward generic . there princess , evil pigs kidnapped her , it up you you only rescue her save her world . that it , no side-stories , no reasoning , no subplots - just straightforward rush point point . here i thought phrase " save princess " universally recognized ages-old cliche . now , i don't want it sound like i'm railing this game just because it got few more nitpicky details than its peers it reuses old phrase way back platformer handbook its sole driving factor . it also completely lacking character development , general storytelling ongoing inspiration . none characters blinx really establish themselves individuals , including lead character himself . you don't hate pig spaceship because he trying destroy world , you hate him because every time he shows up he tries steal your money . i honestly forgot there princess end game after level three , because she never mentioned game start its finish . i mean , very first super mario brothers least reminded you princess castle end every boss fight . i don't honestly think game really designed enjoyable so much it geared overly challenging . first level half set up standard " get know you " format , simplest enemies , most routine stage layouts plenty opportunities mess around your tools . shortly thereafter , you're thrown wolves . most part , level designs very short , more emphasis cheap hits than complexity true challenge . i noticed lot overlap stage layouts , whether it retracing your steps time time again or walking catwalk ( har har ) above beginning stage invariably plummeting back start point . you'll almost always know what needs , but actually accomplishing act real trick . i just can't overemphasize how unbearably cheap most this game really . if there bottomless pit nearby , ( chances very good there ) blinx find way force himself into it , regardless what you're hitting control pad . if there enemy two feet front you you hit attack button , he'll aim random switch other side room , rather than imminent threat . that not say entirety time sweeper totally without merit , because it bring few fresh ideas table , but most part those insights hampered their surroundings . ability control time , instance , time really fresh , interesting new play mechanic still stands out today , despite limited field imitators since emerged . you rewind few seconds catch enemy unaware or rebuild crumbling bridge , pause action take advantage frozen time , knock level into slow motion , etc . all while , blinx moving around real time . it great idea , but implementation painfully short underutilized . why can't i use two controls same time ? why don't more aspects stage encourage player experiment solve problems these powers ? why doesn't ridiculous ten minute stage time limit pause , speed up or rewind when i use my time powers ? why their duration so brief , why can't i hold more than dozen uses time ? i mean , this could've really fantastic experience if time control aspect beefed up little further treated more than just auxiliary function otherwise run-of-the-mill platformer . controls , too , undeveloped , undertested nightmare . blinx himself often sluggish respond , especially when implementing his time controls . he difficulty making precise turn , whether midair or solid ground . he stops briefly celebrate when gaining item , which leaves him open constant enemy attacks . he routinely moves direction certain death , though pulled magnetic field , whether you've instructed him so or not . he'll occasionally refuse perform double jump , particularly when attempting difficult , precise leap across gaping chasm . i think it these controls most make blinx so mind-squashingly aggravating . glance , you'd imagine they'd fairly difficult screw up . you've got jump button , suction / fire button , time control button analog stick control movement . plus , there already long , established line three-dimensional platformers market years before title release , paving way ideal control experience . super mario 64 its issues , sure , but nothing like this , it trailblazer entire genre jump world 3d . it like they map leading them right treasure decided forge their own path anyway . i can't even say i'm impressed graphics showcased throughout time sweeper , either . exception lead character himsef , these some incredibly cheesy , preschoolish character designs - they feel unfinished hurried , less purposeful than you'd imagine ( especially contrast blinx himself ) . particularly insulting large population simple blobs roam around levels , trying vain bump into you cause fatal injury . here finely detailed main character , such close attention paid his wardrobe even gloss his shoes obviously debated time time again , he pitted against set monsters could've sprung life directly out pages four-year-old sketchbook . despite featuring spoken dialog track , there no english voice acting . i couldn't pinpoint language , but my wife seems think it either french or some close variation it . it certainly didn't sound japanese . while this add touch personality title , it not every day you get chance hear cat shouting something language love , it all seemed really odd out place coming out my television . everyone vocal personalities so black-and-white , too , i feel like great chance establish some much-needed individuality amongst cast lost once again here . bad guys all same deep , gravelly , transparently evil tone , while good guys all bright , cheery , squeaky high-pitched like monkeys super monkey ball . it like parody games come before , but i won't give developers enough credit assume they doing it purpose . overall , blinx really just few promising concepts thrown together one package , strapped shell far-below-average third person platformer unleashed upon unsuspecting public . time its release , it still need lot polishing , some serious scrutiny behind closed doors re-evaluation just how far some these concepts half-hearted character designs could conceivably stretched without losing any quality . top , i really don't know which audience they targeting it . game ridiculously difficult , which betrays childlike demeanor surrounds it leads me believe it meant serious gamers out there , but so bright , kid-friendly annoyingly cutesy i can't imagine anyone demographic rushing out stores release day . number spontaneous controller hurls shot through roof during my time blinx , reaching near-marvel vs . capcom 2 levels its unashamed , excruciatingly cheap hits , especially later levels . i no idea how i acquired willpower finish level eigh t.t he game adequately lengthy , offers some replay value , hidden cat medals each stage eventually unlocking production sketches , promotional materials like . once you start hunting floating cat heads those super-tough later levels , though , you'll remember why you so happy finished them first place . unless you feel like pulling your hair out clumps ( i shaved my head after experience part cleansing process ) enjoy self-mutilation , i'd recommend you stay far away	-1
i used my remote all 8 times before it stopped working . even proprietary dongle inserted into controller slot you cannot control this thing controller , you must use remote control . when you take dongle out dvd , screen come up telling reinsert , so if either dongle or remote get slightly injured or malfunction , then you've just wasted thirty bucks . i feel quite ripped off . low cost dvds nowadays , it much better idea buy standalone imho , you get good progressive scan $30 or $40 , which comes out same price . side , it also extremely annoying you can't turn , or off device remote , you must go up box it yourself , especially annoying if you just want watch dvd your bed crash afterwards . all all value proposition offered this product very low considering similarly priced alternatives	-1

this game , simply put , not good . i got bored tears playing it , then ended up giving it away because it robbing useful space my desk . it slow-paced , predictable , not suspenseful all . fact , these characteristics probably why it so mainstream , even though it laughable comparison real first-person shooters , which way don't even belong consoles . owning this game means you average player . any true fps gamer knows what childish , pathetic garbage this , while rest just go hype . many successfully deceived themselves into thinking it worth anything all . it isn't	-1

i start off saying if you own 06 version , then dont bother updating , you may not notice many updates/upgrades . this awesome game ? yes , but it few holes even still ; 1 ) too much sacking your qb cpu . 2)the cpu run ball so darn often , it joke . 3)the game might strain your ps2 it loads so often , 4)if you want play all-madden level , you forced play qb vision , which we all know stinks ! basically , they tossed few more options so you play blocker or etc offense you more advanced defensive controls such match-ups , assignments , etc . also , franchise mode still really great superstar mode quite enjoyable well . what this game really good ? well , it safe say graphics quite good commentary solid once again . crispness passing great running game big part this years focus . it still really fun running qb strong arm , it easy way dominate game ! btw , new kicking scheme actually really easy after test it out time or two , now i am making 90% fg easily ! you fully tinker ai change all other settings well . rosters also accurate but personally , if you own madden 06 , wait 4-6 more weeks then buy this one $19 ps2 best game	1
fable easily one greatest games ever released . story boy who grows up become hero still wants revenge tragedy his past , it compelling very entertaining . gameplay excellent , it not your typical rpg since this plays like action/adventure game . i love how you choose good or bad choices you make reflect what your character looks like . game also plays like real life . you get married , divorced , sex buy houses , even decorate them ! game so real you choose straight , gay or bi-sexual depending who you sleep . only thing missing you can't children , but should change future installments . cool thing game more evil you get , more people afraid you . but , more hero savior you become , you greeted praise clapping every town you go . overall , this game must !!! replay value extremely high . i played beat game many times i'm still not tired it ! if you love rpgs or hate rpgs this still fantastic . i can't wait until fable 2 released , which currently completed . get this , it simply amazing !	1

i just finished hl2 xbox thought some my observations might helpful other prospective buyers . my review primarily concerned my struggle getting hl2 pc or xbox . i bought hl , hl opposing force hl blue shift pc when they came out thoroughly enjoyed them . due hl2 xbox price horror stories i'd read online use pc version hl2 , i decided go xbox version . i make right choice ? hl2 very good game $20 xbox version , represents excellent value money . great graphics , great sound engaging game play . however , i think hl1 pc better game than hl2 xbox . why ? first , original hl much more open ended there often more than one way something or get somewhere . hl2 , i found there only one way . second , controls hl1 better configurable . hl2 xbox , i found some controls really awkward difficult use . example , there air boat drive direction throttle same thumb stick . i assume throttle direction separate keys pc version ? third , when there lot going , example , several combine soldiers firing you , explosions fair bit scenery display , xbox slowed down almost halt ! it just couldn't cope amount processing . i never problem hl1 pc assume suitably equipped pc could cope hl2 just well . lastly , others mentioned you didn't go very far hl2 before you saw `loading ' screen . frequency which you saw this become distracting annoying after while . one plus hl2 there no weird psychedelic alternative dimension like there hl1 . remember all hopping floating platform floating platform plants light up when you went near them ? all nonsense gone away which relief ! reflection , most my gripes hl2 more xbox version rather than game itself . if i choose again , i'd buy hl2 pc certainly get any hl2 spin off games pc if they appear like they hl1 . if not , i'll wait hl3 which ending hl2 leaves open .	1

i always hear these things , mainly point it unrealistic , noone uses teamwork , people too preoccupied their stats , etc , etc . may true many public servers , though there quite few aren't filled morons , actually people who play teamlike fashion , complete their objective over killing off enemy time given . i am one those people who actually go objective . actually , i am admin server , if terrorist last , camping out round , then i slay him warn him stay task . onto point- many people claim this so unrealistic , it may true points like m249 slow shooter , very cumbersome , too good aim standing up , fact you die 2 shots toe awp- those all unrealistic points , but if you think it , how much fun would it unload 5 clips half killt he enemy ? * cough halo cough * yes , i just insulted halo , because enemies too damn strong , it drives me crazy , multiplayer so annoying you shoot enemy 3 shots sniper kill ... my final point there people who aren't just preoccupied their stats , there servers dedicated fun- yes , fun , counterstrike . they whole slew crazy maps , ways make it even more insane , things such . if you interested try custom map servers . all-in-all this game peak perfection- not even mentioning huge amounts customization involved this game , weapons player models	1

xenosaga : episode 3 ( also sprach zarathustra ) brings back magic episode 1 fixes vast majority problems occurred episode 2 . story here , rich complex ever , brought appropriate moving close shion company battle uncover deep-seated conspiracy unlike anything else they've ever encountered . fabric story itself , voice acting , cutscenes all truly superb - it remarkable makers namco/bandai managed pull all loose ends together make story finally make sense . boot , it pleasure watch listen -- who could ask more ? battle system , it finally regains its fun episode 3 . i simply wasn't fan episode 2 system , so return " basics " blessing my mind . characters still battle their unique ways , each his/her own customizable skills obtain , but long gone days ridiculously long battles against painfully weak enemies . here , both ground e.s. ( mech ) battles , your ability strengthen customize your party shines through you always rewarded your hard work . replay value moderate-to-high well , since your party consists all familiar players most game ; if you habit using same three or four people ( like me ; yay chaos ! ) , you always play through again different group . shops return this episode , making buying selling your merchandise once again possible . only thing lacking this game little more " extras/side quests " department , which this game only offers handful . while some these take longer than others , few more side quests would nice , particularly since this last series . i can't rave enough how impressed i this title . it rivals episode 1 every way possible , trilogy epic story outstrips other rpg competition without question . if you're looking fun battles , fantastic story , beautiful graphics , then look no further ; xenosaga : episode 3 you . i only hope someone changes their mind decides make one -- after this exceptional closing episode , it hard not wish game come future . very highly recommended . summary : story : a+cutscenes : agraphics/rendering : abattle/skill system : aextras/side quests : a-replay value : moderate-to-hig	1

i love this game i it snes it one my favorite	1
simply put , xenogears + xenosaga 1 absolute best storyline , best role playing experience ps2 date . i strongly believe xenosaga 2 best storyline any rpg i ever , ever played , including final fantasy 7 , xenogears , hundreds others . because rpgs strongly reliant storyline gameplay , i consider this pinnacle role playing ps2 . final fantasy comes close , star ocean , but terms storyline , this game beats them . however , i mark down few other minor flaws . this game highly niche game , only those who enjoy style , sci fi setting . it also very short ..... 20 hours if you play straight through ( no leveling up ) . maybe 38-42 hours if you take up side-quests want strong character . gameplay : first xenosaga highly relied cut scenes narrative . fact , i absolutely could not stand battle system . xenosaga episode 2 still relies heavily upon storytelling through hours cut scenes , but it fixes battle system . battle system , simply put , one most fun turn-based systems i ever experienced . while xenosaga episode 1 battle system seemed slow unwieldy , episode 2 fast paced , action packed , highly challenging battle system . you 3 characters screen just all times , these characters switched off manner much like ffx , but it costs turn this game , causing it more tactical . each turn you many options ; you attack ( more various attacks later ) , stock ( save turn next turn order get combo ) , use ether ( read : magic ) , or change your battle party . if you choose attack , there whole slew options here well . most importantly learning weak points enemy . every enemy , including bosses , certain attack combination most effective against them . when you attack , you press either square , which zone attack , triangle , which zone attack , or circle , which zone attack . certain characters also zone attack , but this only against flying opponents . you must expierament enemies order learn zones they weakest . sometimes , you may required ' stock ' turn order attack enemy its weak zone . " what advantage attacking weak zones ? " you ask . well , it allows large scale , damage pounding comboes absolutely essential this game . once you hit all enemy weak zones , you " break " them . this involves circle button . once character ' broken ' , they tossed into air , or attacked while prone ground . this add up tons damage if you plan your boosting right . boosting integral part combat system . pressing r1 button brings up 3 slot meter which sometimes empty , but it may feature character potraits some your characters . if you press r1 , then button ( square , triangle , or circle ) character potrait , they boost forward , immediately after acting unit taken its turn , this new character turn . enemies , however , take advantage all these systems well . if you not plan well , or randomly attack without comboes , enemy break you , boost ahead several times , easily destroy one your characters one short , brutal assault . countless times my entire party destroyed simple enemies should no problem , merely because i not plan ahead . you get very , very used seeing game over screen . plus side this difficulty you feel real exhiliration when you win , it great accomplishment . note even power levelling , it won't help you much some situations , believe me , i tried . finally , there ether . ether skills basically magic , if you know anything rpgs all , then you know basically what present here , healing ether skills , attack ether skills , nothing big . i forgot mention e.s. units . these basically mechs , called a.g.w.s. episode 1 . many points game involve you using these move around fight , now they independant battle system . it basically same one your characters screen , except you only one attack turn , no comboes or anything like . it just added piece fun already awesome game . there skill system place . after every battle you earn class pointss and/or skill points . these spent getting new ether skills , or new upgrades your characters make them more resilient when you equip them . every character same skill set , this minor flaw slightly brings down gameplay score , but not overall enjoyment least . finally , one other flaw gameplay there no weapons , no armor . both these rpg standard fare , it seems kind odd not either . this may just something developers decided not i disagree , but it still seems little odd . note this really not detract game any way . xenosaga 2 , they also opted add lot more puzzle solving than episode 1 . interesting thing these puzzles , while challenging , don't take away gameplay expierience all . fact , i found many very enjoyable . storyline this game simply incredible . but , keep mind it basically required you beaten xenosaga episode 1 if you want understand it all , or least acquainted story some manner . if you haven't played it , best way get bonus dvd came game , there probably some somewhere around , maybe even ebay , allows you see 4 hours cut scenes original . this substitute those who dont want spend 60-80 hours required xenosaga episode 1 beat it . anyway , i digress , xenosaga 2 storyline more space opera fun . often times i got very emotional , game tug your heartstrings . ending sequence game , spectacular event lasting 15 minutes , i seriously tears . this game you , storyline good . it also filled entrigue , betrayal , new discoveries , new secrets . it truly incredible . i seen certain reviews say storyline doesn't solve everything , it doesn't solve all mysteries . let me tell you something : it not supposed . xenosaga going 4-8 part series , storyline continuous . it makes no sense all story complete only episode ii . i see no reason why anyone could possibly complain it . graphics : graphics xenosaga 2 basically same they episode 1 . no real improvements all . they still great though , cut scenes gorgeous . my one real complaint here lip sync sometimes off ( problem just every rpg voice overs ) , some environments little dull . this made up environments simply breathtaking . sound : soundtrack xenosaga episode 2 godlike . opening theme battle music catchy japanese sounding tunes ring your head forever , this music incredible . voice acting also absolutely superb , i zero complaints , this rarity . sound effects also very appropriate , very well . value : game hurt value department only because its length . put it perspective , first playthrough took me 28 hours , but more like 30 if you count all times i died go back point i got killed . after you win , you use your game clear file access even more goodies like some bonus bosses , dungeons , side quests , this helps make up shorter length . personally , i think its best $50 i ever spen t.t ilt : finally , overall enjoyment . this game simply most enjoyable game i played ps2 . i completed it after several all-night gaming sessions , it most likely keep you up too . role playing experience here superb , storyline possibly best rpg history , battle system incredible depth . there virtually nothing not like . avid rpg gamer , i recommend this game highly possible . however , there few things consider : you handle challenge , you like space opera/anime feel ? if you answered yes both , get this game	1
if you liked vice city , you'll love san andreas . more missions , car character customizations rival gang territories take over , what could better ? games biggest downfall familiar feeling you get after while , however , new improved options easily make it winner well worth cash . note , i no problems running this game pretty much all options high . i run dell 8300 3.0 ht , 1 gb ram , radeon 9700 pro it flies ! strap up get ready defend your ' hood	1
i decided try this game because it listed similar game customers purchased other games i really like . i am fan longest journey , syberia , gabriel knight , broken sword , etc . etc . i wasn't expecting whole lot when i started keepsake , but i looking kill time because i love pc games . very start , i swept into story , setting , characters ( i love it when there fun mascot sharing your adventures ! ) . voice-overs some graphics really pretty unrefined , but also makes game more endearing . these factors could reasons this game not listed way up there some other titles i mention . i added it my list favorite games , i play games alot	1

i wanted this workout " game " get back into shape after baby . it great workout including cardio , combat , isolation abs , arms or legs , mind body including yoga tai chi-type exercises . i love it tells you what day work out ( if you don't you fail day ! ) it increases intensity workouts based your previous performance . there several different workouts each segment so each workout truely unique help prevent burnout . your workouts assigned letter grade based your performance so it motivates me get allusive " " , which hard achieve ( it should ! ) . i am week 8 12 week program i definintely feel my muscles more toned firm after not working out year . i love nike helped produce game . i recommend this game anyone ; however , i issues eyetoy camera . you would think i would get how camera works after 8 weeks but i still problems . sometimes it indicates i touched something i nowhere near , sometimes it takes me 2 or 3 tries it register i touched something . you're still getting workout , but i'm working towards getting good letter grade . i want credit what i'm doing right . combat exercises frustrating i hard time believing i'm not punching hard enough often receive 0 score . i've started working out night sunlight windows makes camera less responsive . there couple times i've walked left screen my body triggered " try again " button after cardio workout ... so i 10 minute workout again history shown when i try exit out it , game fails me day quitting . all all i'm happy workouts , but just know camera takes some getting used . i hope others better luck it than i . my husband 12 week program also he lost 10 pounds i've lost 9	1
after sixteen long years , final fantasy iii finally sees official release outside japan . however , unlike previous games , final fantasy iii completely reworked . this more than just port enhanced graphics . final fantasy iii includes some new secrets side quests addition its graphical overhaul . final fantasy iii may just enough please some hardcore fans , but wait really worth it ? well , yes , but game isn't perfect . storyline final fantasy iii entirely too simple . crystals losing their powers there only four warriors come forth save world falling into darkness . sixteen years ago this pretty standard story , but when compared your average rpg today , current final fantasy games , storyline final fantasy iii joke . there nothing this story screams epic , characters involved aren't developed very well . luckily , we let it slide because its sixteen years old . gameplay wise , final fantasy iii pretty similar most rpgs today . you'll go roaming through dungeons towns getting into random battles . there few quirks game ds utilizes . you'll find moments where you'll zoom into certain objects you examine . it should also noted you use touch screen almost exclusively game . using stylus you make your character run direction you want him , gliding it across screen . taping things makes your character examine it , ultimately this how you open chests talk people . it works out , but it feels really clumbsy times . if you're looking get through dungeon little hassle , just stick directional buttons . its credit , though , using stylus makes menu navigation much faster , but most part , stylus controls just feel tacked . combat traditional turn based combat . there no atb gauge like later final fantasy games . each round you choose all commands your characters , then watch round battle take place . it simple , but isn't always fun . mainly because final fantasy iii challenge . if you began some later final fantasy games , then this installment may little too difficult . sometimes combat unforgiving , especially when faced bosses attack twice per turn , power take out character single shot . even worse , encounter rate pretty high running away battle often wasted effort because you'll fail so many times trying so . you'll probably get wiped out just trying run battle failing so many times . there several moments when you'll forced battle hours just leveling up . this fine those used old school rpgs , but many rpgs today not put so much emphasis leveling up , it may try your patience after while . it great people looking challenge , least , but some it may bit too steep . job system interesting . you go through game you'll get crystal shards allow your characters use certain jobs . each job its own set abilities learned it . example , white mages specialize healing arts , black mages attack magic red mages little bit both . you've also got other classes like warriors who take damage other party members , thieves who steal much more . there 23 jobs all , possibilities nearly endless . jobs you choose your characters also impact your stats . mages , example , don't lot strength but they excel magic . also , you gain levels , you'll also gain job levels . so it not only important make sure your characters good level , but also good job level . game looks absolutely stunning , least nintendo ds . it far one best looking out there . there some moments where it looks pixilated , but you can't deny game just looks good regardless . movie sequences also really pretty look they run surprisingly well . battle also fantastic . your enemies sport some amazing detail so backgrounds battle . whole , game just looks good . perhaps only fault graphics how restricted animation characters enemies combat . your characters won't physically go up strike enemy . rather they just step forward swing . very similar how final fantasy games nes worked . it strange see , but you'll quickly get used it . thing seems kind strange , though , top screen throughout most game remains blank . all action takes place bottom screen . there few moments when top screen actually displays anything . you'll see world map you travel overworld while you're towns . there certain moments where top screen text , or shows important story sequence , but that usually it . other than , when trumping through dungeons ( you often ) battle ( you also often ) top screen remains blank . there nothing wrong it , but it feels very awkward play nintendo ds game where top screen blank . they could've used it display dungeon maps or enemy information or something . top screen no impact gameplay whatsoever . music game pretty good , though . it not good other games series , there some tunes just aren't great , but music no means bad . there no voice acting game , really , but we let slide . audio wise , game good . final fantasy iii pretty satisfying experience any final fantasy fan looking good challenge , see how far series come . however , it may also shed little too much its old school charm some areas , particularly its unforgiving challenge . still , it worth it final fantasy fans who want see just how far series come . good+finally chance play final fantasy iii+great visual look+good music+the job system interesting+it provides good challenge+a fair amount secrets sidequeststhe bad-the story not all great-for some game might provide too much challenge , point frustration-high random encounter rate-throughout most your adventure top screen just ... blank ... nintendo ds game this just feels awkwar	1

i bought 2 these controllers my kids , because i didn't want cables middle our family room nor i want them sitting too close tv when they played . this controllers excellent . they work perfectly , they easy store because lack cables , weight fine small children , range signal more than enough they aren't battery eaters . i use them well they wonderful . they much better than ones comes playstations	1
santa brought this game , i don't think we've stopped playing since ! it such blast , really brings family together . we all so excited when my husband finally beat platinum " brick house " ( it our last one left wasn't platinum ) other day . it great variety songs ... new old . reviewer said there weren't enough new songs , i disagree . my friends ' daughters ( 21 16 ) even commented how many new ones there ( but they still chose sing " take me " 80 . my 8-year-old my husband gotten perfect scores " material girl . " fact , my daughter loves all old 80 tunes . only problem we've this game arrows don't show up dancing . we don't mat , but we tried it someone else house . anyway , i'm sure we'll get squared away time we get mat . i cannot recommend this game enough ! don't get headset , regular mics better ... sure get two duets	1
i played through fable lost chapters several times . all all , this very fun game . classic rpg elements leveling up , buying or finding new better weapons armor , choosing focus magic use or hack slash , choosing good or evil all included fable . graphics superb its time , voice acting top notch . addition , storyline quite good , more complex than average rpg ' save world ' tale . i heard some complaints fable too short , but if you take all quests max out all levels , game length should just fine ( unless you expecting 50+ hours morrowind experience ) . where fable loses some points controller setup . button configuration overwhelmingly complex , so much so finding yourself using item you not mean use frequent occurance . addition , you may find yourself using magic inopportune time , simply because you pressed trigger mistake . bow aiming feature might pop bad time ( like when you attacked 4 creatures ) , while rotating camera view , map pop-up might fill your screen you midst battle ( thus obscuring your view ) . also , fable tend some save problems . you may complete some quests save , upon reloading , quests may recompleted , or worse , may not saved not offered again ! still , these rather minor complaints . while fable really doesn't live up its advertising all-immersive rpg , it quite good , blast play if you like dd styled rpg . if you like zelda games but wish they more adult , definitely check out fable	1
headset awesome . fits very snug your ear not irritate over time . crystal clear 2.4 ghz channel . 9 hours game time only takes most , 1.5 hours charge . gaming lot more fun !	1
this game out while . i playing it long time now . i ever boring moment while playing gta : sa ? no ... i honestly cherished every moment gameplay . why ? because this game so much content capability , it not possible dislike this game if you actually sat down play appreciate it . people giving gta : sa low ratings must joking . control - superb . when i want my character something , he it , no questions asked . if i want fire gun enemy , i get fire gun without put up errors or jams . if i want hop car take off , i get just . content : this game vast improvement over even gta iii . there so much , it impossible ever get bored . every second entertaining ... there always something work and/or improve . challenging missions everywhere ; if you don't want missions you go lift weights , build up your muscles ... or you go put some neat features/colors your personal cars . radio : good stations songs cover just any genre . graphics : course there always room make graphics better , but graphics this game very good , despite there so much disk . this game covers everything , there never really let-down . if you haven't bought/played this game , i suggest you . it worth every penny , keep you entertained accumulated weeks time . good luck	1
it great game featuring awesome engine , single player campaign really good , multiplayer ok , totally recomended	1
this great controller , it rumbles ( unlike wireless one ) . yeah , it wear down time , but it far one better controllers because it doesn't ruin your gamecube it more durable third-party ones ( aka those not liscenced nintendo ) . i first third-party gcn controller some reason , it stopped my gamecube reading discs . i get it repaired . if anything , if you want good controller , don't go third party stuff . go original like this , one : they last much longer two , they don't ruin your hardware . it may look plain , but it would better plain working controller rather than quickly defective pretty one . also , official wireless if good , if you don't mind lack rumble	1
when blinx first came out , all reviews didn't really know what make it . they said this one most innovative titles come out past few years , but then they started going how hard it how it gets repetitive you go through each stage , clearing enemies proceed . well , what game isn't repetitive ? you could just easily say " all you tetris line up blocks " or " all you mario 64 collect stars " . reading time controls sounded so confusing . i didn't think i'd able handle 10 minute time limit each level while controlling time . so just week ago , i got blinx couldn't wait see how it played after countless " love it or hate it " reviews numerous people . after watching cool little intro breezing through first 2 worlds night , i saw -nothing- wrong this game . only people much trouble this those who only play rpgs or sports games , don't give platformers try . time control nothing worry either , it very simple understand , actually , you don't use time controls often . main story blinx short point . which good because i'm really sick games spending 15 minutes intros just tell you " this what going " pointless fmv . blinx quick 3-5 minute intro showing you he part millions time sweepers , time custodians clean up any problems time different planets . but suddenly , something goes wrong one them , princess kidnapped . blinx sees her gets determined save her , planet . you go through 9 worlds ( each world except last , there 3 levels , one shop , boss end ) get her back . each level , you collect time crystals gain time powers sweep ( use your sweeper/vaccum cleaner ) garbage take out all enemies level proceed next . it actually very fun i never got tired it . sweeping up different objects deals different damage enemies . garbage or flower pot won't whole lot , but beat up jaloppy , piano or even 16 ton weight , now there real damage . time crystals all over place , you gain time power collecting 3 or 4 same type . getting 3 one kind 1 any other gets you one power , but getting 4 same time crystal gets you two power . powers you use rewind , fast forward , pause , record slow motion , hearts gain you retry . if you haven't figured it out other reviews yet , it kind obvious when you need use some powers . like if you see bridge fall down , use rewind watch it rebuild itself cross . if you can't walk up river that pushing you back , rewind it so you walk up ease . if there two switches you need activate , record yourself jumping one while you jump other open door(s ) . main ones you'll using though pause slow motion , mostly because these work anything , even bosses . yeah , people go how hard bosses ... i guess they didn't figure out how use time powers . but last boss ... oh man . guy took me least total 9 hours beat . i just beat him this morning 2:59:49 am ( yes , i got exact second ) flipped out . i proud myself . he up there pocky rocky snes last boss . it like developers got mad something put all difficulty into him . because rest game pretty easy until part . side note , i love how ice levels actually ice . not magical non-slippery ice they other games . here , you pretty much skate floor if you go too fast or hit wall , you fall over get back up . it small things like make me love this game even more . graphically , blinx stunning most part . remember 10 years ago when you saw screens donkey kong country impressed models ? that what i got here . blinx himself some best graphics i've ever seen . see how he looks box ? that exactly how he looks in-game . you see fur him when he up close , they got every single detail down perfectly . every level also just much detail , there no bare areas all . there always something going . course , i can't leave out water . everyone seems impressed no matter what they think actual game . try slowing down time running through river/canal . or pausing it see trail left behind . developers fantastic job . unfortunately , some enemies don't much detail blinx . lot them just one colored shapes didn't really require much effort create . but then there some really cool design . so it little mixed bag there . last boss man , i won't even start thing . there no slowdown unless you're blasting tons garbage enemies without stopping . only other slowdown when you make it happen . it appears run 30 frames second , there nothing wrong . i really enjoyed music too , would love get soundtrack . main theme if fun enjoyable , first level contains most magical music i've ever heard . rest game good music , always fitting mood setting . final boss music really puts you mood take ' em out , it full energy concentration . sound effects cartoony , but that not bad thing . when blasting garbage enemy , you get zany little effect sounds like something tom jerry . voices however , i'm confused . they're not bad . fact , blinx great delivery voice acting not much personality ( he platformer character . he doesn't need personality ) . but i could've sworn they spoke japanese beginning . i know fact i translated some words meaning what text screen meant . but end , i didn't understand single thing . i guess they made up their own language here just like they panzer dragoon orta . but there isn't lot language going , just belts blinx most time . though he say some things english once while . i noticed " yay ! " " burned kitty food ! " when he got knocked out into lava pit . keep ear out what pigs say when you hit them garbage whenever they show up level . i swear one you fight most time goes " you suck ! " when he gets hit . it pretty intimidating hear even if you're winning . blinx didn't disappoint me all . it tons replay too . you get rank when you complete level , if you get all a+ or s+ ranks , you get cool treat . plus there cat medals each level add little bonus clips . first few pretty lame , but you get more , they turn out great . going back figuring out new ways beat bosses always fun too . i just can't stress how much i love this game . my shelf , i put this above knights old republic jet set radio future . but right behind panzer dragoon orta . what i've heard , demo sequel ( i'm amazed this thing well enough get sequel ) even better . blinx 2 probably first xbox game i get full price when it comes out . so get this if you're looking little bit " old school " feel superb graphics quality ... course fun . that all matters games , fun	1
basically if you like 04 , 05 06 you like this game nothing but rankings really changed . its same commentary , gameplay few new graphics . i like it its lot fun . im glad they didnt change it . remember old saying if it aint broke dont fix it . this great game play close there you ge	1
this game enjoyable enough , but doesn't really hold my interest enough go back it . it lags bit my gamer pc , some minor errors , but all aside , it just wasn't interesting me . game good quality , may perfect other gamers , so it still worth good rating	1
there really not much say this kit , however i think it unfair it received such poor rating considering only other reviewer complaint , kit too expensive , inaccurate because one he suggests actually more expensive . however , this truly passport amazing gaming experience . xbox live experience truly something innovative relaly really fun , i would recommend buying xbox 360 despite next playstation nintendo stations coming out . however , i also recommend waiting til after christmas . rush get these now ridiculous , i seen some consoles sell over 800 dollars . why not wait til after christmas when there almost certain price drop enjoy what this xbox live pack offer	1
star wars : jedi knight ii - jedi outcast . third game star wars dark forces series . introduction : i've pretty much always fan star wars , you may guessed , i'm fan many games based series . although star wars games often hit miss , when one succeeds , it usually succeeds beautifully . one most interesting ideas star wars game dark forces , released playstation one pc . although game itself horrendous , terribly-choppy framerate very poor level design , it something world never seen before - star wars first-person shooter . sequel , jedi knight , cleaned up lot problems , added some new innovations . now third game series , jedi outcast , arrived . like previous games this sub-series , it gotten multi-console release . read see how it fares ! overview : jedi outcast star wars first-person shooter . game one-player quest , well several different multiplayer modes . review : put it simply , this game everything original dark forces should . while not perfect , this game huge improvement over its predecessors . once again you play role kyle katarn , agent other dark forces titles . second death star destroyed , but many imperial forces still fight , so it up you infiltrate their hideouts exterminate them . graphics , most part , solid . i impressed how good they this kind game . nothing state-of-the-art , but they're still pretty damn good . control also given overhaul rightfully so , since this game lets you use force powers wield lightsaber . single-player mode extremely entertaining , fact game offers multiplayer options only adds overall value package . you save whenever you want single-player mode ! but , course , game isn't perfect . like earlier dark forces games , level design just not good . too many areas look alike , there too many instant death spots just too easy fall into . likewise , many cases your objectives unclear , some puzzles pain - i don't know you , but i buy first-person shooters shoot people , not solve puzzles ! because imbalanced puzzles often poor level design , it took me over hour just beat first level ! huge problem availability . lack custom control configuration also plagues game . this huge problem , since game limited control selections often clash what you're used this sort game . this game wasn't released gamecube very high quanitites , so you're gonna shell out full new price just get used copy - my mind , it not worth price . sad but true . i recommend this game star wars fans , just warned it not perfect , it hard get copy . edition notes : this good game , but some strange reason it just wasn't available gamecube very long . because this , even used copies fetch close original new retail price . this extremely annoying people like me who want get every star wars game . still , you should hunt it down if you're into this sort thing . overall : overall this best game dark forces sub-series thusfar . where game succeeds , it succeeds beautifully . i am impressed game , it just shame gamecube version not made readily available all would-be players . i strongly recommend this game if you get hold it - i doubt it disappoint any star wars fan .	1

this game great . both missions things you your own ( like extortion ) make this game awesome part anyone collection . i only found one thing wrong game . when you reach rank " don " , everyone still talks you i you bottom barrel . instance , when talking one corleone men , they still say something like , " hey kid stay outta trouble " . this game , although great , still use little fine tuning .	1

i using basic linksys wireless game adapter my 360 , it worked fine . however , it needed connected pc firmware updates ( making it impossible mac users ) , generally more difficult set up than " official " adapter microsoft . i ended up getting this adapter sale , setting it up snap . it gets decent throughput , saves some energy over external adapter , because it only uses power when you xbox 360 . it also nice see this supports wpa networks . if your time valuable you , this probably worth extra few dollars over similar products . you just snap it , enter your network password , you're off .	1

my kids really like memory cards because they keep playing there game once they get off andthey save it	1
i've counting down until i could get this release couldn't wait play all these great games again . when i got it started playing , it fun but disappointment kept mounting . little things like no manuals ( you open file and/or print them yourself ... not big deal itself , but come vivendi , quit so cheap ) no case cds ( you just get twopaper sleeves ) make package look incredibly cheap low quality . yes , these computer games 80s early 90s , but this package could put together better . graphics same originals , so i didn't expect any " update " there . i completed kq6 1 no problems , but kq5 annoying because you can't go back text ( or least , i haven't figured out how ) . " music " overpowers what characters saying . any problems you previous games , such difficult maneuvering , remain same , which expected . overall i guess my disappointment comes fact vivendi could made really nice package this , added some extras , beefed it up , included more information , stuff like . especially how long it took get this going . how many times release date pushed back ?? but no , it bare minimim cheapo production . i know it only $20 , but still ... could lot nicer . still must any kq fan tons fun play , but i am ultimately disappointed this product	1
i just got this game thursday i'm already disc 2 . this my first time ever playing final fantasy game i'm glad i picked number 9 . i won't spoil anything telling any story , but i tell you game amazing . graphics great there best i've ever seen ps1 game . i love characters , i'd say vivi my favorite then next would zidane , but really i love them all . playing final fantasy 9 made me wanna buy other games play them too . buy this game , you won't regret it .	1
i hesitated good while before picking this game up bargain price . based upon various reviews player feedback , i assumed this game would like 10 hours long , bit buggy , dumbed down . fortunately , none this case . i some good fun this over weekend ( yes , it finished over weekend ) didn't come across single bug . fable not same league morrowind , oblivion , gothic 2 , or some other great roleplaying games ( rpg ) out there , but it provide enjoyable diversion . gameplay : controls typical wasd keys mouse commands found most single-player rpgs . game fairly easy learn navigate . story traces hero childhood through adulthood , when he'll , you know , save world . there no character classes per se , but you roughly play warrior , magic-user , or stealth/archer character , or some mixture these . much story centers around main quest line , but there number side quests available . unlike most rpgs , quests assigned quest cards you pick up heroes guild ( lol ! that what it actually called ) . it rather artificial-feeling system , but it functional . progression game quite linear . most instances , you not able even leave beaten patch , since fences , rocks , invisible barriers won't allow it . compared more open-ended rpgs like elder scrolls series , fable seems restrictive light weight this regard . overall , it decent story , but it rather force-fed you . game includes several interesting touches . people react you based upon whether you've performed good or bad deeds . if you roleplay like saint , you'll eventually halo butterflies floating around . ladies ( guys ) worship you , you option buy home marry ( multiple times if you'd like ) . if you play evil character , you'll eventually grow horns fall out favor polite company . nonplayer characters game , least towns , jobs schedules . they work during day sleep night , though only quest-related characters anything say interest . although you only play game same guy , you customize him tattoos , facial hair , haircuts , ( small ) assortment armor . you control how your character skills develop , but not deeply you game like morrowind or baldur gate . there other small things you , such fish , play games chance , treasure hunt . overall , this game takes 20-25 hours everything it offer , so it rather short rpg . things i didn't much care not major , but simply underscore light-weight nature this particular game . game certainly designed appeal adolescent crowd , hotkeys burping , farting , so forth . various tattoo styles haircuts further highlight this point . there nothing really offensive game ; it just feels bit immature places . also , save system based mostly checkpoint model . you can't save just anywhere ( least your quest progress not save ) , but game autosave important junctures . graphics : game looks quite good . character models convincing ( though bit cartoonish often repeated ) , natural environment screenshot beautiful some places . since pathing fairly restrictive , much scenary noninteractive . it not like oblivion or gothic 2 , where if you see it then you probably travel it . sounds : voice acting pretty good , usual british accents invariably seem accompany such games . music particularly well appropriate various atmospheres . ambiant sounds also decent . replayability/technical issues : game probably worth playing twice : once good guy once bad guy . it play similarly either way , but there different ways perform certain quests depending your moral disposition . technically , game perfectly stable my computer -- no freezes , crashes , or other problems . manual decent explains much game , in-game tutorial . if you like rpg games get this one cheap , go it . it well-polished , though simple , rump through fairly well rendered world . don't expect same character depth , engrossing story , or exploring options you'll find some games i mentioned above . however , fable : lost chapters good several hours entertainment .	1
i purchased nintendo ds lite solely use it brain age big brain academy . i not used it play other games not intend so . i am still confident giving it 5 because keeping my brain active worth it . my wife also uses it daily . pros . - long battery life ( 8-12 hours what i seen ) , easy use , compact , possible use internet browser if card purchased ( i only seem them e-bay japan - mixed reviews ) con . - biggest complaint it not utilize built wifi not coming built internet browser , not really interested adding mp3 jpg files but i would like option so , more educational games line brain age or big brain academyoverall . - it worth $129 ds lite $19 brain age start using your brain again	1
if you liked original then you also like kh2 . it finishes story nicely . battle commands improved - i especially like reaction commands . still some camera issues . overall good game	1
i similar difficulties this hi-def adapter . one thing , plugs nearly impossible get into sockets . once i get them , all i got black screen . but thanks friend , i figured out what problem : if you're trouble getting those monster cables attached ( who hasn't ? ) , you should get deoxit progold kit caig . it just two very small cans stuff help clean off your connectors , more importantly , act temporary lubricant . i got my kit radio shack . i think it twelve bucks . not getting any picture all , my fault . i didn't realize two sets inputs my tv 1080i only . once i moved plugs proper jacks , turned off signals not apply my xbox dashboard , picture sharp brigh t.t he cables good quality . my only problem them proprietary digital audio connector . it kind lame monster require you buy their special optical cable comes right adapter . other than , if you've got cash , get these cables , caig kit	1
call duty best game you get wii its launch titles . except zelda tp , course . story line incredibly well developed you lead ally forces their liberation france . game utilizes all aspects systems capabilities you use unique motion sensing capabilities drive jeep , plant charges , aim mortor , even fire your own weapon . graphics not quite comparable those ps3 or 360 , but it never becomes issure . this game incredibly fun i would strongly reccomend it anyone	1
i rarely rate or write reviews video games , cds , or movies ... but i feel this game deserves all props it get . honestly when i first saw ad it i thought it looked interesting but none my friends or family heard it , so i reluctant buy first . however , my roomate i decided buy this game play it through together , it ended up even better than my favorite final fantasy video game series . sotc unique story line , decent music , but most all most beautiful innovative gameplay i encountered . idea just fighting giant creatures throughout free roaming world amazing , able climb up them use terrain best your advantage . no " trash mobs " each colossus relief too , because i feel though it would made game more cliche unenjoyable . i could talk all day this , but sake listening me rant ... go buy this gam	1
i think it great game , you play online other people around world . it good your're able play online , because after awhile easy level , gets boring . there different levels keep your intrest . campains really awsom . they never become boreing . mythology it real . this game real high , easily gets addictive . days fun .	1
not use this dvd thing causes xbox break . when u play games disk doesnt constantly spin . it reads some takes break so it doesnt over heat . when it reads dvd , it must constantly spin . dvd playback kit fryed my xbox . most " best buy " you buy dvdplayer functions better less money than one xbox .	-1
when i first played this game , i got bored 10 minutes . all you shoot kill people nothing , police chase you you shoot them , bring girls into your car it them . i dont recommend this game all its overrated	1
first , let me say i whole-hearedly agree review tiberius . back glory days counter-strike ( 2001-2002 ) , this game be-all end-all 1 ) online video games , 2 ) first-person shooters , 3 ) pc games , 4 ) any video game basically . it real-life weapons , graphics superb time , maps extremely well-made , system requirements still obscenely low , damnit it fun . then , inevitabely , hands time began take their ruthless , indiscriminate toll . video cards supported better graphics , new ( yes , better ! ) games came out ( battlefield 1942 , unreal tournament 2004 ) , hacking became unmistakable poison counter-strike , lot cool , casual gamers grew up or moved . 2000 2004 , counter-strike went utter joy sensation fading diamond nuisance . 2004 present day , it become problem . great games great game developers losing tons money because people still playing this game after five years their mom worn-out 640 megahertz pentium iii pcs running windows 98 . counter-strike still one most popular games all-time , ridiculous number people playing it average day , because people just don't seem enough self-control give up their hopeless addiction . today , server admins , most part , humorless dictators , not stand anything deviates this game undeniable , monotonous drone . people still playing same maps 1.0 release , completely lost all their zest initial potential . it always feels if i've played same round thousand times before , i probably . even custom maps sickening their monotony . fy_iceworld fun 3 consecutive seconds . many other popular custom maps heavy server rotation same way , all look disguisting . i've played probably over 500 servers , downloaded probably over same amount * quality * custom maps , not more than 3 i ever seen server run its rotation , or voted players . furthermore , people still playing game using dial-up , cs veterans always complaining camping , even if its tactic used complete objective . far objectives concerned , counter-strike basically become deathmatch game . no one listen anyone plan ( rare occasion there one ) , no one tries rescue hostages , everyone always calls someone " p***y " or " nub " if you use auto shotgun or awp . top it all off , valve cancelled outstanding won.net replaced it this steam garbage , utility soaking wet incompetence . l337 speak also gained mass popularity jaded counter-strike culture , become its own incessant frustration . but i won't even get into . if you're new cs , don't bother , veterans this game far friendly , you'll probably get called bunch names involving lots zeroes threes if you're beginner . now , if you want indulge yourself great online game , check out world warcraft , battlefield 1942 , sven o-o , or even team fortress classic ( dated game * awesome * community yet lose its initial charm )	1
all i say this game not ' everyone'!! you able read play ! last time i checked not everyone read . i bought this my 13 year old son ... who autisum . he master just every game i get him but he can't read . so , him this game not much fun . i ended up playing more than he i didn't even enjoy it	-1
this game 25 minute introduction or story . square enix really creative stories so good ! however i expect them put something like " skip intro " cause impatient people could really get mad stories ! i , however only get game every five months so i am fine . this only minor flaw . flaw when you want look map or statistics , you wait 5 seconds until it appears . very annoying , but again minor flaw . this game depends how much you like battle same creatures over over over again ! it get very boring after awhile . you train those dumb spirits sometimes you just want them level up quicker . this game gets very boring after awhile you want ditch game well characters . there not much action you limited amount monsters battle . 1.0 ~ 3.5 ----- terrible 3.6 ~ 5 ----- bad 5.1 ~ 6.5 ----- average 6.6 ~ 8 ------- good 8.1 ~ 9 ------ great 9.1 ~ 10 ------ must buy excellent ! graphics- 9/10 great sound -9/10 some voice acting but great fun - 5/10 depends how patient you how you react battling same monster over over again average- 8 my grade- 7 goo	1
graphics aren't most important part game me . i already owned oblivion when i bought gothic 2 because i hoping it would darker more mature " oblivion " style rpg . while it much more mature content than oblivion ,.. i never got see it because bad controls ,.. bad collision lack fun . ( bad collision i'm talking your character walking through or getting stuck objects . ) only weapons you find first tree branch tiny dagger . there no easy enemies fight level 1 character . even little gremlin looking guys first cave pond beginning totally beat crap out you ease . controls make combat unfun chore . i'm patient forgiving gamer but gothic 2 barely half quality elder scrolls 4 : oblivion . if you've never played oblivion don't xbox 360 or pc run it ,.. then maybe you'll get into gothic 2 . it much lower system requirements	1
this game just original + crappy beam system where you spin right when you lock beams gamplay totally repetitive also their isnt any game transforming all !! i hate this game so much !! it literally worst dbz game i ever played { i played them all ) i advise you if ur looking new dbz game wait next one because their shure isnt anything new here but crappy beam system . not buy this game ever !!!!	1
try before you buy ! this game major glitch : its save game files erased sometimes , so you start all over again . beware	-1
game itself very interesting - storyline engaging controls unique . it rpg , which quite switch mario . major problem this game interactivity - not enough it . specifically , there far too many cutscenes not skippable . many these cutscenes lead directly into boss battle . most frustrating instance this just before final boss battle - it takes 10 minutes get " real " fight prior save point . this isn't problem first time through sequence , but if you lose 4 or 5 times , this just becomes hassle makes game not really worth playing see end . this major problem most game designers found work-arounds , but nintendo revealed its lack rpg experience this element . it interesting game , but just make sure win , or friend/sibling/(enemy ? ) skip through dialog sequences you if you get tired them	1
i used my remote all 8 times before it stopped working . even proprietary dongle inserted into controller slot you cannot control this thing controller , you must use remote control . when you take dongle out dvd , screen come up telling reinsert , so if either dongle or remote get slightly injured or malfunction , then you've just wasted thirty bucks . i feel quite ripped off . low cost dvds nowadays , it much better idea buy standalone imho , you get good progressive scan $30 or $40 , which comes out same price . side , it also extremely annoying you can't turn , or off device remote , you must go up box it yourself , especially annoying if you just want watch dvd your bed crash afterwards . all all value proposition offered this product very low considering similarly priced alternatives	-1
playing icewind dale ii reminds me all those novels written american authors late 19th century . though many novels very well written , they never seemed suck me continue reading book . icewind dale ii like . it looks nice , it supposedly improves gameplay , it gives player more character creation options , but i just don't really want play it . why ? well , end day , it seems if icewind dale ii hurt extremely corny story ; it bogged down numerous irrelevent puzzles involving you running around constantly ; it just not fun its predescessor . i bought this game one reason reason i addicted baldur gate ii needed expand my party based rpg addiction realm . icewind dale ii seemed logical option . i wrong . i immediately confronted story so corny it almost embarassing take part . i confronted gameplay caused me run back forth one place constantly . i confronted battles so easy i soon bored . i tried play it again , but again i plagued same problems . i installed bunch unofficial patches , but those not solve problems terrible puzzles whatever else . overload puzzles corniness would ok if you could diverge one path you could baldur gate ii , where you could accomplish quests order you wanted . here you accomplish everything linear order could never diverge path . furthermore , story seemed retread story original icewind dale . fact , design game seemed paralell it completely . final problem this game concerns fact it difficult play if you no knowledge dungeons dragons rules . if you not know how use rogues or unfamiliar feats like , this game pose very high learning curve you may not want climb . i mostly familiar rules , but it easy see someone who not know them well could easily make mistakes or unfamiliar use certain classes ( even though rule book pretty exhaustive ) . all all , i not think this good game . i would just go baldur gate ii or icewind dale i instead this game .	1
don't buy it unless you want starforce malware your computer . i understand publishers wanting prevent piracy , but not expense replacing drivers i need(ed ) my dvd burner . check search engines see yourself . would otherwise great game , too bad it isn't playable because this malware	-1

i always fan fighting games . far 3d ones go , i great experience dead or alive series proficiency soul calibur 2 . i fear dead or alive soul calibur may spoiled me though . recently i bought mortal kombat deception found it horribly awkward * compared fluid battles soul calibur or dead or alive . i felt same way when i played tekken 5 . unlike graceful awesome animations dead or alive or soul calibur , movements characters tekken 5 unrealistic absurd . try out christie tekken 5 example . her idle animation preposterous . if you access dead or alive 3 , try putting out leifang . her idle animation thing beauty . every one her moves flows perfectly one next . this kind grace seriously lacking clunky tekken 5 . now let us speak character design . tekken 5 characters boring uninspired . they run gamut miscellaneous boxer 1 , 2 , 3 , 4 , miscellaneous karate fighter 1 , 2 , 3 , 4 . oh . there also few shrieky girls tight clothing , some which seem asian , if that your thing . then there guy cat mask . awesome sounds , it looks silly game . if you ever played practice mode dead or alive you probably recall fondness there feature shows each move command top screen keeps it there until you successfully perform move . this feature , useful it , not present tekken 5 . fair , it isn't found any other fighting game i played , but it really should . without further ado , let me simply say i not recommend buying tekken 5 if you ever played soul calibur or dead or alive . intro video much excitement game offer ( i especially enjoyed suicidal bicycle girl rescued kitten ) . * but least mortal kombat deception puzzle kombat , which rocked my socks	1
i started caesar2 back when it came out . i played it hours hours loved it . when caesar3 came out i bought too loved it even more spent even more time playing . both caesar2 3 rarely crashed . things changed!i'm spending more more my time restarting caesar4 than i am playing it . 8 out 10 times i access area where you trade other cities it crashes . without trading , you make little money game essentially over . other problems i'm seeing overall performance . i don't fastest machine ( amd 2.1 ghz , 512ram , rockin ' video card 256meg mem ) but there irritating 1 second delays addition crashes . i find whole game difficult use . this not case caesar3 . unless they issue patch , i'm feel frustrated crashes . maybe i dumb down graphic setting get rid delays . my suggestion ? wait patch before buying --- or move . - jason	1
this preview spoilers game please don read it if you didn play it ! i played xenogears when i saw xenosaga episode kinda short compare xenogears battle system but ok because xenosaga like " introduction " . ok improvements : gameplay longer than episode 1 ( i ended episode 1 everything 42 hours ) change ep2 ( 88+) . sidequest like plus if you want it it if you don you end game anyways . idea epiloge after you finish game very cool because you could kill special bosses get better kill final boss overkilled stuff like . chaos jr momo shion kosmos looking improved they looked more grow up . battle system put them up or down depending who you using or fighting well double tech attacksall characters able use all magic skills long you buy them your skillpoints making able sidequests . momo bow very nice improvement now she very good damage dealerrecover mp while stock good idea well use ep freely without any trouble . people complain because history focus jr urtvs but title says itself ( jenseits von gut und bse ) means " beyond good evil " wich means " rubedo worring ladies danger his red dragon mode wich makes him go out control ( possible reason sakura death ) , albedo his obssesive love rubedo but same time kill him well , nigredo wich refused mission ( involved rubedo ) killed his own father but he plays good person moment albedo said " giving life 1 hand delivering death other " . honestly second episode history role more development than first one because wasn introduction we starting know how things going ... what they wrong : i don see how they could think throw away tech attacks going good idea ... good thing they added tech attacks special attacks ep 3 you stock lot times make good combo characters(wich made battles kinda boring)music battle kinda boring compare ep 1voices chaos(sounded boring ... ) kos-mos ( like fake silly girl trying play robot ) shion ( pushing like " i better than you " ) momo ( very annoying ) sad thing my main team chaos kosmos momo thats why i got sad voice changes but they said they refix their voices episode 1 third last episode . ep 1 almost 8 hours movies ep 2 4:30 hours ( i guess complains long movies)i still don get it movies give more motion storyrole game wich most attractive things xenosaga over most games . episode 3 4hours full motion movies but plus speak texts faces included while characters move stuff like valkyrie profilethey cut completly close up when they cast spells or hit lights stuff most time you see characters back all way while you fighting . ( they fix ep3)in resume everyone know episode 2 bad things but well good things ( every game ) no they shouldn it bad when they noticed things people like game itself . good thing they fixed most bad stuff episode 2 episode 3 . battle system soundtrack characters voices all better only thing i didn like episode 3 battle mode they make it appear average rpg system ( attack , ether , tech , special tech , others ) so forget 4 combinations make tech attacks ethers cost " ep(cp ) " special attacks cost boosts . i wonder if attack give some " ep(cp ) " later . even all this i recommend you buy it before you get episode 3 because you losing lot storyline if you don more now they cost 20 dollars each ( or less)atte : roy_master	1
i've never bought wireless controller before ... so i wasn't sure what expect . but it turns out , this probably most comfortable video game controller world . logitech wireless ps2 action controller every bit comfortable dualshock 2 , then some . it very curvy controller fits almost too perfectly into palms your hands , buttons placed great . buttons never noticeably stick , full d-pad hundreds times better than sony segmented d-pad , analog sticks extremely sensitive , responding lightest touch , there start/select/analog buttons there 9though analog called mode this controller ) , new button turns vibration or off . placement these four good enough you won't using them often anyways . lag time wonderful this controller . there no noticeable lag whatsoever . radio frequency causes no interference , reciever small barely noticable , if not bit , dare i say it , " cute " . controller weight excellent too . it runs batteries , yet unbelievably light . battery door not stick out back uncomfortably either . your batteries also last you 50 - 300 hours vibration on/off . you won't even know you're playing it when you're middle violent gunfight somewhere . it just good . size also comfortable barely larger than dualshock 2 . plus , there no cords trip over , pull out controller slot , or add mess cords behind your entertainment center . there one small bad point this . vbration feature not good dualshock . but there just too many good things here this controller make it invaluable buy , even this minor drawback . verdict : guilty charges most invaluable piece ps2 hardware ( aside console itself ! ) world . sentenced bought consumers around world . case dismissed	1

unlike any other game you've ever played -- best possible way . i am easily bored and/or grossed out traditional racing , shooting , killing zombie games this game refreshing change . challenging enough keep you entertained quite long time . other reviewers said it ends too soon , but game lets you repeat each level beat your previous best score . so , if you barely beat level , you it over until you totally blown it out water . perfect pair obsessive-compulsives like my fianc� me . he thought it looked stupid when we bought it but now he plays it more than i his 6-going-on-7-year-old-son loves it , too . there isn't anything would inappropriate any age , but kid younger than 6 or 7 probably wouldn't get it . ( after he goes bed we play insanely gory jaws game -- you get shark !! ) you might think rolling up stuff make big ball would get old fast , but king all cosmos keeps it exciting challenges surprises . levels just get cooler cooler . also , music fantastic . it you singing no time . na na na na na na na na katamari damashi ! it doesn't even make sense but i love it ! i just ordered second katamari game , " we love katamari . " `nuff said .	1
i loved this game so much i gone got second copy , mine stopped working ! i love feeling entire world lives within game you always just steal car ride , listen radio take vice city many sites . tommy vercetti - excellantly cast ray liotta goodfellas fame gets out slammer goes back his turf . he gets sent vice city get him out way because really , they don't want him around anymore they certainly don't want answer his questions why he got jailed . you ride bikes , take cars , helicopter fly over city , go through districts different cultures work many gangs . bikers , columbians cops even , accompanied sound track beats heck out any other game i've played . radio enough variation keep everyone happy they their drive-bys cruise looking women . talk shows ! classy touch . game play smooth barely bug seen flows day night back again city sync , vice city night amazing , you also get weather variations impact , rain , bikes tend skid more you fall off . it kind attention detail means game never grows tiresome . hidden jumps all manner vehicles taxi/paramedic , etc missions mean game really so open ended . it three years i'm still exploring vice city . classic	1

i'm going keep this short because game doesn't deserve review longer than actual game play . great idea , tons fun , addictive , short . my only complaint , just when i digging game , i beat it . alittle disappointing , definitely worth $20 , just make sure you something else after you beat it	1
overall , i am pretty happy this unit . my only complaint it little underpowered far grabbing my router signal . my laptop 5 bars basement , but i typically only get two xbox 360 this adapter . because this , it drop its signal occasional my linksys wrt54gs router . however , it also 50 ft . away ( assuming direct line ) two floors several walls way . still , using this unit much better than figuring out how hardwire my xbox two floors away . setup breeze . i plugged it ( it snaps nicely into back 360 plugs into nearby usb using short cord ) , went network setting 360 , selected wireless slot , found my network , typed my wpa key my router . . it took all 5 minutes start finish . until buying this , i just dragged 100 ' ethernet cable down steps through doorways anytime i wanted connect xbox live . what pain ! this not perfect solution if you lot space stuff your router xbox 360 , but fine my needs , which mostly includes downloading xbox marketplace , occasional online play . if you avid xbox live player , you setup like mine , you might want consider hardwire solution . you may ocassionally lose your signal middle game .	1
this very flashy , very fun car chase shooting game . you get over 20 different vehicles guns . tv-like gameplay makes good story line . there hardly any dialogue cut scenes , but this one first ps2 games . gran theft auto : $50 . driv3r : $30 . starsky hutch : priceless	1
xbox dvd movie playback kit very easy set up use . all you plug little receiver into one controller ports , put dvd enjoy . buttons remote responsive easy get used . however , xbox dvd system very simple . it doesn't any eject buttons ( something mentioned many times other reviewers ) not many options more expensive stand-alone dvd players . you keep mind it made people who already xbox don't want shell out extra $50 dvd player lot special features when all they want able watch movie . dvd itself runs exactly it would good stand-alone dvd player . it sort like one those little $100 digital cameras . there isn't anything really special them . they just take good pictures you put your computer .	1
i agree some reviews rush need keep up happiness tied immigrant status . said - i spent endless hours researching building thoroughly enjoyed this game . well worth cost enjoyable . i am not familiar other civ games - looking more city building game set past , similar my favorite game children nile - perhaps explains why i not disappointed	1
this game fun play but not greatest game either . course movie way better than game . game pretty easy short considering there 18 levels . storyline beginning could alittle better well . some missions pretty hard but after you pass tough ones it just gets easy again . all all it good game . i would recommend it . graphics good , i like how they put some storyline movie . it not bad game play .	1

much said technical aspects or systems requirements game , many reviews oblivion other next-gen or advanced games market today . caesar iii quite old , sequel always going further system demands . it worth wait . let talk game : basic gameplay intuitive . not lot you haven't before . interface pretty standard minimized off screen screenshots or just zooming around without distraction . which you really should . all these types games , you spend lot time building developing . you need get cup tea sit back this one , closeup views city work play what so new here . graphics look somewhat standard zoom out , top down view . there lot looks familiar . until you start get closer look texture details come life you realize there level realism here you watch shadows lengthen plaza near sparkling fountain midday sun moves across sky trees sway breeze . wow . no other roman game out currently comes close . this everything you always wanted caesar iii somewhat cotn , ( children nile ) although buildings here more substantial better realized . cotn feature able follow behind person they move streets , saving you hassle trying maneuver camera views get realistic walkthru experience , one they should implemented here . i would liked see more variety housing , also goods , particulary food . there only three foods , grain , vegetables meat - cattle . no figs , cheeses , fruits , pork , chicken or fish . production lines very simplified , no bakeries bread no weavers cloth . grain goes households wool straight clothing or armor factories . more decorative options should available well . overall , while quality what exists very good , there certainly room expansion . i hope they address these things games come . it part appeal adds longevity continued interest game . maps overall somewhat small , although game this graphic intensive would reasonably limit size facilitate performance . there very limited sandbox modes available , least now , i find no user created scenarios currently available due part complexity unsupported editor . but again , what there very good indeed . all structures beautifully attention detail . landscape breathtaking , variety ways put your city together around terrain . enough hustle bustle city streets bring it life . i mention you zoom all way down into arena or colliseum , watch closeups games or swivel around floor arena watch all spectators coming out moving around or cheering ? i am currently running mid-line gaming system nvidia 6800 , system run oblivion fairly well . i update some drivers well defragment my hard drive run this game smoothly . i hadn't experienced many lags until i built up larger city or playing several hours my system started protest . i replaced game launcher icon installed game desktop or program files shortcut i created game file caesar . exe actually get game start , something i found forums consistent problem . there some bugs trade routes . opening them before you goods doesn't seem problem much setting ports sell goods you sell but don't stock yet . i'm not thrilled number people it takes man each prefect , but it usually seems work well enough , except high speeds where frequency fires seems increase , but if you more than two or three buildings burning you better off destroying those rebuilding than waiting them get put out . you easily find your entire city flames very quickly ! while it certainly few faults , most things matter preference adequate , clean system . core game itself fundamentally solid . it takes work build up economic stability based trade taxes how well you handle your production chains . you create , any scenario , stable cities largely run themselves , aside requests/demands empire . your ratings screen tell you things you need meet your goals . instance - prosperity would also mean higher levels housing , especially villas , well successful taxation trade . better educational coverage not only affects culture rating , it affects security rating because better education means less crime good coverage jupiter , who frequently remove all criminals his blessing . good religious coverage affect both your prosperity culture ratings you then evolve your housing . military automatically meet threat city doesn't require lot micromanagement long you everything place well supplied . stable gameplay , depth , realistic economic simulation , great music breathtaking graphics , it not only very good game but best current selection city-builders . so if you chose , i would recommend this one first . enjoy	1
honest , i little wary disgaea 2 . first game so much fun , i bit worried sequel would just suck . worry not , fair gamers , disgaea 2 takes most ( though not all ) what good first game builds upon it . incredibly humourous localization ? check . colorful anime-styled artwork ? check . detailed , amusing , slightly outdated 2d sprites ? check . highly amusing strangely moving storyline ? check . etna ? check . dark assembly ( new improved so it much more enjoyable) ? check . my only quibble they stripped out lot unlockable classes , which takes little bit fun out obsessively levelling your characters . however , you tell my rating , only quibble , it totally balanced out all other improvements they made . overall , if you enjoyed first game , you'll enjoy this one just much . i'm so very thankful this not suffer " sequel-itis .	1
i've only this controller few days , i found layout same black controller . i wish thumb controls little softer , they hurt my thunb while playing exciting game	1
this first karaoke revolution game i received , i enjoy it very much ! however , songs game i found quite old , even someone like myself , senior college . i dont know rest you , but 80 blur me . i didnt know these songs very well , which put major hinderance game play . i liked high amount songs they put he recent game , but i already ordered karaoke revolution volume 3 after seeing more recent songs i would know . i found " sing dance " mode challenging , if you dont know song heart , dont play it , because you need watching arrows where your feet should going . i would also recommend wireless microphone dance pad ( if they exist ) since cord get way your dancing moves . i thought it really cool game sense initiative , over 50 different unlockable items ( although 90% which items you use create your character , or just new character ) . some songs listed here need unlocked through game play . i'm sorry i couldnt think every artist these songs , but if it isnt listed , assume its least 15 years ago . 1 .

xenosaga : episode 1 took us . although flaws game many , story sufficiently entertaining interesting warrant praise given game , clunky play mechanics . xenosaga : episode 2 awful . plain simple , it awful . any interesting cliff-hangers episode 1 either answered stupidly , or not all . game not only possessed lackluster storyline , extra characters introduced merely confusion sake , but i never seen battle system more user-unfriendly , more monotonous clunky than episode 2 . times , i wanted throw my ps2 against wall , particularly when fighting patriarch . terrible game which seemed kill series ...... until episode 3 , which throwback simpler rpg fare , works quite well . episode 3 , battles actually interesting fight ( least early - i enjoy use boost counter once ! ) . no more you guess whether shion attack useful against enemy , or whether you should switch , say , chaos . instead , characters divided into three classes : attackers , defenders supporters ( healers ) . it pretty simple system , no ? also , story kicks back into high gear . i won't spoil anything , except say finally , testaments , which alluded episode 1 but completely ignored ( other than tangential referral ) episode 2 , returned , let face it : wilhelm much more compelling character than , say , young albedo . finally , wheels which began spinning episode 1 come full circle . fact , it seems if episode 2 could skipped entirely , no loss continuity . there numerous nods xenogears this game , way , gear sequences actually quite fun ( character battles episode two only trumped boredom ... gear battles ) . any case , xenosaga 3 worthy addition library . it flaws ( again , it would nice action sequences movie sequences move more seamlessly , although it infinitely better than episode 1 or 2 ) , but it fun game	1
this game remains one my favorite games all time . i'm old school game , i've played computer games since i atari st cartridge . i played other gta games , i liked them very much , they all addictive . this one , this one trully jewel crown . there many things i could say , but i just don't want repeat same waffle . it great game , characters all superb , voiced great actors . ray liotta just fire tommy vercetti . i'm still suprised they got all this talent , there seems no stone un turned , even blondie get minor par t.t his many thumbs way up . indeed , it notorious , it not minors , though no doubt there more minors played this than adults . lot it subject matter just kicks , just teh kind amusement we seek because it kind thing we would never normally our wildest dreams ; other part , inmo , jsut sheer style . i can't recommend this title enough . only possible downside it , this just picky loading times various parts city . this eliminated san andreas , but this one one . " i run this town ! me !! " - tommy vercetti	1
pros : 1 . character creation fun , detailed basically unmatched any game market , much better than nwn creation system . 2 . graphic beautiful , but if you expecting fully 3d environment , you disappointed . 3 . music just awesome . 4 . i mention character creation fun ! playing your custom made party very satisfying experience . any kind team playable , you solo game too if you like . cons : 1 . not feature 3d environment like nwn2 . gameplay linear , but i didn't care point my game develope my character	1
star wars : jedi knight ii - jedi outcast . third game star wars dark forces series . introduction : i've pretty much always fan star wars , you may guessed , i'm fan many games based series . although star wars games often hit miss , when one succeeds , it usually succeeds beautifully . one most interesting ideas star wars game dark forces , released playstation one pc . although game itself horrendous , terribly-choppy framerate very poor level design , it something world never seen before - star wars first-person shooter . sequel , jedi knight , cleaned up lot problems , added some new innovations . now third game series , jedi outcast , arrived . like previous games this sub-series , it gotten multi-console release . read see how it fares ! overview : jedi outcast star wars first-person shooter . game one-player quest , well several different multiplayer modes . review : put it simply , this game everything original dark forces should . while not perfect , this game huge improvement over its predecessors . once again you play role kyle katarn , agent other dark forces titles . second death star destroyed , but many imperial forces still fight , so it up you infiltrate their hideouts exterminate them . graphics , most part , solid . i impressed how good they this kind game . nothing state-of-the-art , but they're still pretty damn good . control also given overhaul rightfully so , since this game lets you use force powers wield lightsaber . single-player mode extremely entertaining , fact game offers multiplayer options only adds overall value package . you save whenever you want single-player mode ! but , course , game isn't perfect . like earlier dark forces games , level design just not good . too many areas look alike , there too many instant death spots just too easy fall into . likewise , many cases your objectives unclear , some puzzles pain - i don't know you , but i buy first-person shooters shoot people , not solve puzzles ! because imbalanced puzzles often poor level design , it took me over hour just beat first level ! huge problem availability . lack custom control configuration also plagues game . this huge problem , since game limited control selections often clash what you're used this sort game . this game wasn't released gamecube very high quanitites , so you're gonna shell out full new price just get used copy - my mind , it not worth price . sad but true . i recommend this game star wars fans , just warned it not perfect , it hard get copy . edition notes : this good game , but some strange reason it just wasn't available gamecube very long . because this , even used copies fetch close original new retail price . this extremely annoying people like me who want get every star wars game . still , you should hunt it down if you're into this sort thing . overall : overall this best game dark forces sub-series thusfar . where game succeeds , it succeeds beautifully . i am impressed game , it just shame gamecube version not made readily available all would-be players . i strongly recommend this game if you get hold it - i doubt it disappoint any star wars fan .	1
i played several nancy drew games this far best one . i recommend this game anyone .	1

while it shares name " chrono " many people think it horrible sequel , it fact not direct sequel like so many people think it . it very well rounded amazing game play , it follows up twenty years after fall lavos . keep mind when playing this game it chronological sequel rather than direct sequel so many people fail realize . while game numerous playable characters , it still maintains very good story , if you follow it closely , but times , become very confusing if you miss certain details . chrono cross net you around 30-40 hours gameplay , if you don't stop playing game extended amounts time , story just becomes completly amazing	1

seriously though , this game awesome . i bought this game simply because i heard it good , i am glad i . plot great , actually worthy bear star wars name . story what makes this game great ending satisfying . it everything , tons action fighting , emotional dialogue , lots choices even few occasional hints romance . basic story this ( don't worry i wont tell you too much ) . you soldier republic gets involved rescue jedi , who you develop kind mysterious bond . through out game you travel several planets , including tatooine , kashyyyk , dantooine several new ones , never mentioned original movies .	1

mario kart double dash essentially mario kart 64 then some . game brings alot new cards table , which i review below . mario kart double dash improved last game immensely , saying alot , because mario kart 64 one most fun games available n64 . first way it improved previous game allowing players choose 2 characters race instead 1 . this makes bit more complex control scheme , but otherwise doubles fun . game also features tons available characters play : mario luigipeach daisywariowalluigibowser baby bowserkoopa paratroopababy mariobaby luigidonkey kong diddy kongyoshi , andbirdothe game ol ' grand prix mode time trials , but it also some new unlockable features , such : new cartsnew charactersa new circuitnew battle mode stages ... more , but i don't want spoil anything . mario kart double dash multiplayer modes better than ever , too . not only battle versus modes once again available , but there new types battles : shine theif babomb blast . all all , mario kart double dash extremely fun replayable , enough features unlockables keep you occupied entertained while . i enjoy it , i think any gamecube owner should pick this game up . i reccomend renting it first see if you like it , then making your decision . thanks reading , bubba " samus	1

i got earlier design this controller . it bigger felt better than regular dual-shock . only down side it analog sticks . top curves like bowl not like knob no grip which means my thumbs kept slipping off . this new controller away problem goes back old knob style analog sticks more grip ... but it size regular controller now but rounded . it fit well hand uses only 2 aa batteries . this controller great , but if when it stop working like other reviewers say , i swap out analog sticks my old logitech controllers . ( little altering needed	1
i recieved this gift christmas day surprise . however , there mishap wal mart i guess mic they told my parents would work actually didn't so i hadn't able play until yesterday . however , now it all sorted out i finally able play using usb ps2 head set . game actually so much fun . first time i tried i went familiar songs , so i selected " pieces me " . i so bad first time it laughable , it failed me just i started second verse . but game gets so much better after your first few tries . after while i easily getting gold expert judging ( i immidiately like challenge myself ) . i breezing through songs i grew up loving such irene cara " fame " , wild cherry " play funky music " , vicki sue robinson " turn beat around " . then i going through songs dominating my cd player not too long ago such ashlee simpson " pieces me " , incubus ' " drive " , beyonce " crazy love " , hilary duff " fly " . it even better classics such madonna " material girl " , blondie " call me " , commodores " brick house " , whitney houston " i always love you " ( one many i haven't quite nailed yet ) . now order make platinum beyonce you actually sing like her ? no , which makes game very accessable . however , it doesn't hurt familiar your singing voice . over all this very fun game only one problem . while songs may fun , it very very diverse . sometimes too diverse it own good . take example when me my mom want play , songs we personally know two different erras . i'm wanting bust out " call me " , she wanting " i left my heart san francisco " . this creates only problem : unless your all around music-know-it-all ( which i'm not quite there yet ) you'll end up doing same songs over over again . but this really doesn't bring game down . if you've around listened wide variety songs then you should able cover good 30 songs . not mention , it would make great party game . i would suggest getting this game if you're into fun while not afraid make fool yourself	1
this so wonderful . i 7yr old ( boy ) 9yr old ( girl ) they cannot get enough this . my 9yr old sleep over other girls now want come over all time play ! i even some parents inquiring it . this so much fun , even my husband i great time playing . kids love you creat your own characters change their outfits anytime when you well you unlock new songs outfits . we can't wait get microphone so we more .	1

( yes , i'm 29 years old she still can't it ! ) . i'd recommend this game anyone not looking advanced game requiring weeks play advanced storyline . if you like tetris but want little more variety just little more skill requirement ( good laugh ) , this game you . there something oddly satisfying rolling over dog seeing his legs twitter air when 5 minutes earlier he pushing you around ... weird ? yes . fun ? yes . i'd say good 12+ years because young kids may find this too boring because they won't appreciate how strange cool this game really	1

( way , avoid ds game called " sudoku " . it unnecessarily clunky entering data . ) this appropriate game seniors who like math/logic challenges even if they've never used computer . plan spend some time tutoring newbie , then watch he or she enjoys challenge	1
this game reminds me alot grand theft auto series . while it many similar characteristics way you get around town , go into buildings , way you interact environment it still manages offer few original interesting components gaming industry . this game great storyline fans likely enjoy . even if you weren't fan movie this game still must . like gta there few side missions ( not massive gta though ) , there collectibles , then you main missions way . while object game take over new york , some warehouses businesses get repetitive , but its mostly all fun . one plus police this game tend less hassle unlike gta games . this lets you keep playing rather than stop restart safehouse or police station . this helps speed up game . controlls take time get used but after you play little while you good go . if you like gta format style play you certainly like this . also if you like godfather , storyline game great really stays true movie . while its not best game year it certainly until new gta comes out . it took me 2 weeks finish game playing few hourse each night . i hope they come up godfather 2 . we see ...	1
loads fun . great graphics . great rpg . great rts . i've played it few times it never boring . story fantastic although linear . true proper trilogy . i hope spellforce 2 least good this one . ( i've got it already but not start it yet)cheers	1
this truly amazing game , especially considering it made small independent developer . there virtually infinite number different unit types , spells magic items so game never gets repetitive ( this possible * because * it doesn't rely massive amounts graphics ) . different nations each their own style play . ai challenging even when set " easy " . you download new maps other modifications internet . i only reduced rating 4 because problems interface . it sort unfinished feel it . example when game ends , it always exits windows rather than main menu . also , running multiplayer game very difficult requires executing two instances game simultaneously	1

if you liked first disgaea you just love second one ! game builds upon all strong points previous game . now instead taking forever get powerful characters you achieve characters like archer , ninja , etc . much quicker . main characters still hilarious , i love fact you get see laharl , etna gang again this one . ( go prism rangers =/ ) . once again plot isn't too twisted , but it enjoyable . back game play though , its similar old one , but you more options . one , you join dark assembly . item world you not only level your item , but go assembly , improve luck your item , purchase items such alcohol bombs influence assembly . there also new addition subpoena . these felony charges your characters receive based upon too many murders , too much hp etc . etc . these " medals honor " demon world , allow your characters more prestige , not mention they once again make you want go item world . bonus , you transfer bailiff your subpoena onto your item , so you get felony charge , level your item same time . this game fabulous addition any gamer collection , i highly recommend it ! enjoy	1

red dead revolver , far , one best western games i've ever played . game easy learning curve also . after hour or so play you all controls down , you'll hooked or otherwise very interested . it one best story-lines out any other games i know . basically , western tale revenge renegade southern general his colonel . you play red harlow whose father brutally murdered right front him colonel darien , again , general diego right hand man . i wouldn't say this game bad rating makes it . there no actual dismemberment , rating " blood gore " says , use curse words kept minimum . if you've seen any pg-13 rated movies , two could relate . it fun time killing game , if you're bored , great replay value people who don't plan finishing single player modes . there tons characters choose multiplayer mode , both good bad . multiplayer modes numerous also , including things like showdown dueling modes . downfalls this game short story mode overall simpleness it . there aren't many ways you get creative it . but , greatest thing it i believe : sheer hilariousness it ! me friend sat played it more than 4 hours night once , sat holding our sides , crying , because laughter . midget clowns character reactions funny . especially how it sometimes glitches up . once during boss fight very fat character , fat enemy got hung stairwell , because he too big go through it . overall very good game ! you should buy this , if you like this game , you may want purchase gun too . gun copied off red dead revolver most part though . both games very short stories too . if you like good western great replay value , then you certainy love red dead	1

this game just like film quality playing uncoutned , where fun just keps going . highly recommended ages 3+ . don't forget memory card ..	1
great remake , but where fast forward ! my kingdom fast forward button ! this great game ! cut scenes nice touch helped draw player into story line , but would someone please give me fast forward/skip button . i understand makers game want you get involved appreciate storyline , but without fastforward/skip button , this game game limited replay value . i already played through game once , now i am running through it again , i am going insane ! long cut scenes , seemingly endless , " next " clicks fine first time , but come ! game 3 different endings you would figure developers would give you break ! ok , now i said , lets get back review . character development use magical items , while definitely not unique , but they helped flesh out fight scenes . combos skills moves made game interesting kept me coming back . while i would liked see graphics slightly change when different equipment used ( swords , helms , etc ) combat special moves graphics definitely nice . should you buy ? sure if you like rpg game definitely buy , but fore warned ... prepared read , read , read , click click click , before you even get your first fight scene , even then expect much same long before you get things your own	1
i purchased copy game year edition end may , 2006 . it now almost september . i playing morrowind three months most week day evenings 4 hours most weekends 12 hours . game great graphics , character interaction fairly intricate though times repetitive , game ai monsters non-player characters fairly advanced , game manipulation fairly easy learn , layers complexity somewhat challenging though not overwhelming , most importantly one or two puzzles i come across thus far straightforward resolve . most various quests not terribly intricate difficult so they lend themselves jumping few hours then taking break . i wanted game would visually appealing , simple game manipulation mechanics , interesting but easy puzzles , mysteries , above all provide immersive virtual world explore . i wanted inexpensive game would run older 900mhz amd thunderbird nvidia fx5200 128mb video card 1 gb ram . morrowind fits bill nicely . i ignored all faqs manuals how play game most those provide spoilers instructions most opportune or expedient path . i discussed game some my students who moved oblivien , fourth game series . all all , this best 20 bucks i ever spent game . previous this i played call duty civilization ii extensively some other strategy games bit . i play dungeons dragons group friends college some 20 years ago so fantasy ideas embedded game familiar	1

one most common complaints xenosaga ep . ii battle system annoying ponderous because " even ' regular ' battles , it forces you spend many turns stocking just so you decent damage enemies . " this actually form codespeak . what these people really saying " i'm not very bright , even after several hours playing ep . ii , i somehow never realized how use battle system efficiently . " ep . ii puts great deal emphasis each character attack attributes . attacks classified either physical or ether , then there elementals ( fire , ice , lighting , aura ) finally there types ( slash/pierce/hit ) . sound complicated ? eh , little more so than average rpg . not nearly bad something like vagrant story . all you use analyze any enemy you're unfamiliar see their weaknesses , then use change command bring character proper attack . when you come across enemies physical/elemental weaknesses , there ethers which you cast add element character physical attack . if their weakness ether/elemental , then just use standard elemental spell ethers against them . this all you need make battles flow nice , normal pace . some reason , vast majority ep . ii players seemed never realize this . instead , they saw their only option using stock command nine ( nine ! ) turns row before beginning their attack . even wimpy garden variety wandering monsters ! they took no heed enemy weaknesses , using characters physical/fire based attacks against enemies weak vs . ether/ice . rpg players used reputation more intelligent gamers . i wonder what happened ... lot ep . i fans never bothered play ep . ii because negative word mouth spread so quickly amongst fanbase soon jp version released . but now ep . iii out ( it truly fantastic ) lot them finally play ep . ii soon . i hope they better than first rounders	1
when i heard square putting out game disney fronting it i even keel . i don't much love disney but rings true mario well i still played mario rpg . however , unlike mario rpg ( here just " mario " ) final fantasy ( ff ) characters weren't featured . i'm all little cosmetic upgrade squall cloud since graphics when their games made now quite gap . one thing i didn't expect some most powerful beloved characters video game history would take back seat kid key weapon . these two protagnosits particular much more emotional development struggle then " sora " ever . this beyond frusterating . after all cloud through , he still seen this weak willed person no direction or purpose life . squall other hand ( unlike cloud psychological battle ) , huge distancing emotional issues overcome , especially abandonment . but ff8 he showed final boss greiver what . know i put so much time 2 games gave me reason truly care all 8 members either given game , i couldn't care less sora his friends or fate every disney world . lame square lame . you some most highest grossing games both rpg over all history you still sold out disney ? i come expect more company caused me stay up so many nights , miss so much homework miss out so many life experiences . thank god you didn't disgrace some your more advanced titles ( xenogears vagrant story come mind ) . well thats my review any true square fan take it or leave it but while you play your game just remember who your dishonoring	1

i played this game back ' 91 when i 21 watching 21 jumpsteet . even dumbed american version(of this game ) fun time only good form entertainment .

this my first experience sim city . i've never played earlier versions . important note : computer prompts you type code white box lower left part back cd case . well , i looked looked , it wasn't where prompt said it would . after five minutes thinking my eyes playing tricks me , i finally found code . it back owners manual located inside cd case . you'll find it very top back cover manual , not lower left corner . tutorials helpful , so if you're new all this i highly recommend you go through those first . if you feel you need go through them again , you reset tutorials start fresh all over . i'll built small city , i've only this game day , but i know i'm going love it .	1
i'm not 1st/3rd person shooter fan . but this game graphics sheer re-playability won me over . i actually played battlefront ii before i , but original seems much much better than seque l.p.s. best star wars game ever : x-wing alliance . what i say , i'm old-school	1
my kids ( 11 7 , 2nd 6th graders ) first played this game friend house . they both begged it . they not stopped playing it . thing we live texas sometimes it just way too hot play outside . there always news reports kids just sitting around . this game makes you move !!! they played so hard first day they got it they both so sore next day . i recommend this toy several people . first , if you need get your kid moving , this great . if you hyper children need outlet , this great . if you need exercise more , this great . if weather doesn't permit your active kid go outsice this toy great . if your kid wants see him or herself tv this great ! if your kid afraid try new things front others , this great . this toy got my boy sign up little league . both my kids already active , so they play hard , but it irresistable temptation even inactive kids . everyone neighborhood loves it	1

you played any games doom series ? how metroid prime ? medal honor ? golden eye ? well , then you've played halo 2 , also , because all first person shooter games exactly same . i don't care how many times x-box magazine ( odd how magazine drools most over x-box game system magazine . ) calls it greatest game all time , i'd rather play mario power tennis which atrocious . story absolutely appauling terms science fiction orientated theme , utterly mundane , unoriginal , boring just all around unentertaining . gameplay so generic it if this first creation some fresh out college video game designer , music cliche , voice acting flat , master chief just all around retard . weapons , oh boy , weapons , again lame aspect game . alien weapons like something kid " toy gun " section toys us , human guns nothing i haven't used resident evil game . when first halo came out i didn't get big deal , i didn't even play it , then eventually i got myself x-box , decided give this installment shot - huge mistake . come think it none games x-box even worth owning system : fable decent , but got old after beating it few times , knights old republic series boring , everything else x-box i could play ps2 or gamecube	-1

it pretty much all said , let just say it again ' cause i'm sure firaxis/firefly plant positive reviews here . game takes ages load , voice acting silly ( british ? australian ? herman hermits ? ) , progression totally linear ( ie game fails become more complicated higher levels ) , graphics date 2002 , citizen ' fetching ' system completely random opaque . sit watch awhile : your huts change size every thirty seconds . most importantly , boo sid , boo . you could've produced this bad caesar3 ripoff called it anything , but you called it " civcity " , even put tiny civilopedia it . haven't you got enough money ? civ series brilliant . don't cash it	-1
concept this game strong , it got some cute ideas , but voice recognition - especially word " blue " - character recognition abysmal . it makes " game " exercise frustration , more than anything else . character recognition ... unless you write whatever font game programmed recognize , it going record your answers something different than what you wrote . you penalized when system doesn't recognize " blue " or correct number . if system so rigid it only accepts one way saying " blue " , then system should sound file tells you what it wants hear . number recognition , it should screen shows you how system wants numbers written , or it should able allow you enter your numbers correlate them numbers within system . ( when i make this mark , it = 4)also , " intro " content absurdly long , no way skip over it . huge waste time after first 10x you've seen it . i just got game today , i've spent hours trying figure out way say blue such game recognize it ... now , i just wish i could return opened software . i'm very frustrated entire experience	-1
i started caesar2 back when it came out . i played it hours hours loved it . when caesar3 came out i bought too loved it even more spent even more time playing . both caesar2 3 rarely crashed . things changed!i'm spending more more my time restarting caesar4 than i am playing it . 8 out 10 times i access area where you trade other cities it crashes . without trading , you make little money game essentially over . other problems i'm seeing overall performance . i don't fastest machine ( amd 2.1 ghz , 512ram , rockin ' video card 256meg mem ) but there irritating 1 second delays addition crashes . i find whole game difficult use . this not case caesar3 . unless they issue patch , i'm feel frustrated crashes . maybe i dumb down graphic setting get rid delays . my suggestion ? wait patch before buying --- or move . - jason	-1
opening cutscene introduces you blinx cat , supporting cast particulars his upcoming adventures , i found myself trying wrap my brain around basic premise story . idea secret , off-world clan humanoid cat creatures , armed souped up vacuum cleaners , responsible development dispersal time itself every known plane existence map . it seems time , when compressed tightly enough transported said cats , takes form one five different brightly-colored shapes . if these crystals left out open too long without properly introduced flow things , they turn into monsters . i could go , because game certainly doesn't stop there , but i think you get point . i like think there fairly thick line drawn cartoony fantasy super-detailed realism . generally , lot physics environmental details taken granted realistic game , because they're almost exclusively set photorealistic , lifelike location . cartoons , other hand , generally don't worry themselves particulars primarily concerned delivering good time . how much fun would wile . coyote cartoons if every time lead character suffered grisly fate , it strictly obeyed laws gravity aerodynamics ? blinx tries straddle thick line delivering story that overly detail-centric environment that right out kid show . result tale comes off way , way out left field almost completely abstract . it focuses things would better left viewer imagination ignores importance good underlying story way . beneath needless discussions why there monsters world , how time compression works how cats actually responsible all we hold dear , actual plot almost laughably straightforward generic . there princess , evil pigs kidnapped her , it up you you only rescue her save her world . that it , no side-stories , no reasoning , no subplots - just straightforward rush point point . here i thought phrase " save princess " universally recognized ages-old cliche . now , i don't want it sound like i'm railing this game just because it got few more nitpicky details than its peers it reuses old phrase way back platformer handbook its sole driving factor . it also completely lacking character development , general storytelling ongoing inspiration . none characters blinx really establish themselves individuals , including lead character himself . you don't hate pig spaceship because he trying destroy world , you hate him because every time he shows up he tries steal your money . i honestly forgot there princess end game after level three , because she never mentioned game start its finish . i mean , very first super mario brothers least reminded you princess castle end every boss fight . i don't honestly think game really designed enjoyable so much it geared overly challenging . first level half set up standard " get know you " format , simplest enemies , most routine stage layouts plenty opportunities mess around your tools . shortly thereafter , you're thrown wolves . most part , level designs very short , more emphasis cheap hits than complexity true challenge . i noticed lot overlap stage layouts , whether it retracing your steps time time again or walking catwalk ( har har ) above beginning stage invariably plummeting back start point . you'll almost always know what needs , but actually accomplishing act real trick . i just can't overemphasize how unbearably cheap most this game really . if there bottomless pit nearby , ( chances very good there ) blinx find way force himself into it , regardless what you're hitting control pad . if there enemy two feet front you you hit attack button , he'll aim random switch other side room , rather than imminent threat . that not say entirety time sweeper totally without merit , because it bring few fresh ideas table , but most part those insights hampered their surroundings . ability control time , instance , time really fresh , interesting new play mechanic still stands out today , despite limited field imitators since emerged . you rewind few seconds catch enemy unaware or rebuild crumbling bridge , pause action take advantage frozen time , knock level into slow motion , etc . all while , blinx moving around real time . it great idea , but implementation painfully short underutilized . why can't i use two controls same time ? why don't more aspects stage encourage player experiment solve problems these powers ? why doesn't ridiculous ten minute stage time limit pause , speed up or rewind when i use my time powers ? why their duration so brief , why can't i hold more than dozen uses time ? i mean , this could've really fantastic experience if time control aspect beefed up little further treated more than just auxiliary function otherwise run-of-the-mill platformer . controls , too , undeveloped , undertested nightmare . blinx himself often sluggish respond , especially when implementing his time controls . he difficulty making precise turn , whether midair or solid ground . he stops briefly celebrate when gaining item , which leaves him open constant enemy attacks . he routinely moves direction certain death , though pulled magnetic field , whether you've instructed him so or not . he'll occasionally refuse perform double jump , particularly when attempting difficult , precise leap across gaping chasm . i think it these controls most make blinx so mind-squashingly aggravating . glance , you'd imagine they'd fairly difficult screw up . you've got jump button , suction / fire button , time control button analog stick control movement . plus , there already long , established line three-dimensional platformers market years before title release , paving way ideal control experience . super mario 64 its issues , sure , but nothing like this , it trailblazer entire genre jump world 3d . it like they map leading them right treasure decided forge their own path anyway . i can't even say i'm impressed graphics showcased throughout time sweeper , either . exception lead character himsef , these some incredibly cheesy , preschoolish character designs - they feel unfinished hurried , less purposeful than you'd imagine ( especially contrast blinx himself ) . particularly insulting large population simple blobs roam around levels , trying vain bump into you cause fatal injury . here finely detailed main character , such close attention paid his wardrobe even gloss his shoes obviously debated time time again , he pitted against set monsters could've sprung life directly out pages four-year-old sketchbook . despite featuring spoken dialog track , there no english voice acting . i couldn't pinpoint language , but my wife seems think it either french or some close variation it . it certainly didn't sound japanese . while this add touch personality title , it not every day you get chance hear cat shouting something language love , it all seemed really odd out place coming out my television . everyone vocal personalities so black-and-white , too , i feel like great chance establish some much-needed individuality amongst cast lost once again here . bad guys all same deep , gravelly , transparently evil tone , while good guys all bright , cheery , squeaky high-pitched like monkeys super monkey ball . it like parody games come before , but i won't give developers enough credit assume they doing it purpose . overall , blinx really just few promising concepts thrown together one package , strapped shell far-below-average third person platformer unleashed upon unsuspecting public . time its release , it still need lot polishing , some serious scrutiny behind closed doors re-evaluation just how far some these concepts half-hearted character designs could conceivably stretched without losing any quality . top , i really don't know which audience they targeting it . game ridiculously difficult , which betrays childlike demeanor surrounds it leads me believe it meant serious gamers out there , but so bright , kid-friendly annoyingly cutesy i can't imagine anyone demographic rushing out stores release day . number spontaneous controller hurls shot through roof during my time blinx , reaching near-marvel vs . capcom 2 levels its unashamed , excruciatingly cheap hits , especially later levels . i no idea how i acquired willpower finish level eigh t.t he game adequately lengthy , offers some replay value , hidden cat medals each stage eventually unlocking production sketches , promotional materials like . once you start hunting floating cat heads those super-tough later levels , though , you'll remember why you so happy finished them first place . unless you feel like pulling your hair out clumps ( i shaved my head after experience part cleansing process ) enjoy self-mutilation , i'd recommend you stay far away	-1

first off , i cannot believe how mad this game made me . i like all kinds games , but honestly trying figure out some levels this game left me stumped . it one thing stuck somewhere retry lot , but several times during this game i stuck area no idea where do/what , etc ... even after i killed all bad guys i didn't know how get out room . this game not intuitive ( sp ? ) all ! secondly , this game should not called incredibles , it should called mr. incredible , because you play him almost all time . playing elasta-girl great , i really enjoyed part , but when there lot baddies guns , mr. incredible pain since he no way block anything , so you spend lot time getting pushed back until bad guys reload . i liked first mission dash ( when you play dash , which only twice ) you run fast ; however second mission i just lost my patience because i restart million times because i couldn't see what ahead me . playing violet bad , they should lot more her instead boring stealth mission . incredi-ball mission incredibi-sucked , it took me like hour hit something because it difficult place . i'm just finishing up game now quite frankly i haven;' enjoyed lot it , which shame because i really loved movie . some levels too hard because you barely find way something mr. incredible needs more than punch people . currently i'm rocket silo level i keep falling down trying get onto platform . what load fun 100 times or more . bottom line : playing elasta-girl fun , everything else either blah , or made me want swear lot . hopefully second game better . i'll renting instead buying , this game left me disappointed overall	-1

i've got honest , this game more entertaining than probably last three games i've bought , not they bad though . funny thing these kind games ( so long you're using light gun ) they improve your accuracy firearms . it no substitute real shooting , but then again , how often you spend hours shooting probably thousands rounds like these games ? now , game itself , graphics good enough , but arcade style makes it look ... well , not real . but then again part what gives game it charm . buy game , light gun	1

i've through doom3 now three times . first time i didn't even cheat . i won't go into how great game it but stick few short comings . one , game started off perfect . little bit realism goes long way but later degraded into world comic bookish nightmareism ... skeletons missile launchers their shoulders come ! bugger man rocket launcher pace right hand .. aaah ! it isn't hard figure out why id it , they trying spice it up bit keep it interesting ... i understand , i just don't agree . two , no mass attacks monsters use up all your hard won ammunition . instead you transport our marine h-ll once more search find same things all over again -- all these games ! monster nazi helmet whip -- more comic book filler . three , game cheat every other room searched gets little irritating . you know monster other side darkened doorway . you throw dozen gernades there , monster isn't hurt . you take step forward , monster jumps out you blast it . then -- course -- monster which appeared out nowhere behind you , attacks . answer course walk backward , trip ' if then ' statment program , shoot monster behind turn around shoot one front -- your second attempt get through door . i get tired computer gamecheating because i makes me cheat beat game . i don't mind dark areas , whole base just went h-ll , i would expect lights not always work . four , i've heard those h-ll knights destroyed big green glowing plasma gun/cannon . well , i it thirty eight hand grenades ! game would -- i think -- better if two or three turn loose roam hallways looking humans munch randomly . five , basically , never enough fighting room . understandable station world pressurized atmosphere . rooms would all small . exploding barrels pressurized enviroment , what hoot ! yuck , yes i said yuck instead number , belted ammunition machineguns usually came 100 round belts -- not sixty . mini guns used chained belts -- i know , i use repair them . plasma gun munitions travel far too slow . shotgun needs longer barrel so it still choke keep pellets spread out too wide becoming useless after ten feet . handgrenades can't thrown properly . light machinegun firing rate half what it should ... goodiness sake , get some duck tape flashlight tape you weapon . list could go these ' little ' things ... but game easily worth money . remember , these mostly suggestions id future program	-1
i decided buy star wars republic commando xbox my son , because he won't let me play my pc version . come find out it seems like it plays easier xbox . this game far one best i've ever played . it awesome . i find it very exiting actually feels like part combat squad . everyone team knows pro-active , rather than reactive . i haven't seen game yet , where squad members react direct or indirect fire these commandos it . you don't move your team , they'll their job . you also redirect their orders they follow orders letter . able " inject " them bacta , makes game whole lot better just " finding med kit " , other hand , while you're injured , rescued your crew definitely gives you feeling you team !!! only regret ( just small one ) game so short ( or least it felt like it ) . it only three major campains , game so much fun , it seemed like time flew . i only hope lucasarts decides make republic commando ii ( maybe , based missions omega squad ) ... here hoping . i definintely recommend this game , squad-based combat or star wars fans alike , you'll get kick out it . i'm definintely fan " delta squad , republic commandos	1
after playing grand theft auto iii , i thought there no way rockstar could top themselves . fact , when advance word this game got out , i actually thought this nothing more than add-on gta3 . stupid thought , i know ; whole , gta : vc bigger , badder , more audacious than gta3 ever . so , here story : 1986 , tommy vercetti -- hitter forelli crime family liberty city -- finally released prison . sonny forelli , his boss , immediately sends him down vice city close major drug deal handled ken rosenberg , shyster lawyer forellis ' contact . no sooner deal closed than gunmen break it all up , kill everyone but tommy ken , take both drugs cash . now , tommy recover money sonny ... but before long , he decides make name himself this town . setting pure ' 80s excess , through through . if you take bottomless amoral corruption scarface , day-glo polyester fashion miami vice , innate cheesy greed ronald reagan 1980s american culture , you'll vice city . you'll see it fashion sense citizens , local architecture , cars tooling around road . you'll even hear it radio stations , which boast array heavy metal , dance , latino , bubblegum pop music like which you haven't even thought since ' 80s . i swear ; try listening one radio stations see if memories don't come flooding back . voice acting , usual , superb . ray liotta outstanding job bringing tommy vercetti life , making otherwise loathsome sociopath into strangely likable character . there others well ; burt reynolds , dennis hopper , gary busey , lee majors , fairuza balk , robert davi all turn great performances . but philip michael thomas , who played don johnson partner tubbs miami vice , gets special mention ; more ways than one , his character -- lance vance -- one keep eye . while main story missions only take up third game itself , it addition new feature not only rounds things out , it also adds length game , really makes you feel like you're establishing criminal empire . they're called asset properties . certain point game , you option buying certain businesses . once you buy one these asset properties , you complete its mission strand , business start generating daily amount money you pick up . some them perfectly legitimate , such taxi company or nightclub . others little sketchy , like boatyard or strip club , but others absolutely illegal , like protection rackets , " ice cream " company , or car showroom . they add great amount depth , they let you establish contacts across town . needless say , once sonny forelli comes town " check up " you , make no mistake ... he now your town . so , if you feel need get away it all indulge your inner tony montana , book trip vice city . like san andreas , it great place visit unwind ... also like san andreas , you'll glad you don't live there	1

nintendo dominated handheld industry since gameboy came out . now sony stepped , some predicted their hold might finally breaking . not so , there no better proof than ds lite . lite evolutionary step over original ds , similar gameboy advance sp . it more compact form factor , brighter screens , side-mounted power button , weighs less , longer battery life , simply looks more fashionable . basic functionality ds still here- same buttons general button layout , wi-fi , gba compatibility , etc . this worth buying if you already ds ? maybe , if you've got some spare cash . this worth buying if you don't own ds ? definitely . design far superior old ds . no ds review would complete without further mention psp . while psp undoubtedly more capable device , it significant weaknesses compared ds . particularly , psp games tend far longer load times , it much shorter battery life , hardware itself more fragile . oh , course , there cost . most critical factor , however , library games available . now , ds games more better , there simply no contest when it comes which more offer this department . games what really make or break console , wide variety excellent casual immersive ds titles make it clearcut winner .	1
mario luigi partners time me takes me back snes , first mario rpg " super mario rpg : legend seven stars " game i absolutely love ( would also recommend anyone snes or emulator ) . reason general gameplay this rpg hasn't changed . you move around different screens , attack enemies , fight bosses , etc . there definately unique ( i suppose you might consider it simplistic ) ideology this game follows . it easier version action/rpgs , you level up , battles aren't random ( you see enemies you engage screen ) though it turn-based . this game plays feels much like original legend seven stars , but added its own twists funny little story line make it , it own game . i highly recommend this game anyone who doesn't mind lot chatting , but even more action puzzles ! homerun mario rpgs	1

note : this review spoiler free regards game storyall good things must eventually come end , such star wars series , lord rings trilogy , jak daxter trilogy ( not including racing game daxter own psp game ) . after two excellent games , our favorite elfin friend his furry sidekick come last entry jak trilogy . big question : it good ending ? i'm pleased say overall , yes . jak 3 takes place undetermined time after conclusion jak 2 . haven city become divided after relentless attacks robots , metal heads other nasties . population blames jak these problems he finds himself flown out wasteland , harsh unforgiving desert where nobody survive without help . abandoned those he saved , jak his buddy daxter set out thier final adventure . like it two predecessors , jak 3 platforming game combined gun shooter . you get various jumps , kicks , punches leaps , you also get wide array firearms take out your foes when your fancy kung-fu karate aren't enough . jak moves remain largely unchanged jak 2 ( which now called j2 ) . he still punch like man , jump like kangaroo , leap like bullfrog . gunplay remains pretty much same well . you get four guns ( blaster , rifle , machine gun peacemaker ) , but nice twist , each weapon gets various upgrades game goes . rifle example , starts out it default setting . hower , next upgrade allows it shoot richochet bullets while third upgrade gives it flying platform shoots bullets all directions . each gun three upgrades playing them blast . peace maker example , fire shot paralyzes all enemies makes them float around ( whee ! ) while it final upgrade ... well , let just say you'll shooting mini-nukes lo t.t he biggest change jak game play comes form vehicles . while j2 flying vehicles zoomers , jak 3 cars ( not nice , talking pixar kind ) . because half game set desert , jak daxter get around dune buggies . there eight them each various unique traits . some really , really fast , one jump riddiculously high ( wheee ! ) some them spin out control slightest twitch control stick ( boo ! ) . you'll spending lot time driving buggies most part , it enjoyable fun , though some them ( such sand shark ) bit difficult handle . new feature jak 3 sheer size it . j1 j2 two enormous areas run around . here , you not one , not two , but three , yes , three ! gigantic areas run around . like previous games , there no loading times , astonishing feat considering how enormous both worlds ( spargus city , wasteland haven city ) . you'll definatly see lot amazing sights during your trips throughout jak 3 world ( such how haven city ... ahem ... changed since last game ) . dark jak powers return well , but now balanced new side our hero ... light jak . if dark jak attacking force , light jak defensive force . dark allows you kill things really quickly , while light allows you heal , fly ( this so awesome ! ) , surround yourself inpenetrable shield , even slow down time crawl . both powers activated any time long you light dark eco your meters . very nice touch , you stop light or dark touch button save your energy when you really need it . while both light dark come into play vital moments during gameplay , both really just little added bonus spice up gameplay when you want , you play throughout game without needing use either force ( except scripted moments where you need ) . but then again , able heal yourself whenever you want very handy thing ! * smile*like j2 , jak 3 you going place place , talking people doing what they tell you . when you finish , you head over next person what they want , etc . it linear system makes it easy tell where go what next it sounds fairly restrictive , but it one big strength : you don't start next mission until you want . if you want , you wander around wasteland blowing up wanderers twenty hours , go hunt down twelve precurser orbs watch sun go up down three times , then tackle mission . this free roaming system allows you what you'd like if you don't feel like doing missions while . one thing i'd like address before we go any further difficulty level . if one takes look my review j2 , one find lot anger hatred directed towards naughty dog making j2 most unnecessarily hardest game i've ever played ( it still way , tied only spider man ps2 ) . i am very pleased naughty dog towned down difficulty lot jak 3 . no longer each every mission require twenty attempts before you pass it , no longer you throwing controller into tv while screaming obscenities becuase a**hole errol won fricken race again . here , difficulty seems just right . not too hard , not too easy . most missions require few attempts before they completed , few finished one try . there still few quite difficult , one or two grit-your-teeth inducing , but overall , nothing infuriating many moments previous entry series . oh , there only few " go through ring " missions this time around . thank goodness . addition free-roaming gameplay , there also plenty secrets unlock this quest . there over 600 precurser orbs find collect jak 3 , doing so you get unlock various features such unlimited dark light jak power , invincibility , extra vehicles , various weapon upgrades , etc . while some hidden behind corners , many these orbs collected doing various challenges people throw your way , such searching around paticular area , going through rings ( grumbles ) , following little blue light even stopping time . there plenty things get those little shiny orbs , but results well worth it . addition , jak 3 arguably best moments series terms " wow " factor . fighting gigantic sixty story tall monster only dune buggy moment sends shivers down your spine . even all these fine points , jak 3 stutter little bit what arguably most important part game ... story . j2 most memorable me it story . it many twists turns you never really knew what expect next . story jak 3 good one it keep your interest what going happen next ... but ultimitly , it left me unsatisfied . how so ? three biggest ones charachters , precursers ending . those you worrying i'm going tell you who precursers ( which i won't ) i'm going keep this spoiler free i . first off , charachters . we jak daxter course , those two always fun watch care . we many returning charachters such torn , sig , samos , we some new residents spargus city . problem ? almost all returning charachters zilch charachter development . it assumed you know them last game because , jak 3 takes no time explain who they or what they . may okay , but pretty much none charachters expanded all . torn still gruff tough ( but not much last time ) , ashelin firm leader , samos gives warnings what may happen planet if things go badly . keira , who such vital charachter j1 j2 , absoloutly nothing story aside look pretty important . sig ... well , he just there because he cool . only returning charachter who kept me interested tess , who fufills " dumb blonde " role . her relationship daxter sweet lighthearted kept my interest easily . errol returns well ( though i won't say how ) , but he gone " insanely irritating " " average irritating " , sad departure his compellingly egotistic nature j2 . new charachters , only one , damos , kept my interest due his charachter . tough , yet gentle caring same time , he easily most compelling jak new companions . new villian , count veger , isn't compelling , though he some very powerful scenes ( especially one near ending ) . one claims back game box we'll discover shocking secret who precursers really . i said earlier , i won't reveal who precursers ( someone ruined suprise me ) , except my personal opinion , we should never find out who precursers leave them mystery . i personally felt seeing who they really sucked out all suspense mystery , esepcially since they talked length two games now . it like revealing face doctor claw . when you go back experience your old memories , there no more mystery or wonder anymore . my personal opinion , these beings should remained hidden forever . however , saddest part game me ending . again , i won't ruin it you , but it always sad when game developers wrap entire trilogy up three minutes . some people criticise ending film , return king , saying it goes too long . however , ending lord rings film trilogy took it time wrapping up threads three movies bringing closure story leaving one satisfied . however , jak 3 doesn't . game goes gets closer end , feeling dread idea everything destroyed just vanishes pretty much gone time final boss battle comes ( sadly , battle itself isn't exciting or memorable ) . ending end trilogy , but leaves door wide open more games ( which two already happened ) . i've invested lot time these three games , i've grown attatched it charachters i would like closure all thier stories . saldy , doesn't happen . everything left wide open when , my opinion , it should closed . there no real ending here , least , one ties everything up nicely . but despite my points story , i want stress jak 3 very good game . it satisfying blend storytelling , platforming , shooting , driving , action . it one those games where you keep saying " just five more minutes , just five more minutes " , only discover time flown it two morning . it addictive , fun , , me , blast play . i definitly recommend it , especially if you find it under twenty dollars	-1

i know i'm little late , but what heck ? i felt like writing review this game . final fantasy just fantastic game . simple . its extremely deep , fantastic story , great characters , great battle system , it perfect length rpg ( 45-55 hours ) . not everyone likes tidus , he honestly doesn't bother me , i think he interesting character . rest cast well developed , they all interesting personalities distinct this universe . cast very memorable , you'll remember them years come , i think speaks volumes how good this game . its enhanced usual good voice acting square known , so doesn't disapoin t.t he gameplay extremely fun , its actually one my favorite battle systems . battle system make or break rpg , this one doesn't disappoint . its fast paced , so it doesn't get bogged down long battles . you also swap characters mid battle , thats awesome feature . gameplay also incredibly deep , i've heard people literally pouring hundreds hours into this game . so if thats your thing , i'm sure you've probably already played this game . if some reason you not played this game your into rpg , don't hesitate pick this game up , its cheap now , its one best most balanced rpg i've ever played	1

i am huge fan world war 2 first person shooters . i've genre since begining medal honor . since then , not too much more impresive me than call duty . it wonderfual game still . call duty 2 even better . this new game maintain stellar streak series ? word , yes . although , it alot more same . but then again , why mess great formula ? call duty 3 works because it exactly what original game built around , sheer intensity .... also alot fun . but then you might say , well i've played cod2 , you saying its same ? yes no . basic mechanics same few newly added gameplay elements little nothing overall game so escense . yea , its same game . but this time around levels bigger look o so much prettier . honestly , these some most amazing visuals xbox 360 . i dare say it puts my beloved cod2 near shame . lighting texturing beautiful explosions heart stopping behold . life like graphics complimented brilliant musical score . oh , if anyone should wonder ingame soundeffects , just pop previous call duty game imagine it amped up even more . seriously , battlechatter never so nicely integrated . cod3 yet amazing world war 2 game certainly keep veterans genre happy content , meaning edge your seat . newly implimented rag doll physics destructable enviroments make sure you stay there too . i reccomend this game anyone everyone who played world war two first person shooter enjoyed it because what we here ladies gentelmen latest greatest , best money buy	1

i liked ssx series , sequel 3 best , but i didn't play racers . i bought first nfsu disliked choppy animation . i got part two just out curiosity i liked it so much i beat game . basically , you newbie bayview city you race different type races build rep your car . you must tune your car each type race you must check shops frequently . there various shops , visual effect paint shops ones which improve your car speed , handling etc . races also different : you races isolated tracks , races live trafic , street races confined cramped space without nitro option , lot dirty driving hitting ; short tracks which you win if you shift gear time , my favorites , drift races , which you win if you get most points , not if you pass line first . drift races won breaking steering order make long trail . i used automatic shifting i set game difficulty easy since i don't play racers . i 93 percent i got into race which unmarked map . it 6 circuit race against boss final one . some advice beginngers : if you can't find races map , go garage check out world map option you'll get list all races per level . if you beat them can't find any more races , upgrade your car or get some stars visual rating getting ' cosmetics ' ( new parts like spoilers , lights , new paint ) you'll get offer magazine cover or dvd . if you still stuck , cruise town find unmarked races	-1

i enjoyed this game quite bit -- i ended up putting all other games i playing aside just finish this one . you play three baudelaire kids . story follows 2004 lemony snicket film fairly closely , you must first escape count olaf decrepit mansion , then avoid killed train before you head off uncle monty herpetology paradise , aunt josephine seaside town , finally save violet baudelaire fate worse than death . environments attractive fun explore , game play puzzles neither too easy nor too challenging frustrating . most game -- you explore environments , solve puzzles , search secret rooms such , you switch violet klaus baudelaire you please . many " important " events , such boss fights , you must play one or other , they each different skills weapons . some sequences -- those basically 2d platformer sections ( entire game some platformer aspects , but it usually loosely employed 3d ) , you must play sunny , baby baudelaire ( this only time you play her ) . various puzzles challenges -- they almost amount series " mini-games " , varied mostly non-repetitive , helping retain your interest . some fairly easy figure out perform , but some appropriately more challenging , both mentally terms manipulating controller , take many tries complete . couple first-person shooter sequences ( game mostly third person mode ) , especially challenging , particularly end , but that final boss fight , so that expected . like most games , winning boss fights requires discerning patterns bosses adapting strategy appropriate pattern , which takes both brains manual dexterity . there couple negatives game , but they minor . games like this , released response success film , often rushed through production . becomes evident here cut scenes , which not very exciting -- they feature 2d black white sketches more like slide show major portions story read us . but i'd rather skimping cut scenes than game play , that just what here . also , although graphics wonderful most part , visuals bit dark overall -- i found it best play lights off . bright overhead light , glare too much see important information game . finally , i would preferred different save game scheme , you only save when game asks if you want , save points seem almost random . sometimes you save after accomplishing only one more minor task . sometimes you long sequences ( sometimes number challenging ones ) before you save again . game isn't quite funny film doesn't exactly same " magical " atmosphere , but it engaging fun journey world . soundtrack , jeremy julian soule , inspired thomas newman great soundtrack film , also major asset -- i found myself wanting explore levels again later much hear music again anything else	1

this headset works very well . if you're not used rubber in-canal ear piece , there several other tips bit less intrusive . it worked quite well limited amount time i've used it xbconnect . but price ! you could probably buy similar plantronics headset would compatable communicator cartridge-adapter ( which isn't included this package ; you buy it seperately ! ) , but not designed specifically xbox less than half this price . i very fortunate find two circuit city they discontinued recently five bucks piece ! maybe amazon soon drop price like everyone else ...	1

this game great . can't wait god war 2	1
movie tie-ins usually rather tiresome affair . they sell bundles units more often than not large pile mediocrity . godfather game different . obviously it made back unparalleled success francis ford coppolla gangster masterpiece . it sell this reason well . however , godfather game it own place epic narrative . it would easy ea put player shoes michael corleone - main protagonist movies . indeed , it may due failure securing license use al pacino voice likeness forced ea hand creating fresh perspective famous storyline . what we're left new take featuring your good self ; narrative sees you seamlessly weave out events loyal film . example , when luca brasi stabbed through hand garrotted - start first movie - you look event through window , you're spotted scene turns into revenge mission . it expertly executed you feel part story genuine loyal film . violence superbly recreated also . realistic nature firearms godfather makes interesting gameplay . you might used rather `cartoonish ' gunplay saint row gta , godfather might first seem unforgiving . it . but it realistic - take one bullet close range you're sleeping fishes ... it simple . conversely your own guns carry same clout , so shootouts often become intense challenging affairs , if little frustrating . where gta gun fighting success dependent how quickly you change targets get your shots off , godfather sees you picking your shots timing runs cover . it obvious ea development focussed heavily walking shooting parts game , this where most appeal lies . driving however different affair altogether . given nature godfather ea limited what isn't possible driving sections . physics cars mean they frustrating play . most vehicles slow faster cars seem unnaturally quick . handbrake turns work so well gta irritatingly difficult pull off , especially when chased coppers . cars bounce off kerbs but smash right through lampposts practically unaffected . other vehicles , however , seemingly made concrete . also , getting one way point times tedious - gta gets round this superbly scripted radio stations , but godfather doesn't such ingenuity - you're instead treated violin-based soundtrack depressing once novelty runner . valid excuse most this isn't ea fault - this more or less what it like drive car ' them days ' . there no radio ; cars lame , classic , but moved like pair concrete boots . where violence so real , so must rest game if only consistency . you would expect much what you directed storyline . however there provisions those who more impulsive . outside missions there businesses extort rackets take over . doing such build your weekly wage , which you then turn spend clobber sorting your hair out . you respect bar increases each completed mission , but coolly this isn't only way gain kudos amongst fellow gangsters . buying nice wise guy suit brings plaudits boosts respect meter much whacking guy . each time your character levels up you get point allocate his attributes . it bit weak rpg element , but worth thinking when acquiring garments . extorting businesses tricky , but worth effort . you'll usually take out two or three ' bad guys ' before able get owner . when you situation requires thought . essentially you need scare businessman into paying , you so finding his or her ' limit ' . so while some owners agree ' protection ' soon you ask , others battered brink death . pretty sick , but then life gangster isn't fairies . warned though , going over top or killing proprietor render business inactive while you'll get nothing but bruised set knuckles . it fantastic sidetrack main game taken seriously if you want hire muscle buy more powerful weapons later missions . so you've got two sections same game sit paradoxically each other . superbly well balanced combat game play forces you thoughtful timely . very dodgy vehicle part frustrates bores more than anything else . it difficult review sandbox game without making comparison gta , although it slightly unfair so godfather given rules imposed subject matter . it very best it delivers gritty realism , but same realistic token , it times terribly dull . it difficult dislike godfather ea so faithful everything we loved films - but this undoing game also . it would forgivable exaggerate gameplay places order make it more entertaining . but godfather game purists order please it feel genuine , godfather certainly .	-1
chrono cross , which semi sequel 1995 chrono trigger , cant even come close its former games plateua . chrono trigger arguably greatest rpg ever created . so while chrono cross ' not good ' it still whole heck lot things righ t.t he gameplay , story , battles this game all top notch . its fun get handle over numerous tough boss battles this game because elemental magics strategic system . black beats white red beats blue , etc . its always fun interesting see what next dungeon or boss offer . gameplay never sluggish always keep you your toes . also , when you beat game you option replay entire game again all your beefed up characters before . if things going slow you speed them up fast forward button your second play through game . truly brilliant ! so why this game get 4 out 5 if it so darn good ? because its confusing/tedious magic system over abundance characters . most magics summons this game joy watch behold their might . but this game there no magic points you must ' equip ' every single magic spell you . could mean 50+ spells equip per character ! setting up each character late game take upwards 5-10 minutes easily . each spell only cast once per battle unless you buy multiples spell . probably games worst point its ridiculous amount characters . chrono trigger something like 7 recruitable characters you play , each their own terrific unforgettable personalities . chrono cross 44 recruitable characters . 95% your 40+ characters personality wood stool . some characters literally say ' i join your party ' than join never say anything else ever again ! 44 playable characters instead 7 spreads each one way too thin makes them all lose individuality . end this game still one greatest rpgs ever made first playstation . while its few flaws keep it true classic , it still one greatest rpg experiences past 5 years .	1

this game great . i mean it might just like last years game all , but still it pretty cool . i like graphics . they don't show great detail , but they suffice . new momentum meter nothing special . it doesn't help you or anything . it just tells you who doing better game . new emotions expressed players really helps you know tempo game . one thing sort con this year campus legend mode . that really only reason i bought this game . i really don't like college football team well enough franchise it . i like csu though , so i might try it . but anyway , campus legend mode lets you normal thing . pick your position instence . you get lots drills your position this year . good some , bad most . also , you pick major . what up ? i mean , college football rough enough but study major ? unbelieveable . then they expect you remember all stuff you studied take two tests it each year . i got so frustrated i failing chemistry i started write all answers down . so i'm doing better now . trust me though , this game fun play random games your college team or guess franchise your favorite college team , but please , if you want make all-star football player , just go out but ncaa football 2006 . way more easier	1
this game long time making , given cultural popularity western genre , it surprising western-themed video game should take so long come market . i this game long time , but only recently got play it , when i finally got into it , it enormously entertaining i loved lot spaghetti-western themed humor musical score . game , you control variety characters ( many whom introduced superb opening sequence , which plays much like opening credits sergio leone western ) . most time , you play part red harlow , half-breed bounty hunter mission hunt down his parents ' murderers . ( sound familiar ? ) you'll also get chance control variety other western archetypes , such expert pistoleer english dandy , sharpshooting , spitfire rancher daughter , indian cousin red harlow ( who dresses like iroquois instead sioux or other plains indian - but i'm nitpicking ) , negro buffalo soldier , you even get play bad guy when you assume role renegade mexican general . gameplay itself took little time get used . instance , draw your gun , you must press button down , keep it held down while pressing button shoot . if you let go button which draws your gun , your character holster his gun again . this one quirks which made initially difficult learning curve . however , once controls mastered , combat actually surprisingly easy . you duck , hide behond cover , dive/roll , jump . when guns holstered , you even punch kick - one my favorite sequences whole game bar brawl ( more stereotypical western scenes ! ) where you cannot use your guns , but must use fists feet ( occassionally broken whiskey bottles ) fight your way safety . addition " normal " combat , there " showdown " mode which dedicated quick-drawing against one or more opponents . highlight this feature " tournament " ( which seems inspired movie " quick dead " ) where you battle ever-faster enemies until you win . this mode sometimes very frustrating you may replay again again . overall , graphics okay - what helps make this title fact makers put grainy , old-style matinee look ( like game movie played old-style ( worn out ) projector , complete hairlines picture moving off-center times . this little touch very endearing . while this title may not lot replay value , it still immensely fun i would recommend it highly .	1
this game rivals battlefront 2 all time greatest star wars game ver made . this game very similar halo its 1st person concept w/ hud . every level different lots strategic tasks . graphics gameplay awsome . i can't wait this game 360 compatible .	1

great uncomplicated game decent graphics just right amount quot ; spookinessquot ; . i loved puzzles which weren't overly difficult solve hint system very very good helping me get over one or two puzzles which not seem make sense . marble-in-the-hole game little irritating but all other puzzles solvable even trial error basis . this game probably not people who like complex plots puzzles but game novice i enjoyed it little disappointed when game ended ( little abruptly ! )	-1
i read previous reviews other reviews this games , i agree some disagree others . i like whole story line game . it gave us insight into history jr gaignun shion . i very disappointed overall combat system . i liked changing characters middle combat like ff-x , but i miss ability hit enemies special weapons like first episode . i also disappointed way creators changed way build characters first episode second . i liked characters different abilities . it added diversity building strong team . i didn't care too much good samaritan side quests . i didn't like go all over place pick up stuff vital development my characters or advance game . ability two characters attack during combat using special attacks interesting even though i didn't use it much . far characters themselves , i agree reviewer shion . i also found her bossy cold . certain scenes , i found her too emotional . most her lines near end completely out place especially end after jr showdown albedo . ( i disappointed when my most favorite npc gaignun possessed , but that just me . ) i agree one reviewer voice momo although i like some her lines . i very happy creator took away her wand give her weapon . it made her very useful combat . chaos too laid back me this game kos-mos too much vain side . i like how reaction shion jin or kos-mos before combat starts . overall game enjoyable play . once i got pass disappointing aspects game , i found it very entertaining	-1
... graphics pretty imbarasing . object game get snapshots you get these snapshots completing missions , levels , hero times ( specific mission you use one character ) . some levels fun , like far , far , away level(it grand theft auto theme ) . i give graphics 3/5 ( i think they should better job main characters ) , audio 4/5 , gameplay 4.5 /5 , fun 4.5 /5 , overall 3/5 .	-1
i saw ad city life i clicked it . i read it thought it sounded so much better than sim city 4 ( which i currently own ) i decided download try demo . demo so much fun , it many features . what gives this game unique twist social cliques . you meet needs each cliques , example different types jobs they need . what makes it realistic , it just like real life . blue collars dont want live next fringes , whereas rich don't want live next poor , or homeless . what supprised me most this game though 3d graphics . you zoom out get eye level " people " you see them reading paper their picnic table their backyard , or walking down street , or taking trash out . neat feature how easy it zone . zoning such improvement over sc4 . this game makes you auctually get involved your community , making it your perfect town . now all i am waiting my copy game come . 1- least ........................... 10-bestgraphics : 8simplicity : 9fun : 10realistic : 9overall great game those who tired waiting sc5 or , those who just starting out city simulation games	1
if you aren't daunted little detail turn-based strategy game , you don't mind graphics fall short quot ; latest eye candy testquot ; , you're willing spend some time bringing yourself up learning curve , you'll love this game . if you find any above 3 make you doubt , you probably shouldn't get it . but me , turn-based strategy junky core , this game absolute gem . probably best i've bought last 5 years . specific niche gamer out there , this one extraordinary	1

lemony game not hardcore gamers . it doesn't aspire . it shouldn't compared warcraft or resident evil 4 . game developed amaze activision . any one familiar first three harry potter movie o-o rdinated games ( through electronic arts ea games ) familiar amaze . first three potter games fun bit challenge children those adults who new pc gaming . player wandered around magical world hogwarts , collecting jelly beans wizard cards . what fun not completeing tasks or learning new magic , what fun freedom discover new areas find secret places . fans potter games recognize same mechanics gameplay outfitted new location , jelly beans replaced golden eyes , golden hearts refuel stamina instead chocolate frogs , playbills letters granted instead wizard cards . players also recognize flavor wonderful score game set , enjoyable , appropiate , but not overbearing some familiar notes . lemony isn't quite good aforementioned potter games . reason lemony not fun story . while ficticious , lemony story relentless abuse three very droll very wealthy orphans . its much more fun play boy , who left his abusive aunt uncle behind , entering magical world educated hogwarts . i rather enjoyed learning how fly buckbeak prizoner azkaban . lemony , i'm rather relieved i solved train signal puzzle , thought children run over over over train until i , depressing me . yet , lemony provide some consolation those who disappointed ea latest potter offering , goblet fire . while there adjustment droll circumstances , task discovering your world take over game eventually command your attention . while lemony isn't bad , it isn't good , either . they renderings children not most flattering they could , villians boorishly ugly . gameplay controls aren't half good potter games , they weren't greatest . there match game puzzle cellar , only shows up per every install , instead every game . i complete it nothing happened my game , which maybe reason puzzle won't show up rest games particular installation . it this twice me , i'm not going uninstall install third time see if it happens again . it no effect my score or letter or eye collecting . camera angles aren't well mapped shooting . i supposed shoot rat , but camera got behind ceiling lamp , while rat biting me , all i could see inside lamp shade . suff like . still its better than most children games out there , it plays ! you may guessed , there violence . when i shoot rat lemony , it shot rotten egg lobber . rotten eggs your bullets , player stuns enemies , instead killing them . time . i've played lemony three times , third time it going through motions . once few skills jumping , aiming egg lobber , boot puncher mastered , there wasn't any interest left . but time i play , i enjoy it . games amaze category unto themselves . they not action games based trigger finger , nor they point click boring adventure games beset brain teaser puzzles futuristic world . they relaxing time where you don't test your brain , just delight it . if you never played potter games new pc gaming i recommend lemony , it good place start . if you fellow potterhead felt betrayed buy goblet fire , lemony sustain you .	-1
i'm not going into storyline , becuase it obivously spoil it those who haven't oppurtunity play this excellent game . final fantasy first game final fantasy series released playstation 2 . graphics here sharp crisp , no fuzzness or distortions . voice actors actually good job , doesn't sound like those old kung-fu movies where tone voices ] don't match person appearnace . battle system simple use they offer tutorials within menu case you're still confused . i'm really pleased results i see myself playing this game over over again	1
late 04 i decided give purchase gaming system time original xbox . not real dedicated gamer previously only played ( never owned ) systems i little knowledge how it'd upon use -- but since halo 2 just released rave reviews i knew i try it out ( hey , it halo , people ! ) . man , i glad i invested it ! it bit large ( compared my best friend ps2 ) bit difficult lug someplace , but graphics much better than ps2 games available it great ( significantly critically acclaimed halo series , course , best game out there my opinion ) . there some issues how bulky system but it quality gaming rather than how bulky gaming system	1
