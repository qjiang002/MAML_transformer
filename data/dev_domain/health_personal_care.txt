when internal rechargable battery dies so uni t.t he power cord not power shaver once battery no longer hold charge . you cannot replace regargable battery yourself ! sending unit factory repair after its warranty cost you more than buying new one . shave : not bad , but not exceptional either . cutters very tiny , not built last , not durable . all rechargable batteries limited life depening conditions how they used . this shaver may last you few months - year , 2 3 years stretch . i also braun norelco , norelco 10years old running fine , braun 15 years - both original cutters foil - i heavy duty clean them 97% alchohol once year , brush out debris once every 7 uses , these units dont batteries this why i purchased remington acess when there no power plug available . remington shaver really needs it cutter blades cleaned ( brushed off or washed ) after every use ( what pain) ! i find this shaver waste money it more akin disposable electric shaver - than one last	-1

get hot lather , which nice , you first get device installed top . i would not recommend this if you easily frustrated . directions provided sparse several languages . first you pry top off shaving cream . they provide pry tool purpose which works well some brands shaving cream better than others . then you fit device top . it worked well one brand large size . when i tried it smaller size shaving cream it emptied half during installation process . using different brand large , i trouble prying top off . if you time patience , willing spend some money various brands shaving cream find one works well , give it try . otherwise , forewarned it may lead frustration bad language . it would nice if companies intending sell products us ( apparently manufactured somewhere asia ) would provide clear set instuctions english , reasonable large readable type , illustrations . this case , they need clearly specify type shaving cream unit designed . i not need instructions foreign languages , get tired limited instructions six languages	-1

i recently purchased this lumbar support cushion gift my father this past christmas . i am physical therapist , over 5 years experience dealing primarily mechanics mechanisms low back pain disc dysfunction . i tried out many cushions over years , my experience , this product good any higher-priced product same intent . composite board insert allows consistent shape maintained , so cushion not yield easily body weight over years consistent use , burgundy cover removable washable . it also excellent size average-sized person ( my dad approximately 5'9 " , ~ 170 lbs . ) . it provides good side-bolster support well added feeling comfort around outiside lower back . i highly recommend this cushion when placed comparison other similar products . most other products out there contention this one composed unnecessary additives , like massager , ribbing contours cushion , etc . i've found simply maintaining good posture ( not only sitting , but all activity ) allows so much more freedom pain simple ease back into daily life . again , i highly recommend this product anyone out there searching answer help alleviate low back pain ; however , i must caution commercial products not cure-all one problems . it always possible alleviate pain symptoms , but other steps necessary terms fixing problem . i highly recommend seeking out professional care physical therapist , it more than likely necessary one would need ( least ) proper education intevention help one get better .	1

if you suffer folliculitis , this may just razor you waiting ! i tried mach 3 few different times over years but all it would take just one shave , boom !, my face would break out folliculitis . although gillette claims mach 3 reduces irritation , i always found it super irritating . two things seem different fusion . closer spacing blades seems genuinely reduce irritation i found mach 3 . mach 3 always seemed dig into my face scrape away layers skin . not so fusion ! second , it seems me way fusion shaver cartridge mounted handle makes better angle shave . i haven't noticed gillette makes any claim way fusion blade mounted any different mach 3 , but still , i think it slightly different . i always felt like leading edge mach 3 shaver cartridge too sharp angle against my skin . it seems like fusion avoids this mounting " hinge " farther back shaving cartridge . thus , rubber fins front blades makes cartridge ride more level or flat over face . truly improvement however it achieved ! also , before i used fusion , i thought five blades little ridiculous . i figured you could never get close front ears , under nose , etc . however , i found five blades aren't ridiculous . special trimmer blade nice but i find i don't hardly need it . i get into close spaces generally without it . end , i used fusion enjoyed totally comfortable shave ! no folliculitis outbreaks resulted my use it ! i really like razor	1

pro : shave close blades . it may take while , but it get job . ( based just my person experience , comparing braun 1000 , 4000 . 500 , 8000 , new norelco speedxl , panasoic linear ) . con : poor build quality all area , look feel , fits noise level ( loud ) , shake , power connector , so . ( new norelcos similar problems - look feel cheap . far less solid than my old faithful quadra . braun panasoic feel better build . brauns pleasure my eyes hands . but unfortunately , no one shaves close remington)and it shaver after all it supposes shave . if this remington doesn't last ( i my reasons bit worried ) , i get one same . only hope remington least keep their technology intact over time . ( side note , among all auto cleaning systems , one comes braun 8000 series really works : fast , clean , easy get shaver out station , charge wash separately . too bad remington doesn't come close washer technology , braun doesn't cut close ! ) p.s. i no beard or mustache , but lots whiskers all directions around under chin . all other shavers i've tried simply won't go there . difference loud clear , literally : when whiskers got cut down , you hear it . all shavers work great initial cutting phase . but only remington continues after , while all others just empty runs , my fingers clearly tell me there're more cut . bottom line : try it . don't get scared away bad raps web . i tried remington my last resort . i never regret i	1

sunbeam flexible heating pad some nice features . built elastic bands hold it place . it wrap easily around any body part . it relativly comfortable , except over-sized connector pad power cord which always digging some part your body . but real problem heating . pad heats well 5 minutes then shuts off . unit shows its , but there no heat . unit not heat up again half hour . like many cheaper heating pads , i believe this some kind thermal-couple saftey kicks out certain temperture . then fails kick back until unit cools completly . i found this heating pad many high end features comfort , but heats like cheap heating pad . heat what heating pad all . its reason after owning many heating pads i willing dish out almost $40 this heating pad . heat . sunbeam just doesn't deliver . finally after using this heat pad 2 dozen times , it started smell like burning plastic . so garbage it goes . $39 down drain . after alittle product study i found real high end heating pads thermophore theratherm . check out their customer satisfaction amazon . i just purchased theratherm because you set temperture degrees . it seems work well , but early tell . i'll update future	-1

here few positives negatives i hope help :( +) it work , however some places-like your bikini line-where hair tends lay flat you need pull skin tight . (-) it hurts , bad . it slow painful process . (+) hair doesn't nearly long if you waxing . (-) hair goes everywhere . there no little storage area hair , this thing just rips it out flies it all over room . you it tub . (+) it easy clean , brush comes it works well , but i wish they gave extra one because i just know bristles start sticking out any-which-way after while . (-) battery not very good , you keep it plugged if you plan using it more than fifteen minutes . (+) it came cute bag store it . (+) i haven't shaved two weeks ! i probably wont two . bottom line i like it , i'm happy it continue use it . i wish i could gotten better one but i couldn't get shipping hawaii more pricey ones	1

clipper comes one speed , which not disappointing . two speed clipper tends get too hot this could severly hurt or damage small dog tender skin . it all you need begin , including clipper oil nice hard plastic suitcase type case . clipper oii comes so tiny , i'd suggest purchasing larger sized clipper oil separately , if possible it ready your first job	1
i agree others here they not everyone or every situation . my professional life , i constantly take them off put them . i huge head initially i some problems them coming apart . you need adjust experiment bit . after giving them second chance , i enjoy them lot . i used search everywhere pair my reading glasses . now my biggest problem crumbs . when properly adjusted , they work well . they only limited range lens strengths , however . they easy peer over ... bit more sporty or dare i say macho than pair chain	1
here why .... i searched high low decent lighted makeup mirror similiar one i years . my old mirror windmere , lasted 12 years . prior i clairol ( lighting just ok ) . days web searches led me those horrible round halo lighted mirrors ( they just look good counter ) serve no purpose . this jerdon basically same mirror my old windmere . very sturdy , great lighting , large rectangle mirror , side mirrors , vertical 360 ' rotation , 5x magnification reverse side mirror 11 mirror positions , also extra electrical outlet front appliances . issue regarding previous reviewers complaints lighting . you must hold button down 3 seconds allow bulbs light . lighting this mirror superior others i seen . it weighs 6 lbs folds nicely away . negatives this mirror : bulbs make slight buzzing noise when use ( typical this type bulb ) electrical outlet installed upside down my product , therefore mirror must collapsed lower position allow enough room plug . i consider these minor complaints considering product services all my needs . if you want go out house looking like you intend , this mirror you . i would definitely buy again	1

nude bill blass my signaturefragrance since 1996 . i've wearing it so long i don't even smell it anymore when i put it . little behind ears pulse point my neck i'm good go . never , ever i ever worn scent garnered more compliments than nude me . people love it me ! it just lovely , sexy fragrance . however , i would recommend , before buying it online if you've never worn it before , one should go department store try it first . get opinion your husband or boyfriend or good friends because fragrances tend smell differently different people . my sister plopped down $40 bottle nude years ago after smelling it me . her husband told her it smelled awful , lol ( now , mind you , he always complimented me when i it ) . she ended up giving it me going back what she used before .	1

i've tried many pheromones consider myself something " expert " . i'm not biochemist , so take this what it worth : androstenone pheromone which attract attention women , but only some women only when they're ovulating . so if you want one-night stand hookup , get something lot androstenone ( like pherone d-17x , which i'm also reviewing ) . problem androstenone it also quickly intimidating or turn women off if they're not ready it . so better choice product like m-11 which other pheromones " modulate " androstenone ( doesn't too much androstenone ) . this one turn women but doesn't scare them off . other hand , if you're all intimidating kind guy , what you really need my favorite one , v-5 , which no androstenone all . v-5 my every-day phero , i use m-11 going out clubs . it works me ! way , if you smell it means your using too much . some other companies make " odor free " pheromones . what really means they don't put much phero their products . so just use little bit . dab'll ya	1

these diapers fantastic ! i myself prefer cloth diapers , but because we high water table if we much laundry our septic backs up into our house - yuck ! i am also severely chemically sensitive so scent " normal " diapers even seventh generations ones gel make me ill . but these great !! they made wood pulp/paper feel if there cotton them . they no chemical scent all feel nice soft smooth my fingers . they close means adhesive strip either side closes onto larger piece thin plastic either side . if you accidentally close adhesive strip paper it tear when you pull it back off usually not reseal . this not problem if you use them only once . we potty our baby so sometimes we take it off put it back few times before it gets wet or dirty . other than accidentally sticking strips paper i haven't problem using them like this . there elastic legs but it basically encased so it isn't contact skin they snug enough my baby legs . these little harder tell if they wet than seventh generation ones ( i've never used regular diapers since i can't get near them their chemical scent ) because there isn't gel . i usually just put finger it then touch finger my thumb then i tell if i feel dampness or not . if my baby pees lot though it easy tell if it wet ... even outside because it look little more molded form , but not feel damp outside inside less damp even then than cloth diaper . packaging says you should not let baby put these his/her mouth since it paper tear off their mouth it should not held near flame - again because it made out paper . but all said , these not flimsy all , they well made hold up just well regular disposable . i highly recommend these anyone who whom cloth diapers just isn't possible or those times when impractical ( day care ) those people who want limit their baby exposures chemicals	1
we used our fsa balance two purifiers , other hunter quietflo . this rabbit air purifier great . house smells lot fresher . we dog two cats , my husband i suffer certain allergies , we live humid south - it amazing how much dust odor we breathing . this machine quiet easy use . sensors seem work very well - opening front or back door , dog walking past it , cooking smoke or odor - so i leave it auto most time . comparison , hunter quietflo ( 30119 ) lot less expensive , two filters , only one control knob . so far , it captured only smaller particle dust where rabbit air gets small larger particle dust some fur . " o-o zone " much better . i've tried purifier sharper image which not capture much only made air smell like ozone - gave me headaches ! i definitely recommend this brand room air purifier over others . it worth money	1

smooth , luxurious , smells great , provides close , great shave . amazing stuff . tub last many months if you use sparingingly brush . there nothing like waking up this stuff mornings . truly amazing smell , but most importantly , yields amazingly close , non-irritating shave . price this site rip-off .	1
i love how this scent very sweet girly -- you really can't go wrong it . my only con it it doesn't last very long -- only couple hours max . i spray it twice day sometimes . otherwise , it very worth money	1
not prettiest scale but deadly accurate . it delightful scale anyone might need put their glasses see their weight morning . this scale i ! much bigger than it looks online . it easy keep clean most important all it needs no battery . my parents health-o-meter over 30 years old it just accurate today it 1976 . reason i selected this product . i'm happy say they still build quality scale reward you when you exercise	1

this pedometer so much cheaper ( ~ $7 ) than typical decent ones ( go $18 - $20 ) .. now i know it reason .. buttons flimsy , package looks very cheap , one i bought presented senior citizen - not work , also found sr citizen found it very hard use buttons this little device .. terrible ergonomics/form factor . would recommend spending bit more getting omron/oregon sc $18 pedometers - much better form factor , high reliability quality	-1
ok , i'll admit , nail clippers rock . i no problem using them , they sharp , cut evenly perfect width . said , throw everything else out . bulb syringe useless , keep one you get hospital . get ear thermometer , it heck lot easier . spoon ... not even going there . med dropper isn't easy enough use . my suggestion ? go find syringe cork attachment . you take top off bottle , push cork attachment into opening . use , flip back attached lid put med syringe into opening , flip bottle over draw med into syringe . this best way it .	-1
it warms ok , not great . but worst thing , massage loud ! i work home , my basement , where it gets cold , thrilled get this keep my feet warm , excited get massage too . however , i can't use massage feature while i am phone - it way too loud . there no control heating element , just off . disappointment . i still use heat feature , but also wear thick socks	-1
i also heater mine go out after few short months . i really loved this machine though ! it actually blew air ! it nice safe switches unlike toggles most now . i one those previously my cats turned it while i gone almost burned place down . so anyway , i'm trying contact manufacturer , but i doubt it any good . too bad . loved it while it worked . hoped it fluke going order before i saw reviews	-1
i bought this straightener two times .. first time i it 8 months . my friend bought straightener i fell love , so i bought my own . first 8 months heaven . i straightened my hair all time . then , 8 months , one plates stopped working ! while i used it , but it took forever , didn't straighten my hair well all . i decided buy , thinking it just defect first . i bought other it didn't work nearly well i remembered ! fact , it stopped heating up all together within 3 months !! friend mine bought this same straightener it caused problems her well . we both decided against buying this one again , obviously , i would reccommend you , too . i heard newest conair straightener wonderful , comes two-year warranty , so i wouldn't pay again , if it same thing me this one . don't buy it ! unless , course , you enjoy ripped-off ..	-1

fine example how fickle or intimate ( i prefer word intimate ) scent each us . this one fragrance i not gotten like . received gift more than year ago , bottle still three-quarters . it `rich ' scent but i find it too confusing indescribable scent , not educing one word description like `sporty ' , `sexy ' , `alluring ' . i don't wear it very often but i don't recall single occasion `what fragrance you wearing ? ' this one . it just not my cup tea so definitely , if you're not familiar this scent beforehand ; not buy before trying it out department store day . why buy ? gift guy competing female currently your crosshairs . gift your boss - you know he coming mile away . you need gift guy who couldn't pour water out boot even if there instructions hee	-1

i'm more than satisfied this scale . i concerned i would buy more expensive scale get good accuracy ( see reviews other digital scales this price range , ) but i've tested it several times over several days , my weight varies 2 pounds or less over course day . my first weigh-in day pretty much same previous mornings , sadly . neutral color ( grey ) glass would blend well just any decor , lcd screen easy read , 1.5 inch high numbers . only thing i don't like it it creaks quite lot when i step it , even though i'm nowhere near its 330 pound maximum load . problem my head more than scale : i don't think it going break , but it sounds like i've got two people standing it once--i'm not fat , am i ? added feature when i'm craving , i go into bathroom look it , know it isn't going fall any my excuses tomorrow morning . so last piece cake still sits fridge . scale intimidated me into not eating it . accurate , easy read , easy eyes , intimidating -- i think it good deal	-1

everything advertized . love turbo feature speeds up heating process less than one minute	1
over years , i tried many different brands types heated rollers i never liked using any them . i recently bought new set which i return due fact i terrible time trying roll my hair almost smooth surface rollers then after clipping rolls , they would immediately fall out my hair .... scream ! i bought remmington #1080n wax core roller set i finally found easiest quickest way curl my hair . rollers surface , when warm , grab hair ends immediately allow great control when trying roll even short hair . rollers held place full clip which looks more like comb so clips not leave ridge my hair . once heated , rollers relatively cool touch ( no more burned fingers ) but due wax core , rollers hold plenty heat it takes just few minutes after setting produce excellent , long lasting results . set takes 10 - 15 minutes warm up . i've found warm up time takes longer than time i actually leave curlers my hair . this best curler set i ever used . if i ask one change , it would quicker warm up time . however , just fact rolling so quick easy , makes up few extra minutes preparation . i'm hard please , so my recommendation says alot . thanks remmington ( i still don't like your other regular rollers ! ha )	1

i drink lot bottled water . it not make me feel full - sometimes quite opposite . course , drinking water before or during meal lessens chance overeating , but effect skinny water goes beyond . i love its taste because it not overbearing too sweet like other citrus-flavored water i've tried . it replaces my soda curbes my apetite pretty well . i also bought bottle friend mine . he wondering why he wasn't getting hungry long time , only later realized it must skinny water . it costs quite bit . however , bunch drinks cost same negative impact your body . so , even if this placebo effect ( , fankly , i don't care long it works ) , i think it worth it . you'll judge yourself . i can't afford three bottles day , but buy this water sporadically , most likely my local 7-11 . i would like point out most people who wrote negative reviews here either didn't like taste water , or never tasted it first place . course some people don't like taste - you can't please everybody - but it bears no relevance its efectiveness ! people who review stuff without trying it ... well ... they obviously don't understand what review means , too bad their preconceptions count towards overall score product	1
i little skeptical when i first bought bodygroom , but i say it definitely worth money . first time i used it , it extremely comfortable easy , areas i shaved ended up almost smooth if i used razor . it easy clean recharges quickly . only drawback it doesn't work well after you've used it while . i'm not sure if it because blades dull quickly or if it just normal wear tear , but you just little more careful because it easier nick yourself when it worn little . overall , however , bodygroom great tool trimming keeping groin , chest , underarm areas smooth	-1

yes scott most popular bathroom tissue since time began -- but " bounty " bathroom tissue : but this std . form little roughthis " scott bathroom tissue " strong , very long lasting , terrific value . there , however , one rub -- it little rough this application , especially frequent usage [ which why they recently introduced " scott extra soft " product ] . " charmin ultra " would better choice if you need extra softness some store brands such kroger , shop-rite , wal-mart " great value " comparable value-specific picks . scott always considered " gold standard " bathroom , but its superiority challenged increasingly recent years . if you still like this product , there no reason change . however if your needs now require softer tissue , try " scott extra soft " or " charmin ultra " . i recently noticed other reviewers , glued end paper roll must pulled apart order start roll seems very hard detach . this seems new phenomenon leads me believe things changed scott not better . maybe it just fluke . maybe it no big deal . maybe scott bathroom tissue isn't quite good it used . maybe it rougher coarser than before . just maybe . meantime , however , i am now using " charmin ultra " after 40 years continuous scott patronage .

strengths : cheap ; sleek design ; wet shave ; retains charge long timeweaknesses : not come international voltage charger ; not very good hair necklinesummary : its price its really neat thing . braun points out , shaving wet skin not give close shave because skin swells when wet . so i dont prefer wet shave . yet feature good those who suffer rash or itch dry shave . it take bit getting-used-to dry shave . normally within 2-3 weeks most people adapt it . this one like most straight-head shavers not best around neckline you may need learn few tricks ur own get close shave around area . it retains its charge upto 5/6 shaves provided you shave least once 2 days course depending rate ur beard growth . it doesnt come any fancy accessories like stand brush like braun . but hey ... u paying half price	-1
my friend mary-anne given away many these razors because she thinks they so great . i recipient one mar then i went out bought extra travel recommending it all over place . no cuts your knees , convenient storage case sealed extra blades ( no rusting while waiting ) solid grip handle so it easy hold under running water . i know people think it pricy , but it comes extra blades lasts much longer than regular disposables . give it try	1
this well-blended , complex , layered fragrance . it quite heady going , you only need use very light spritz . it lasted all day without changing character . this probably because its parfum spray , not eau de toilette . this sized bottle should last long time . perfumes very subjective , but i really liked scent . you still smell lingering fragrance your skin after shower . its definitely classic style rather than contemporary - think chanel rather than lo or brittney . overall , i think its one best new perfumes out . i bought this direct amazon - great price , buying direct amazon i know i get real thing , not knock-off . i don't same confidence other online stores , whether they sell through amazon or not . i bought some well-known online perfume stores past sent imitations or old stock - ugh . it made me very cautious where i shop . some fakes obvious but other ones very clever you only detect imitation if you already familiar product	1
bought this replacement earlier rechargeable braun . fantastic . very close shave . 3 weeks one charge !	1

i personally am connoisseur energy drinks . i rely caffeine most my projects school late night coding sessions well marathon gaming . although energy drinks considered crutch , it lifestyle decision many , many people embrace rather than attempt avoid ... i am one these people . said , guru energy fairly cheap ( $1.25 usd/can ) if you buy it here off amazon , it comes redbull standard 8.3 fl/oz cans , shipped suprisingly lightweight compact case ( compare this monster , rockstar , or any other brand standard 16 fl/oz cans ) . taste , like guru website describes , very indescribable . it very sharp light medium amount carbonation . caffeine buzz more " natural " ... it more upslope downslope rather than sudden cracked out ( which arguably awesome too its own respect ) then big crash sort feeling . this because caffeine guru derived 125mg guaranine ( guarana herb ) rather than synthetically separated then added . there no mention how much 125mg guaranine real caffeine , but since red bull checks 80mg / 8.3 oz it seems guru pretty good shape . i think particular good feature guru it uses cane sugar rather than high fructose corn syrup . i appriciate good quality soda , particularly microbrew colas , they often exclusively contain cane sugar . so summary , this energy drink farily cheap , good buzz , all natural , great coding , gaming , or studying	1
i love it works great , one flaw .... when you change numbers leneghth you want it trim , well you like ( 1|3|4|6 ... ) so one time i left it 11 , but didnt realize i pushed it down ( top ) .... well it went 1 , i could see 1 line so i figured it fine , well guess what , i lost my beard lol ...... they could made it more user friendly , but once you screw up once you realize never it again . otherwise works great ! wish there catcher all trimmed hair :-) kosher	-1
got this my mom . she'd looking one these while very happy product	1
not painful i thought it would legs , just some slight prickling , like little pins , you definitely tell it working . i thought this two heads i wouldn't go over same area again again , but i , this major drawback . horrible bikini line , don't even think it , pain goes feeling like little prickles feeling like great tufts hair pulled out once , when it really only getting few ; it also seemed skip over my skin pinch me well , we all know you don't want pinched there . overall : recommended legs large areas where skin taut easily accessible , not buy this product hopes using it your bikini line- buy braun silk epil xelle instead .	1
excellent product cleaning your glasses or other lenses . they small enough carry around your pocket . they lift off dirt , fingerprints , etc . i recommend washing your cloths weekly hot water keep them completely clean . cloths not scratch , but debris left cloth scratch	1
good9170xlcc gives excellent shave 5 minutes . it'll take 2 weeks daily use your beard adjust razor heads , but after it close clean any blade shave . bad : 1 . it cheaply made . norelco outsourced manufacturing it shows . frame holding razor heads plastic ; every other norelco i've owned ( over 30 years ) metal . frame supported these weird plastic-bubble " shock absorbers " probably go year or two . shaver junky , cheap feel it . i always gotten 5-6 years use out my past norelcos ; this one feels like it'll last two years . 2 . cleaning tank marketing gimmick sell $[ ... ]/bottle cleaning solution . way overkill . it work ok , but shaver gets just clean if you rinse it under hot tap water ( which you anyway because cleaning solution leaves razor heads coated slimy residue ) . you pretty much throw it out after free bottle solution used up . 3 . i'm already my second unit . chip controls battery level indicator , recharging , etc . flakey . first one i never could accurately display battery level even after 3 complete charge-discharge-recharge cycles . it'd show 15-20 minutes remaining , then just die middle shave ; battery tapped out . also , it would sometimes illuminate no reason all ; turn on-off clear it . if it happened during night , battery would fully discharged morning . so i returned it amazon.com ( thx amazon great customer service !!! ) . second one they sent me recharges continuously when you use it cleaning tank -- it not supposed charge during 55-minute cleaning cycle , but mine . means you catch it 5 minutes into cycle , after it it dunking tank , or it'll recharge completely after every shave ( which instructions tell you not because it shortens battery life ) . more reason toss cleaning unit . ridiculous shaver this expensive they'd ship junk their customers before fixing these problems . 4 . travel case worthless protecting shaver road . it nothing but zippered nylon sack . you'll put shaver into something else if you pack it checked luggage or it'll pile parts when you unpack . 5 . they don't include stand so when you're shaving you lay it bathroom countertop . i'm using one my old norelco , but if you don't one , storage shaves just setting it down somewhere . sad see fine old company like norelco cheapening it flagship product like this . i've customer 30+ years , but next time i'm market shaver i definitely comparison-shop competition . two stars because it give good shave ; rest mess	-1
i left review 90 count device , which same device but more uses tip . zeno works me , like charm . trick i've noticed , zeno advocates , catch them when they're first starting arrive - before you see them , but you feel them . proactive it'll what it says , i guess most people . other reviewer here points out it says " most people " or " most acne " , if this loop hole . any device like this , most devices/tools general don't work everyone . some straightening irons damage one persons hair while making another sleek shiny . some hair growth therapies work some , not others . so it toss up . my guess if you random annoying pimples , but not something you'd consider acne problem , you catch these pimples before they really develop show , this device you	1

i've used schick quattro 3 years now happy it . i thought i would try out this powered m3 razor see what all hype . many my friends said they got best shave ever using it : no razor burn , bumps , or nicks etc . however , m3 gave me more razor burn nicks than any razor i've ever used ! could it i wasn't used mach 3 blades after using quattro years ? rule out blade differences , i subsequently tried power quattro obtained similar , albeit less drastic , negative results . particular , both m3 power quattro really number my neck area . i even people comment how abused my neck looked after shaving these two razors . both gillette schick assert vibrations diminish irritation lead superior shave . my case , i believe vibrations actually lead more irritation ! my personal experience these razors , my cynical nature , lead me believe vibrating razors just ploy shaving industry get people buy more product ( i.e. , aftershave creams lotions cover up mess such razors create ) . my advice avoid these powered hybrids alltogether stick regular quattro or mach 3 razor .	-1

i just looking way get rid calluses my feet , so i figured foot spa good start . i've read various reviews elsewhere foot spas , dr. scholl came up favorite , so i'd figure i'd try it . i'm not sure what people expect foot spas , but i liked this one lot . unit lot places hold it , which big deal if you want put water it move it where you get thing work . lot water very heavy , but you actually don't need much this unit . there lines interior amount , which probably few quarts mos t.t he unit plastic hood thing where touch-toe controls located . you turn it massage very nifty bubbles massager thing . interior where you place your feet all these nubby things it , where you little self-massage . there also spaces both foot recepticles where you place two different foot massage attachments . one raised cylinder spins when you rub your feet against it ; it looks like something like small hamster wheel . one , i didn't like because it so high you can't rest your feet all water . rubbing action didn't help all . there insert just nubs it , like nubs bottom foot spa . this much more comfortable , what nubs : good place rub soles your feet . i used peppermint foot bath additive okay ( this something i added ; it not included foot spa . ) additive okay , not something i'd pay again , but bad thing it it impeded my use bubble mechanism . everytime i hit , peppermint stuff foamed up ridiculously spilled out foot spa . that shame , because nicest thing this device bubble mechanism . it really pleasant sensation ( so next time , if i add anything foot bath , i'll make sure it non-foaming ! )you put hot water this . massage control also heat controller . it not , directions say , make cold water hot . it , however , keep hot water hotter longer . i used this 20 minutes first time around , very hot water i used still nicely warm when i through . cleaning this bit bear . blue shield houses control device helps keep water warm not removable . means you go slinging around inside device wash dry it . just nuisance , not enough turn me off this foot spa . cord sufficently long , it wraps around elevated feet unit storage . only other thing i'd mention when you wash it out , sure tip it almost upside down get rid water . thin blue strip runs down center each foot areas where bubbles come out ; seems hold quite bit water even after you're emptying it . just turn it over give it good shake , that'll take care it . all all , i'd recommend this . it pleasant , it works well , softened calluses easy me pumice off after 20-minute soak .	1
if you don't like getting attention , these not you . i'm often surprised people astonished reactions act putting them taking them off ; i'm so accustomed pulling them apart , i forget how unusual viewing public finds it . i wearing clics nearly year . i pretend i don't need glasses , but course i nearly decade . popped standard diopter lenses out , put my bifocal prescription . it worked great , despite warning my optical shop . ( even if they broken experiment , price right : i could try it again . ) previously i wearing glasses chain . besides various difficulties noted reviewer , i also found plastic loops connect chain arms glasses bad habit stretching . then glasses slip off chain inappropriate times frames break . i call color mine " magenta " - which may or may not same online " red " - i bought them shop (** gasp **) . my short hair not problem , but i agree reading bed doesn't work . so i use different pair those occasions	1

owned my fountain four months run it constantly since i purchased it , i not any problems it whatsoever . it clever design - three pillar candles appear " melting , " but drip water pillar pillar . flickering leds make soothing patterns walls just bright enough approximate candle-like glow . falling water sound beautiful no t-t oo-loud . i keep it nightstand next bed . still night , it might seem little loud first , but you get used it relatively quickly . when i company , they usually seem intrigued gentle flicker light against wall . i would definitely buy . pros :( 1 ) soothing . sounds looks nice . ( 2 ) acts natural humidifier . ( 3 ) avoids fire hazards while i sleep ( unlike real candle) ! caveat(s ): ( 1 ) it bit cheap . candles made plastic , base ( it seems ) all parts . ( 2 ) occasionally , pump bit loud . remedy : you may able dampen loudness reducing vibration pump . place soft cloth underneath your fountain , such doily or washcloth . i cut small piece plastic under cloth well , catch any water may splash out ruin varnish nightstand . ( 3 ) not enough " river rocks " included it . i like make mine look like it sitting pile stones all around base , not just front . remedy : purchase cheap bag tumbled stones arrange them yourself	-1

i love these glasses . they always there when i need them ... hanging around my neck ready me put them place . only problem i experienced related application i am using them ... my shop . i got 3.00 so i could good close up look when necessary . however , i've noticed when i'm actively working around project getting myself different positions related object my work , glasses often separate where magnets positioned bridge glasses causing me clear both hands tools or whatever them reconnect lenses . it exasperating , but you've got able see your work . this design flaw product clearly doesn't apply most people situation . some might argue my head just too big ! while i may big ego , my head actually slightly smaller than average . this problem could likely corrected manufacturer extending each temple one inch give glasses more room expand before breaking apart . but important thing you know i'd still buy these glasses all over again . they really terrific	-1

not buy this pedometer ! not only it not work , but design horrible . there absolutely nothing intuitive how operate many functions sound so great , but completely hidden behind weird button combinations such : press twice , touch your nose , press once , wait two seconds , skip garbage throw this horrible product fast you . after attempting wear it first day spending lots time figuring out their user guide - written something other than understandable english - noon , it completely stopped working . most horrible thing , i sent their customer service department email explaining such - instructed their website they never even bothered respond . don't encourage this company until they get their act together . then i realized one my kid toys - super man computer - made oregon scientific also . it works but weird interface also very few functions after you figure it out . great packaging sales job though ! this company all marketing no scientific ! they clearly no usability experts !	-1

any dental health professional attest , flossing one teeth just important brushing , perhaps more so , bacteria causes gum disease ( certain extent cavities ) almost always starts teeth . daily flossing breaks up film harmful bacteria allows it removed . therefore , dentist , i am always stressing importance daily flosing my patients . my advice this : 1 . choose floss comfortable you right thickness your teeth . some people prefer floss holders rather than wrapping floss around fingers , while others prefer thin flavored floss waxed thick floss . there so many options - choose right one you . 2 . waxed floss " waxed " allow easier passage teeth . waxed floss no more effective than unwaxed removing bacterial film build-up . important thing floss ! 3 . floss once daily , preferably before brushing . flossing breaks up film bacteria teeth areas toothbrush cannot reach . it important then brush teeth rinse teeth remove film bacteria flossing dislodged . without brushing or rinsing after flossing , bacteria reattach teeth . 4 . try tie flossing habit , such watching 10 pm news . i know it sounds strange , but incorporating flossing into habit leads one into developing new habit . some complain they don't time floss ; well , if flossing tied into habit , such watching tv , both easily concurrently . 5 . there many gimmicks manufacturers use sell their particular brand floss . some flavor floss , some incorporate fluoride into strands floss , some make their floss more slippery folks tight contacts . whatever case , most important point choose floss variety you use regularly . it mechanical act removing bacterial flim important part , not flavoring or chemical additions floss . 6 . if you want keep your teeth life-time , develop flossing habit . one wise sage said : " if you ignore your teeth , they eventually go away " . i recommend this product because it effective relatively easy use . i found it tends shred more than regular floss , this bothers me bit so i not use it regularly . i like mint flavor fluoride cannot hurt either . all all , it good product . jim " konedog " koenig , dds	-1

although this sunscreen not pasty white look like some other zinc-oxide sunscreens , it greasy , slippery shiny , plus it stings if you get it your eyes . not good sunscreen face . blue lizard sensitive sunscreen better choice my opinion , but trade off sensitive sunscreen ( which zinc oxide titanium dioxide ) pasty look . i planned use this sunscreen surfing running but i wouldn't recommend it those or similar activities	-1

i am 27 year old male caucasian struggling shaving my face many years . using razor i would always get bumps irritated skin . period , i even decided not shave anymore let my beard grow trim it electric razor . my girlfriend doesn't like look . i finally discovered barc bump down relief after only few applications i already solved problem . no more razor bumps nor irritation ! my face much smoother now after shaving , especially area around my neck , where skin more sensitive . i apply very small quantity barc moisturizer also after shave . barc gives pleasant stinging feeling when you apply it freshly shaved skin , which i later learned caused alpha hydroxy acid . aha acts exfoliant leaves my skin very smooth . i also noticed while i don't get ingrown hair anymore either . so here little secret : i gave barc my girlfriend try it after she shaves or waxes . she loves it ! she now regular user too . i strongly recommend barc , men ... women	1
finish not very smooth or fully blended . it doesn't live up its claim 14 hour moisturization either ( similar sunscreens other brands don't moisturize well , but they don't claim moisturize begin ) . so better apply moisturizer first then this sunscreen . however , it cheapest complete spectrum sunscreen sensitive skin . if you wanna pay nicer finish , go olay complete defense spf 30 sensitive skin ; or better protection 9.1% titanium oxide , go neutrogena spf 30 sunblock lotion sensitive skin . neutrogena one leaves even whiter finish though	-1

so far , this scale fairly good . it gave weights pretty close what other electronic scales gave ( . 5lb increment this scale precise enough , those you wanting . 2lb increment ) . my body fat measurements fairly consistent , it not varying more than 1% day day . but !!! main suspicion i this scale it seems " lazy " weight measurement change . what i mean ? let say , example , you weight yourself scale says 154lbs . if you step off , take off jacket u know weights 1.5 lbs , step scale again , scale show you still weight 154lbs . but ! here when it gets interesting , i suspected scale might ' shor t-t erm ' memory built into its eletronics simply go back most recently measured weight if difference weight small enough . so , i weighted myself , say , 154 , then made scale go some other weight , say 130 , then take off my jacket weight myself again , guess what ? i now get 152.5 lbs . so , summary , pretty precise good scale , but some reason , its designers decided build ' cheat ' like just give illusion it even more precise	-1

i saw commercial , i read reviews - so i bough one box walmart . it not worth it , that my conclusion . trays made very thin plastic-like material , very difficult position properly your teeth . active gel easy goes out trays , fills your mouth . during first couple od uses , after 20 min or so i started feel vague pain my gum . nevertheless , i continued using product all 7 days , advertised , 30 min day . after whole package gone , change color my teeth barely visible . i hope you better luck .	-1
i really like my electric toothbrush oralb so i thought i would like this too . however , it just doesn't work . cartridges they set up don't work because soon you tug them all , floss becomes loose therefore won't vibrate - it only vibrates if it taut . but because way they cartridges set up , there no way make it taut again . it would worked if instead they used roll floss let you feed it through yourself needed , but they too greedy wanted sell lots cartridges . this would ok if you got lots use out cartridges , but my experience they broke halfway through single use . so ... forget it	1

there so many different sites all tell you ' they ' best absorbed coenzyme q10 manufactured . it hard know who really telling absolute truth or just propagandizing product quick sale . we born extremely high levels coenzyme q10 then it gets slowly used up years pass even if we actually eat foods resupply our bodies . who purposefully eats these foods coenzyme q10 content ? mitochondria every single cell our body needs this coenzyme production energy . time we over 40 , our levels dropped significantly our energy levels dropped it . i must admit this nature made product not seem increase my energy level like other company coenzyme q10 . so , my own reaction this product , i not recommend this particular coenzyme q10 . there several other companies make excellent , effective products ( like dr. whitaker dr. sinatra dr. william ) but not this nature made product	-1

my wife high bp , so we got this model . reasons choosing this model : 1 . upper arm monitors supposed more accurate2 . it cheaper than fully automatic models3 . omron seems one better/best brands . 4 . supposedly , pumps fully automatic models prone breaking . unit appears well built ( including hand pump ) . it easy operate , it seems very accurate . we checked its readings fully manual unit we home , automatic unit drug store . we find it takes very accurate consistent readings . people physical limitations might find hand pump inconvenient . also , people big arm might need buy larger cuff . i'm overweight right now , so cuff barely fits my arm , but fits my wife nicely ( it bought her )	1

this well-made device useful , though limited , value . it usefulness derives its consistency , which amazing . given your body composition varies throughout day , particularly your level hydration , omron measurements vary only fractions percent - exactly what you would expect . it measures small electric currents running one electrode , through your body , second electrode . omron programmed estimate your body fat measuring impedance your body flow electricity . so , one might think such measurement would straightforward , like weight scale . electricity encounters fat , muscle , bone , fluids omron interprets current displays your body fat percent . right ? after all , when you step scale , scale responds showing your weight . you don't need tell scale whether you think you athlete or how old you . it simply measures your weight . well , omron doesn't work way , nor other similar devices , nor skin-fold calipers . it looks me though electrical skin-fold devices all simply measure surface body fat . then they require you input other data , such your activity level ( " normal " or " athlete " omron case ) age . this not good because it introduces general population averages into what should specific measurements you . instance , regardless your body , it assumed older you , more internal fat you . resulting body fat estimates dramatically different when factoring those variables . omron ( calipers ) still useful , though , if you consider it compass rather than scale . you can't sure it tell you where you , but , over time , it tell you where you going .	1

i tried several " energy bars " found hooah best doing what it says it , give me steady energy . most other energy bars i tried , pick me up then knock me down few hours later . i feel confident feeding them my family too . my 8 year old son races motocross eats one before each moto . my daughter eats one before cheering football games before her 4 hours dance lessons . my husband , contractor/builder , eats one before hectic work day . i keep up all them sometimes don't time breakfast or lunch , i just grab hooah bar i am set . they like bread milk our house , if we out , everyone mad mom . since we several friends family members armed forces , we also like fact portion each sale goes military . thanks hooah !	1

i never eaten luna bar before i made this purchase , so i expectations not even close fufilled . when i read " chocolate pecan pie " .. i expected just .. taste rich chocolate , nutty pecans gooey sugary base . what i received bar little taste , nothing all similar name bar . my opinion , bar edible if you no expectations it ... flavor barely there . bar dry . it never again my " purchase " list	-1
this high powered toothbrush helps you brush better . however , it not magic . you still know " how brush . " it also much more messy , using this kind toothbrush , but dental hygenists strongly recommend them	1
first shave seemed good ; but second time me fusion . instead just one nick , i managed around 3 or 4 nicks once . but looking cost replacement cartridges enough shock look cheaper alternative shaving . i purchased merkur futur german made adjustable safety razor it only costs 40 cents or less each merkur razor blade they alot sharper ! merkur heavy duty safety razor supposed great beginners safety razor also highly rated ! one even get 100 blade bulk packs derby extra double edge blades merkur ebay which average just around 16 cents or less apiece . sensor more practical me ! my opinion , gillette must think we all willing pay high prices these fusion blades new modern 4 bladed shave . lately , there seems trend more men going back good old fashioned shave using double edge safety razor ! i wonder why ?	-1
i offered one these while cycling thought it very tasty . so good , fact , when i got home i went straight web site show back wrapper learn where i could buy them . just above web address nutrition ingredients list . probably mistake manufacturer part it gives you something read while site comes up . oops ! this bar whooping 25% your daily allowance saturated fat ! not only , but fat palm oil . this might acceptable soldier involved prolonged strenuous activity but i doubt cardiologist would recomend it most us . commercially formulated product more likely fill average person need lower fat ( healthier fat ) energy bar , than one formulated extreme physical activity , sold profit marketed patriotic tribute troops . bottom line : read label , weigh health risks if you want support troops , there better way than eating hooah bars .	1
i finally found product works me , after trying too many other products . i tried magic shave powder but couldn't use it no more than once month ( damn thing reeked , too ) . if i didn't get all hairs , i'd toast . i would use razor finish job , which defeated purpose not getting ingrown hairs . i tried magic shave creamer , didn't work either . i would get most my beard , but if there anything left over , i'd same position use razor finish . i tried norelco ( received christmas ) but couldn't deal my hairs pulled ( ouch !! ) . i bought beard trimmer wahl cut my beard skin , then used magic shave razor . it worked but still got razor bumps ( not bad ) sometimes bled . i vacationing florida my friends who visited his sister brother-in-law . his brother-in-law happened neighborhood barber , he used this razor my face . i got so enamored , went i got back i went online bought it immediately . since i know my face very well , i realized i only use this shaver most twice week . i used this since february 2006 , it wonderful . i give it four stars because , even though it works like product says , i get little bump here there . all all , i recommend this product men suffers in-grown hairs . please note , after reading other reviews , usage individualized . other words , know what your limits terms how many times you use shaver . you might able use it daily or weekly	1

i've tried lot energy bars this best tasting . i am however partial peanut butter . cliff bars my favorite , but these taste much better bit crisp them . cliff bar dry tasting comparison . i would given this bar 5 stars it not used palm oil . this ups saturated fat , which i need watch . corn surup not best thing ingesting either but since i am working out burning it off its proabably not problem . this bar lowest sat . fat ( 2g , 10%rda ) than their other two bars most potasium . later important me because it may help ward off my leg cramps . i agree vitamins probably marketing ploy - after all , anyone who exersizes regularly probably takes multivitamin . i'd give it 4-1/2 stars if i could .	1

i got this model free full trimmer set , it silver when included set . i original silver one two years before it finally died after extensive use - not bad lifespan free item . battery cover held place flimsy plastic tab if you drop it floor it break . i this issue , which i solved taping cover place it didn't bother me all . this black unit comes accesories which free ones not include - 3 length adjusters , brush , comb some oil . thing i like this model you use just clipper part right up against your skin it not pinch you unless you careless . i bought remington model it cut without spacer . attachements only needed wahl length variations . despite it slight cheapness , it price performance make it worth it ; best trimmer i ever used far	1

my first impression this heating pad , " great ! " it large enough wrap around sore shoulder well down back , it nice controls four heat settings , turns off after hour or so ( safety ) . unfortunately , it only 3 weeks before it stopped working . i exchanged it unit ( thought maybe it fluke ) . replacement lasted two months almost daily use , then died . it appears controller simply burns out . i would not recommend this heating pad	-1

okay , let see if i write this review so not offend amazon fastidious editors ... guys , if you want plug-in massager please your wife or girl friend , hitachi magic wand what you need . however -- gals , if you want plug-in massager please your husband or boy friend -- panasonic ev2510k one ! why ? because panasonic more powerful than hitachi , its hard plastic roller head better suited man , um , contours . addition , panasonic quiet causes no video interference , selling point case you augment your " massage " sessions some video stimulation ... only reason i don't give panasonic five stars previous " panabrators " proven less than reliable ; typically they seem last year before they conk out . still , get ev2510k , you'll most enjoyable year	1

i little worried this one , based price , but it worth it . yes , epilator painful , so if you don't want pain then don't buy one . you won't get completely smooth skin right away , it'll take more than one session over course few weeks , but hair you remove won't come back thick or densely . i recommend using skin guard if you're doing your underarms , since skin more sensitive there	1

i recently started using phytobase hoodia delite shakes every morning breakfast . i shakes almost month now not gotten tired them , all . i believe hoodia gordonii really work supress appetite . feeling hungry all time obsticle me past . after using these shakes few days , i felt less less hungry each day . now , i no problem getting through day without nagging hunger pangs . taste fantastic . it mixed milk or water . i usually mix it fat-free organic milk i like add frozen berries . frozen berries add little more sweetness make mix thick creamy . best thing mix how many vitamins minerals it . it 50% or more almost everything . i definitely difference since i started these dailies . i more energy less fatigue . my biggest complaint price . it around $30 18 servings . 3x cost similar products , such slim fast . advantage phytobase product it low calorie , sugar free made organic ingredients . i think when you compare benefits phytobase commercial products , like slim fast , phytobase ends up coming out ahead worth cost . still , i would like see price come down $10 . overall , i like this product . if you don't mind spending extra money , i think it worth it	1

schick top name razors overall but it also always lead competition its silk effects razor . while silk effects still demand , schick came out quattro women , probably compete gilette venus , this " newer " razor lives up its competition many ways . women using their husbands ' razors ages because they shave more accurately more precision so it only makes sense simply modify man razor fit woman , which exactly what schick this produc t.t his razor even feels like it something more substantial than your basic woman razor because one its main elements : metal . unlike other plastic razors , this razor feels ( looks ) much more substantial , perhaps because it feels tougher heavier ; it not razor i would readily throw away - nor would i want both razor replacement blades cost quite bit even if prices par other leading razors . it feels more like man razor . , one might argue it but even elements regular quattro considered improvement over regular female razors . both quattro quattro women boast 4 precise blades , metal handle which might actually help shaving accuracy , comfort grips . quattro women gives us something little more . obviously , it " feminized " changing colour black pink but this razor also pivoting head make shaving feminine curves easier conditioning strip . enough advertising , though . this good razor . if it not #1 market then it #2 without doubt good reason . i shave many parts my body i always get least good shave , if not better , quattro . i find this razor works best certain parts my body , however , i not giving up my venus anytime soon . while i get good shave my legs underarms , i prefer use this razor my bikini line bikini area . i find areas prone razor bumps rash shave much more nicely not become irritated my quattro but areas shaved fine my venus , not seem shave smoothly quattro . this blade seems dull fairly easily well , though perhaps it because i tend use it more dense hair . you really cannot stretch it out " just one more " shave . when it dulls , razor bumps irritation increase almost exponentially , more than once , numerous blades " tugged " my hair skin . there other elements quattro worth discussing than just quality shave , however . this razor comes handy , compact suction cup holder stick your shower wall or door . although sometimes it seems fall , it usually holds up well quite improvement over bulky holder venus . nevertheless , this holder not any place store your extra razor blades . furthermore , you wouldn't want store your blades your shower case they , those sleek it , not entirely enclosed moisture deteriorate moisture strips blades . therefore , if you're like me remember you need change your blade only once you shower , you'll jump out shower it . however , my complaints really not overshadow this quality product . it still top line , since i purchased it , i extremely pleased quality though i still continue use my venus some parts my body	1
