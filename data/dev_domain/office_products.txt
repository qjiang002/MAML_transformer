while history cool , extent which everyone drinks kool-aid gobbles it up bit startling me . i suppose those people who still care enough physical writing experience pen paper might more inclined romanticize it ( other words , not only great notebooks , see below , but also smart marketing , more power them ) . i also enjoy writing , but respect little 3.5 " 5 " books , purely practical level , i like these simply because there very few notebooks out there provide such high quality writing experience such small volume space . little ( 3.5 " 5 " ) softcover almost ideal shoving your back pocket carrying everywhere , nice , high quality paper . covers durable smooth enough still work well even after acquiring some " character " your back pocket ( ie they actually mold your [ ... ] bit ! ) . i haven't tried fountain pen it ; although i enjoy writing them , i wouldn't use one this application anyway . these little books not really writing great american novel ( or great novel your country origin ) , they're more jotting notes or to-do lists , they work extremely well this role . only reason i withhold one star lack feature would make them completely perfect me ; pen attachment/enclosure provision . my ideal book would able accomodate thin pen spine , so book could slid into my pocket easily no fear snagging or worry whether i remembered " click " pen retract it . i realize this would make it bit bulkier , though . it , my leading pen choices this fisher space pen or zebra g-301 medium point gel retractable , former very , very short ( but bit thicker ) when capped , latter very nice skinny , but longer . anyway , these notebooks pleasure use , though bit costly , how long they last me pleasure ( utter utility ) i get using them , they seem like " reasonable extravagance " me . i'll go through many , many these before i spend what i would cheapest pda	1
