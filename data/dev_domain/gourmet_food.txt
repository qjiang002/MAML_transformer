my first culinary memory involves surreptitious finger dip into marmite jar age three ; it first food i remember really loving . ever since then i difficulty getting enough it . not everyone reacts it same way . some imagine it looks too much like axle grease . others complain it smells too much like beer left overnight go bad . these facts suggest one might only serve it close friends only when there some alternatives . any case , marmite claim " love it or hate it " quite apropos . it rarely evokes neutral reaction . best preparation i think mix it thoroughly butter . one part marmite two or three parts butter . then spread thinly toast . served this way , primary flavor marmite salt . then there subtle meaty flavor sometimes called umami - it flavor present well browned mushrooms or red meat . label suggests it might put excellent use soup stocks substitute or supplement caramelized roasted vegetables - onions carrots . nutritional value , even spread thinly it dynamite . those who fall hopelessly its charms may find themselves consuming mega-doses few crucial vitamins . it exceptionally rich source b12 , folicin , b6 . since it free animal products it ideal food include vegan diet which normally falls short delivering b12 .	1

easy sprouter great vertical sprouter . seeds or beans go into inner cup drainage holes . inner cup sets outer cup which catches any dripping water still allows air circulation around inner cup all sides . maintaining your growing sprouts ( most seed types ) means holding inner cup under running water least thirty seconds , allowing excess water drain off , setting inner cup back outer cup . doing this two or three times day makes sure growing sprouts remain fresh enough avoid spoiling , moist enough not dry out , but never remaining standing water . most seeds need pre-soaked initially , this step managed directly easy sprouter . there three lids : two lock into place - one air holes , one without . third domed , but doesn't actually lock onto cup . comparison , sprouting canning jars requires jar filled emptied several times each rinsing , draining sufficiently not always easy . sprout master , which sprouting tray i love , allows similar rinsing , but seeds must soaked different container then transfered sprout master . sprout master allows growing plants slightly more light because it width rather than height , but difference slight . i've mostly used my easy sprouter leafy sprout salad mixes ( alfalfa , clover , etc ... ) these varieties take week grow . variety lids sprouter it very flexible . i haven't tried sprout while traveling , but i'm confident it would work well . it works storing your grown sprouts fridge advertised , but i usually take them out sprouter break up clumps before serving put any left-overs into different container . i use my easy sprouter nearly constantly , my sprout master mini trays . i currently second easy sprouter order	1

only refined sugar this brownie mix chocolate chips ; otherwise , it naturally sweetened . it easier put together than mundane supermarket brands : add one egg , butter or oil ( or applesauce , if you're oil-free person ) , little water . throw it 350-degree oven 20 minutes . that it . i'm active home cook rather intense one ( we make our own vanilla , roast our own coffee beans ) , so it no surprise i'd say results aren't good homemade . but they _very_ good . i could put mix together innings while watching baseball game . how _that_ easy ? i'll making this mix again	1

**** tazo decaffeinated chai black tea enjoyable chai experience most part . paper tea packet , tazo writes , " rich blend full-flavored naturally decaffeinated teas exotic aromatic spices . " their web site , tazo describes flavor profile decaffeinated chai " creamy , vanilla , sweet pungent spices " . tazo describes aroma " sweet spice " . those pretty accurate . black tea " blend " little bitter , though , even minimal brewing . it real trick get it brew long enough get experience flavor spices without tea turn bitter . ingredients decaffeinated chai : naturally decaffeinated black teas , rooibos , cinnamon , ginger , cardamom , chicory , cloves , black pepper , natural flavors , star anise . it caffeine-free ! tazo interesting company makes only super premium teas . they socially responsible , based portland , motto , " reincarnation tea " . tazo owned starbucks . their web site fun quirky , zen-type focus , definitely worth checking out . it unclear , though , their web site , how many their ingredients organic or kosher , they use some " natural flavors " their teas -- this wording seems little vague super premium tea . i would rate this tea , tazo general , good --- better than premium teas like stash or celestial seasonings --- but not good numi . i'm soooooo spoiled numi teas , which why tazo decaffeinated chai gets only four stars . ***	1
if you like it hot then this you . warning : only gods handle this substance . you lesser beings , just add it recipes :)	1
i've buying these freeze dried strawberries several months use them mainly my cereal . they delicious consistantly high quality . i only one what seemed like excessive strawberry " powder " bottom .	1

pico-balla very subtle candy -- you find yourself eating large amount it if you don't pay too much attention . different colors each differently flavored , you eat this chewy treat slowly or quickly . i like bite off outer layer first then eat inside , but my wife eats inside part first . just very different candy what we used -- it doesn't taste overly " sugary " , won't feel like you greasing your mouth fructose , etc ... give it try . i wish i bought two boxes . i wish amazon offered balla-balla , too . i can't wait try sometime , but i would rather wait until i get it good price . amazon price 66% world market price , even less what online candy stores sell it . take chance it .	1
this best candy i ever . my aunt gave everybody christmas this candy red box , what great gift . it doesn't help my atkins diet , but i've got my chocolate	1
this delicious basic thai yellow curry , some vegetables . it comes little pouch cooked rice soak up sauce balance meal , but i still found this meal , i really crave some chicken or some heartier addition like paneer cheese cubes , nuts , or eggplant . i don't any thai places my area , so i add some chicken pine nuts round it out it really helps thai craving . sauce delicious veggies crisp	1
this sauce medium heat everyday use . it excellent roasted pepper flavor , there * no vinegar * get way . consequently , you get exactly what one should expect pepper sauce ... versatility flavor not try smother character food you season it . every-day sauce should not leave patina your tongue . this not boutique novelty , it household staple . 32 oz . size right size hot sauce household . you want good ? try tapatio cottage cheese . you'll never eat cottage cheese any other way again , i promise . i use it just anything except cereal ice cream , but my personal favorite applications tapatio : eggspotatoespizzaanything creole ( forget tabasco ! )cottage cheesemost ricemac cheeseand course ... mexin my opinion , this best sauce your local grocery store	1
my husband , non-celiac , eat this pancake mix ( make waffles ) all time . recipe calls egg whites beaten until stiff , so it bit more work than many other mixes . but , it worth it ! result tastes like * real * waffles . kinnikinnick mix also makes good tasting waffles , but texture isn't nice	1
sure , it not 100% pure vanilla extract . that indicated quite clearly ingredients . molina vanilla made mixture pure vanilla extract synthetic vanillin . personally i love its strong distinctive flavor , regardless what percentage pure vanilla extract it . those who feel it too strong , use half amount listed recipe . i know couple people who this when using molina vanilla . again , i like flavor , so i use full amount called recipe . this stuff great flavor really kicks things up notch	1

stella d'ora fudge cookies best dessert i could find my lunchbox growing up . its crisp cookie fudgie middle perfect milk or hot tea . many times i would eat cookie part save fudge center last test my patience because there nothing like eating chocolate . stella d'ora brand common nyc grocery stores ( throughout nj ) , so everytime i would visit relatives there i would buy breakfast cookies , annisettes , fudge cookies . i seen breadsticks nc but nothing else so its so nice find amazon them . stela d'ora always seemed so refined since they italian adults who liked little treat their coffee or cappucinos . my father used dunk his cookies coffee they would become warm gooey , while i preferred them crisp milk . either way , try package this some other biscuits . they really unbelievably good .	1
