there now no trace delight left this band . all songs either moderately slow somewhat self-indulgent or frightfully slow quite self-indulgent . i love this band pronounce praises upon them whenever i receive doe-eyed look saying their name , but this cd cd previous ( which 1 tune , " apples , " which one could smile ) , first time , take away any anticipation their next collection chopfallen tunes . first , we loose roses , then ned disband , following , swervedriver breaks apart velocity girl gone forevermore . now my charlatans become charlatans great band they once .	-1
i want this guy succeed so badly , yet he just couldn't pull it off . his voice great sound it , pleasant ears , yet his interpretation just not there . his phrasing very lazy boring most times . it seemed like he didn't know where start next word . he also sounded out breath . he sounded so out breath i started gasping air ... i stop listening . add , john vibrato sounded washed out faded places where it needed stronger . i truly hope age experience he improves . there no reason why he should not . he not catagory buble ' or connick jr. yet .	-1

i bought this soundtrack 1984 when movie adaptation george orwell book came out , simply because it attached movie . i'll try not use any non-family words here , but this soundtrack sucks . muldowney original score available cd , simply imagining it used intended adds whole new dimension movie . far this soundtrack goes , though ; skip it	-1
she doesn't sing ... she yells !!! using one ednita songs she " lo que son las cosas " just sacrilege its " best " ( or worst ) . it really easy hit it big your first single when song already classic itself . she absolutely nothing beyonce or cristina aguilera . her cd just plain bad ! if you want hear good music latin women beautiful powerful voices ( actually sing ) , you might want look la lupe , celia cruz , ednita nazario lucecita benitez ... these only ones i remembered moment	-1
i love every track ne-yo cd " my own words ! " next let me thank ne-yo bringing true rb back industry ! i dont consider songs cheating your bf/gf/husband/wife rb . rb supposed love - thats why people call them slow love songs . 2001 - 2005 new slow love songs didn't exist . i ended up listenin same songs da 90 over over until i got so tired them , fortunate lucky enough my radio station ( plays mostly rap : genre music i dont like ) play " so sick " ne-yo . it great song . this literally first only rb album i never urge use fast forward feature get next song ! ne-yo lyrics strictly romantic sweet too ! he lyrical genius . his voice soothing melodic . most rb albums obviously rap tracks or rushed rb songs filler probably meet deadline or get cd out fast possible reducing enjoyability cd , but this album all songs great . all tracks this album great , but here ones superb : 1 . so sick - 9/10 ( would 10 if it wasn't played over over so many different versions . although i still listen it over over2 . when you're mad - 9/10 ( those guys who like look girls faces when they get mad . maybe michelle rodriguez fans . :) ) 3 . get down like 10/10 ( both versions ) ( i call it " dont get down like " ) ( this song guys completely faithful like me ) ( if you're not player , proud faithful , this da song you)4 . sexy love - 10/10 ( great song . um hmmm .. what i say this one its lyrics ?.... oh yes .... this song guys who girl when she touches them , it just feels like .... magic . ) this da only cd dat ever deserved 5 stars me , only reason i gave other rb albums 5 stars cuz i took into consideration : there no rb album existed nothing but good tracks , most poorly upbeat song	1
unless you frequented jazz clubs baltimore or philly fall 1955 , this would your first exposure miles davis-john coltrane collaboration ( few tracks recorded columbia , label miles would soon joining exclusively , few weeks before this session weren't issued until much later ) . davis settled coltrane his replacement departing sonny rollins almost default - no one else fit bill or new book . they would stay together long seemed unlikely because their temperaments differed so much ( davis hands-off leader , coltrane wanted constant input miles his playing music general ) . stablemates ( benny golson tune ) track seems draw most attention . it excellent composition , although coltrane sounds somewhat tentative ( nervous ? ) , performance attractive . but my favorite side there no greater love , even though coltrane sits this one out : miles plays beautifully , i love emotion he wrings tune . true , this early effort group would transform modern jazz , but it very good session nonetheless . group plays well , rhythm section rock solid , they all off running . full speed ahead	1

deutsche grammophon united all abbado mendelssohn recordings london symphony orchestra this inexpensive 4 cd set . without question , abbado mendelsson symphony cycle , recorded mid 1980 , remains among best . highlights include splendid performances 2nd , 4th 5th symphonies , others almost fine , abbado opting brisk tempi emphasizing scores ' broad orchestral textures . splendid surprise inclusion orchestrated version scherzo minor octet ( opus 20 ) , which mendelssohn regarded alternative 3rd movement his first full-fledged symphony ( symphony no . 1 minor , opus 11 . ) . other works included this compilation include all mendelssohn overtures , most notably quot ; hebridesquot ; ( opus 26 ) , overture shakespeare quot ; midsummer night dreamquot ; ( opus 21 ) . sound quality quite superb , though may bit dry comparison recordings made vienna philharmonic concert hall . avid fans abbado mendelssohn music surely want acquire this collection	1

my first exposure general public came 1984 . i listening original wktu radio new york city this song called " tenderness " came then . time , this radio station " disco/dance " radio station new york . what i distinctly remember this station it very different song than dance numbers typically played this station . nonetheless , this song caught my attention well attention many other fans . it turns out this true " crossover " song group general public . it part collection ten songs could easily fall into " crossover " 80s/techno-pop category general public debut album " all rage " . mid 1980s , term " supergroup " became very popular . supergroup basically group or project whose primary members other successful bands . two most common supergroups power station mike + mechanics . before either or these supergroups , there supergroup called general public . when english beat disbanded , vocalists dave wakeling ranking roger decided form new band . they recruited keyboardist micky billingham drummer andy " stoker " growcott dexy midnight runners . also recruited bassist horace painter ( " specials " ) guitarist kevin white . both english beat dexy midnight runners produced most unique 80s pop sound almost become synonymous decade itself . make no mistake this , sounds both these groups alive well this " alliance " . lot ways formation this alliance results so much more than " 80s music " . here quick synopsis album song song : " hot you're cool " : this might not deepest song terms lyrics , but there lot more than just 80s sound this particular track . there some terrific saxophone work makes melody so terrific . " tenderness " : this signature song group . there lot reasons this became signature song . you hear wakeling roger trademark vocals , - but you hear contributions just everyone band . i think billingham keyboards , painter bass , white guitar deserve lot credit . justine carpenter background vocals ( i.e. " where ... " ) make this song so special . mentioned above , this crossover song - although i see it more dance song . " anxious " : although not strongest track , here track breaks 80s mold . this song features brass section some trumpet trombone helps distinguish it many other 80s tracks . " never you " : this second single released this album . here song definitely walks tightrope rock dance music . this pretty good track more you hear it , more you want hear it . " burning bright " : this second best song behind " tenderness " . i am very surprised this song didn't get more airplay . this song opens some outstanding guitar light keyboard overtone . " stoker "' drumming strongest this track . there 1 minute introduction . this isn't much 80s techno-pop track others , but much more progressive rock sound . this song lines " moscow monterey maine mexico " printed back cd . " matter fact " : i don't think this strongest track , but it isn't bad track . this song moves back toward techno-pop sound much more dance music feel it . " stoker " shines here again some nice drum work here . " you leading me " : lyric melody standpoint - this song starts out classic 80s techno-pop feel it . 90 seconds into song there terrific reggae sequence nice change pace . general public finds great way integrate reggae into song they switch gears flawlessly . " day day " also starts classic 80s feel it . unlike " you leading me " , it doesn't switch gears . it sticks classic 80s feel . i would say this weakest track collection . " where line " : terrific mix 80s music carribean twist . this very catchy song one good dance floors . vocals top form once again horns find their way into track . " general public " : i think its great when group names after song after themselves ( or names group after song ) . this song perfect wrap-up song . it mix some theatrical qualities very european sound . this song too pretty catchy . liner notes contain all lyrics all songs . all participating musicians listed credits well some production credits . one drawback liner notes lyrics credits put into 6 thin columns per page . result small fonts very difficult read . following this debut album , general public subsequent albums would never achieve success this debut album both commercial or critical standpoint . much this due fact late 80s early 90s , music landscape would change move away synth-pop more natural rock sound . however , this more than just 80s album - there some real talent this collection . you get so much more than song " tenderness " . i highly recommend this collection	1
i'm big fan bowie , iggy , . rex other bands glam/early punk era . this album provides perfect mix those genres . it really hard listen this album not hear how their influence spread lot bands would proceed them . there really isn't anything i say this album hasn't said already . if you like bands i mentioned above , this must addition your collection	1
i'm long time belle sebastian fan , i've listening them since tigermilk , i just cannot get enough this album . it my favourite album theirs date , it also very best album i've heard so far this year . it takes all elements made this band so wonderful over years : witty lyrics , bacharach-esque melodies ; but there new sense humor fun , even some funky 70 glam rock swagger boot . it most fun album i've heard ages , it just makes me want get up sing dance . amazing band so known it retro mod sound come out one freshest sounding albums year .	1
fact not good all .. i really don't like good charlotte .. i don't own this cd , my brother . almost all songs singer feeling sorry himself , whining how miserable he . lyrics very , very simple . " hold " supposed song against suicide , but i find it totally unbelievable , when theres song cd called " day i die " , where he sings happiest his life he dies . i think he mentions death some other songs too . so maybe he not miserable , or " hold " just attempt gain more popularity heroic . it really makes no sense . i'm giving this cd 1 star because i really think it bad . not because i think " real punk " " classic rock " only good music , you should buy instead ( that just stupid ) . there lot great alternatives this cd . but there also lot bands this genre , almost bad good charlotte . comparing this blink 182 insane . blink 182 makes great melodies clever lyrics	-1
perhaps no musical group exemplified anti-counter cultural approach music better than band various ways . they influenced many people who influential their own right either time ( eric clapton george harrison approach music ) or would years come ( i.e. roger waters ' approach concept album writing pink floyd ) not mention one begetters 1970 style " folk country . " while more could said them than , there plenty say this album where review focused . album opens " across great divide " it sets tone very down home americana feel this album full uniformly excellent songs . latter song contains story man who tries explain himself his woman recounts some extent recklessness his " younger days " he tries persuade her not kill herself . it not grim it sounds words i assure you . second song " rag mama rag " which fun quirky song fiddles , offbeat drum pattern , mandolin , fiddle instead bass , bass parts played tuba . lyrics song woman who only wants play ragtime music ... there may sly message but whatever . brings us one best songs album . " night they drove old dixie down " musically lyrically masterpiece . it ironic canadian songwriter ( jaime robbie robertson ) could write such empathetic tune old south but it power song cannot denied . it delivered conviction only american group ( southerner levon helm ) . garth hudson gets some very textural sounds melodica overdubbed via his lowrey organ , which sounds like harmonica starting second verse song . it example multifaceted talents band members -all whom except robbie robertson played multiple instruments . i never get tired hearing this song , singing it , or playing it guitar . it followed " when you awake " , song lyrics family remembering grandfatherly advice given . there album moves " up cripple creek " which song very " back porch " feel which ( i must say it ) deliciously sleazy way . garth hudson playing clavinet through wah wah pedal create sound jew harp . when mixed danko bass playing , it gives significantly low range tune narrative man who wants lookup old girlfriend " assistance " if you how many areas she completes him . " whispering pines " follows , which robertson co-wrote richard manuel . song completely different tempo than one preceding it manuel delivers very wrenching vocal performance vocally piano . following " whispering pines " " jemima surrender " which heavier tempo boogie-woogie piano ( played not manuel but hudson ) , manuel drums , levon helm not drums but rhythm guitar , robertson lead guitar . ( alternate take -- half songs album alternative take this cd- members their usual instruments completely different approach song . ) song singer wanting girl named jemima give ... well ... all i tell you it . " rocking chair " possibly my favourite song album . it unconventional musically group there no drums ( helm mandolin this tune ) , hudson plays accordion , robertson acoustic guitar , timekeeping solely danko bass adequate . lyrics i find quite haunting now wake lost my childhood best friend last year other reasons not mentioned here . " look out cleveland " up tempo rocker sung danko some aggressive lead fills robertson backed danko equally aggressive bass picking " storm coming through " which ends up devastating everything . ( compared everything else album , this song stands out its strident phrasing . ) there next song " jawbone " it opens very slow start alternates time signatures verses pre-chorus chorus back again lyrics thief who unrepentant . album next moves into " unfaithful servant " which sung danko slow creeper ... well ... exactly what title says narrator tries examine reason faithlessness involved . album ends officially " king harvest " which frantic tune sung manuel . song unusual sound even album songs many which distinctive sense . shifting tempos verse verse gives distinctive sound robertson stinging lead playing which shows pleasing restraint it . lyrics show tensions paradoxical attachments ( city country , past present , etc ) tale union man who feeling pinch ala steinbeck " grapes wrath " wraps up album quite strongly . there also alternate takes six songs cd release well outtake song would appear future albums ( referring " get up jake " ) . but twelve songs album originally released focus this review they all cohere well making this album must anyone who likes good music .	1

wow !! awesome !! rhino it again . rhino records always puts out great anthologies . i remember growing up 60 these musicals always playing television saturday afternoon . i thank my mom . i remember most these tunes i can't wait order this . it took some time search it out amazon . congratulations !! you won't find collection good this . it closest you get owning best hollywood musicals without buying every soundtrack . if you remember lazy days family couch singing judy garland , fred astaire , gene kelly , this collection should hit spot . i agree , this collection needs more bing crosby . but i disagree it needs some sinatra . ( even though i love town guys dolls . ) there plenty great sinatra recordings own ( i 12 ) , but these recordings rare . man , they make room clark gable . what great choice . but never fear sinatra fans , maybe rhino box set . one only hope . " forget your troubles , come get happy . " if you remember when hollywood could sing , you get this . enjoy .	1

pinback blows me away . i consider my taste music very diverse , tendency love obscure indie rock-pop , last three decades ( talk talk , split enz elliot smith death cab ) . pinback delivers some best , most consistent music i've heard years . i started summer abaddon weak knees , then i acquired their debut album could barely stand ... now , blue screen life knocked breath right out me . i haven't gotten through entire back catalog because i can't stop listening three albums i my hands . words cannot express how fascinating this band - intricate complicated simple , straightforward delivery . their transitions sick . they put their contemporaries ( death cab , shins , killers ) shame . i love all aforementioned bands , but pinback slaughters them delivering well conceived , perfectly executed , diversified albums you listen front back , over over . how many albums you say ? they heavenly . standouts xiy , boo , concrete seconds , bbtone , prog , pene ... oh , screw it - every song great !	1

disclaimer : i give sound quality musicianship five stars this album . set list way some non-pj songs seem disconnected overall feel album what brings it overall three stars , though still recommended . avid pearl jam fan who listened nearly everything they've ever published recorded music realm , i again couldn't wait get my hands this live acoustical album ... sometimes simply known musical circles " unplugged " . album features few their classics like " girl " " daughter " well many covers , like dylan " masters war " . unplugged cd like this , you get hear band almost more true folk/spiritual sounding set opposed arena rocker . venue , benaroya hall , what i " hear " this album , superb place record live performance ( especially acoustic one , vedder voice almost echoes , but doesn't , it just enough give it more far reaching " boom " opposed falling flat through crowd which sometimes happen recording such this . thankfully , this not case ; it one best sounding live albums i've ever heard ! because i love sounds , could tell whatever this place obviously place when recording " unplugged " album , i some research it . i'll give you basics short but informative way . 1 ) benaroya hall opened up 1998 seattle state-of-the-art performance hall . it home seattle symphony . 2 ) state art facility designed music mind course . i mentioned before , vedder voice really comes through clear strong . hall made multitude angles well panels nooks disperse diffuse pitch sound it travels wavelength . physics this course , gives us much more quality music ... it enhanced million times better than if say , they playing stage middle basketball gymnasium . now you familiar how great sound science behind it , it time move my opinion this album . first off , set list . when i first listened it i enthralled hearing some my favorite songs . acoustical album it still felt like powerful music , vedder crew really sound like , usual , they putting their heart soul into playing their instruments delivering message or theme song portrays . i went later into album , i started feel little lost . several songs i never heard seemed suck some energetic feel i their classics right outta air ! it song , way they played song or their attitude general ? i think latter not apply , but former mentioned rings true . some these songs may seem like something band should play ( like " masters war " " i believe miracles " ) however , often i felt like band wasn't benaroya hall anymore , they regular stage singing cover songs . band me simply not seem evoke same energy or spirit they their own music . now , saying , maybe because their music just , something came their heart , mind , soul , not someone else , why i feel somewhat disenfranchised non-pj songs this album . continuing objective , i would liked see couple more their own songs , whether they hits or lesser known tunes , each disk . i think me it would made it little more pearl jam . however , fan , i ultimately still enjoy this album , am impressed quality sound hall they play presents . there still parts this cd simply amazing , like way your heart feel heavier when hearing song " low life " " girl " . these tracks i never get tired hearing so i may biased there , but taking electronics electric guitars out picture never seems strip down bands talent but unveil stronger , richer sound all it own ! interaction crowd course more subtle than playing say , some place like miami or houston front 50,000 people . feeling crowd appreciative , but also special kind considering they doing album ( what i gather vedders intermittent speeches ) youth benefit charity . pearl jam never called sellouts or greedy rock stars , they often known participate things help their community , world , fellow man . " sleight hand " also gem here comes deep eddie now usual soothing , almost reaching out sorrow serious toned vocals . it uses usual theme one person vs . themselves others , invoking sad tones regret memory . there seems some electronic things going here there , so i am assuming unplugged means lead guitarists playing acoustics , or perhaps someone using pedal machine via acoustic banks . regardless , overall it sound quality hall makes up some songs i don't put up pedestal . there other pj sources live music ; however , i don't think you really go wrong this album . 24 tracks performed great venue one greatest american rock bands all time , how could you go wrong ?	1
it took me while ( not long , thankfully ) get into tilly wall ever since then i tapping my feet beat . their music , lyrics tapping refreshing answer today boring pop music . i would say they " indie pop " . if you looking some music sing ( loudly proudly ) car or get your mood up this cd . listen first track , if you like it than cd highly recommended since many their songs similar beats sounds . there some beautiful slow songs ( lost girl ) , but some people hard time getting use derek voice ( main guy voice ) since it rather soft scratchy . i chance see them live even though they entertaining then , it not justice shown this album . i high recommend this anyone looking dance , need mood lifter or just looking new kind band listen .	1

this your classic west coast , gangster , " ride my enemies " album dog pound gangster kurupt . takes you back death row days early 90 when kurupt , daz , snoop , rest dpg crew would smash anyone anything got their way ! kurupt shows off his vast rapping skills every track . besides kurupt , some west finest , such snoop , dr. dre , xzibit , daz , others pop up album . highlight song without dought " live mic " featuring hip-hop legend krs-one . no hook ; just straight freestylin ' , both rapper specialty . track worth second listen " callin ' out names " ( bonus track ) . this classic dis record direct dmx , foxy brown , murder inc ., 50 cent ! any fan west coast gangsta music should definitely pick up this one .	1
well i'm 17 years old probably got into hip-hop around age 13 , so you say i never grew up greats like 2pac , biggie , etc . not until i heard this cd i could really appreciate hip-hop . sure radio ok but when i heard this i realized how much hip-hop lacking today , what happened ?? using skip track button my cd player isn't necessary , whole cd really classic me . it not just genius beats i impressed , but lyrics . lyrics ... wow , genius ... no other way describe it . i plan exploring many other areas hip-hop i never knew exisited . i wish hip-hop how it back early 90 , it lacks something today . you no longer " nod " ur head rap music radio .	1
not like this album all . poorly written musically failure . no wonder this guy trashes other artists	-1
alright , so main reason i got soundtrack pistolero juno reactor , real driving , pumped-up techno song . i started get into rest music soundtrack , i find it essential cd i carry me . great thing this soundtrack you listen mexican traditional music glimpse culture , still some real badass-sounding guitar ! whatever you may think film , you imagine actors playing their parts your head , since they play sing soundtrack ( first one ) . there aura music i can't put my finger ; there history , old feel it , but it lingers new musical ideas . kinda like movie , terms making it . i agree fullheartedly previous reviews : where movie fails , music fills gaps expands mexican music , making entire movie/soundtrack experience very deep epic . i dunno , maybe i'm rambling , but i emphasize this soundtrack adds culture kickass your collection , it mine	1

this group assimilated all influences great rock music 1967 1972 come up modern vision . everyone frank zappa quicksilver messenger service morgen guess who procol harum yes(plus hundreds others ) touched upon this eclectic recording then stretched almost jazzlike sound . i call it pure genius if any above mentioned bands your idea great music then i highly recommend this all their other recordings . too bad there no other bands mining this territory , but i'm sure glad these guys !	1

i only recently encountered this opera , acquired rattle recording few weeks ago , since , also bought listened naxos recording . fact may indicate i consider this little-known opera major find -- sumptuous , passionate , work i return many times , i am sure , would love see produced . i decided comment here because i really cannot agree either earlier comments . it probably true polish speaker would find hampson singing language bit uncomfortable -- i am not competent judge . but his singing , i always find it , sensitive intelligent , though he not throw himself into characterization ( andrzej hiolski naxos set ) , he projects clear sense dramatic conflict confronted king roger . i also cannot concur condemnation szmytka roxana . her voice light but well-controlled she manages negotiate vocal line effectively . true , it would interesting hear , example , renee fleming role , but i find this roxana completely satisfying . ( barbara zagorzanka , naxos set , bigger broader voice , but very wiry upper register -- i don't object it , but her sound also not kind warm , sensuous quality seems desired . ) i would agree tenor singing shepherd not outstanding ( but neither corresponding role naxos disk , though tenor stronger overall . ) whole , this recording powerful beautiful introduction superb opera . i think most opera lovers would find it much more than satisfactory	1
i bought this cd because i figured i couldn't go wrong isaac stern . i right . playing this cd taut powerful , crackling energy . same time , though , players keep superior sense musical precision , manage make music sound energetic without sounding heavy-handed . gramophone would say , it not without irony * felix * mendelssohn composed works such * felicity * , these performers keep felicity intact , which sets this cd way above myriads other mendelssohn piano trio recordings . ten dollars especially , you can't go wrong . this cd every mendelssohnian should his or her collection	1
missing essential " out street " , still only available bloated " river " 2 disc set . instead , includes tedious , unnecessary ubiquitous " 41 shots " , left-wing tirade against nypd one-time , nearly forgotten tragedy	1
unlike many reviewers , i enjoyed howie day previous release , " australia , " but i also found it inconsistent . " stop all world now " avoids sounding somewhat inconsistent ( hey even coldplay improved since their somewhat inconsistent " parachutes ) . but i digress . " stop all world now " starts off strongly ends off strongly , filled tons passion throughout great acoustic rock fill . " brace yourself " amazing song lyrically range motions within it ... great opener album . " perfect time day " calypso-esque acoustic feel it interesting . " collide " song catapulted howie day up charts it easy see why ... this love song , but love song almost bittersweet too moments . lyrical quality , acoustic nature , 25 piece orchestra just make this song even stronger more amazing . " trouble here " great acoustic song piano really makes this song stronger " sing " even more . " sunday morning song " probably one song could drag this album down though it different . " i'll take you " different kind song but crescendo middle song just intensifies passionate lyrics . this one better songs album . " she says " harkens back " ghost " although it cannot supercede " ghost " , it still great acoustic song . " numbness sound " song builds this album , beginning off vocals very little instrumentation , but song progresses , it builds emotion power . yet one better songs album . " you promise " ... this my second favorite song album . lyrics tackle some very difficult issues like pregnancy but lyrics trascendental enough they apply any hard time relationship when promises made . great song vocals , lyrics , music . " end our days " song relationships but it also beautiful love song ... one better songs album . " come lay down " would my favorite song entire album ... lyrics convey beckoning feeling , feeling protection . instruments vocals perfect well help create mood flying . " this time around " perfect song follow " come lay down " great lyrics . " standing sun " continues " flying " type mood course better songs album . acoustic versions " brace yourself " " collide " great end off because it strips howie day down his vocals just guitar ... fine way end off this amazing album	1
let me pull everyone aside honest minute . nook isn't very smart . i'm extremely attractive , uncanny fashion sense , am best cover band frontman ever my headband collection unparalleled , but i'm pretty freakin dumb . case , i don't get this band name . they aren't named thompson aren't twins . one them black . i'll sit down every third day try make sense it , but usual it leads me riding my bigwheel into busy intersection , stopping traffic until police arrive . it sad because music thompson twins , my opinion , most influential last 25 years . you hear their influence everyone nickelback . diddy other great artists today . why they pick such stupid name ? song 16 candles my favorite because i love movie . molly ringmall only hottest girl 80s . she breakfast club too ! song makes me think forgein kid yao ming , who just stole movie anthony michael jackson . anyway , thompson twins awesome i am too	1
not much say this compilation . all goth hit miss , but this compilation fair content . very different spectrums this album . most tracks organic , which whats wrong all other unquiet grave compilations . newer material , more electronic dissonant . volume 1 very retro goth feel it ... like some these songs could pouring out dark , evil goth club heart city . i'm not going review material b/c i believe style music speaks its self . i say if you looking variety , look no further . bells , organs , guitars , sitars , harps , violins , synthesizers ... all present . haunting female vocals , low thundering gothy male vocals ... they present too . perfect music halloween party held dusty old mausoleum ... enjoy this compilation this coming fall ... happy samhain	1
yeah , you saw right . i gave this album 5 stars , you know why ? kick ass . i've it two weeks it playing non-stop ( driving my roommate crazy ! ) . course this album spawned " bizzare love triangle " so why even write review without mentioning it ? also " all day long , " i like one too . then there paradise . i'll agree dude who said " paradise " greatest song this record- it dark , kind creepy , , well , you'd know if you heard it . i'm freaking obsessed this song . it really sad 80 get overlooked modern times ( unless it become adult contempoary hit ; think sting ) . you really hear their influence anything motion city soundtrack no doubt killers ( who totaly ripped off new order- right down their name , stolen music video " crystal . " don't get me wrong- i like them lot ) , tons other music , especially dance . vive la 80 	1

ok theres only like 4 good songs this cd : megalomanic , pistola , sick sad little world zee deevel . rest songs slow void interest , theres nothing really takes off . its slow more mainstreamed approach rock . i love other two incubus cds i : make yourself morning view but this one just doesnt sit right me . if you like other two cds you may not like this , you warned but if you like soft jazz rock which never really lifts off ground feel like sleeping bring your pillow cd player this cd drift off sleep . btw ( look your face after reading this review ' priceless '	-1
spinal tap returns ! most prolific nonexistant band ever back " break like wind , " wonderfully warped metal album celebrates rock'n'roll , bad lyrics exploding drummers . this bad album -- gloriously , magnificently bad , way only spoof . it opens roaring male dominance rocker " bitch school , " which would offensive if it weren't tongue-in-cheek , then lurches wonderfully bloated " majesty rock , " gloriously ghastly duet cher , insanely pretentious " sun never sweats " ( " bolder than pirates who used rule sea/braver than natives , who never heard tea ... " ) peak this album may song " break like wind , " which aspires deep inspirational despite lyrics like " we thumb stranger hand . " two most priceless songs end : mope ballad " all way home , " truly twisted christmas song , " christmas devil . " world first introduced spinal tap " this spinal tap , " classic rockumentary england loudest band . help cher ( yes , cher ) dweezil zappa , they take it upon themselves roundly mock metal , hard rock , rock ballads , quite few other things well -- they're funny because they put so much effort into doing nudge-wink bad job . music itself pretty standard hard rock riffs -- it merely okay , therein lies irony . what really startling while music not amazing technical sense , it actually much better than many real-life bands . scary , no ? it its moments brilliance , due zappa jeff beck mostly , well some gloriously ghastly sitar . it not music but lyrics genius . michael mckean , christopher guest , harry shearer true geniuses bad song -- what even better , these sort bad songs people write , but don't know they bad . " that majesty rock ! /the mystery roll ! /the darning sock , /the scoring goal ! " it get worse than ? yes , if you include lines like " rise ! you cream " " we may gods or big marionettes/but sun never sweats .

i would recommend buying any banhart albums . you could debate which better , but they all so good it hardly matters . his music original , sometime sounds poetic , silly , psychotic or all three . you could name any number influences , but his work really just it own thing .	1
first thing realize this 4 cd set ..... king phil ! no other grateful dead cd phil bass boom out so forcefully ... rattling windows shaking walls . if you're debating closing winterland ... should i buy dvd or cds ? my opinion , it far more enjoyable buy cds just hear music without visuals . cd 1 , highlights scarlet begonias fire mountain , both tracks long , excellent jerry jams . cd 2 you get very very good playing band ... terrapin station better than very over-produced studio track . cd 3 gives you extremely loose not fade away ... maybe it bit too loose ... harmonica solos some guitar solos not jerry ... but throughout jam , phil king deep bass satisfaction booming daylights out your sub-woofer ( if you sub woofer ) . cd 4 relatively short dark star/other one/dark star ... but it well worth hearing . all all , closing winterland essential any dead collection . fun , you always listen funny introduction cd 1 first track , dan aykroid " burning ember " happy new year countdown	1
i feel like crying right now , literally . i suppose i saw this coming , even though i'd give anything avoid it : goo goo dolls straight up sold out , no other band could dissapoint me more than they could . goo goo dolls sole band brought me through my teens , probably single most early influence my taste music . no other band intensity , musically emotionally , these guys captured their earlier albums ( albums like jed , hold me up , superstar carwash , or boy named goo all you who started dizzy ) . complete lack words describe feeling certain song gives you -- you know what i'm talking about- these guys it everything they . it , past tense . their progression critics tote " maturing , " alas , dolls slow descent into what they've become now . we ( longtime fans ) saw it silently groaned ourselves , not able admit ourselves it happening . it started dizzy up girl ( what , or five singles ? get serious ) . don't get me wrong , i enjoy album , but only because it still some magic made goo goo dolls what they . songs still felt real . gutterflower real omen ; but least songs still somewhat interesting , musically . so it comes this , great band ruining itself . trust me , i tried desperately like this cd . desperately . but it doesn't feel real . lyrics cheesy . musicianship way below par ( compard their creative ability talent ) . songs forgetable all sound same . only song i found somewhat enjoyable " listen . " ( only taste real ggd i could find this cd ) . ( only two songs robby vocals ? its shame . his raspy voice beautiful . ) its hurts me immensely say these things john robby . they've my idols more than half my life . it feels like part me dead . sounds cheesy , but ggd never dissapointed me . time face up facts : they finally . i guess all good things come end.so if you want hear some good music , go used cd store pick up superstar carwash , hear what this really great band used sound like .	-1
ok , first off i am sick debating whats " punk " what isn't " punk " . i like simple plan but i like other bands lot heavier .. like nile , cradle filth , lots others . this cd kind pathetic but i don't really care .. i just like catchy lyrics . labels pretty stupid band when you think it , i mean if media would not started calling this band punk , then there you wouldn't called poser listening them . simple plan said over over again they not punk band but won't stop everyone else because stupid , stupid , stupid , media	1

don't let whole " collection eps " thing scare you ; you don't need obsessive belle sebastian fan enjoy this album . it two cds solid material , quite bit better ( my opinion ) than their other albums i've heard . eps blend together well , offering songs rollicking subdued . most them catchy weirdly fun ... who doesn't need more ?	1
more acoustic folk-oriented than led zeppelin previous two efforts , but not lacking attitude or craft . slightly underrated ( if you'd consider certified 6x platinum album underrated ) , but still well . though not absolute essential like led zeppelin 4 , led zeppelin 3 excellent piece work worth your time money	1
truth i so transfixed visuals soundtrack movie didn't enter my consciousness . it superlative vedder/nasrat fateh ali khan duets radio drew me this fabulous compilation . truth also while knowing pearl jam , i'd never given eddie more than glancing attention . ali khan i'd heard since mid 1980s . their singing this cd compelling . then there challenge set song champs tim robbins write their impressions roughcut film . dividends aren't quite so great . springsteen , michelle shocked , susan vega , mary chapin carpenter , my favourite here , lyle lovett , all returned wonderful material . lovett pure diction phrasing ensures enunciating failed promises , failed words , cuts deep . springsteen sets mood fairly literal condensing film narrative . i consider it stronger than anything , ' tom joad ' . springsteen voice assembles sean penn screen face me , so carpenter erect susan saradons ' . star cast emerge collectively absorbing material , though none quite match vedder(who later bob dylan cbs bash , stole show ' masters war)and ali khans '	1

last reviewer , this album should not compared sting " nothing like sun " or " dream blue turtles " . it sting move different direction , move started " brand new day " . it more techno , " smooth good way " sting , which , my opinion , wise step . " dream " " sun " terrific albums ? yes . should sting making sequels them now ? no . " brand new day path " good musical evolution sting . " sacred love " itself , it very fine album . traks such " inside " , " dead man rope " , " book my life " standouts , but whole album sounds like cohesive whole . it superior " brand new day " sting stays away rap country tendencies evident " brand " . this said , really great tracks album ( " thousand years " , " desert rose " , " ghost story " title track ) , most part , better than great songs " sacred love " . what makes " sacred love " better it more album than " brand " . songs form suite instead just seperate tracks . basic point : buy " sacred love " if you like " brand new day " sting . if you love " turtles " " sun " , " sacred love " may not best choice you	1
' 1999 ' funky , fresh , very catchy .... he got some pop-friendly cuts like ' 1999 ' ' little red corvette ' impossible not love ... then he got some crazy ' out there ' but infectious songs like ' automatic ' ' all critics love you ny ' ' lady cab driver ' .... course clever balad " international lover " .... although i too young ( i might not even born yet ) remember those days , i think general consensus this album propelled prince super-star status solidified his position one most creative unique musicians his time , or any time period matter ...	1
much band professional career , corrs fallen outside bounds " irish pop , " where they've so often lumped , more area pop musicians who happen irish . but " home , " family band makes giant leap into ireland musical tradition without ever losing its unique pop sound . while sound pop , music this time around largely traditional . crossover works brilliantly , turning classic old irish songs into tracks would go over quite well any pop music radio station or dance floor . album conceived tribute late jean corr , siblings ' mother , who musician avid collector songs before she died 1999 . what more i say ? traditional irish songs given exciting new spin one ireland top pop family bands success written all over it . any luck , it bring new listeners into traditional fold -- encourage corrs explore more deeply their rich family legacy national treasure .	1

grand majesty carnegie hall , name , fame , quitessential respect . heir angry comedy finds his throne respectable stage last . i bought this album because it required buy his albums soon they hit stores when you own funny bone . i am also desperate after memorizing every bill hicks album i own . this isn't bite lewis , though , he funny mofo all his self . very outset , lewis black seems think he obliged explain why he there carnegie . he goes straight through factors his conception his influential jewhood . this seems very boring beginning , relaying his history , but i guess that mid-life combined playing famous opera house he says he dreamed playing when he started . entire two discs easily constitute , " my life " ordeal , contemplating his own thinking big stage where he feels reborn . he apparently thinking very big , put his entire history comic into this performance . gone oft breakup rants , replaced controlled rants . he combines what seems ' bibliography biography ' his political , intrapersonal , stage-presence comedy . hitting every current event , especially then-recent hurricane katrina , terry schiavo fiasco , forte few comics anymore . one thing i continuously revel , this album seems so huge , gigantic all-encompassing . lewis spent his time rules enragement , white album ideosyncratic , erratic , very comfortable . his luther burbank performance very fresh , but without whole lot lasting substance . end universe easily one his best albums , his breakthrough , his most original material combined stage-finesse could captivate anyone , both sides any spectrum culture . this very close second end universe , but different kind album first place . every artist goes carnegie , whether it carlin , or lenny bruce , finds introspective route goes long time respectable performance they find within themselves . every carnegie album like , except carlin hbo special , but he still really moving point still . actuality , i don't know what think this performance . great quality obvious , but it'll require test time see if it catches internet-generation audiences	1

like . woods , previous reviewer , i not really get into van hunt music until after hearing incredibly-sultry " seconds pleasure " during sexy pedicure scene movie " something new . " ( talk perfect soundtrack scene !! ) i no idea what i missing ; well , better late than never ! want better description , van hunt style his debut album best described " d'angelo/prince edge . " but even this fails capture seamless blending musical styles , melodies riffs van hunt album . this album easily make it into my neo-soul/jazz/funk hall fame , inimitable jill scott , floetry , sweetback , remy shand , brand new heavies ( those who remember back-in-the-day ) . i didn't think anyone could measure up kem my favorite soul-jazz-rb artist , but van hunt comes very close second ! his debut album chock-full good stuff ... swipe it up asap ! highly recommended	1

released june 1990 follow-up daydream nation - album placed sonic youth top late `80s independent rock scene - goo band major label debut geffen . given deluxe edition treatment , this pivotal work now available remastered form bonus tracks second disc extras . original album - nicely freshened up john golden - strung together heavy doses sonic youth signature dissonance ; however , bizarre tunings jagged distortion crammed into tight song structures , making this one their most accessible efforts . essential tracks like " dirty boots , " " mote " " kool thing " ( featuring public enemy chuck ) may dated , but remain potent , assaulting rock clichs art-school cynicism . deluxe edition package includes widely bootlegged 8-track demos goo featuring dinosaur jr. ' mascis handful unreleased tracks . demos aren't wildly different than finished product , but they provide more immediate raw take songs . previously unreleased material , only " lee #2 " - stripped down , poetic outtake written sung guitarist lee ranaldo - particularly noteworthy . however , liner notes make good read , providing nice snapshot group tumultuous time pop music history . goo may not sonic youth best , but it undoubtedly important album their career proves experimental underground band could make major label jump without sacrificing their credibility . reason alone , it nice see goo get paid respect it deserves . james baronesynthesis.ne	1
true i see how people say he started become pop this release he started singing lil mo christina milian but everyone feeling this . two lead singles hot but so " love me hate me " sweet violins keyboards bouncy beat , " you " horns scratches great track ride . " extasy " made you wanna dance " , " watching me " hot intro , other tracks pretty hot too . however , i don't like track " if god one us " . seriously that so disrespectful god talk him like , but if i give props it it great beat . there some filler songs here like shade sheist collabo but this still better than b.g. or master record anyday . now , before i go , i must ask question all criticisers out there : i know many can't stand ja singing ( i personally don't mind it but i see where it become nuisance ) but singing love songs doesn't take away you street cred . his crew whooped 50 physically ja sold drugs . just keep thought mind singing doesn't lower your cre	1
production good news backed off . there layers , but very rarely too polised guitars dominate mix . it more intricate but intricacy seems come mosaic simply-toned sounds . guitars scratchy or acoustic , vocals thin sort lispy . unless they're screamed , then they're just thin . only thing jumps way out mix dominant bass drum - used sparingly throughout whole disc - kicks halfway through first track . lots other instruments ( real musical instruments like horns strings , opposed synth or found sounds ) fill gaps left modest mouse usual thin sound . all this jumble creates rhythm but rhythm only goes so far . it not rocky it not dancy . it just musical . it goes well under what seems main focus , melody . melodies good , fairly catchy without annoyingly poppy . all this , working well fact songs consistently good paced well over course album , make it pretty good listen overall . while i might not like it more than moon antarctica , i certainly see it easier get all way through one sitting . ---- hummit.blogspot.co	1
classic wu tang , seems like all older rap music sounds better than garbage put out today like 50 cent , game , lil jon ( most annoying voice since mystikkal ) . listen old school hip hop if you never listened rap music	1

i don't know much frontman jari m�enp�� former band ensiferum apart fact they played what they called " heroic folk metal " , but what i know debut album wintersun one most beautiful metal albums ever emerge scandinavia , well taking high spot europe top 50 metal albums ( least my opinion ) . though some may not find it appealing due melodic black/death metal common usage scandinavian metal theatre , but music here absolutely stunning ; despite only eight songs , it almost reaches hour-long point . each instrument played beauty precision comes together end make one hell masterpiece . this may also appeal large number power metal fans who handle harsh vocals , jari also employs some wonderful viking metal vocals remind one early bathory arcturus if they recorded decade later . one thing sure , jari fits comfortably ranks quorthon simen hestaes ( most recent vocalist arcturus ) viking metal best . jari m�enp�� proves any doubters he , fact , virtuoso , especially when you consider he recorded this album alone , without help any other musicians except session drummer kai hahto , who also great job giving songs precise speedy beat like any good metal drummer should . his vocals among album highlights , he sounds comfortable belting out mournful , epic tunes well screeching skill seasoned black metal vocalist . his guitars chug intensity active volcano while he may not one greatest soloists ever , he knows how bust one out without sounding unnecessary , but they aren't very common this disc they aren't all important progression album . keyboards wonderful wherever they , whether spewing out atmospheric ambient tunes or playing fun , speedy solos reminiscent children bodom janne warman . bass , like most epic melo-death recordings , falls back ranks unnoticed , but it isn't too important recording other than need bass guitar works . bottom line : if you're melo-death fan , then you must get this , no matter how hard find it ( if you see it , buy it , because god knows when you'll ever see it again ) . but even average death metal fan power metalhead find something enjoy this album , its lacing grandiose musical structures heaviness sure winner . other good melodic death metal bands include norther , kalmah , children bodom . track selections : " beyond dark sun " , " death healing " , " sadness hate " . 10/1	1

ghostface delivery one both abstract , yet contains enough charm pull average listener into his world . his lyrics contain in-jokes , references mythical places , scattershot memories his childhood ... 90% time , you no idea what he talking ; but you feel it . although this ghostface first solo album , he sounds like seasoned veteran ; handling curves rza soulful , yet mysteriously minimalistic beats samples , allowing his personality shine through each verse . there absolutely no negative thing this cd ... but one point always confused me cover graphic design direction . what exactly ghostface , raekwon , cappadonna doing cover ? overseeing production latest wu-wear shoe line ? notice cheezy laboratory test tubes up shelf dry ice smoke coming out . haha ... what ??? i mean , that cool all , but you admit , it weird concept hip hop album . but then again , it ghostface	1
i seen this group live this album accurate documentation group progression footprints live present . i think it important we know where these songs come how they where interpreted first . albums like joy ryder , phantom navigator , atlantis good examples if you find them . some these same songs heard beyond sound barrier played electric band form previously listing albums , then here them 15 years later quartet form amazing . groups interplay each other so indepedent , sometimes you wonder where wayne shorter ?, then there he smack your face or tapping you your shoulder ever slightly saying , " hey i'm over here . " this quartet wayne shorter plays every role imaginable . he horn soloist , but also accompanist brian blade , danilo perez or john patitucci , all four them catalyst well . it many other facits make wayne shorter quartet truly amazing .	1

i first discovered matthew ward `the transfiguration vincent ' ( 2003 ) , which became one my favourite albums year . i've waited eagerly follow-up which finally arrived form `transistor radio : memories utopian radio power ' matthew ward similar my opinion old blues , gospel folk singers bygone era , which makes him sound way kind familiar . his voice what i would refer fragile rasp sometimes , husky quality similar crosby , stills nash elements mississippi john hurt . musically this well produced yet minimal giving these songs open airy sound . `transistor radio ' opens instrumental cover beach boys `you still believe me ' before album gets underway . standout tracks my opinion `fuel fire ' `lullaby + exile ' . lyrically these all these songs world-weary optimistic approach . i discovered matthew ward through listening devendra banhart , iron wine , grandaddy sparklehorse . if you like any these i'm sure you'll find something enjoy here , although it closer content first two production latter . check out . ward previous record `the transfiguration vincent ' also , which contains excellent fragile cover version david bowie `lets dance ' .	1

this , ward third cd , places him forefront modern movement clearly progressive while simultaneously sounding regressive , feeling dusty age , manifesting genius pure untempered . his music defies description except say it coming somewhere seeped early blues neil young overlay feel country , blues , pop , folk . i am beginning believe , more i listen this cd , if neil young heard it he would say : " that it ... what i trying sound like ... listen those chord progressions chord changes ... that it " . people point tom waits others ward forebearers but muse here genuinely unique sounds those only budding genius could make . opening rif " fool says " feels like it came abbey road but song end you dipped young dylan . i dare you listen " get table time " not imagine yourself there ward family calls their prodigal son come down attic dinner . ward makes beautiful music --- sounds like you never encountered --- he sings melodies if he can't help himself . who could if they this much soul ? it all coming very deep place inside him you owe it yourself before you pass --- main issue he addressing this cd --- hear these songs because they most soulful melodic tunes you heard quite some time . this man lives his own songful world i can't thank him enough sharing it us transfiguration . if you put this cd your stereo it long time before you take it off . more you listen deeper it gets --- just like ward , i suspect . this genius , pure genius , you need hear it . if when you given transfiguration good listen find yourself wanting more same ( yet beautifully different ) , then go backwards ward highway end amnesia or forward transitor radio . you very glad you . enjoy	1

eagles reputation groups them greats rock country-rock . this reputation comes spite fact eagles released but seven albums their two incarnations , six which they released 1972 1979 . their last album " hell freezes over , " orphan released 1994 . first eagles greatest hits album covered only pre-joe walsh years . second eagles greatest hits album focused last two eagles ' albums , one song first four one song live album . those us liked eagles both incarnations , two greatest hits albums better than nothing . this album combines all 20 tracks both greatest hits albums , adds 11 songs , solving greatest hits problem very cost effectively . there other eagles collections . " very best eagles " most songs first two greatest hits collections , but considering price this cd versus cd , why not get extra three songs ? there also boxed set provides 52 eagles songs , but substantially greater price . i think if you seeking representative greatest hits collection reasonable price , this collection one . it easy look back this music put it down because 30 years later it no longer fresh , new , or original . there hundreds imitators eagles . however , eagles one first , many ways , first . those who came later imitated eagles performed similar music so many times after while impact eagles appears diluted . truth , impact occurred when these songs released , part continuing evolution music . try put yourself back early 70s when this music released . it great then ; fresh , innovative , young . jungle beat disco , techno-pop , discordant chords nine inch nails all yet , beatles only broken up recently . i always remember this music how unique it when released .	1

i don't know tim mcgraw person therefore cannot comment this man character . however , i comment tim mcgraw supposed singer/musician . he terrible voice cannot sing , evidenced anyone who ever seen one rare clips him singing live . nor he write any his own songs ( even he freely admits this ) . nor he play any musical instruments , unlike country singers such brad paisley , who real talent strumming guitar . top , tim mcgraw songs aren't even country music songs ( least not according tried-and-true definition this once great musical genre ) . i can't really think any quality his should allowed him become ' big ' musical figure he currently . so it external factors - marketing , hype , course , old maxim " there sucker born every minute . " those suckers , course , those people who lap up tim mcgraw ' music ' actually pay money buy his albums , including this one . tim mcgraw not country artist . if you want listen real country music ( better singing voices boot ) , then go look artist - they exist out there , even if they don't same hype applies tim mcgraw	-1
this my first donell jones ' cd , i truly say this far perhaps best cd i've heard several years any artist . tracks start finish great , i found myself listening cd all day first time i played it . what prompted me buy cd song i'm gonna which i hear more my satellite radio stations than i locally here michigan . because quality music , i very rarely buy cd anymore , however , after hearing i'm gonna , i telling friend how much i liked song my friend happened cd only after listening maybe 3 or 4 other tracks , i knew i wouldn't disappointed . i love this cd - great job , donell !!! what i am disappointed lack promotion this cd . it just burns me up when there some non-mainstream artists great product whatever ( dumb ) reason , marketing depts . record companies don't actively promote artists such donell jones who quality products . there isn't even video out , which this day age , artist must video further promote their product(s ) . so shame jive records ( all other record companies ) who don't actively aggressively promote cd quality this one exhibits . i recommend this cd anyone who appreciate good quality rb - both youngheads oldheads ( i'm old head my mid-40 ) . i doing my own promotion this cd contact my local radio stations ask they include i'm gonna their rotation .	1

india . arie great job when she came out 2001 delivered acoustic soul ; fact , she such great job album nominated whopping seven grammys . seven grammy nominations means you'll least win one , right ? well , we all know , that not way it went down ( she even performed saturday night live backwards 7 her shirt ) . but thing , after she her mother complained how backwards grammys , india quickly went into studio record voyage india , which she scored three grammys after all . i'm not saying bad album , but me it didn't stand out next acoustic soul . after she kind disappeared , but she finally emerged testimony : vol . 1 , life relationship , her best album date . i listened this entire album few times i couldn't find one song not worth rewinding . there standout after standout , like " these eyes " , " good morning " " india song " . india also good job covering don henley " heart matter " ; even necessary we-are-the-world song " better people " sounds great . course there few songs empowerment here , most notably " i am not my hair " featuring akon ( one those artists seems shine every album except his own ) . country superstars rascal flatts also impress acoustic " summer " ( but they're only singing background vocals , so i don't know if should really count guest spot ) . any rate , every song here damn good , so whether you want some great music play your friends or you want follow track 5 your own private party , my testimony pick up india latest album never take it out your stereo . anthony ruper	1

yes , faith hill back country . when " cry " first released 2002 , i can't say i big fan album . however , slowly but surely , i became attached after few plays now it not so bad . but now , faith back music made her . country tracks this cd show faith never left her home country music . although tracks like " sunshine summertime , " " mississippi girl , " " like we never loved all " meant highlights album , those tracks just don't cut it . but it took tracks more deeper meaning slower pace make me fall love album . tracks like number eight , " i want you " really moved me . soft guitar faith pure voice this track could melt anyone warm goo ... you know what i mean . i really sent over edge , officially fell love album after i heard last track , " paris .

this disk my introduction leonard cohen . his voice took little bit getting used , but i soon came appreciate his deep , baritone growl . cohen belongs school singer/songwriters such dylan who not traditionally fine singing voices but who bring dimension emotion their own lyrics more than make up any technical faults . cohen fascinating point view ; i particularly enjoy title track , which he laments loss moral reference points point he becomes nostalgic unambiguous evil represented stalin berlin wall . one drawback this recording his long cover " always ; " it giant dead spot this disk	1

there always little politics involved when someone decides it time drop greatest hits album . someone like tupac shakur , it just posthumous thing : album eulogy after lifelong legacy hits . someone like say michael jackson , greatest hits album key tool during trial time when your presence under public eye intensifies courtroom cameras become free advertisement . but most people , greatest hits album simply signals end your shine this here biz-ness music . ja rule-and his greatest hits exodus ( inc/def jam ) it little trickier . late nineties , ja rule ar devil made agreement where he signed over his street cred soul pop success . beginning , it worked out ja rule his polygamous duets like " put it me " " ain't it funny " kept his beach chair south beach . yet gradually , his fans losing their testosterone fellas block black doo-rags weren't nodding their heads much . we gave him one last chance he used it bobby brown sing duet building roof " thug lovin '" . even rule himself knew he made boo-boo . so , this sudden resurgence includes rotten apples most current hip-hop anthem " new york " , " clap back " , . kelly midas touch " wonderful " throws us off somewhat . ja rule career really downward spiral ? sh*t , exodus hot . chronological order most part , exodus allows listeners see where it went right ja rule , where it went wrong , then back where it went right again . hardcore rapper who blushed comparisons tupac , sensitive fellow singing thug serenades , buddy fat joe , man who gave him back his figurative bandana sagging jeans . exodus solid well put together greatest hits album . even new track " me " seals ja rule place bona fide rapper . still , we left funny feeling end album . that when ar devil pops out his pitchfork asks ja rule if he remembers agreement .	1
this record really makes you feel alive that pretty high praise . this record also new sound bob dylan ( what else new ) gospel backup singers . steve douglas ' sax rocks . billy cross kicks lead guitar david mansfield rips strings . through all dylan voice rings out crisp true . no rough edges here . this almost soul music . no , it soul music . maybe not james brown , but soul nonetheless . i've listening " street legal " something like twenty years it keeps getting better , sounding new , because i'm hearing something different each every time i play it	1
tilly wall pioneered weird new kind indie-pop -- tap-dance pop ! worked well their debut , it works even better " bottoms barrels , " which makes everything their sound fuller . instrumentation bigger , melodies catchier , tapping more promiment , their second album just more fun general . it opens echoing vocals over barely-audible electric guitar ... then it joined piano , increasingly drama heels start ratatatting background . " i kidnapped real young sweet taste love/built fondness things just weren't good enough/i cradled crow , always shooed off dove/which tagged me na�ve son , " kianna alarid sings little breathlessly . it followed up lo-fi mellotron swirls " urgency " latin-flavoured stomp-stomps " bad education " ( " girls boys full frustration/ st. valentine , i think i taste it ! " ) . then they tap frolic through shimmering keyboard pop , pretty little piano ballads , solid indiepop , tambourine-laden dance music . this omaha pop band really something special -- they really add life vibrancy retro indie-pop , they knack spinning up melodies make you want dance whether you like it or not . perhaps only weak spot their folkier songs less engaging than their sprightly ones , though these still above averagethe album seems center unhappy , rebellious youth -- they're young , feisty , they want out into world . boys who want girls , frightened young girls , teens who " slept bad side town . " while lyrics playful fun , they also very dark ( " so when your bones broke you're all alone/and fog so thick you can't see up close/just know i end up strangled too " )the music colourful swirl bells , tambourine , xylophone , recorder swirls warm-tinged keyboard , some guitar bass lurking down there somewhere . no drums -- jamie williams just tap-dances really hard rhythm music , surprisingly it works well , if not better . tilly wall still colourful infectious ever , anyone who adored their first album practically worship " bottoms barrels .	1
prince 1981 album controversy classic album his catalog . title track standout immediately . this longer version than single version features prayer . song funky effective . " sexuality " great disco/funk number . " me , baby " probably one sexiest songs he ever . this full length version one hear . " private joy " funky song which favorite album . " ronnie , talk russia " short protest kind song . same goes " annie christian " , which he wrote shooting john lennon , ronald reagan , various atlanta child murders . not effective " ronnie , talk russia " but decent track nonetheless . overall highlight prince career	1
anyone who thinks madonna nothing more than vapid image-maker , listen clsely tracks this album . you come realize madonna created many , many memorable songs during her now-more-than-20 year career . this album only sampler her hits , because more than one disc would needed all her hits her first 1983-1991 period . one hear feel her growth person artist this disc , poppy dance music first deeper more introspective material later . course , her fans remember each track companion video firmly their memory . such power video . people who never really paid attention videos surprised how well-done songs . this collection shows what true cultural chameleon madonna , how she matured artist . this collection true must-have music fans , not just madonna fans , because madonna true legend music industry , she shows no signs slowing down	1
i write this after reading previous review . " tonight night " no point view , you say ? you no powers perception/discerment , my ( harsh , yes ) response . way album produced , played , written ( it bit like great play or movie script , isn't it ? ) point view , songs tell tale . depression , despair , sadness , loneliness , anger , regret , it all here . not say it downer album , it it isn't . point : when i angry young teenager , i'd put who " live leeds " it would help release anger , non-destructive ( except my hearing , perhaps . eh , wot ? ) way . it same way " tonight night " . when i'm feelin ' bit under weather , emotionally , i put this it mirror my feelings , i sense there someone else out there who felt same way . every song keeper ( though it took few listens get used ) , every song contributes " theme " album whole , which " it what it " , either you relate it , or you can't . i think there awful lot people who relate it , or least appreciate it distance , since it rightly considered masterpiece , not only neil , but rock music general . if you survived early ' 70s aware " youth culture " time , you certainly know what neil singing . either you friend , or heard someone , or saw it tv , or read it news , but utopian dream faded " vietnam veterans returning home , nixon watergate , etc . " reality , " old reality " ( one our parents used live , you know , before late ' 60s , all ... ) re-asserting itself vengeance , we midst type reality again today . this cd more relevant than ever , if you think buffalo springfield csny best neil offer , you would wrong , neil just gettin ' started ! now , when " time fades away " re-issued ( please !!! neil , i'm begging you !!! release it expanded 2 cd set , pleeeaaaase ! aaarrgh ! yer killin ' me ! i can't wait forever !!! save my life , because ... " time fades away " !!! " bridge , we'll build it now . it may take lot time , it may lonely , but , ooh babe ... bridge fallin ' ... " ) don't let bridge fall , neil ! anyway , ( i want start web petition cd ... ) , " tonight night " best studio neil , " time fades away " best live neil , " rust never sleeps , " live rust " notwithstanding . huge praise this album . neil young premiere artist this his brightest ( dark ) masterpiece	1

i bought this last year i listen it once while . i both 2 volumes b/c i couldn't afford whole box set sadly ( plus , it wouldn't fit my cd rack anyways ) . but back point . two new tracks complete garbage , though nice instrument skills displayed them . i'll review track track : 1.it weird , but creative-7/102 . nice beat lyrics-9/103 . great song general-10/104 . dirty-6/105 . great love ballad . later covered some singer named melissa morgan , i think-10/106 . very fast-paced cool-8/107 . one greatest songs ever recorded . pure classic-10/108 . good song , but gets boring after while . still love it though-9/109 . never liked this one . pop life best tune off album-4/1010 . very very creative soulful , later covered tlc-10/ 1011.3 rd no . 1 hit . need i say more ? 10/1012 . great beat , but lyrics pure garbage . sounds like it written his then wife , mayte-5/1013 . duet w/ sheena easton . very funky nice-10/1014 . ha ha ha . it ok . it james brown feel it-7/1015 . funky tune . not suggested played around young ones-8/ 1016.5 th last no . 1 song billboard 100 . it bluesy feel it-9/1017 . crap-0/1018 . lovely ballad . this song should played every prom . i might suggest this my prom this coming year . 10/10 ... don't make same mistake me . if you starting get into his music , whole box set avoid later ones like best ultimate	1
dresden dolls just one those bands . you either get them or you don't , which isn't intended judgment those who don't . opening track slowly developing song follows sort anthemic rise . this pretty disconcerting first since dolls play only piano drums . it feels totally out left field . then comes rollicking punk girl anachronism . after overtly musical-theatrical missed me , oddity disappears . music still unusual , but it suddenly feels perfectly normal hear it . they exactly what they label themselves : brechtian punk cabaret , seems like nothing out ordinary . rest album settles into perfect rhythm beauty punctuated whimsy c-o-b occasional moments hurt anger . if you make it through last four tracks without loving it , you much harder soul than i am . let clear : this isn't original music all ; truly original can't labeled words we already use music . so " brechtian punk cabaret " can't original . but it sounds so different anything you've ever heard , there moments you'll find yourself feeling if you hearing music first time	1
i like fact this album you fall asleep , but there times when mind ticking over faster . different version track ' monday - paracetamol ' ulrich found soundtrack gran turismo 4 , called ' million miles away ' . you know how sometimes twins don't identical ? well , faster , more aggressive beat , atmospherics layered below this mix create ' foreground music ' - driving electrosnare ought get people moving opposed just tapping . intro more get you sooner . people critical drawn-out repetition this album ought find more complex construction this version more their liking . clocks 7:10 , but takes you through few places way . i managed record it my ps2 onto md , you might able ' find ' it somewhere ones zeroes . there few things worse than parents dress their twins identical clothing , wouldn't you agree ? i hope this helpful someone out there , i would rate this version higher ( subjectively ) than stuff this album	1
michael buble greatest male artist since frank sinatra . i absolutely love this cd dvd . he super personable very entertaining !	1
cast album 1963 broadway premiere production oliver ! actually recorded during show pre-broadway run los angeles . oliver ! played subsequent audiences san francisco , detroit toronto before opening imperial theatre new york january 6 , 1963 . show played 774 performances before prematurely ending season play 9-month national tour , later returning new york `farewell ' run 64 performances . she rapturous acclaim london three years previously , georgia brown played role nancy , earned similar praise her performance new york . her rich , velve t-t inged voice especially haunting chill inducing ballad " long he needs me " . composer lionel bart wrote " it fine life " especially brown after learning she cast role london production . ron moody also scored heavily london his tour-de-force turn fagin , but producers fearing his portrayal `too ethnic ' , role taken clive revill broadway premiere . revill just come his celebrated role irma la douce , his interpretation fagin every bit valid ron moody . bruce prochnik winsome wistful oliver , michael goodman delight artful dodger . wisely-retained original london company handful first-rate supporting players : hope jackman shrill mrs corney ; up-and-coming barry humphries mr sowerberry ( humphries would later graduate playing fagin before his beloved alter-ego dame edna unleashed herself world ) . promising young belter alice playten smartly-showcased nancy offsider bet . but , sound mix broadway album always rather flat dull , despite recorded stereo format day . voices orchestra no vibrancy or depth , this due studio which they recorded it , where ceiling very low sound not necessary acoustic projection . nevertheless , recording charm energy which overrides technical shortcomings . this new cd reissue rca offers some interesting bonus materials including musical director don pippin sharing his memories show ; barry humphries performing " that your funeral " ( london cast album but left off broadway album ); live recording patti lupone singing " long he needs me " ( lupone played nancy short-lived broadway revival 1986 ) . good value	1
this album perfectly acceptable distillation tribe 5 lps , two songs not included any those lps : if papes come , nice side ; vivrant thing , which i assume everybody already enough . this less reason exist than hits , rarities remixes or second half love movement , it would make lot more sense if they put all extra tracks one volume instead giving little time . i suppose this recording gives little too much preference earlier albums , but lot tribe fans partial first one or two them , so i guess justified . i see no point buying this if you much fan all ; it makes lot sense least two their albums instead because all them lot worthy content cannot compressed volume like this . but if you just want grab couple mid-90s hits one rap greatest groups , then go ahead ..	1
this band suffered terrible injustice they no way deserved . end personal difficulties then .. trajedy just not what moving , energetic , innovative fun band deserved all . i wish i seen them live . they always my " check out more " list i picked this up record store owner suggestion . very fine introduction .. i knew them tiny bit .. least enough know they cool .. but this compilation great crash course overview ... but it very sad because i just can't belive something lively really alive this music sounds could gone . however , tunes really hip sounding could come out two years now . they haven't dated all .. 1996 .. isn't long ago .. remember scientists say we entered new epoch past several decades called anthropocine ..... we'll see if lasts any longer . anyways ... this cd breaks my heart ... but it rocks soooooo gooood !! super hot singer looks like my first serious girlfriend ... reason this cd breaks my heart . i going out her when i first saw lush strum dreamily late night alternative mtv ... heartbreak .... this cd makes me want pick up some their other albums .. but then i'm worried getting addicted " dead " band .. because i'll always pine them .... heartbreak ... i'm pining already . red-haired singer-guitarist rocked rocked rocked . this very fine very special cd excellent band should not forgotten anyway i hope all lush family doing well today .. because i'm heartbrokenly love ....	1

child legendary singer choosing same profession difficult . lalah hathaway , daughter legendary singer donny hathaway , who listed musical influence famous artists every music genre , it would seem both enormous blessing burden exist shadow such icon . but somehow , hathaway handles weight her lineage grace integrity . course , it doesn't hurt she undeniably talented her own right . last year , hathaway released her third record , " outrun sky , " which marked welcome return this exceptional singer , who fans waiting 10 years new release . if her large , active website community 500 enthusiasts any indication , her audience hasn't diminished least albums . instead , they've eagerly scooped up any recording featuring single note hathaway . years since her last record , she featured number notable recordings other artists , including grover washington , wayman tisdale , marcus miller , meshell ndegeocello , joe sample . outrun sky displays hathaway jazzy , hearty voice perfectly , she torch singer ballad well she uptempo rb groove . evidence this found album first two singles , luther vandross tribute , " forever , always , love , which arguably better than original , crazy love , upbeat track " better better .

this first red hot chilli peppers albums i bought , many years ago now . i relistened it last night because i've wanting put up review this great album while now . i tend nominate albums " great " if they few really good tracks [ like midnight oil classic " 10-1 " or lot good songs , like midnight oil " diesel dust " or metallica reload ] . californication gets nod great album second category . there two tracks i count very good this album : around world , title track . first fast furious guitar assault then slows down some guitar picking . it some near rap style vocals very nice scat vocal section . highly energetic song . title track more laid back , some poetic lyrics concerning influence hollywood hollywood lifestyle . when i first got this album , these two songs i repeatedly listened , what probably tipped me into buying album , heard them radio , hearing some other nice songs album . whole , album described funky , ryhme laiden , alliterative lyrics , bass prominent music . i suppose best album tracks 1-7 . i heard track 3 , scar tissue , it nice song , though not kind song compel you buy this album . still , it very pretty , there few similarly laid back mellow songs album like this-otherside , californication road trippin ' . get top didn't really strike me good song first listen , though i really like cool guitar sound it . last night , i still liked guitar sound , but maybe song better than i gave it credit . perhaps porcelain initially my least favourite song album . it not very good pop song-not really catchy all , but , i think if you treat it like lullaby , it maybe not so bad after all . some songs nice , overlapping vocals weaving out , like otherside saviour . latter strikes me beach boys flavour-it little bit experimental sounding . speaking influences , purple stain , whilst not particulary good song , guitar riff out led zeppelin whole lotta love included . right time features beatle-esque backward lyric vocal outro . probably my favourite " easter-egg " song this album emit remmus . it not lyrically complex song , but its simplicity catchy chorus winner : " what could wetter than , english girl , american man . london summertime ... " . really cool song , i'm surprised this one few songs this album which not get radio airplay ... it definitely deserved . perhaps this song touch clash it . other tracks feature nice choruses you sing , like parallel universe , scar tissue , easily , road trippin ' . whilst there many good songs this album , album depth enough interesting , even when there songs sub-good . i didn't make any notes last night i like dirt this velvet glove , indicating they're not particularly interesting me , though i suppose you could say some may find i like dirt catchy . so , all all , highly listenable album , which rare , i think . many good songs , many interesting if not good songs . couple really terrific songs . my only complaint ? album suffers ' snap , crackle pop ' , which you hear if you listen good quality headphones , like i . reason , i'd give sound quality this album 2 out 5 . great album	1
bit untrue . this album times seem like run sign o . but it not fair comparrison : this album much lusher than sign o , just brilliant . songs man , songs . this album also fufills promise made around world , ten fold . highlights " life so nice " " mountains " one prince lushest songs . anotherloverholeinyohead which great prince funk song , kiss which amazing prince funk song , all ballads . they equally brilliant funk songs , something prince sometimes couldn't pull off	1
vivaldi spirit must symphony when they recorded this . though i parts vivaldi 4 seasons few baroque compilation cd , this far best overall performance/recording . example . tight driven strings break into lazy beginning summer section awe inspiring . i never really paid much attention part until i heard this cd . my hat' off also recording artists this cd not overly awash waltzy-smaltzy concert hall reverb . it dynamic tight ! yeah ! oh , just so you know , i'm not only lover great baroque music , but enjoy rock , pop , blues , metal well . hint : if you'd like hear great marriage hard rock classical , check out rondo veneziano albums " magica melodia , " " visioni di venezia , " " i grandi successi originali .

after fooling around their sound their first album , audioslave break through sound their own . while first one sounded too much like rage against machine , this one mellows sound bit comes up something , if anything , more " grungy " . though not completely , i wouldn't call it soundgarden . it kind simple really easy get into , yet it not boring . i listen it over over again not get tired it . this album there softer songs like " heaven dead " , " curse " , " yesterday tomorrow " ; but there also harder ones like " your time come " ( which sounds lot like lesser known metallica song called " bad seed " ) , " drown me slowly " , " man or animal " . " doesn't remind me " melody sounds almost hippie-ish " #1 zero " probably best song i've heard them play . chris sounds amazing this song , he always . tom spends less time making weird sounds more time just doing some great guitar playing . last album , there wasn't really any time you could say " man awesome solo ! " here , although alot music more mellow , there some really hard heavy-metal style solos riffs better too . also brad drumming much more lively here , more fills three drum solos ( okay , i'm not calling him neil peart , but it hell alot better than basic 1-2-3-4 click track drumming plagued most first album ) . audioslave went release more funk-influenced album after this but this stands my favorite three i would recommend this anyone who enjoys straight-out rock roll doesn't mind it little simple . audioslave this album : chris cornell - vocalstim commerford - bassbrad wilk - drumstom morello - guitar	1
i must say when i first heard " kick push " i thought myself this guy really something talk because he such metaphoric rhymer his delivery very strong so i know i buy lupe fiasco debut album " food liquor " . after listening this album beginning end i not all disappointed but indeed this album really let me know there still few rappers out there still kicking rhymes issues we deal everyday life instead hearing these other mc dont rap anything except cars , clothes , jewelry , women . i would recommend this album anyone fan real rap because this album open your eyes alot things life . my 5 favorite tracks : 1 . " cool " - this song basically young man who died(not literally ) but he able come back life try make change better but same time he chose live his life same way he lived it once before . song very metaphor deep . 2 . " he say she say " - this song little boy who doesnt visible father it affecting him deeply . 3 . " hurt me soul " - this song talks just any issue you think women degraded rap music , drug dealing , crooked cops , government not offering black people welfare overcharging healthcare , johns prostitutes . song also very nice hook . 4 . " sunshine " - this song this girl he falls love club eventhough he not looking love he cannot resist it this girl . 5 . " pressure " featuring jay-z- very nice concept it lupe standpoint eventhough im not big jay-z fan he still put down nice verse . other songs i like " just might ok " , " daydreaminin " , " kick push " , " i gotcha " , " instrumental " , " american terrorists " . i would recommend this album anyone who true fan real rap because it not disappoint you all !!!!	1
this album just good all other tool cd . tool real artists , unlike 99% all other " rock " bands these days , tool real talent doesn't care mtv or all other mainstream crap . if you like real music get this cd . however , if you like 12 years old only watch mtv then get fall out boy or some crappy pop/rock band like	1
if you fan church you enjoy fine re-working some classic church songs . new arrangements emphasize acoustic but still retain " spacey " feel marks music produced kilbey , willson-piper , koppes , powles . stripped down versions bring brand new sort freshness , emphasizes absolute beauty found some tunes . plus , 5 new creative songs justify 4.5 - 5.0 star rating . new listeners choice titles melodic approach makes accesibility novice ears . highly recommended	1
movie : ***** dvd quality : ***** dvd extras : *** dramas _teenage gays coming out closet ! _ so plentiful , they sometimes run together my mind . " edge seventeen " exception statement because it genuinely exceptional movie every way . screenplay todd stephens sensitive true life , or rather , many people lives . it tells story eric ( chris stafford ) , young man growing up small town sandusky , ohio , who just beginning grapple his sexual orientation . what so refreshing script eric portrayed neither victim nor hero ; he simply kid cusp adulthood who trying find himself . eric sometimes selfish thoughtless ; other times sweet naive ; occasionally manipulative ; but generally good guy ... other words : completely human . holds true other characters movie , including eric parents who love him dearly but aren't quite sure what make his fast-changing moods appearance ; his female best friend ( tina holmes ) who harbors deeper feelings him ; his new gay " family " ( headed lea delaria ) who fiercely supportive , yet sometimes insensitive where he terms his coming out process . thankfully , stephens ' screenplay remains true itself right down final fadeout doesn't cop out trying wrap everything up into neat little package ; end movie , there definite sense these characters continue live , learn , make mistakes , thrive . ( sequel , anyone ? )the entire cast uniformly outstanding . chris stafford embodies eric all his complexity ; his performance never strikes false note . tina holmes amazing his confused female friend ; more than once her face vocal inflections reminded me extremely young meryl streep ( high compliment indeed ) . stephanie mcvay distinguishes herself eric baffled mother , andersen gabrych fine eric first same sex crush whose confident veneer covers troubled heart . perhaps best all comic lea delaria , who turns warm winning dramatic performance earth mother whose wisdom understanding always available eric , regardless how hard he sometimes pushes her away . strand dvd offers flawless letterboxed transfer featuring outstanding audio video . somewhat sparse extras limited theatrical trailers " edge seventeen " five other feature films designed appeal lgbt audiences . it would wonderful additional benefit cast crew biographies filmographies reasearch tool viewers who want explore others works filmmakers , but this small complaint . overall , this truly must-see film , one worthy repeat viewings .	1
this cd marks cornerstone reich . delightful sextet he things bowing marimbas or playing them normally . first its parts , 5 , unfolds brilliantly his classic minimal manner . 3rd most fun . 5th , its intricacies wild wild pulses end , always leaves me breathless . then , six marimbas one his greatest even tapestries . i recommend this cd most highly anyone interested reich	1
heard this one radio -- oddly , track " ballad yvonne johnson " , knew immediately i it . it all this aspects just what draws me record -- it rootsy , it political , it told story true ( i totally " felt " yvonne johnson end ) , told fearlessly unflinchingly , it this amazing , distinctive , absolutely perfect woman voice . cd full great songs , standouts me " hiway 9 " " dark side town " " wonderland " , but i love everything here . my tastes eclectic -- just check out what i reviewed this point -- i enjoy good singer songwriter stuff . but my standard dylan , townes , guy clark , stuff some meat it , stuff well - chosen words , frankly , bit attitude . this record meets standard . it also wonderful voice .	1
this cool album . my favorite nelly songs it , nelly lot funny stuff it , too . i should add he also sways singing rapping . whatever , here very best songs(in my opinion)hot herre-a funny song , perfect raunchy moments . also my favorite nelly song all time . best time listen this song summer . work it-i don't know where begin . so i'll just say this much-it very cool interesting lyrics , one best tunes this side hip-hop music . # 1/number one-nelly shows many challenges life how he got one top artists this very stellar well put together song . there many other songs i like , but i'm only showing top 3 here . but , anyway , this very good cd if you like nelly , you should buy it . oh , nelly my second favorite rapper all time next who else but eminem	1
great , i get 4th reviewer . i guess sums up how popular this band . well , rare gems hard find . this disk lot variety but dmst definitely distinct sound . i there previous 2 disks think this one best . more warm cozy , country feel it . some it very beautiful , some slightly annoying noisy . if you investigating them because godspeed constellation stuff , they not same . well , you get some tremelo guitar ( what anyway ) , but music far more pleasant palatible . enjo	1
i dont want or need add anything these performances , - other reviewers spot , - they simply wonderful , life affirming , even . what i would like comment sound . this forty year old set , always sounded good . recently , however , i upgraded my beloved castle howard s3s nakamichi amp quad esl63s twin valve amps new valve pre-amp . so , you imagine , i've rummaging through my collection , hearing everything afresh . amazing discoveries ? several , but this among happiest . this forty year old sound fresh daisy , - it superbly re-mastered superb masters sounds , well , superb . so dont just think you're getting one gramophone most precious performances , you're also getting sound better than you could possibly expected	1

nothing stands out this record except genuine feeling melancholly . if you're looking complex sounds or melodies , maybe you'll find some here , but i think you're probably better off something like killers if you claim that what you want . this isn't pop music , this rock roll its purest . pop music stuff they play radio ' cause everyone recognize it its own song instantly ... rock whatever it it couldn't care less what you think it . i like this album ' cause it stands true its morbidly romantic title ; i actually no longer own this cd ' cause i too felt it too generic although it started grow me when i wasn't really wanting it ( i don't know why , this almost year ago if not ); i since managed experience several feel- " good " listens rhapsody.com, i'm really seriously thinking buying this again . i haven't found better example this " kind " music , except maybe couple songs here there , but not entire albums devoted this feeling self-loathing romance combined . fall out boy killers both topping headlines these days , but why ? fall out boy music more generic than this sense doesn't any place society heart , supposing society one . yeah , some their songs you kinda love get stuck your head ' cause it gets you devoted band but one spin opener " our lawyers made us ... " enough ruin someone entire day . killers some good music , but little if any it found radio . i like " change your mind " " believe me natalie " songs like , but stuff got me familiar band musically just catchy jingles . let me put it this way ; if you want your heart feel music , buy this supposing loud music doesn't bother you . if you want something occupy your mind , buy fall out boy or any other top selling music act . personally , i attest firmly idea mind polutant ; it deceives itself , more often than not tends wither up waste away due lack excercise ( or more like lack training ; no one willingly exercises their mind w/o prior encouragement ) , it importance sooooo over-rated . heart life may fake or it may more real than anything , but i think reality itself or any aspect thereof could just easily said same . what person w/o his/her ability feel reality ? i feel reality , i feel this music . i still admit this isn't best i could 1/10 way imagine ; not heavenly calls angels sing my hopes , but post-punk band , it shiznit !!	1
i first purchased this album tape 1992 . unfortunately , some criminal broke my car stole my tapes . well unless they keen ear music , they probably couldn't sell these average purchaser hot items . this album beyond great . i loved it over eight years . out 100 tapes stolen , this one hardest replace . good lover ...... great , sweetest thing ... excellent . whole thing must	1
redwalls imitative , yes . there certainly times , while listening album , you'll hear other , better acts . some point , you may think you're listening lennon luscious vocals " tomorrow never knows , " but it just redwalls . just redwalls , but still good still lot fun . these guys lot spunk great live . really great . cd host few uniquely redwall moments . first track killer , abrupt musical transition near end song truly beautiful . these guys no dylan or beatles , but no one ever going , they'd probably first tell you so ; i heard them unabashedly cover their musical heroes cover them well . all this said , cd listenable ; there no bad tracks . de nova won't go down history timeless cd mine or anybody else collection , but doesn't mean it isn't worthy some listens then maybe few more . i buy next release , gladly ; i see them live again , gladly . i give this album four stars . redwalls accomplish what they set out . they prove their thesis , so speak , but don't they set world fire process . , record , i'd rather listen them over pretentious phonies like cold play " any day , any day , any day ... " ( that me imitating smiths because i am not original either . ) happy listening . let them you what they ask no more . you won't disappointed	1

it punk ? it goth ? alternative ? metal ? play this cd 10 different people i bet few them agree how categorize it . that one things makes it great . if you afi fan their early days three-chord songs answer stay fashionable , then this likely wouldn't appeal you . this not punk sense their earlier cds ( yes , i heard them ) . but punk influence still there , particularly vocals " but home nowhere " " bleed black . " someone who only listens pop radio , they would think this punk . someone who thinks crass real punk , they obviously wouldn't . if you look through one-star reviews , lot them people who mad afi " sold out " sign major label no longer sounds like they when they writing breakfast cereal . nor this goth , per se , but if you only read lyric sheet looked photo band this era , you might assume they goth . okay , review : this cd amazing . i grew up listening old punk goth , yet my days wanting listen those exclusively mostly over . life gotten too complicated me invest time energy into concerned categorization or " selling out . " afi appeals part me liked those styles music , because i still hear those influences . my favorite songs this cd vary almost day , i love each them best different times . atmospheric call arms " miseria cantare " incredibly energizing almost bouncy " this celluloid dream , " there enough variety here keep it interesting . it not like listening same song over over . " ... but home nowhere " positively epic . lyrics worthwhile read commit memory , dark almost poetic times . if , like me , you grew up listening cure , bauhaus , joy division , etc . you might just love this cd . davey havok guys afi combining varied influences interesting , complex way . passion this music undeniable . after i got this cd , it almost three weeks before i even wanted listen anything else , just because i kept discovering something new subsequent listens . all afi cds something offer , i really like all them different reasons . but this one true masterpiece great introduction anyone considering checking out afi .	1

often called world greatest guitar player , eric clapton certainly upper echelon rock elite . his career spanned five decades , both member three successful bands later brilliant solo career . " cream clapton " contains 19 tracks all stages eric career , his days cream ( " sunshine o your love " , " white room " , " crossroads " , " badge " ) , blind faith ( " presence lord " ) , derek dominoes ( " bell bottom blues " course " layla " ) his solo career ( " i shot sheriff " , his great cover " knockin ' heaven door " , " cocaine " , " wonderful tonight " , " promises , " i can't stand it " ) . all songs sound great , even though they could still use tad bit more tweaking . my only major qualm this collection there few good songs missing . " lay down sally " , example , got all way up number three billboard hot 100 , yet it not make it onto this collection . also , while it most likely not included personal reasons ( though it made it onto later , inferior collection " clapton chronicles " ) , " tears heaven " also huge hit . " forever man " one clapton few quality recordings 1980s ' , it also warrants place this collection . last but not least , clapton two pretty big hits after this collection released : " change world " ( which made it number five hot 100 stayed there nearly year ) " my father eyes " . granted , i know they came afterwards , but i'd like see them appear collection someday . hopefully , clapton get two cd collection all his best work someday , but until now , " crwam clapton " offers exactly , what it promises , even if it only sampler	1

i think what many people not understand this cd , well sacred revolution , they live recordings conferences such oneday passion . songs these cds mere snippets over-all experience each conference . me , they serve reminders conferences bring back memories what i learned experienced there ( which , passion conference always profound challenging ) . unlike concert , where focus music audience enjoyment , songs passion conference specifically coincide what happening , either message just given , or perhaps focus moment ( missions , prayer , adoration , specific verse etc ) . cds contain " most memorable " songs moments those who participated , which probably doesn't necessarily resonate those who weren't there . artists cd all their own albums , which probably more representative their musical abilities produced wider audience . if you haven't attended passion conference , you may not " get " this cd . so instead complaining this album , i'd recommend all artists ' individual projects : david crowder band , chris tomlin , charlie hall , shane shane , christy nockels	1

big rich took music industry storm when this , their first album , hit #1 billboard charts 2004 . some people criticize their fusion country rock , but i must say i think they fantastic . first all , i must say combination big kenny alphin john rich voices produces music real feeling power like i never felt before . also , while they most know their bouncy songs like save horse ( ride cowboy ) , they broad range song style , such songs drinkin ' `bout you , touching holy water , inspirational saved . overall , i really like big rich , think they great career front them . i yet heard big rich song i didn't like , this album really great one listen my long car rides . so , if you want hear great album , lots genre-busting songs , then get this album . it superb	1
ok , i just could not resist coming here review this . i've this cd 4 years now i still listen quite bit , proof right there this cd definetly classic ( my book least ) every single song here original , guitar riffs simply amazing , lyrics i not even describe words how much they hit home how breathtaking they . if your goo goo doll fan , you still not this cd , i deeply encourge you go buy it now ! this goos like you've never heard them before . cd pure genius , my opinion best cd i've ever heard	1
gene vincent probably one most forgotten acts ' 50 , because other than " be-bop-a-lula " , you ususally won't hear any his songs any oldies stations . that shame , because there some real gems here . lot songs goofy ' 50s feeling them , " hey cat " , etc ., but if you overlook , you're real treat . gene his blue caps all great musicians , but guitarist cliff gallup really steals show most songs . johnny meeks plays lead last three tracks . hear cliff his best take listen " race devil " . i'm sure his guitar work astounded people ' 50 , it even more refreshing listen , now . playing gretsch duo jet single-coil pickups , he tears through his solos smoothness seasoned jazz player , yet rockabilly attitude . if you like rockabilly or just like old ' 50 rock , give this disk spin . if you overlook lyrics , you'll see how timeless this music really .	1
" goo " never sounded any better . sonic youth first major label album mixed reviews , hardcore fans , " industry " , mainstream , yes , even band itself . however , this deluxe edition sounds incredibly good just new powerful sounding any other current modern release . this re-master finally gets band stamp approval well . while " goo " helmed transition album , some songs this album " classic " sonic youth songs , rock just good scream drone . new re-master album much more clearer than original release , allowing you hear songs breath flow , especially demo version disc album . these group songs sound ten times better than old original ' bootleg ' release , show you what true " re-master " album should sound like . new bonus songs pretty good well , particularly ' tuff boyz ' ' issac ' . one thing i wished they would included live songs ' dirty boots ' single , which ' bedroom ' disc one comes . otherwise , this re-master makes great album sound even better , bring some those older fans down memory lane bit . if you got dough , i recommend getting this album , if you already own it , but if demos . rock !	1

i perusing my enormous cd collection over holiday weekend came across morcheeba " fragments freedom " cd . i haven't listened it couple years . " fragments freedom " only morcheeba cd i own so i can't compare it group other albums . i honestly didn't think " fragments freedom " bad lot people say it . i'm not big fan funk music but surprisingly enough i found myself enjoying group more funk-laden tracks like " love rare " " let it go " . " fragments freedom " far not perfect because way songs flow together which bit choppy side . i mean first two tracks gorgeous your traditional icy trip hop songs then next two ' 70s funk-laden tracks . fifth track dancehall/reggae-influenced track . i thought various sounds made album . overall sound album uneven . nevertheless i like all songs despite fact they made album sound very uneven	1
i can't believe how utterly wrong other reviewers blasted new lead singer ( baby ) lyrics , melodies production ( bathwater) ! this cd even surpasses their best , initial effort , " who you trust " ! there not dud song list ( like , big calm " sea " " digging watery grave " ) pretty much everything " fragments freedom .

disraeli gears cream breakthrough achievement . their most famous piece work , their highest praised too . , it deserves all this . album fully entertaining . some spots may lower than usual standard , but it doesn't really get boring . length okay , some say it too short , but i like my albums this long . songs then . album kicks off strange brew . though it isn't much opener ( i'd put swlabr instead ) , it still nice song some nice clapton blues licks . after , bruce kicks agressive bass line , eric follows guitar riff everybody knows : sunshine your love . standout thing this song baker drums , course , you can't forget clapton solo . last two songs singles , so album really starts after sunshine your love . world pain got some mixed up melodies , may require few listens get used . i like song . dance night away one my favourite songs album . eric ginger really make this one . clapton rhythm guitar tone excellent here , leads sound pretty psychedelic . i really like drums during chorus . blue condition isn't very good track . it drags , lyrics sound strange it repetitive , plus it isn't fun last two . i like some parts it though . tales brave ulysses sounds lot like white room , song band would release later . white room much better . it album instead , put opener , this could my favourite album ever . anyway , song isn't bad . not much say it , though i'm not fond lyrics . swlabr damn fine track , most fun album . hooks get your head you'll singing them no time . great solo there . we're going wrong excellent . atmosphere set up ginger drums , then eric joins soft guitar then some nice licks . i like jack vocals this . i don't know what happened near end , when eric ginger go crazy play something completely out context , but then jack closes song nicely . outside woman blues i'm not much fond . blues lick repeated too many times , it isn't song i particularly like . take it back got fun start , i like john vocal start , but then it loses its magic . group finishes album mother lament , joke song , doesn't spoil album any way . i like how they sing boy-by . anyway , damn fine album , very enjoyable some nice songs . i highly recommend it .	1
wow . where i even begin ? it sad think so many americans misinformed iraq war terror this darryl worley . first off , i don't know anyone who saying " you shouldn't worry bin laden . " if anything people against war iraq wanted our government spend more time efforts tracking down al-qaeda leader . fact bush jr. not make hunt bin laden his #1 priority one many reasons why millions americans voted kerry . they want leader who stand up protect us mastermind who attacked us not send us wild goose chase like what bush jr. unfortunatly . think once darryl ! next , if you going write song invading iraq least make references it . also , now war iraq our president approval ratings so low . i doubt darryl worley would ever make sequel song staying course iraq . he his managers probably thinking next tragedy cash . hmmmm maybe he $ing hurricane katrina next ... we spent so-far 500 billon dollars more than worth human life lost iraq , all war " ended " according our president may 1 , 2003 . perhaps , outsourcing jobs other countries should extended crappy songwriters too .	-1

reviewer amazon , discussing different album , stated album he reviewing would one he would use introduce alien rock roll music first time . interesting question , my own surprise , one i immediately my own answer . iggy stooges ' ' raw power ' not my all-time favorite album . however , i believe it very essence everything makes me love rock music . bad attitude , feeling it all explode into violent mess any second , distorted , kick-to-the crotch mix , menacing lyrics all say , " this rock . " i would not end introduction rock music raw power , but i think argument made this one best places start . come think it , maybe raw power my all-time favorite album ..	1
since going buying spree this web-site , i added large number unknown guitar heros odd god . i forced give 5 stars most am stunned addition my collection re-rating my former heros . most outstanding all new aquisitions andy timmons . i quite like vi / satriani / mcalpine / malmsteen / others this genre , but it often hard listen whole cd . these virtuosos not always gifted writers often work tired formula give their pirotechniques some framework . timmons rare his total control over guitar matched some astonishing compositions . supreme beauty huge range influences mark this cd very special . only gary hoey offers same quality material well unsurpassed virtuosity . he speed burn , but doesn't make it his only or main tool . his tone inventiveness stand above all others . vi also very inventive , but some his more bizzare stylings hard ear . nothing this cd hard ear , even when timmons reaches extremes his genre he remains totaly entertainig listenable	1
mitch hedberg classic one-liners looked life completely different view . i love his type off-the-wall humor . i can't say enough this cd , i've listened it 30 times already i laugh harder harder each time .	1
meat loaf voice never better but quality songs bat i ii vastly superior . " monster loose , " " land king ... " " if it ain't broke ...

high-profile snafu pepsi bill o'riley his movie roles , ludacris keeps busy . it easy think he not focusing rap game if he into so much other stuff right ? wrong . chicken -n- beer , atlanta-bred rapper third release def jam 4-star effort , far his best album date . ludacris , relies heavily his own talent his crew , disturbing tha peace ( dtp ) . 13 tracks , only four feature established artists . high-profile vocals include snoop dogg " hoes my room , " chingy " we got , " 8 ball mjg carl thomas " hard times " houston lil flip " screwed up . " production team chicken -n- beer assorted order . erick sermon , kanye west , dj paul juicy " " share roster lesser-known beat masters icedrake , ruh anubis , jook . beats provided this team more than enough hook listener , but craftily they don't overshadow ludacris flow . recipe album similar rapper prior two : freestyle sessions , smoking drinking , partying , sex , introspection pimpin ' . ingredients similar other mainstream rap albums but ludacris charismatic delivery hilarious rhymes continue make him stand out . lead single , " stand up " kanye west-produced ( ludacris co-produced ) club banger . it right amount energy punch lines makes it enjoyable club well car . standout track " splash waterfalls . " verses follow progression romantic relationship -- one that full kinky sex . but verses aren't what make this song great . icedrake put together track that mellow background but laced fierce drum loop full bounce . " screwed up " ludacris ode houston style " screwed " music . beat sounds bit like slowed down circus ditty laced lot bounce beat machine . lil flip lends his drawled vocals few verses they flip staying high off weed lean . " hip hop quotables " version three freestyle track always appeared ludacris albums erick sermon minimalist head-bobbing production allowing listeners pay attention lyrics . punch lines come back back back this track . don't laugh too much or you'll miss next joke . ludacris continues improve lyricist despite keeping busy movies his philanthropic efforts . chicken -n- beer served up well fans want large order .	1

when you think great work all terms so this one . this album perfect contrasting two sides(vinyl talking ) , environment side one environment other side totally balanced way . i agree critics when they say this would considered pink floyd " magnum opus " if " dark side moon " hadn't appeared . i'm sure when you musician this kind work you spend all your life searching , floyd searching time indeed . why i afirm this , because this album absolutely cohesive convincing , it unique sounding , what obvious case pink floyd work , they truly sounds different among all rock groups . since first notes " one these days " group creation avant garde piece music , it starts two delayed basses lines echoe device after wind blows suddenly , you'll never listen something like this anymore your life , very creative inventive . second part this finishes slide guitar gilmour more wind blowing , superb . my opinion most intelligent love song ever composed " pillow winds " , what superb piece music , man , it perfect , really , it portrait mutual contribution roger waters david gilmour , waters wrote lyrics gilmour music , lyrics description moment life when you just resting calmly , your love your side she breathing low , waters write genius : - " deep beneath ground early morning sounds , i go down , sleeping time when i lie , my love my side , she breathing low , i rise like bird haze when first rays touch sky , night winds die " - . this lyrics shows absolute lyrical genius waters , it suppose love song but he transformed it into deep philosophical moment deep meanings , all love songs should like this one , music gentle gilmour waters playing acoustic guitars gentle way , very well played , wow . third song best one first side , " fearless " , one more superb waters/gilmour compositional contribution , acoustic guitar riff , immediately captivating , genius lyrics , - " you say hill too steep climb " - , waters point view you get your life your hands when you decide , portraited this song , beguinning he starts indecision , but end song he decides made it happen , - " no doubt your own way , every day right day , you rise above fear-lines his brow , you look down hear sound faces crowd " - . next song jazzy " san tropez " very good sound kind relaxing song , side one ends idea copied all around world , put dog vocalist song , very brave them , this demonstrated they never really wanted commercial band , anyway . side one greatest pieces music ever composed any popular band world , " echoes " . critics like describe this music cathedral sounds starts ground top main tower beeing constructed gradually perfect intricate way , beguinning end without any weak part it . first sounds you discern like sonar sounds played rick wright piano , after starts gentle guitar carefully played drums , it like introduction , preparation classical music terms , waters enters bass playing just after starts singing double tracking vocals gilmour/wright working very well . melody gentle beautiful , gilmour guitar playing he himself said right place , he found his own style this album . middle section it exploration experimentation sound effects my opinion most effective ever made . floyd most gifted group terms sound effects creation , they never made useless effects , they've always used exact amount , but this album effects like whales crying deep distant cold ocean simply superb there no other word describe it , following section instrumental section , best one all floyd carreer . group sounds like orchestra , gilmour describes his own words , " end echoes this kind guitar orchestra going ... i still think this wonderful . " if creator said what else would i say . they finished this absolute masterpiece music total symmetry , after climax they made coda movement like classical music piece , they recover vocal part walk end concluding sonar wright piano sound million human voices ressounding deep soul . if you music lover never listened this superb work art , you discover this kind thing transform your conception life totally different one perspective , irreversible way . you never same after this listening . buy this album remenber what i told you . this album mainly " echoes " pink floyd sounds so cohesive they seems like classical orchestra , it sometimes difficult believe there only four musicians playing . buy it fast you . five stars not enough this album . i agree score given one " kid-reviwer " , made review good any adult would make , below , but only disagree score 9/10 " pillow winds " , time goes you listen this song several times , it increases more more perfection untill you recognize this song masterpiece , so me " pillow winds " 10/10 song , indeed .	1
this album shows just what unique talent john fogerty truly . he goes country " chicken pickin ' guitar work big train ( memphis ) all way hard rocking mr. greed which he lashes out way he treated certain record executives . i am also happy say his anti war stance alive well heard song " i saw it tv " where father grieves loss his son futile unnecessary war which only boosted corporate profits . this album should compulsory listening any teenage aspiring guitarists songwriters . mr. fogerty may grown up california but his heart still louisianna bayous . naturally 5 stars this album i would give it 10 if i could	1
release " ashanti " , artist became major name release popular single " foolish " . many believed ashanti new major name rb , more modern ( less capable ) mary . blige . it because this hype singer album such dissapointment . each song album similar sound sounds very like it produced irv gotti rest murder inc . constant interruptions irv gotti other murder inc members doesn't complement ashanti voice album would sounded much better if it only contained her voice . 1 . " intro " - unnecessary filler contains samples past songs ashanti featured . poor opening album . 2 . " foolish " - best song album clear choice first single . good production good vocals ashanti . 3 . " happy " - little immature but still solid effort ashanti . use ja rule unnecessary start song . catchy chorus . 4 . " leaving ( always time part 2) " - unnecessary sequel " always time " . sounds very similar original only original much better . 5 . " narative call ( interlude) " - terrible interlude put fill album . 6 . " call " - nice beat good enough lyrics . grow tiresome after while . 7 . " scared " - sounds very like it produced irv gotti contains unnecessary bad language . would better without irv gotti it . it still decent track ashanti voice complements it . 8 . " rescue " - very good production generally good song although music goes far too long end . ashanti vocals quite similar tracks before . 9 . " baby " - i don't know why she released this track . it so corny lyrics awful . production isn't great either . 10 . " voodoo " - annoying interlude start track follows quite bland . chorus isn't any way special ashanti vocals become annoying this point . 11 . " movies " - very rb song works well although it isn't well made . bad lyrics but what you expect such immature rb release . 12 . " fight ( over skit) " - awful use time record . it just excuse use much bad language possible minute . there shouldn't need spoken interludes good record . 13 . " over " - slightly bland . ashanti voice doesn't really suit song well . 14 . " unfoolish " - very similar " foolish " . still it nice track add album it adds something unusual , biggie verse . 15 . " shi shi ( skit) " - we don't want hear ashanti sister saying nothing few seconds . awful . 16 . " dreams " - nice idea but turns out very cheesy . 17 . " thank you " - ashanti doesn't manage her vocals well this track it too short . should left off . overall there far too much filler album make it decent . ashanti would much better if she signed record label taken her time her first record instead releasing this rushed job . most interesting thing album images which always bad sign . she show potential singer could release something significance future . until then i would reccomend people avoid this rushed job anything she released since ( possibly download some singles ) . there much better comtemporary rb singers out there . mark- 3/1	-1
hey compilation good way find new bands guitar vader one them if you familiar jet set radio future then you should know them love super brother polysics black out fall out well forgot what seven track called but buy it anywa	1
i purchased import copy b/c it took 18 mos release their last disk stateside . i am first admit i mildly disappointed this wasn't more vein ' long gone before daylight ' . ' super extra gravity ' still good disk - one blends ' lgbd ' w/it predecessor ' gran turismo ' . first half this disk just ok . starting off w/ " losing friend " still seems like bad move me , " godspell " would made more welcoming intro . but once you hit " i need some fine wine you , you need nicer " it all good . it take me little bit warm up disk , but time worth it . love " little black cloud " , " round " " good morning joan " ( great chorus ) . first i thought sequel " then he kissed me " bad bad idea . initially it some elements original , but tune seemed off . after repeated plays it better , but it isn't original . this import price comparable most domestic disks .... it may or may not released u.s. you might consider picking it up this way	1
well after reading all one star reviews i my doubts , but i went out bought it whim . i am pleased say it completely flies face those one-star reviewers . most them referred it emo band ; those people seriously need learn different genres before throwing them around . this band far emo . it sounds much closer punk , some slightly heavier elements , more diverse sound strangely enough violin , which seems add extra dimension music , almost guides you through song . it quite hard explain , so i would recommend buying album listening yourself . it fantastic cd .	1
i actually like this one better than first one , mainly because " heaven not enough " , which i loved show , whatever episode it . i also really like " mouth fire " , " face " , " cloud 9 " , but album whole excellent . my only complaints it would nice both english non-kanji translations japanese lyrics , but would take up more liner note space . also , what up bonus secret track 23	1

this who 2006 . finally after what left band plus 4 some superb musicians like pino palladino , zack starkey , simon townshend john " rabbit " bundrick , entered studio pete townshend not only writing all songs but producing mixin , we who first taste their complete new collection songs since 1982 " it ' hard " , cd great songs production but wrong runnin order ( same problem " who you " ) . who began recording this cd 2002 when john entwistle still alive . they practice 3 songs released two " now then " " greatest hits " cd two simon townshend produced songs : " real good looking boy " ( tribute elvis pete himself ) , great tribute song john entwistle " old red wine " . they practice roger daltrey song called " certified rose " remains unreleased best who tradition . john entwistle recorded many songs his own this proyect but not gave roger pete , steve luongo said interview ... sad thing neither roger or pete took time ask them order hear them . so wire glass result 23 years wait what we hear valuable very good who disc . production mix , leaves space better sound but songs rendition very good indeed . roger daltrey s` voice sound ever some songs , others like last verses " we got hit " , fails little . other hand , pete townshend ' rendition songs he sings , leaves you wanting more better ; it not bad all , but we know he sing lot better . peter .. drums very very good , he even treats songs like keith moon would it . pino palladino justice john entwistle , he really into songs great similarity what john entwistle could . me best one " mirror door " vintage who song derivative cords bridge " behind blue eyes " , ends similar way " dogs " . also , " we got hit " sounds fresh very good song . old songs like " punk meets godfather " , " bell boy " , " behind blue eyes " , " dogs " " sustitute " among others alive new ones . but main source inspiration seems " punk meets godfather " , song " quadrophenia " , who played their 2004 tour . this moment ( complete new cd not yet released ) , i able hear other songs fortcoming album among them : " mike post theme " ( good song guitar chords derivative " punk meets godfather " middle bridge " acid queen " , also " it not enough " ( song selected " single " new album writen rachell fuller pete townshend ) , two others . it seems we finally receive very good who cd after 23 long years . there lot new who material ( or related ) this moment such " live toronto " ( great set list but poor sound ) , pete townshend , roger daltrey ' john entwistle ' double " antology " cd , reisues all band members solo cds extra songs . also some great dvds such john entwistle ' " ox story " tipton , entwistle powell cd ) . last but not least , keith moon ' " two sides moon " . prepare your wallets !!!!!!!!!!!	1

like come back album weezer , this review short . just over 28 minutes long , this album barely gives you opportunity get into before it leaving stage . you listen it few times before songs stop blending into 28 minute stream power chord pep . but said lot really good albums ( blending bit , not pep bit ) . said , this album true weezer upbeat fun loving pop sound . hash pipe , photograph , island sun , simple pages o girlfriend power distinguish themselves fold while rest may you singing but most likely won't make it your shower concert set list . honestly , though , i am amazed ( pleasantly suprised ) how far weezer able push this sound . overall , i am very pleased this album only taking off points length couple duds . if they would included sugar booger , it would five star sure . side note , my fiance ' i doing our first dance island sun . it should pretty amusing	1

when i listen music , i like listen real thing . hank sr. real thing . let me just say it out right : i love music hank williams . his earliest recordings through last , demo through live stuff , radio shows through his spirituals . no one sings ' em like hank . think all this accomplished less than 10 years ! true hillbilly singer every sense phrase . other words , there no mistaking him fake country music today . me this box set represents everything country music should , i thank folks polygram/mercury keeping this great music alive . folks who program modern country radio should listen this set prerequisite before entering into their field . maybe then we wouldn't listen majority current crop country pap out there who seem more into rock pop than country music . i'm not going squabble how ' incomplete ' this set really . add every single recording - including live stuff demos - would make this box set so outrageously priced no one would able afford it . it his complete mgm studio recordings , what i believe title pertains . hank williams truly musical hero mine , true legend 20th century	1

short , this cd half good half crap . cd starts strong catchy guitar , obvious sharp synth parts . thing gets me this bands over popularity genre music around over 25 years . frontman brandon flowers complains other successful new wave/postgarage bands success ( bravery , fever , bloc party , moving units ) they " riding our success " . meanwhile killers go tour depeche mode after they reach platinum status some reason flowers doesn't take hint . he simply become depeche mode 2004-whenever this band breaks up ( cuz they should ) . unfortunately this band lot less talent than depeche mode , seeing how flowers voice overly futzed mastering he uses pitch corrector concert . plus half their cd sucks their new cd isn't sounding much better . new single awful . quite terrible . now i know this review get bunch thumbs down , but i know those people who listened each single radio know nothing real music , music history , or probably even how play instrument , so it won't bother me . if you want real new wave alternative rock check out these bands : braverykaiser chiefsmoving unitsbloc partythe feverthe unicornswolf paradethe dove	-1

i never expected this album wonderful it . much i enjoyed it lead single , " say i " , i simply thought it filled tracks i wouldn't enjoy . this key example us never judging book it cover . this one best albums i heard quite long time . i enjoy every single track . christina voice shined like radiant light throughout . while christina doesn't such strong voice , she holds her when vocally competing against her contemporaries ashanti , amerie , cassie host others . cool dre impressed me album production . album different sound , but it good different . change good , this instance , change exceeds good . " so amazin '" ( title track ) showcases christina versatility . chorus lyrics so simple , but it just enjoyable ! christina talks sings throughout this song . i revelled production this song , too . this album great indeed , but " she don't know " stand out . christina hispanic , so she included some spanish this song she sounds so good vocally this song . it man not going home his woman , because he . " who gonna ride " great song , which obviously nick cannon . this track christina asking nick who going there him now she not there anymore . i highly recommend this album anyone ; especially those who underestimate christina milian artist . i would put this album up against rb ladies who compete against her because this disc just good . it so amazin'mikeisha top 51 . say i2 . who gonna ride3 . she don't know4 . gonna tell everybody5 . just little bi	1

i love sublime many years . they far my favorite best band ever . this very excellent cd truely portrays sublime live essence . however sound quality poor bradley misses few lines songs such date rape , caress me down . personally i think thats makes it better , but non-sublime fans would disagree . definitly must cd , but make sure you've listen " 40 oz freedom " or their self titled album first . sublime kicks	1
kenny dorham , besides prolific composer ( more styles than one ) , one hell player ; unit assembled here : cecil payne , j.j. johnson , oscar pettiford , ' potato ' valdez , blakey , know afro-cubano genre well any - it shows . these particular tracks smoke start finish . " afrodesia " , dorham opener , sets tone great stuff come afro-cubano tracks , #1 -5 . i see if someone bought cd expecting nothing but afro-cubano jazz , they may feel bit cheated . i don't . i suprised when mood shifted , but these grat jazz sessions , too , their own right genre , classic sidemen like silver , heath , mobley(in great form ) , payne , , again , blakey . i think this dorham best stuff , both genres	1
i'm repeating myself some same sentiments other writers but feel compelled say something . this cd good . course radiohead comes mind but this band its own thing , not copycat ( which sometimes i think muse ) . these guys fabulous every song gem . now , how many first cd you say ? see , i think people planes comes tradition great music following progression yes , nektar , early genesis , progressing tool , radiohead finally people planes . they not missed . get it right away . it wonderful !	1
if you're going buy it , here hint . not listen it late night when it pitch black outside . totally freaky ! but this cd rocks !!!! i love #1 , 2 , 6 , 13 . those best	1
well ice talking street but nwa coming out harder more aggressive this sound . man this where gangsta rap got started this album . nwa pioneers straight outta compton one greatest rap albums all time . before them no one talking police brutality or gang life or even yelling fu@% tha police but nwa guts say all this . before people wanta yell g-unit or game man they nowhere if it wasn't eazy , dr. dre , ice cube , dj yella , d.o.c. mc ren . these six men changed rap forever . now everyone want immitate them sound like them , but you can't they too original sound can't touch . people these day don't even give this album respect it deserves . they rather hear crappy tunes like lean wit it rock wit it or laffy taffy . man forget those wack songs man go buy this album blast it your stereo . some songs great straight outta compton , fu@% tha police , 8 ball , if it ain't ruff , bit@# bit@# . if you want get into some hard west coast sounds than look no further than nwa . they invented it they always rememberd it . rip eazy .	1
i trashed sound quality new reissue mountain quot ; climbingquot ; improperly lumped quot ; nantucket sleighridequot ; it . but there really isn't much tape hiss this one , sound quality much improved over original issue . needless say , this classic album , well worth getting its enhanced sound . but hang your old quot ; climbingquot ; cd -- new one isn't any better . i guess i should assume original master quot ; climbingquot ; basically unsalvageable give sony folks break one . maybe	1
i lent this album friends uk warning '' go , try get one these songs out your head . '' it stick mind . once one these songs gets into your head , it doesn't let go weeks upon weeks . when you're finally free , you just may tentatively approach el oso once again , daring try your luck song , or whole album one sitting . what amazing album . soul coughing doing some stuff american shores already making its way across europe frenzy . so you give them credit opening up styles drum bass america , catching up europe quickly rising scene . i mean , you go throughout music history find elements this , probably disprove what i've just said . or you just buy el oso , listen it , hear how different it sounds lot acts roaming sterile jungles certain american music scenes , then zip over across water england or france hear where some music going . first song i fell love el oso '' st louise listening '' . it just ' mean ' . it mike doughty voice pretty much me enthralled song . gritty , slightly nasal , but so much character it made song '' personality '' . like it needed anyway . groove impeccable . i first heard soul coughing single '' super bon bon '' , it took ages find out who after first hearing it . time i found out , el oso released . i can't remember what i heard first this album , but it must relation finding '' super bon bon '' band who it . i must listened song see what they like , then el oso my playlist least 2 years . i haven't listened it awhile , but few weeks ago i hear '' i miss girl '' started getting withdrawal symptoms . el oso dangerous beast , i say . it melodies absolutely baiting . '' rolling '' just its repetitive nature gets you instantly recognise song get it rolling your own head . plus beat just ... well , can't really describe it . you just hear song really . '' monster man '' just kicks @ss . '' blame '' too catchy . i surprised '' circles '' song came off this more well known many . not my favourite pick el oso . it far simpler confined compared its brothers , sisters cousins existed this album , far cry '' so far i not found science '' . or '' fully retractable '' . it really album purchase . my british friends who heard it came back me weeks later asking me what i given them . it worked like virus . they couldn't get album out their heads . most times , all they could manage say '' album great , how you hear them ? '' i don't know ! it took me ages find out who '' super bon bon '' . el oso worthy purchase . must .	1
you certainly see where band should go . it powerful album some senses , but overall , it just good . pick it up , understanding it just good rock/grunge/whatever . enjoy .	1
long time fan movie soundtracks , well long time horner fan , i no trouble all " taking chance " purchasing this one . seen movie several times , i knew i treat typically spanish brass , rhythm scattered throughout score . marc anthony song " i want spend my life loving you " big reason purchase , elements this melodic love song found here there . my favorite track first one , " plaza execution " full zorro theme , arresting emotional segues , setting stage rest movie . this definitely worhty addition anyone music library , especially if they prone loving spanish music .	1
how could supposedly comprehensive compilation vu tracks not contain single cut loaded ? where " sweet jane " ? where " rock ' roll " ? those songs just much part vu legacy anything vu nico , it ludicrous they aren't represented . sure , john cale left prior loaded , but doesn't mean it isn't part band catalogue . also , there obvious predilection part whoever assembled this cd negate all great experimental work band put out . " european sun " arguably significant vu nico track " heroin " , where " sister ray " ? including only " white light/white heat " " here she comes now " makes white light/white heat seem like velvet underground nico part ii , which it obviously not . wl/wh should appreciated dark nihilist art piece it . let real vu retrospective , one better encapsulates band monolithic influence american art . better yet , let not any retrospective all .	-1
this disc features uk edition " off record " , which lacks " stairway stars " , but not worry , since it included amongst bonus tracks . other bonus tracks , you get non- l.p. b-sides " distinct lack ancient " " why don't you it me " , alternate " midnight daylight " (which debuted german 2-cd set " sweet originals " ) , disco mix " funk it up " (a capitol u.s.a. creation made via tape copy repeats certain sections . yawn ! ) , fine previously unreleased demo " lost angels " , alternate mixes " she gimme lovin '" " hard times " which heard numerous previous outtakes cd . my only complaint : tape copy used " stairway stars " audible damage during first second . obviously , it passes quickly , but it wasn't present any previous release song . oh well , it mid-price cd ...	1
david clynick nice job catching mood this album . very dark album indeed . get nice variety lounge , techno , rock , various other beats . nice ! don't need play game enjoy album , but soon you get your hands 360 check out game	1
legend it , it took quite bit convincing get karen dalton into studio record this album , it spur-of-the-moment decision . consequently , arrangements loose accompaniment not varied much--dalton 12-string ( don't hear any banjo , despite what liner notes say ) , guitar or two playing lead , spare percussion , some bass mostly extent backing instruments . fortunately , focus karen voice , which real pearl . no one else really sounded like her before or since , although this album isn't very polished , it invaluable one only two studio recordings karen ever made . although karen played whole lot folk , most these songs blues , some writing great . two fred neil cuts highlights --" little bit rain " " blues ceiling . " " ribbon bow " great brooding traditional tune . title track " right wrong or ready " also highlights . really what ties set together karen voice -- if you haven't heard it , it pretty tough describe it . it so complex , involving strained breath beginning words , kind southern-accent nasal pronunciation sounds , really guttural , emotive undertone . some people annoyed her voice , but i recommend giving it chance--it shame write off such complex gem originality sounding bit uncommon . her unique vocal tools , dalton wrings emotion , pain life out these songs . even though she didn't write them , such impressive readings , it doesn't really matter . two albums karen dalton recorded , this far away lesser jewel . its faults rooted off-the-cuff way it recorded : most backing instrument parts don't add very much songs , since it essentially jam session , playing almost frustratingly tentative -- guitars sound like they're just playing fill space end up just noodling . me , this makes overall feel album downbeat more mellow than it may sounded better arrangements preparation , or if it just dalton her guitar . it , songs kind float all sound very similar . i recommend this album , but i recommend you buy dalton second , recently reissued album my own time . it production polar opposite -- much slicker ( but not overly so ) , much more interesting impressive accompaniment , everything sounds better-prepared . additionally , song choice much more varied -- blues folk accompanied rb , rock , jazzier numbers more pop/rock sounding numbers . i think it may easier fall love karen voice starting her second album , once you've gotten into it time check this one out . it fine document showcase her voice it supplements better thought-out my own time . i hope you enjoy both albums	1
fred hersch points out his liner notes , since syncopated rhythms walt whitman poems led directly bebop beat poets , why not set leaves grass jazz ? selecting 17 passages whitman -- 11 them song myself -- hersch adds four horn players , cellist two vocalists his trio create " small-scale oratorio .

i read excellent reviews this disc her landing music publishing deal paul mccartney great expectations this former lead singer band " moon alice . " while she certainly pretty lady stunning front cover shows , i not connect much music . " different girls " plausible rocker doesn't sound unique enough nor groove great enough make me reach repeat button . australian producer chris pelcer cowrote " swim " rocks one more successful tracks simplistic lyric , " cotton candy , spin me ' round lovin ' tree , if i hold out tempting all my sweetness , sticky sticky , so good . " " radiowave " rocks some great hooks , but lyrics make it seem sophomoric , " like time bomb ticking radiowave ; i'm dancing table strawberry shake , feel like getting down dirty pocket love .

although i just got this recently , i already notice lot songs different than her older work , country note , romantic note , lighter note . she sounds like jewel never heard before , i like it ! it might take while , though , seen rating . so far i only listened this once , but i look forward hearing it again ; i mean , why else would i get it ?! my favorite song here " till we run out road " because it reminds those days when i make those transitions life just decided ride one path longest time . oh , it my latest jewel cd i don't think i made bad choice all . i may fallen it much my older ones don'y even know it yet . this leaves decent aftertaste my mind after nice food thought i given , this album she just may it right . keep up good work jewel ; i am right behind you !	1
these tracks all excellent but frankly several major country duets not here !! where earth kenny rogers dottie west ?? instead we get rogers sheena easton rogers/easton combo makes it almost entirely pop recording it should not this package . buck owens rose maddox track but where buck his far more famous duet partner susan raye ? merle haggard - janie fricke track should not included since she really only just sings harmony record . why aren't jimmy wakely margaret whiting who started male/female star duet craze 1949 slipping around here or kitty wells red foley , first superstar duet ? where ferlin husky jean shepard , jack greene jeannie seely , david houston barbara mandrell , bobby bare skeeter davis , roy drusky priscilla mitchell , don gibson dottie west , johnny duncan janie fricke , name just few famous country duos yore . instead we too many tracks same artists here . it very good package but it should great classic one	1
t.h.u.g.s. okay album but it just doesn't anything give it extra push . not recommended	-1
i like material dvd better than cd . perhaps best performance whole project john doyle karan casey pyrotechnic rendition " wind shakes barley . " ( it dvd but not cd)the best instrumental " bird hand " set . most extraordinary moment occurs when winifred turns make eye contact donal lunny ( very crowded stage ) smacks her bow hand into mike stand . ouch- leave mark ... but her credit , she just rears back lets fly . there old joke " silly wizard " when they played their fastest " only dogs hear them . " well , john doyle john williams just blow right through sound barrier . again , dvd , not cd . seamus winifred recombining different line-ups , i'm unimpressed . imho , john , john karan all simply little better than their replacements . so " pastures plenty " i wanted john playing accordian john doyle singing . ( fortunately , it both cd dvd . ) don't get me wrong- solas outstanding band but i preferred their " starting line up .	1
one my top 10 cds all time , just great cd beginning end . great guitar , great vocals , great songwriting . easily sdre best album , may best album come out seattle grunge scene too .	1
despite remastering , first three songs this cd apparently still reproduced mono . when heard through headphones , vocal some music comes out though right speaker rest music comes out through left speaker . no vocal heard through left speaker . i owned this collection before it remastered i don't recall this happening . i also own two disc hollies greatest hits collection this not occur either those discs . two disc set , vocal comes out through both speakers . somebody messed up !	-1
this seller sent cd very quickly it new described . wish i liked music more than it turns out i but it worth experiment into cw . great seller	1
c/d contained most my favorite sons pioneer songs . however , i disappointed their signature song " cool water " missing last four lines or verse , i . . shadows sway seem say tonight we pray water , cool water . way up there he'll hear our prayer show us where there water , cool water . dan feet sore he yearning just one thing more than water , cool water . like me , i guess , he'd like rest where there no quest water , cool water . this verse could replaced " ridin home " 1:59 .	1
this great album i listen all time !! i highly recommend this album ! this compilation deserves 25 stars	1
any live album dbb puts out worth buying this album least good others if not better . i really enjoyed hearing newer members band whole thing well capture energy dbb show - something usually difficult live records	1

i cleaning out stuff " pocket full kryptonite " fell pile , cassette format , no less . i hadn't heard album two or three years , so i loaded it . fifteen years after its release pfok remains intensely creative , funky , wonderful , carefree . all honesty spin doctors , this their debut album , delivered so much more hang stick than , say , cold play today . there not dud cut beginning end , seven or eight cuts simply top notch creations . i know doctors not able continue this level , but this one album alone practically entire career	1
louis armstrong reminds us through his voice what simple wonderful world we once . this record classic - never fade . even my 6 year old son liked it	1
slight correction previous review this excellent group . twelve girls band not ones performing closing ceremony athens olympics august 2004 . they united states time promoting release their us album , eastern energy . coincidentally , day athens closing ceremony , they scheduled play atlanta , georgia -- previous venue summer olympics . ones who performed athens group dancers . otherwise , previous reviewer . silverstone right all counts regards twelve girls band musical abilities . updated reply region code issue : john , you're us , your code region 1 . it same canada . region 2 europe , japan , south africa middle east . region 3 asia ( except japan , indian sub-continent mongolia ) . region 4 australia , new zealand , central south america . region 5 eastern europe , indian sub-continent , africa mongolia . region 6 china . region 7 reserved future use . region 8 international destinations e.g. airplanes cruise ships etc . region 0 or all region free , meaning all region 1-6 players play disc . apparently , this 12 girls band dvd coded region 6 ( indicated above ) which explains why your region coded player cannot play it . perhaps you could contact customer service now regarding exchange or refund . alternatively , although not endorsement , i believe there certain places websites which sell region-free and/or multi region dvd players us . these usually lesser known brands . also available here amazon looks it . also , it seems there ways , if you search internet , circumvent region code issue , pressing few buttons here there sequence player and/or remote control . anyway , only dvds region coded . cds vcds not . hope this helps .	1
if u like rap you'll like this cd . whole cd great ! dmx , ja rule , jay-z , eminem , meth amp ; red , this group great rappers . gotta love it	1
it shame record industry offers us nothing those over age seven . so , i'm personal quest find new , interesting sounds made actual musicians . few new things actually quite good creative gotten my attention . suzuki tosca fabulous album those sharing my quest . if not , music cool anyway worth listen . hip-hop , jazz , ambient techno never sounded this good all mixed together some unique grooves . i also recommend my two other discoveries those seeking new music , not necessarily all same genre : dancing dreams barbarian lovers dark adapted eye danielle dax . hopefully , these make your search worthwhile .	1
words cannot describe how awesome bon jovi !!! i am their #1 fan no other group this world produces such quality / entertaining / heartfelt music . i recommend you buy nice day all their cds !!!	1

i remember when jesse johnson made his debut solo artist . time , i just kid so i never even knew he member band time ( one my all time favorite bands ) . my first introduction him through song video , " i want my girl " . some reason , this song struck cord me stuck me all these years . i'm not sure why jesse johnson never became " major star " -he should been-maybe he victim times or maybe victim am records . either way , jesse johnson one most underrated underappreciated guitar players which i am aquainted . my opinion , he one best . unfortunately , whatever reason-possibly because he constantly compared prince , his guitar skills often overlooked . although i love his music past it pales comparison music he now . but jesse johnson proved he could more than just time guitarist oft-said " prince protege " . he could write , produce , arrange , engineer play multiple instruments . some ways i wish he would music he really wanted do-blues rock-but given musical landscape time i'm sure execs wanted formulaic prince sounding albums so he obliged them . i am happy he allowed release this compilation because it allows his fans ( folks like me ) reintroduced reacquainted mr. johnson work . this collection includes his hits like aforementioned " i want my girl " , " you help me " , " your man " , " crazay " ( legendary sly stone ) , " black america " ( song also stuck me ) , " love struck " , " baby let kiss " . it even includes previously unreleased track " vibe " which very sexy it become one my new favorites . i would preferred if they would included " yourself favor " , " drive yo cadillac " , some extended mixes some tracks his 1996 release bare my naked soul which his best work time this writing . but i'm just happy someone thought enough compile collection his work-so i overlook what missing appreciate what here .	1
excellent throughout . quot ; carol bellsquot ; version exceeded ( imho ) only david benoit version first grp christmas ( sorry george ) . but highlight without doubt quot ; angels we've heard highquot ; which exquisite . best ws series	1
no way i mean disparage revered , rightly so , mr. robert johnson . there however mr. johnson equal or perhaps more passion ferocity . his name tommy , like robert , his recorded output woefully lacking . mainly caused era recording technology , partly his own disinterest recording his preoccupation ingestion spirits . i believe seventeen songs this album all songs he ever recorded . but they seventeen slices heaven or hell , case may . aside robert , i think few artists ever , so clearly effectively display such raw , painful pure emotion . proverbial deal devil originated this mr. johnson not robert . judging sound his voice these recordings he may actually gone visit before coming back cryptically relaying his torment us through song . i cannot recommend this masterpiece more strongly than say thank god/the devil mr. tommy johnson his seventeen slices heaven/hell	1
take note previous two reviews ! both 5 stars . so my rating . 5 big stars . start finish this exceptionally smooth album . it just rolls transporting you very upbeat cool place . beautiful rhythm horace ' piano , dexterity speed joe henderson tenor brilliance woody shaw trumpet captivating . i normally find trombone overbearing out place but jj johnson absolutely wonderful this fabulous album . much i enjoy horace better known albums , this my favourite . you not regret buying this album	1
although bill charlap sandy stewart consummate performers , i must agree review sharlan douglas . both mother son compliment their artistry so skillfully but tempo each selection ultimately regretfully same throughtout entire album . neither superbly intimate phrasing sandy stewart nor tenderly responsive accompaniment bill charlap sustained interest this listener . however , when my choice limited few numbers , combined talents both vocalist pianist intoxicating one stimulating indulgence fine delicate wine .	1
uninitiated , marc ribot los cubanos postizos ( prosthetic cubans ) ensemble group dedicated playing modern interpretations son montuno it afro-cuban musical cousins . originally informal jam band dedicated bringing attention music unsung creator son monuto - arsenio rodriguez , marc ribot little ensemble quickly drew enthusiastic crowds their east village scene . next thing you know , major label contract critically acclaimed debut album . here then their follow up effort . i am pleased announce it may even better than first album . energy level seems bit higher , marc guitar tone attack bit more edgy side , much more like live gigs . how best describe what band ? imagine this : group ex- lounge lizard jazz passenger alumni gigged everyone john zorn tom waits playing rootsy afro-cuban grooves . highly infectious , adventurous just plain fun , while never getting too serious . proof just listen quot ; las lomas de new jerseyquot ; , hilarious ode nj never comes off too corny . opposite end try quot ; baile baile bailequot ; it thunderous power chord interjections grafted onto traditional son montuno . those looking good enjoyable modern jazz recording rootsy latin elements emotional immediacy rock music , but structural complexity jazz , one needs look no further . album title says it all	1
it all sax . squealing , fighting dominate , makin ' you know it attitude funk ny conquering world what should nightclub every major metropolitan region . but , there only so much james chance go around . lucky us they invented records . lydia lunch her thang him back late 70 . 4 cd box nice but there too much just doesn't work . what you need this album james white blacks off white album . together , studio , where , least official record releases , james his very tight band live forever . if you like funk wondered if skinny white guy could really it , well james your answer . i lucky enough see band 1980 . show didn't begin until midnight . i figure they ny time , too cool play day or evening even . it wasn't disappointing . neither this lp ( off white ) . buy contortions . little bonus trax , i just hope it well recorded material . i speak studio album . it kept me funky ( sounds weak but it feels good ) punky 24 years . james brown gives us real thing but james chance gives us something mr. brown not , he fervent sax playin ' , ny shark skin suit wearin ' ( i assume ) cool guy who just performed all tomorrow parties long beach coupla years ago . i hope he still swingin ' hard . this record sure . chrisbct@hotmail.co	1

i bought this after intrigued tom waits ' comment shakin ' rafters greatest rock roll record all time . if that why you checking it out , forget it because there very little rock roll here . i knew this cd going gospel music when i ordered it some gospel really rocks , but after hearing this i could not imagine what fuss . music , particularly keyboards , very weak singing , while inspired , amateurish . there lot better gospel music listen market than this . celebrity endorsements aren't any better than anyone else , but i took chance waits ' assessment this cd since his tastes music famously eclectic mine well . looks like i lost my bet here , i won't playing this one much . if you buy this , you should so message , but certainly not music	-1
if , like me , you love see galactic live , not buy this cd . i always felt like houseman necessary distraction band keep funk planet . this album all houseman no funk ! crime ! i don't mean its not up galactic funk standards , would one thing . i mean it over-produced , drums so electronica they sound like drum machines . you kidding me , stanton funk soul band ( world ? ) it what they reduced ? you getting point . even lyrics suck . nothing more than repeated choruses . enoug	-1
first let me tell you , when i got this cd only other jazz i listened miles davis " west coast/cool " style . this cd opened me up so much more . i searching cd just this type really showcased all different elements styles jazz . while most this vocal type jazz(bille holiday , sarah vaughan , ella fitzgerald ... ) there instrumental types jazz , which up till this cd i thought only type jazz . this really opened me up vocal side jazz , like i may mentioned before when i purchased this i jazz novice , i heard billie holiday like radio tv/movies(most songs cd you reconize ) but never really listened them . now i find myself listening ella fitzgerald louis armstrong more then any other music(and i listen lot music ) . i also found new favorite song mine , summertime ella louis . i think most these songs found other cd so if you already own these artist cd then you may want check see if you don't already own these songs . but if you new jazz like i , then get this great compilation start . peace kevi	1

i've listened this cd probably numbering hundreds since its release 1978 . each time i so , it never fails leave me wonder . i ask myself , " how it doing something so simple adding single vocalist , entire look , feel , sound , musicianship band so completely change ? " but then i listen it again , i find my answer .......... songwriting flawless , harmonies tight , keyboards greg rollie used their best form . guitar neil schon sings , vocals steve perry carry each tune its fullest . those reasons , " infinity " rightfully come known one defenitive albums 70s . later albums like " frontiers " would take them new direction allowing them rock harder , " escape , " would find them catapulted into superstardom some best songs found any album 1980s . listen love band their home town , san francisco , " lights .

when we got this radio station i work i just shrugged it off stupid emo album ( we get lot bad albums new rotation ) until i heard dj play song " goodbyes " . i usually can't stand emo bands , but this song particular sounded so good stirred up such emotions ( similar goosebumps i get when i hear radiohead " planet telex " ) i decided listen rest album . lo ' behold i bought it week later ! great thing jamisonparker lyrics good enough interesting , guitar work catchy enough get hooked first listen , jamison voice isn't so whiny it annoying ( although i still picture lot people not liking it - it standable open-minded , but it hurts rating its appeal ) . if i could i would give it 4.5 stars . first 6 songs flow well together all good or great rest album not faring well . these first 6 , however , make it very satisfying purchase fans genre . it just barely not classic , but i think that because , though it really good , it seems kind've derivative . i'm not entirely convinced non-emo fans would like it , so warned . it would've easily gotten " 5 " stars if jamison voice wasn't kind've bad annoying ( i personally like it but i definitely see lot people not enjoying it ) . all all , however , i would still highly recommend this ! if you liked this album i would also recommend daphne loves derby " strength all convinced " . highlights include : " alcohol bandages " " best mistake " " goodbyes " " tearing through me " " paper , rock , scissors " " emergency room romantic " " slow suicide " " here everything i've always meant say " ( extent	1

just simple background piano , vanessa stiches gaps all sorts music makes it " harmonium " . it very beautiful album . when i first heard " white houses " , saw movie video , i fell this album immediately . " annie " significant one , it so beautiful , it brings you tenderly scene inside lyrics moody piano carries you final end four minutes . i must say my favorite song light " san francisco " , but i still failed work out what this song all ; it one song sounding quite light-hearted but lyrics i believe certain history . every single song " harmonium " poem . she even makes fast " private radio " sound beautiful . " half week before winter " sounds like world fantasy , but i think she trying tell something . " she floats " eerie song suicide girl . she very like picasso sometimes , only she sings . first i surprised how less this album seems acknoledged music listeners , but world only cares hot beats sex gangs nowadays , i guess i must not shocked . also , these songs aren't exactly what you'd call catching , especially " c'est la vie " " papa " . vanessa , you get something different hip hop or pop . i hope she makes hit like " thousand miles " her next album ... get attention she deserves	1

if you're casual fan looking more than what " 1 " gives you , this pretty much your only other collection option . it also basically later part earlier set " 1962-1966 " , two 2-disc collections obviously go together well . each disc here roughly 50 minutes , while it could hold many more songs , you still get 28 classics here . even without " 62-66 " set this more than what " 1 " , though short their early work . this also gives numerous tracks off each album , including both " sgt peppers " " beatles ( white album ) " . plus course hits " abbey road " , " magical mystery tour " , " let it " , other singles . anybody could add more or different songs this , but it really hard complain when music this good . again , casual fan , this 1967-70 ( blue set ) almost must get 62-66 ( red set ) . oh , i heard their proper albums pretty good too . enjoy	1

fleetwood mac started off blues band late 60 , members mick fleetwood john mcvie both part john mayall bluesbreakers it showed . many diffrent lineups band continued blues-rock band first part 70 certain amount success . 1970 instrumental hit " albatross " one their biggests hits . christine perfect joined shortly thereafter she later married mcvie , she added pop/soul sound band became influentual force band eventually go more mainstream . 1975 things suddenly going change better , mcvie/fleetwood auditioning new members crippled band they came across duo lindsey buckingham/stevie nicks . pair recording soft-pop band called buckingham nicks . they invited join accepted . first time ever , fleetowood mac became supergroup , not only new arrivals good songwriters but they also added something diffrent band they lacked past , unique talents charachters stood out . buckingham pop/rock craftsman capable both writing pop songs distinctive expriments nicks her hippie style onstage persona frontman they never past . now how this reformed band first release together measure up ? " fleetwood mac " eponymous album 1975 almost good " rumours " 2 years later , diffrence there less chart hits more solid album songs . but there still lots difersity many diffrent songwriters melodies you cannot resist liking . eventually album sold several million copies became smash hit . fleewood mac new era just started would last long . it all starts great buckingham sing-a-long song " monday morning " catchy folk-rock sounding pop song . great start great album . " warm days " christine mcvie next . romantic slow paced song great guitar playing . " blue letter " typical pop/rock song , although it written john curtis , buckingham makes best out it . stevie nicks her sexy husky oice sings most famous song this album , " rihannon " . midtempo pop/rock song mysterious it catchy still this day it identified one her best . mcvies " over my head " one best song this album aswell , it got this jazzy feeling all over it . beautiful meliodic . song lyrics simple but sometimes it simple words best describe emotions . nicks penned ballad " crystal " performed lindsey ( but backed her ) one less knows songs here , but it also melt album concept . " say you love me " , great mcvie song catchy pop/soul sound not surprisingly hit single . " landslide " written performed stevie nicks , it slow country sounding ballad somewhat simple structure . once she proves easy going songs works fine too . " landslide bringing you down " methaphor struck love . " world turning " very bluesy reminds you alot old band . certainly not bad , but diffrent rest here . mcvie " sugar daddy " quite odd , just look title lyrics . oh well , someone got sing sugar daddy too . buckingham closes " i'm so afraid " sounds like fleetood meets genesis , yeah it progressive rock . i like this one , but it not hit feels little misplaced here . overall , fantastic album often shadow " rumours " but it actually almost good . buckingham nicks entrance band takes them new levels , more accessable maistream music easier like identify . this album eventually sold millions this remastered version makes it even better . good buy	1

person who , long time , opposed any sort " greatest hits " amalgamations , i first apprehensive buy this disc . i always thought it better buy every single album band , celebrate great songs songs perhaps weren't so great . couple fact i didn't know much this band ( except songs snake driver , just like honey , head ) , fact i broke , this purchase seemed bit more feasible than my original philosophy . needless say , i completely blown away . " upside down " far one most original pieces music i've ever heard , given it 1984 . intentional feedback , muffled growling vocals , loud electronic drums , all made one truly adrenaline inducing 2 minutes 59 seconds . next two tracks , " never understand " " you trip me up " echo this sensation . next two tracks " just like honey " " some candy talking " , show more melodic side jmc . " just like honey " , really beautiful chord progression , really ambient male female vocals create perfect combination . same goes next track . latter tracks disc cover band more " professional " sound , if you . better , cleaner production , full band , created new face band . " far out gone " , features equal levels drums percussion , guitar , vocals . it rather upbeat song , say least . " snake driver " seemingly regression back simpler means . no fancy studio tricks , no back up percussion ; just two or three chords , their trademark distortion/feedback , etc . let jump last track , " i love rock roll " . very upbeat tune loving rock roll . highlight 50 seconds , horn section kicks background guitar solo . it perfect . far track listing , it too perfect this last track . this far one best cd i've bought years . this sounds kind corny , but this cd branches out different atmospheres . parties , walking around , day driving , night driving , early morning driving , etc . it perfect disc any occasion . get it today	1
musings monk throughout this cd harks back movie which much more than serious look man clint eastwood , but one best jazz dvd's(my opinion ) .. this cd chock full unreleased gems great monk , majority mid 60 some earlier material . it stands dual purpose .. alone it worthy way into man since it features versions his well known tunes monk fan unreleased nuggets like all his variations single theme , essential . additional bonus track " straight no chaser " nice way close things out .	1

i just recently found webpage discusses what quot ;d onegal stylequot ; fiddling all , am very happy know two my favorite artists- altan natalie macmaster , either play style fiddle , or style very similar it ( i.e. , natalie cape breton style) ! this my favorite all altan fine albums , though i'm just now ordering their latest . two or three my favorite quot ; high speedquot ; fiddle tune favorites , beautiful , soulful voice lead singer mairidh ( sp ? ) singing songs i love without understanding gaelic words , i find myself playing this one over over again . buy album- it worth least ten times its price	1
when i first heard children bodom i admit i really didnt like them but perhaps i my whole nu metal phase but after while listening slipknot got boring it starting bland i mean wheres first ( solos ) ? but something missing . then i got into metalcore like month them i found odd band finland cob !! they great combing heavyness melody yet not sounding like retards while doing so also keyboards add nice touch overall music but i am trying say i got into real metal because these finnish guys !!! best ablum theirs best songs warheart silent night bodom night bed razors downfall children bodom alright emo sucks	1
i never cared club much , but my opinion rachel stevens going solo gotten better better , come get it album her best material date incoporated ! you some fun spotting 80s influences samples some tracks , but overall this electro pop its best ! highlights singles tracks like so good - nice elctro disco track consistent basline catchy verses . chorus reminded me lot 1995 dance hit ' not over yet ' grace , remember it ? i said never again kicks off cheesy ' 1234!' brazenly samples status quo guitar licks adam ants drum beats . . . getting away it process ! this great dancefloor filler you up it office party ! dumb dumb high point strong track finish , perhaps best track nods laura branigan hit self control , depeche mode some old school 80s goth guitar riffs thrown good measure . crazy boys takes its tune human league empire state human works ; negotiate love made top 10 uk but not get airplay it deserved , this one reminded me blondie kim wilde early material . big hit 2004 called some girls lp too , which sounds like cross dr who theme goldfrapp ! there nothing wrong . if you like your 80s music , then this may appeal you . although its easy compare contrast tunes , i also think stevens well use these influences mix them up her own sound(and good looks boot !!! ) create perfect pop album which wide appeal . well rachel !	1

i'll try fair since she my favorite artist but this far best most complete album aimme mann made . bit more mature whatvever i'm stupid . aimee finds her knack . she not dissappointed us lost space forgotten arm . these her best albums far . but bachelor #2 just awesome . it starts out strong ends so pleasantly . some disagree but you great moving song . she played it west palm her last show i blown away . you also get few tracks appear her magnolia cd which nice . best songs here red vines , deathly , you know i can't say there best songs because it great beginning end . if you any interest aimee mann or even remember ' til tuesday then you must get this disc . it must ! you won't dissapointed .

after success muddy waters ' fathers sons album , chess records decided something similar howlin ' wolf . so , they got young rock stars like eric clapton , steve winwood , bill wyman charlie watts record wolf . results good , although not good wolf older recordings . practically all these songs recorded wolf before , better versions . wolf voice not quite strong it once , younger musicians didn't quite mesh wolf well old bluesmen he usually worked . but this still enjoyable album blues fans should enjoy	1

i find it somewhat confusing so many people pass this record off inaccessible mess . some extent , yes , kid koala dj dj . other hand , this record got me interested turntable music . i'm not dj ( don't care ) , but this one most compelling records i've ever heard . koala boasts more personality through his turntables than most emcees through microphone . this record just full originality . this record you dance ? no . if you're looking traditional hip-hop party record , you've come wrong page . if you looking something non-traditional original pick this up . maybe it just because i've listened this record 50-60 times , but i wouldn't call this record cluttered mess . it may possess slight learning curve , but once you " get it " , it very rewarding listen . some choice tracks would include " fender bender " , " drunk trumpet " , " barhopper 1 " ( my personal favorite ) , " music morning people " , " like irregular chickens " . kid koala takes his originality straight into packaging product . package made up high quality card stock digi-pack 36-page comic book designed kid koala himself . this not just record dj fans dj enjoy . whether you're fan turntable music or just hip-hop , this isn't record you should ignore	1

while lou reed pretty patchy run solo albums throughout his career , this one manages come shining through . don't get me wrong , i love velvet underground , albums like transformer , berlin , bells , etc . but this one seems most redeeming qualities : it hard put my finger exactly what those qualities , which why first listen it may not seem overtly impressive some other albums . but , listened so many lou reed albums , this one always seems fresh . i don't know how it generally regarded , but it seems like it glossed over ( it may hard find , or expensive ) . however , if i could keep only one post-velvets lou reed album , this would one	1
i fan baroque music since childhood ( i'm not all old either ) . but i've only started reading patrick o'brian books last few months , since it announced my favorite actor , russell crowe , star captain jack aubrey peter weir movie . i am reading books order , am currently quot ; hms surprise , quot ; so what else could more perfect accompaniment than this cd ? aubrey such multi-layered character , filled imperfections bad puns , however he great love music he plays violin quite well . often paired ship surgeon dr. stephen maturin cello , music great release this sea captain , pieces this cd fine representations what aubrey might played while assignment or heard when land . selections hadyn , locatelli , handel , boccherini leclair pleasant , soothing compositions complex varied enough they not redundant , range peaceful nimble . while listening cd , i could vividly imagine jack aubrey below decks his cabin asking maturin strike up tune him . then they begin andante or allegro , allowing aubrey set aside his absolutely awful puns jokes so he clear his mind relax . considering some battles he involved himself so far series , he definitely needs it . reading his adventures while listening these charming pieces relax you well , definitely take your imagination some wondrous places era great change	1

i just old enough ( 14 ) 1968 appreciate big brother when they released cheap thrills lp . after many years i decided replace it cd . however reading reviews here swayed me into buying this live recording instead . good move . ordinarily i don't care much recordings concert performances . this different . this great . buy this cd . if not satisfied i refund your money ( just kidding ) . no person even remotely interested joplin/acid rock/the60 or whatever fail find something value here . joplin purists may prefer some her later work , maybe not . but if you looking " chemistry " this where find it . big brother might not gone too far their own , but they sure great her front . really , without this band this time this place who say what turns janis joplin career would taken ? ten bucks piece history . you can't go wrong	1

counting crows third album band starts off song sounds like it written specifically receive radio airplay . although song " hangingaround " pretty big hit , it really significantly different what counting crows known just sounds me like kowtow record industry pressure . i really never liked song much all it " we've got hit " vibe . after though things improve immensely almost 8 minute " mrs. potter lullaby " " amy hit atmosphere " both which great songs . rest album up down . overall it mellower release than " recovering satellites " many songs moody reflective . other highlights include " all my friends lovers " , " colorblind " . this probably weakest crow studio discs up this point , but it still strong album most part	1

this just my style soundtrack . before movie over , i already wanted score . some people may not like it because there parts may more sound effects than melodic material , but it creates great atmospheric soundscape unknown regions abyss . there , however , very elegant orchestral/choral piece powerfully builds up climax cosmic proportions . if you like this you may also like alien 3 contact soundtracks	1
this some best delta blues ever recorded , but enough written . reason get this compilation its companion " king delta blues singers vol . 2 " wonderful remastering . sound these two issues far better than 1990 " complete " box set ( better even than remastered 1997 version set ) . both volumes " king delta blues " employ minimal noise reduction . while this leaves some high end hiss low end rumble , it makes recordings clearer , more full bodied natural sounding than any versions johnson recordings i ever heard . his voice guitar not sound thin they previous issues . i also prefer sequencing this cd over " complete " set , which back back alternate takes . only thing you miss out " king delta blues " volumes 1 2 handful alternate takes which appear only " complete " box set . it should noted , however , this cd contains version " traveling riverside blues " not appear " complete " box set . highly recommended	1

rolling stones selected this album 393rd best album ever made , i looked over first 392 came before it trouble understanding how those could better . introduced his music time when his music able drill right through , i say he should almost outlawed , he so good . i think hightlight album " diamonds gold " which i really couldn't place same category any song before it anybody . it certainly not ballad , nor it social rant ( maybe it ) . melody piercing melody while lyrics such " catch me rainbow , steal me dream " makes you wonder how tom aim straight your mental health hit bull eye . " time " , other reviewevers put it , may his best ballad , though i would put " alice " before it . " hang down your dead " , while talking sad love situation , less bleak ballad than time . then there " downtown train " . first time i heard it him ( it his song way ) , i wanted cry over what rod stewart it . then i wanted cry other things , but really , it superb ballad . first 4 songs album echo same genre almost sung same persona , which rare waits album . he usually acting when he singing . anyway , if you don't already own this album , there really no excuse it . it very accessible easy love .	1

charlie parker catalog overwhelming . this great cd offers parker greatest recordings his legendary career . i've heard few complaints sound quality . frankly , i think it adds charm recording . there some surface noise , but it not bad . some cuts sound like old 78 40 , but modern presence . surface noise adds patina recording like age fine china or coin or antique furniture . there so many parker cd it confusing . although , i once owned yardbird suite rhino , it just bit too much . it you don't time 50 cuts parker , this logical choice . also recommended : charlie parker strings . parker changed way people improvise create music . his innovation now so common , it like he invented breathing . astonishing technical prowess , despite his inner demons addictions . god-given talent	1

' naked ' opener this dark , sad-filled album where tom shear emotions laid out naked all hear feel . this one great song probably correctly judged one best songs assemblage 23 . personally me ' disappoint ' original album version my favourite album where tom asks most important question ' there nobility suicide ?

i nothing but upmost respect vinnie paul . it eats me up he chose this project his comeback music . i can't think musician wouldn't jumped chance band him . ( zakk wylde , maynard james keynan , hell even matt heafy few names come mind ) i respect what mudvanye . they formula . not exactly my cup tea , but it works it sells records . so why this collaboration ? why now ? i can't figure it out . glen tribot ( insert nothingface guitarist name here ) not even dimebag shadow . their riffing doesn't vin playing any justice it shows right off bat . only part this album where i hear any real connection when vinnie playing snare high hat 4/4 . terrible waste such amazing talent . vocals ... some screaming works , nothing special , just kinda sounds like mudvayne . but slower country influenced songs , i fight every urge smash this cd into million pieces . vinnie paul , please find yourself musicians your skill level leave amaeturs your wake ... if you like mudvayne enjoyed damageplan ... you still probably disapointed this cd . if you expecting pantera , some these reviews lead you believe .. well go throw trendkill feel privelaged you able experience metal its finest .	-1
this one my all time favorite , desert island discs . band cooks dorham plays intensity imagination . i tried pick out my favorite cuts this cd compilation disc i making , but i couldn't come up one or two because whole album cooks	1
unlike most people who consider dirt best album i actually think this album which would groups last their best work . dont get me wrong i love everything these guys but i always thought they always seem improve each realese . this record sometimes known tripod perhaps their darkest offering . production musicship here alot stronger than before . layne staley despite poor state health still manages sing beautifully throughout album notably shame you which i felt one most personal songs he'd ever written . i think every track gem , jerry cantrell contributes some gems his own such heaven beside over now which would state group years time shortly after death laynes fiance , where he very privatlty quit group although it would never publically announced . head creeps favourite it only alice chains song entirely layne himself playing all instruments . frogs perhaps strangest song they ever but its brilliant none less quite unsettling listen especially towards end where layne mumbles strangley himself . sludge factory most creative lyrics ive ever heard temendous chorus . alice chains this album particualar never got acclaim they deserved which shame cause there alot talent group they where alot better then most other bands whole grunge era . rest peace layne staley you'll never forgotten .	1
rip layne staley . dirt excellent album , i would argue best out " grunge " movement . layne voice conveys perfect attitude accompany darker lyrics , which genre could only matched cobain singing " where you sleep last night " unplugged album . favorite track junkhead , which chilling listen knowing path layne would take . alot lyrics deal layne drug addiction , but none powerful junkhead what i see defiant attitude towards his addiction " i don't go broke i it alot " " if you'd let yourself go open your mind , i'll bet you'd doin like me , it ain't so bad " . after best dam river rain when i die , which both excellent hard driving rock songs , closely followed title track . radio songs , my favorite definitely rooster , followed angry chair although any these tracks would make nice treat while listening radio . like good hard rock ? buy this album , well worth 9 bucks you pick it up .	1
this simply worst , most inconsistent sellout album ever ! gwen stefani complete joke she completely lost her credibility musicianship all my respect her ( which mistakenly quite high ) . i even defended her side break-up no doubt , but this rediculous . she completely terrible now . her husband gavin rossdale ( formerly bush ) should completely resent his decision her husband except her looks ( he $ -- so so what this much more ) . album : i mention inconsistent . no two songs sound alike . only way you like them all if you just love her voice , however , i i still hate most them . good luck future , i hope you create some good work , this not . way , i hate lead single ( second , sweet escape , though mostly empty track , some upside it )	-1
i bought this cd assumption it just compilation music pieces . it but they pieces musical play opposed ordinary music pieces .	1
during this time period reba started stretch out new directions this cd captures it well . amazon review makes it seem bit like reba " selling out " trying new musical styles , but i think she believed what she doing , gang , that reflected her choice song off this cd -- fancy -- sing her cmt giants : reba special . sincere smackdowns dixie chicks fan expert using earlier review this cd launch massive mound misguided moronities one most decent gracious performers ever grace stage . chicks tried clever liberal marginalization trick right after 2007 gore-chick grammies when one them said , " we don't want fans who put us their cd player reba mcentire toby keith . " i news chicks : no one ever thought them same major league other two or ever . they're used part ongoing news entertainment media ( nem ) fu george . bush , when his term ends so relentless , sickening free pr campaign chicks enjoyed msn.com myriad other media outlets ever since they verbally spit president london . thus career ballooned out proportion media hot air come crashing back earth where it belongs , next other media-smoke-and-mirrors " stars " like marilyn manson sinead o'connor .	1
first hearing , album downer , but this something live sucked . originally written nancy sinatra , " don't let him waste your time " terrific , borrowing its tremendous , brassy riff obscure phil spector production . there ageless twangings dramatic chord changes throughout , which elevate soul , but all-eclipsing undertow worry age death . funereal " disney time " equates portrayal family life kids ' movies pornography . " i kill again " , terrifying ambivalence , seems written point view genuine murderer . " fat children " un-pc , unreasonable , unfathomable . jarvis not stuff pop comebacks . its maker transparently revels idea standing apart times , floating off self-created bubble scott walker end ' 60s . such , it something dark masterpiece .	1
i bought this item my brother he couldn't find it anywhere stores . he loved it plays it his truck constantly	1
i love this cd . thievery corporation foray into dj kick series classic one it sounds makes esl label so great . it though thievery corp . honored make this album you simply feel it tunes selected flow cuts . label ( k7 ) that dj kicks everyone smith mighty dj cam kruder dorfmiester carl craig well release albums tosca , ursula rucker several other artists , they know thing or two dj mixing . first track me - les baxter " tropicando " ... you may remember this old school easy jazz cut docker commercial 2000 or late nineties where dude dinner table , thinks these two lovely ladies moving up his leg their feet only find out it actually mister across table that infatuated ( yikes ... ) . but then you smooth flowing forest mighty black track titled " rebirth " that'll get party going old styled guitar background electronic samples . it compost thing . then you da lata samba influenced " beija flor " , this came out time before songs tin , so when you hear beat heavy " ponteio " just know neither cut their debut album . fun-da-mental collab . them " mother africa " perfect prelude indian ambiance electrifying " rainbow " following it up . beats don't stop there ... karminsky experience " exploration " sort anthem 1999 ... so simple so great , sitar spashes throughout . " coming top " follows track ... if i boxer would my intro music every fight . those only handful tracks . rockers hi-fi , jazzanova , lazy boy , dj cam few others some smokin ' tracks what imo one best dj comps ever put out . i always fan esl , picking up sounds thievery hi-fi long long time ago but this one made me want actually check out dc lounge myself . definitely check this out . it bit older it sort india vibe it maybe not everyone dig , but i still love this release consistency cd warrant international ambience . if you enjoy this sure check out esl other works , " sounds hi-fi " all way up " outernational experience " . sure take look some many other greats their label , like karminsky experience , ursula 1000 desmond williams just name few .	1

i really thought , when i bought this lp , this would improvement . there keyboard mix first cut , but then farner recycles one his boring , repetitive guitar breaks record takes artistic skid there . i notice cd live version " i'm your captain . " this one band better tunes , played ad nauseum your favorite album rock station . but instrumentation stretched out sans improvisation it all gets tired . new generation even thinks this band worth anything must sad commentary state modern rock pop music . footnote : lp jacket round shaped like huge coin . i'ts corny , but far catchier than insipid music found inside	-1
me this album silent shout bridge crossed deep cuts . deep cuts me more main stream three , eye their storm . opening song nearest i heard knife sound like bjork . songs album more textured playful , landscape more populated this album then deep cuts or silent shout . say anything more would take away experience what music all . say i love this album knife would understatement .	1

i can't believe crap i read this album , every song this album great it own right . what you got here very heavy , wicked return form . production , though little digital-sounding breathes life into band gets them out 90 rut they . i would put this album right after reign christ illusion . though this album very solid effort i few complaints : 1- there actually too many songs here it somewhat dulls " punch face " approach because right around middle album it starts seem little lengthy , but thankfully " warzone " , " here comes pain " , " payback " put you right back into it again . 2- tom araya vocals aren so much angry they just really loud . i miss lower " reign " style . don't let slow you down ... but it !	1

i'm just repeating here what i wrote my gangster love review : ignore all compilations " best johnny " , because gangster love 3 hours past midnight your definitive recordings . johnny guitar watson smoked ' em out hall every time he picked up guitar . you hear johnny licks most rock blues played after this , but he played style . i'm not big fan 70 funk scene he took part , but his blues rock roll all-time hits . it right here . get gangster love , top-ten all-time rockin ' rollin ' blues recording you'll wonder how you lived without . these two cds never find their way back shelf my house .	1

jessica began her recording career via song ( i there you ) soundtrack album ( prince egypt - nashville ) . encouraging response , song also appeared her debut album . it sold well but follow-up ( this album ) much better . this album more pop sounding than its predecessor but fine example contemporary country music remains jessica most successful album date . jessica superb voice equally effective up-tempo songs romantic ballads . all songs here originals except outstanding cover show me heaven , song maria mckee ( originally lead singer lone justice ) uk number one hit . although she didn't write or co-write title track , i'm assuming writers knew jessica reasonably well it sounds like autobiographical song . jessica hand writing one songs ( good friend me , man who wants too much too soon ) . jessica future country music uncertain but i , one , hope she makes comeback she certainly young enough so . even if she doesn't , jessica first two albums ( maybe her third , which i haven't heard ) well worth listen . i generally prefer her first album ( although not much ) but this one sold best , so i'm probably minority . you must make up your own mind	1
though i could write rather lengthy explaination why i like this album , i'll keep my praise brief . i enjoy every song this cd , especially quot ; liarquot ; because it sounds like good kiss-off deceitful ex-lover . short , whether song slow or fast , music highly enjoyable if you like tonic you'll impressed quot ; head straightquot ;	1

female vocalist dierdre dubois ekova , simply known here dierdre , releases her first solo album , ' one ' , six degrees records . ekova , signed same label , one my favorite groups when it comes modern-world music lot unique style which deirdre sings so course when i heard she working solo project it no-brainer i'd get my hands copy it . although i am certainly not disappointed ' one ' , some songs take while grow me . tracks instantly took hold me , though , " waiting spring " , " firefly " , " nights white satin " , " close us " , " sweet sticky perfume " , " way love " , " thoughts you " . she sings both french english , infusing heavier use electronics than ever before funky trip-hop smooth , melodic lounge beats , incorporating influences karsh kale " maid love " ekova bandmate mehdi haddab several others . she careful not steering too far sound fans come love appreciate but experiments just enough create something that different what she past . her distinctly beautiful voice equally evocative cover art definitely worth purchasing this ... please check out ekova if you haven't already !	1

" live sao paulo " sepultura fourth release since derrick green took over departed co-founder max cavalera , group first live album derrick behind mic . some fans never let go max accept derrick sep new main man , but it would foolish not give him try . his vocal style unabashedly one dimensional , but he lot potential , ( some tracks show ) even little power . , even though he usually isn't quite effective max , he usually such good job filling max shoes newcomer shouldn't able tell if it derrick or old guy , such tracks " roots bloody roots . " i don't blame sepultura not playing ton max-era songs , but , unfortunately , they forgot few famous songs ( i.e. " kaiowas " ) normally staples their live show . tracks four five first disc ( double bass heavy " propaganda , " tribal influenced " attitude " ) , explosive songs , both sound great , here . track seven , derrick announces " we're gonna play something older here , " band launch into scorching renditions " innserself/beneath remains " " escape void . " " innerself " flawed , though , because derrick tries desperately but fails miserably keeping up super-fast guitars , he ultimately gets lost mix . fortunately , " escape void " ( track eleven , " necromancer " ) fly without audible flaw . songs number two seven second disc ( " refuse/resist " " biotech godzilla " ) 1993 " chaos a.d. " derrick can't completely match max catchy singing these songs , but , musically , these songs sound perfect , just good original/studio versions . other highlights second c.d. include catchy , churning " territory , " blistering rendition " come back alive , " sepultura classic " roots bloody roots " ( which sounds awesome , here ) . " arise/dead embryonic cells " also almost perfect , but , unfortunately , there loud , unexpected , shrieking sound ( which might come derrick microphone ) middle song . now , even i'll admit " live sao paulo " isn't essential classic like sepultura first live album , 2002 " under pale grey sky . " but it still good live set , well worth putting your shopping list if you're sepultura diehard . finally , love him or hate him , i firmly believe , no matter what record label they're under , derrick green future sepultura , sepultura definitely here stay	1

this cd major purchase anyone serious creative work duke ellington . i am major believer despite billy strayhorn great influence ellington , his presence alongside ellington served musical crutch , upon strayhorn passing , duke , first time since late 1930 , forced rely upon his own creative devices . duke output after1967 soared ! without strayhorn , he relegated his own creative devices , he suddenly exhibits following changes his compositional style : 1)an awareness pop music culture , willingness infuse elements keeping times ... 2)a newly found plaintivity , similar aesthetically perhaps his ' jungle band'(1926-1933)days .... dark , richly textured voicings , raw emotional outcrying . ... 3)a new sparsity , importance urgency now seems attached fewer notes musical phrases ... everything seems heightened , more meaningful 4)an overall accumulation influences ' learned ' strayhorn period ( 1938-67 ) , such fuller appreciation their own serious formats ( note : i don't use word classical ) what i am leading up here this : recordings documented here post-strayhorn era ( 1968-1974 ) , namely goutelas uwis suites , totally revolutionary works art duke ellington most intense creative period , my opinion . course , queen suite , 1959 also totally incredible work , probably more accesable most ' jazz ' listeners , format texture-wise , still bears much strayhorn sound . queen suite still written format duke designed year 1944 , his perfume suite : ellington/strayhorn dealing series short ' songs ' featuring variety mood pieces certain formulaic textures . well , get ready , because uwis goutelas , though still basically formatted short song format , totally break camp where texture concerned . duke tries everything rom atonal flute/piccolo duet fourths , damn polka . beauty it ? it all pure ellington , raw uncut , without strayhorn cleanliness . if anything , these pieces remind you david murray octet 1980 or perhaps sun ra ! duke seems believe himself so much here , seems totally unconcerend any need make ' hit ' or accessible all . he just writing here , pure honest deep ly , well emotions he tap made him greatest american composer . result some rawest , darkest , most emotionally intense music i ever heard . buy it	1

there reason sixties rock group steppenwolf still sells so strongly some thirty years after their arrival sixties rock scenes quick succession powerful heavy rock hits like " magic carpet ride " " born wild " . i've always admired lead vocalist john kay singing style , songwriting lyrical talents , his outspoken personal warnings against dangers drug excess songs like " pusher " " snowblind friend " . he anti-drug when it anything but fashionable so cautious careful . concept albums like fabled " monster " or discursive excursions into dark side rock culture " pusher ' , kay always something provocative thoughtful say . kay also knew his way around melody , whether he making insightful social commentary number songs like " monster " " draft resister " or just plain old wailing terrific , edgy songs like " never too late ( start all over again ) " or " twenty eight " , he used combination his lovely lyrics , driving melodies , wild rock improvisation create whole rafter memorable , insightful very appealing rock songs . most them here , those aren't you find their other albums . steppenwolf quickly earned undying support admiration their original fans , finding new listeners through terrific greates-hits compilation albums like this must-own collection their hits . enjoy !	1

" don't cruel " mixes both uptempo new jack swing occasional rap ( making bobby one first successful singers combine two ) then some traditional bedroom romanticism his early days new edition . this album spawned amazing numbers hits , title track only reached #8 place but big hit worlwide , " my prerogative " reached top billboard charts later britney spears made silly cover it too . catchy uptempo " every little step " reaching #3 two more laidback romantic " roni " #3 " rock wit'cha " #7 . if wasn't enough bobby also made soundtrack new ghostbusters movie hit " our own " #2 but unfortunately it doesn't appear this album . album continues " i'll good you " , " take it slow " , " all day all night " " i really love you girl " where only one uptempo rest ballads/slow jamz . unfortunately there only 9 songs this album if you don't count intro outro but material present album top notch , making it bobby brown greatest only essential album his career ( but third album " bobby " defenitely alright ) . if you enjoy this album , check out guy , bell biv devoe tony ! toni ! ton� ! all simular kind music , almost equally good .	1
originally saw blessed light day 1967 , some oldie fans may not realize buffalo springfield actual several full length albums out . can't believe these guys just one hit . anyway , this twelve track self-titled cd reissue several should - / could - - hits far i'm concerned . cuts like " go say goodbye " , beatles - like " sit down i think i love you " , " everybody wrong " , " burned " , jamming bluesy " leave " " pay price " ( it catchy riffs ) their sole hit " what it worth " all make this disc keeper . it obvious this band heavy influence later artists such eagles , gram parsons , bodeans nitty gritty dirt band . recommended	1

this album actually recorded around 1969 during quot ; let it bleed sessions when ry cooder added mandolin quot ; love vainquot ; slide guitar quot ; sister morphinequot ; ( later appear quot ; sticky fingers . quot ;) album however not released until 1972 . hence confusion some reviews this disc . session took place while waiting keef show . just cooder , stones rhythm section , watts amp ; wyman , mick piano great nicky hopkins alais quot ; edward . quot ; this just jam session great sound quality even though jagger gets buried mix . album centers around hopkins , watts , wyman cooder so fact mick buried mix insignificant . this rocks ! this boogies ! liner notes say , quot ; what point your own record label you couldn't indulge whim every once while ? quot ; plus original liner notes mick himself hoot he adds , quot ; i hope you spend longer listening this than we making it . too judge this album you would other albums stones cannon foolish . but still i find it worthwhile addition any true fan stones , nicky hopkins or ry cooder . if you're not tappin your toes or dancing this i would someone check your pulse	1

i write this review i happen listening cd . i'm not hardcore alice chains ' fan , however i happen one mtv unplugged . this unplugged session great , although somehow too slow beggining ( but not boring all ) . all songs perfectly arranged cantrell guitar solos simply amazing . me highlight cd without any doubt " would ? " . " nirvana vs . alice chains " issue people tend talk whenever reviewing this cd i say it impossible compare this two cds which both bands printed their own unique style . aic darker while nirvana played more " tunned down " style , however they both great . i give this cd 4 stars instead 5 only because i think they lacked some creativity songs . don't get me wrong , they sound real good , however i think they may used extra instruments ( violins , celli , etc . ) make it sound little more different .	1
this cd pretty much everything i hoped it would . it great followup acog . only drawback muddy production , however this really good . if you liked their debut then check this out	1
i remember when song ' how bizarre ' came out . i didn't listen modern music all , but it inescapable part life ' 96/'97 australia ( elsewhere apparently ) . everytime you turned t.v. there video blaring you or when you went supermarket it came loud clear through store speakers . it became embedded my memory couple months ago it resurfaced . i never forget line ' everytime i look around ... ' actually searched lyric using google . it came up website lyric , song ' how bizarre ' omc . i went out searched copy song itself 2nd hand compilation . but i get copy album itself ... now i it , i pleasantly surprised . best track probably ' how bizarre ' but there plenty others essentially just good . ' breaking my heart ' laid back country/hip hop fusion some nice dobro saxaphone playing . ' angel disguise ' just awesome . it really upbeat number nice chorus where pauly harmonises himself he sounds good , there some spirited violin work track too , plus don't pass over it melody . ' lingo gringo ' ambient groove combines haunting piano riff electronic buzz-y sound really groovy beat . chorus really catchy . ' land plenty ' really traditional , again very melodic . that four cracking songs row ! favourite mine ' pours out your eyes ' , 70's-ish ballad tasteful violin playing , but best it probably acoustic guitar riff drives song . there also some really fun tracks , like ' right ' , ' she loves italian ' ' run ' . liner notes pauly thanks musicians who worked album , who contributions made it stand out crowd . i certainly agree . zina sings backing vocals song ' how bizarre ' must say she really know how lay down groove ! her vocals main hook track , it shame we probably wont hear more her . anyway , great album	1

but despite it not what i figuring it . songs well constructed acoustic pop strong jazz influences several tunes . interesting use drums loops etc . his acoustic gtr plaing technically excellent lovely melodies . he also something tune or two , noteably creeping beauty , he shows strong phil keaggy influence , which till then , i thought , acoustic sound/composition style close inimitable . he couple tunes let it fall imo also this keaggy feel . reality i not even sure he ever heard keaggy but he might some point . his voice not assured his two nickel creek compatriots but he makes up it sort delicate vulnerabilty . excellent release - must buy imo	1
nine inch nails ' " downward spiral " , released 1994 much critical acclaim despite it violent controversial content . album times so aggressive offensive you may take deep breaths just take what you experiencing . it very anxiety-filled album definitely hard take some . everytime you think trent reznor give you break songs quiet openings he fools you . he plays your mind each song feels like assault hits you hard , heavy fast . opening track " mr. self destruct " , which leads off sample movie thx1138 , pulsating explosive cut . next track " piggy " example when trent tricks us oh so well into thinking he going slow things down bit before pinning us wall again " heresy " . " march pigs " complete opposite some other songs creating thunderous opening then almost absurd candy shop chorus . " closer " , course best known song album . his placement single note piano keys end brilliant . simple , yet still unexpected . " ruiner " " becoming " go hand hand catchy whimsical . perhaps , biggest surprise record instumental " warm place " . this track flows like liquid your ears . this song may one most intense he ever recorded . ambient track would make bowie brian eno smile proudly . swan song album " hurt " , song every word , every line trent sings resonant intensity . this album lives up all expectations beyond . many may turned off claim it just " noise " . if that your fear then go listen lou reed " metal machine music " . this extremely important influential album . enjoy it what it	1

new found glory one few bands i personally say i grown up . i've listening new found glory since 8th grade , years progressed , so band . i am not going indept analysis how band changed over years , because i think people decide themself . i personally , disapointed catalyst . it felt too repetative , it didnt much staying power me . jordan voice somehow gotten higher nasally record . so out comes 2006 , new found glory set their release . first , i wasn't too excited . catalyst didnt stick , i didnt expect this any better . oh , how wrong i ? this record takes their growth new levels . whole record catchy lyrics still blend fun nfg . first single , " it not your fault " , protraits how much this band grown , yet its so amazingly catchy . if you honestly cant say , song left you singing " it not your fault , so please stop your crying now " , you honestlty dont understand concept catchyness . i would go analysis every song , but i honestly feel this record lot more emotion than anything they ever written . i cannot stress how much i love this record , its not just one or two songs , its whole record . this easily best effort band terms consistancy . catalyst its fillers , but this record strong all way through . i saying before , catalyst didnt much staying power i stopped listening record several weeks , but this record just sticks . there 3 things i would like point this record . firstly , man behind boards . thom panunzio amazing job production this record . record not overproduced , which i felt major difference last two records , better songs this record . secondly , no one seemed mention cameos eisley ( guitarist chad gilbert married amazing sherri dupree ) this record . closing track , " boulders " , gorgeous acapella part featuring eisley girls , one most epic musicallys ive ever heard nfg . thirdly , i would like mention song really stood out . " when i die " written chad gilbert father who passed away . lyrics song breath-taking . it just takes your heart away , especially if you read chad explanation liner notes . especially if you recently lost someone , or ever lost someone you loved , i think lot us relate . whole , new found glory 7th studio effort gigantic step band . this record isn't same new found glory anymore . these songs not just songs . there just something amazing this record , i highly suggest everyone check it out . personally , this could very well my record year . even if it won't your favorite record them , this worth checking out	1

verve most shameless when it comes issuing multiple anthologies single artist under titles such " ultimate , " " definitive , " " best . " since they yet release " best best , " aside purchasing all original albums consumer make some tough choices ( or assemble personal favorite list compiled downloaded mp3 files ) . see my review " ultimate clifford brown " reasons pick up disc , compiled trumpeter nicholas payton . there may even more compelling reasons selecting " definitive clifford brown . " one , it includes more tracks featuring underrated harold land tenor saxophone ( perfect complement clifford , practically " doubling " sound trumpet ) . , it includes performances clifford his two most famous compositions , " joy spring " " dahoud , " well his spirited reading " i'll remember april . " unfortunately , present album duplicates four tunes first collection omits masterful clifford solos such those " i get kick out you , " " delilah , " " september song " ( overlooked , muted-solo gem ) . any collection truly " ultimate " or " definitive " would include his work " art blakey live birdland , " not mention his classic flat blues riff , " blues walk , " his blazing solo columbia recording " donna lee . " still , clifford brown may most non-controversial musician history jazz , admired his lifestyle his music favorite most trumpet players i talk . if you're new him , " definitive " probably best place start	1

humble pie band , like eric clapton cream , carried reputation sounding far better concert than studio . their 1970 vinyl ' performance - rockin ' fillmore ' exhibit ' ' substantiating claim , disc under consideration here , ' king biscuit flower hour presents humble pie concert ' , would seem second emotion . although i never owned either pie live productions prior now , i own vinyl what probably their best studio lp , ' smokin ' , member class ' 72 experienced ' performance ' album one finest live recordings ever made . album , especially tracks ' hallelujah , i love her so ' ' i don't need no doctor ' , two quintisential party-hardy songs era . early may 1973 , when king biscuit radio program made this recording band live san francisco , humble pie changed significantly their origins . while their first live album caught band their formative , raw primal stage , 1973 pie their peak commercially , much more polished act . their original lead guitarist , peter frampton , left band pursue his solo career . frampton replaced clem clempson this disc , we also addition blackberries , trio black female vocalists who add background vocals lead vocalist steve marriott . only three 10 tracks offered here (' stone cold fever ' , though listed liner notes , doesn't appear ) also found fillmore recordings , staples ' 4 day creep ' , ' hallelujah ... ' ' ... doctor ' . latter two tracks blackberries modify arrangement , so they quite different recordings . predictably , tour tapped king biscuit promoting band two studio albums following success ' performance ' , ' smokin ' ' eat it ' . four tracks (' c'mon everybody ' , ' 30 days hole ' , ' road runner ' , ' hot ' nasty ' ) drawn ' smokin ' two ' eat it ' , opener , ' up your sleeves ' upbeat , drum-driven cover stones ' ' honky tonk women ' . rounding out setlist cover ray charles ' ' blues i believe my soul ' , which track five first ( only ) slow-tempoed number performed . humble pie signature songs , ' hot ' nasty ' , ' hallelujah ... ' , ' ... doctor ' never cracked top 40 , but gleaned plenty play house dorm parties album-oriented fm radio . those songs pretty much representative hard-driving funk blues-rock band specialized . steve marriott ethyl merman baby-boom generation , able belt out set lyrics potency essential overwhelm already overwhelming decibles generated clempson co . it also fascinating hear marriott offer muhammed ali-like prose songs , blending images hell-and-brimstone preacher modern-day rapper into one engaging , non-stop rock ' roll lead singer . most instrumental work confined limited number chords maximum number watts , although clempson marriott occasionally engage some sweet guitar interplay , most notably ' 30 days ... ' . we also times treated some 1970 nostalgia , such marriott repititious mantra " oh , people we gotta live together ... " allusions richard nixon twelve-minute plus ' road runner ' . while cover specifically identifies ' ... doctor ' " 12 minute version " , running times not offered remaining tracks , but they all run 4 7 minutes ( according my cd player ) . degree which humble pie become commercial entity illustrated fact performances ' ... doctor ' , 1973 tour , become occasion audience participation . despite additional tracks back-up vocals available this disc , i still regard fillmore concert humble pie piece de resistance . this disc arrive handsomely packaged , extensive informative liner notes bruce pilato regarding history both humble pie king biscuit program ( named after radio program 1920 , sponsored king biscuit flour company ! ) . this only fifth recording made flower hour , which would blossom into storied popular production 1970 progressed , so it possesses bit historic pomp well	1

much like lasgo " far away " cd , this definitely one you'll want if you love fusion modern dance 80s new wave/nrg . plus , you get bonus disc remixes live tracks -- i would rather they put more remixes instead ( like those track " " ) , but least those available cd single . this predominantly very catchy electro synth house , featuring mostly female vocal ( strong vocals pop dance singer ) but there occasional lead male ( who sings 80s new wave feel ) . tracks break down like this : cd 1:1 . fairytale ( incredible synth pop dance track)2 . ( super catchy , more 80s hi-nrg commercial feel)3 . ten miles ( more mellow dance track , like moodier depeche , or perhaps camouflage , but female vocal)4 . paris berlin ( 80s hi-nrg feel , very commercial)5 . peace inside ( gorgeous dance track -- chorus specatacular)6 . vienna ( you definitely know where this band coming this phenomenal synth dance cover ultravox classic)7 . dressed blue ( downtempo electro house -- almost reminds me moodier abba song)8 . ultimate control ( hot track . male sings lead , it reminds me something wolfsheim would do)9 . keen disco ( don't know why superior original mix bonus disc . this slow version . very dark depeche feel)10 . cheap trick kinda girl ( trying fun maybe ? just check out title . this pretty horrid house song -- male even guesting sort real mccoy type spoken part . blech)11 . loved like maniac ( hi-nrg retro feel -- reminds me something bobby o would flirts record)12 . deeper still ( dark brooding dance track -- pretty heavy stuff , but mesmerizing)13 . sunday morning march ( short " outro " . non-dance instrumental)cd 2:1 , 2 . paris berlin -- original extended mix better , if you hunt down cd single . united nations mix sort bland , dj alligator mix very euro dance3 , 4 . keen disco -- hit run disco mix heavier euro dance beat , original mix winner , more retro synth dance feel . 5 . careful boys -- campy dance song featuring downtempo verse house beat kicking during chorus . not bad , but better off here than first disc . 6 . bass driven music -- instrumental electro house7 . balagan -- real novelty dance song . very euro nrg , not really vocal . 8-11 . live tracks not bad . perhaps some infernal older stuff because it sounds dated	1

even if you purchase original reprise albums , this collection may come somewhat revelation . sinatra , help nancy , selected his favorite tunes , his judgment selecting his own material this reprise quot ; ballad anthologyquot ; unerring his taste choosing material other composers . result refinement refinement , distillation sinatra during period when his voice rare vintage form . particularly satisfying readings he gives van heusen quot ; second time aroundquot ; quot ; all my tomorrows . quot ; equally memorable his reprise quot ; put your dreams away , quot ; once his radio theme song played his funeral . but stand-out , surprisingly , quot ; i hadn't anyone til you , quot ; old standard that frequently sung too fast or hokey , schmaltzy style . sinatra version simply transcendent , arguably his best ballad performance record . comparison , lennon quot ; yesterdayquot ; web quot;didn't we ? quot ; , though worthy tunes , just don't hold up	1

this isn't my favorite tom russell album , there others i certainly prefer . one thing tom russell , even stuff that not his ' best ' better than 98% what out there . i bought box visions because it includes ' blood oranges ' , song based paul bowles short story ' distant episode ' . short story one most disturbing things i've ever read , song manages capture bowles eerie images moroccan ' random violence/vengance ? ' so well it makes me shudder every time i hear it , almost caused me wreck car first time i heard it radio . well crafted song should evoke emotions , this one certainly me , goosebump city . it reminder not everything that well ' pretty ' . always tom russell , excellent songwriting , but if you're not already familiar his work , or easily ' creeped out ' , start ' long way around ' or his latest ' man god knows where ' . not shudder bunch those , unless it one those catlike sheer delight shudders hits just before ecstasy sets mind goes blank . hey , tom good stuff . you don't believe me , find place where it safe pass out listen	1
realistic one best guitar pop albums ever made , certainly among very best 1990 . melodies fantastic , some catchy upbeat others mellow . dominique durand sweet voice french accent give melancholic lyrics such poetic beauty . melodic hooky guitar could easily turned into power pop ( sister group fountains wayne ) , but this perfect bittersweetness , energizing yet moody emotional , balance sadness hope , like working up nerve your first kiss . production pacing upbeat downbeat songs object lesson how create perfect pop record . ten years after its release , this still among my very favorite albums all time , one handful i ever listened three continuous repeats . ( matthew sweet " girlfriend " among others . ) apartment life also great album , but although sound more fleshed out sophisticated , songs perhaps small notch below those realistic don't hang together quite well . rest ivy catalog good , but never quite recaptures freshness energy first two albums , better mined singles . if you like female-fronted guitar pop bands like aimee mann , sundays , 10,000 maniacs , sarah mclachlan , indigo girls , innocence mission , everything but girl , mazzy star , juliana hatfield , cardigans , etc ., you owe it yourself give sound samples listen . if you like this album , i strongly recommend frou frou " details " perfect follow-up . you may also find yourself seeking out french pop like coralie cl�ment or going back french classics like fran�oise hardy , serge gainsbourg , jacques dutronc , jacques brel listen	1
this cd apex broiling fusion scene 1970 . one most imagininative , compelling groups ever . this their best album far !!!! i saw these guys live " my father place " long island 1980 . jon clark replaced holdsworth tour , but it hardly mattered ( i initially dissapointed course ) . this collection tunes listenable , exciting rock/jazz . it part it genesis albums like yes ' " close edge " . momentous . just beatles dragged their version chuck berry across atlantic , bruford absolute love smokin ' blue note albums late 50 early 60 origin this fine collection tunes . nothing better , i don't care what you say ; this point history prog , they all chasing allan holdsworth bill bruford . they still ! drink right source ! ahhhhhhhhhhh-refreshing	1

killswitch engage one best metal bands emerge recent years . i , relatively new world metal , first heard their song " when darkness falls " " freddy vs . jason " soundtrack few years back . it blew me away , but i wasn't sure whether or not i convinced enough buy one their albums . then i heard song them " headbanger ball volume one " compilation , decided i could ignore them no longer . i went got " alive or just breathing , " unbelievably awesome cd , one few i could play entire way through without skip song . after this album , killswitch parted ways their singer jesse david leach recruited vocalist howard jones their new frontman . although some saw this beginning end band , many others welcomed it good step fresh new direction . i already biased towards jones , mainly because he provided vocals two songs got me hooked band , though leach no means bad singer , i personally prefered jones . now i'm sure there bunch you out there who already hate me now ready press " no " bottom this review . i can't really much stop you besides finishing my critique . second i saw " rose sharyn " headbanger ball , i knew i get this cd . i promptly , let me tell you , it hands down one best investments i've ever made . opening " bid farewell " features extremely headbangable rhythmic opening , goes display what this band all : good amount heaviness , good amount melody , overall sense power . " take this oath " up next , though it not memorable " bid farewell , " it still good song . " when darkness falls " one best songs album . it slightly ( very slightly ) altered its original version , but it retains its greatness nevertheless . " rose sharyn " follows , perhaps most popular song cd . this popularity justified , it too one best songs found here . " inhale " melodic instrumentalopening " breathe life , " rather heavy track , when it relents its heaviness chorus , expresses message optimism hope ( themes appear recurringly throughout cd ) . title track up seventh , though some find it too melodic their tastes , i think it good example killswitch lighter side . " declaration " similar " take this oath , " if only due fact neither memorable first . after few listens , though , this song grow you big time . " world ablaze " epic track inspiration , one album high points . its awe-inspiring finale leads straight into " ... embers rise , " sedate melodic instrumental . " wasted sacrifice " yet good song , one which also possesses good message taking action what you think right . " hope ... " , last song album , one my favorites , it features great work band whole . special edition this cd ( which i happily paid , even though i own original--it just good ) features howard jones ' take " irreversal , " song band self-titled debut . he pretty good job , but his vocals occasionally get lost mix . it also contains new song " my life yours , " decent song suffers same vocal problems one before it , well live versions " life lifeless , " " fixation darkness , " " my last serenade " ( jones fantastic job all them ) . only problem i cd " resident evil mix " title track . not only it radio-friendly , edited version , but it totally unnecessary . besides , though , this one best metal cds i've heard long time ( shadows fall " war within , " god forbid " gone forever , " trivium " ascendancy " ) . if you're reading this review you don't this album , then stop wasting your time ; get out there get it	1
i've one ryan albums , " day " my favorites pile several years . great album way . anyway , i listening live365 tonight , happened come across his latest cd " beautiful " , i say , " what else would you name it ?

i listened this lp several times . air supply makes most beautiful music our time thequot ; book lovequot ; nothing short . though song quot ; all you wantquot ; lacks harmony repetitive lyrics it erotic song . quot ; when i sayquot ; quot ;d aybreakquot ; very powerful ballads songs deliver quot ; air supplyquot ; quality we come love . my most favorite song album quot ; lets stay together tonightquot ; far best album . vocals fantastic , chords strings really deliver different sound . point song some ramp ; beat it very good . even if song lasts 6:47 min . it doesn't matter becuse this song go forever . quot ; oncequot ; beautiful song lp , it intsrumental it take your breath away . graham russell produced wrote all music i hope mr . russell keeps up great arrangements like quot ; book lovequot ; . maybe future we here more air supply air waves becuse radio stations must sleeping when this one came out	1
i slightly aware chris rea occassional airplay/videaos , but only really heard lot his music my xm , xm cafe channel particular . i enjoyed it enough actually buy his cd . this album excellent sampling his work over years , much variety . bluesy rock tunes , nice ballads , etc . i particularily like his vocal delivery compbined some very nice guitar work . i think comparisons style content leonard cohen made , only chris more musical , my opinion . or maybe i just like small night club groove wonderful strat guitar rythyms . i used my free pepsi itunes winner get song i liked isn't this album , quot ; looking summerquot ;	1

you push play party comes . party ridicules song , shortly after it jumps into khashoggis ship which sucks . then what you get miracle which very pop sounding dumb . after you get average rocker i want it all . then you get strange invisible man tune . then you get happy stupid breakthru . after comes track rain must fall which nothing special . scandal next song which quite dull . then you get lame my baby me followed average it all worth it . 2/5 review i just gave you not my real review , it simply way looking miracle through eyes mainstream music fan anyway my official review goes more like this : party honestly not too good , but it some catchy moments . khashoggi ship alot like party but better . so far not too impressive . miracle next excellent song indeed . next song quite solid i want it all , which quite superior single version . invisible man very good song . breakthru awesome don't stop me now esque song . rain must fall doesn't make lot noise but enjoyable . scandal awesome song where freddie puts his all into it . my baby me- some reason pretty good after while finally it all worth it classic great finish . extras : hang there cool song deserves listened main tracks . chinese torture cool especially if you like brian may guitar playing . invisible man 12 " version okay . i honestly think this album any queen fan not pass up . tracks really make this one 5 stars miracle , i want it all , breakthru , scandal , it all worth it all seriously great songs	1
this cd great . it not only some steve greatest hits it also five unreleased songs . so it ulmost like new cd songs you haven't heard . this cd must all steve perry fans . i loved it	1
this currently one my favorite cds right now . i considered getting lp , but i wanted able upload it my computer , so i opted cd . only after listening it couple times , i able fully enjoy it . it less accessible than " unseen " , which i think better than this . ( download " astro travellin " ) yet , it still some pretty sweet tracks . " closer f/ mf doom " " don't blink " stand out particularly . i got into madlib last year when i discovered madvillain . mf doom rough voice good , but madlib beats insane . here i discovered indie hiphop . there i learned his other projects , yesterday new quintet , , course , quazimoto . his sped up voice holds up full album , even though i wasn't sure it would . i would reccomend you buy " further adventures lord quas , " but before you , get " unseen .	1
my title beyond true . it now 2005 , i've this cd 10 years now . it only cd i've ever owned , every song good . i never like every song cd , except deluxe !!! i got this cd christmas ' 95 , listened heck out it . then i lost it after 2 years or so , found it probably 3 1/2 years ago . when i found it i very happy , i've gone back listening it often possible ! it still good any cd out there !!!!!	1
1980s looking bright individual beatles , least beginning it . john lennon re-enter studio record his album double fantasy after 5 years spent father sean . paul mccartney freed himself constraints leading band starting work mccartney ii , his first solo album since 1971 ram ( although i consider his wings albums paul his alone ) . ringo starr hitting very rough patch musically , but personally he over moon after meeting woman who would become his second wife , actress barbara bach . george harrison , he midst personal joys himself , married one his personal assistants dark horse records , olivia arias , then witnessing birth his only child , dhani . musically , he holding steady after 1979 self-titled album reasonably well , top 20 hit " blow away " . supposedly , george began work somewhere england almost immediately afterwards , said ready record stores around fall 1980 . but dark horse parent company , warner bros . records , not really care final product , insisted george re-enter studio record new material . naturally , he none too happy this proposition , but acquiesced , making sure some new songs hit company right where they hurt . it wonder they considered revised album worth release this time , so somewhere england last hit racks early summer 1981 . if one good thing came these interminable delays , it song returned george top 10 first time since 1973 " give me love [ give me peace earth ] " . shortly after george went back into studio second time , his old friend beatle mate john lennon brutally murdered , causing not just friends family mourn , but entire world . paul would write record " here today " his tribute john his 1982 album tug war . george beat him marketplace his own elegy , " all those years ago " , which wonderful twist fate became unofficial beatles reunion over decade before anthology . ringo starr agreed play drums song , while paul his wife linda sang backing vocals . add engineering geoff emerick string arrangements george martin , it labor love john smiling above . sprightly country-rock-tinged number deservedly peaked #2 charts , manages pay unique tribute john lines " they've forgotten all god/he only reason we exist/yet you one they said so weird " . odd coming deeply religious man like george , man who uttered infamous " beatles bigger than jesus " remark recorded " god " , which he doubted his very existence . although i am sure john would appreciated irony . like song , somewhere england mostly upbeat affair despite blackness original cover restored reissue , one things warner brothers wanted changed . " life itself " heartfelt tribute olivia , shows george softened somewhat new love . " which i lost " not obvious anthem , but chorus seems indicate one : " i need someone show me/illumine my consciousness/remove dark me " . maybe last he found it . even potentially mournful song like " teardrops " positively buoyant borders almost new wave . this particularly applies songs which george striking out against record company backroom boys telling him what . " blood clone " " unconsciousness rules " show cynical wit george always , towards end his life , would get sharper . fact warner brothers agreed release such potentially libelous tunes means they either missed or got joke completely . attitude like , perhaps it no surprise george recorded less less over years . when artist who fine songwriter george , should they ever include covers album , could mean they running out ideas . who knows if case somewhere england , which featured two them . maybe it george underhanded dig recording material his label would rather him . either way , hoagy carmichael " baltimore oriole " " hong kong blues " manage fit somehow , showing george great interpretor well creator standards himself . someone who helped organize concert bangladesh , george always sociopolitician heart , somewhere england still allows those opportunities preach ever so slightly . " writing wall " seems more cynicism its veins , if george throwing up his hands defeat world too much state disrepair saved . but album closes more optimistic vibes " save world " , continuing album primary mood bounciness . while still bit biting its wit , george not lose faith even song first line : " we've got save world/someone else may want use it " . truer words never spoken , ones john would certainly written . george dark horse albums now finally back print after several years out it , it would nice if bonus tracks somewhere england more plentiful . four songs said not made final cut could welcome additions rather than just demo " save world " , which not patch version finally reached fruition . george harrison may little ticked off his record company nitpicking over somewhere england , but he still well enough himself creating one his better albums , my opinion . soundwise , it proved george ready transfer into high-gloss high-concept atmosphere 1980s , route paul would continue well . but maybe george battles his label sap him some enthusiasm , his follow-up gone troppo ( 1982 ) would commercial disaster , often ranked his worst album ( considering 1974 dark horse george insistence recording touring it while battling severe laryngitis , speaks lot ) . however , even if bloom off rose when it came records george , somewhere england showed he could still give it old college try when he wanted . first foremost , he proved when record business tries interfere productivity , one should thrive , not cave	1
i eagerly awaited arrival this cd wanting hear some new rockabilly bands i not familiar , but i severly dissapointed . quality tracks this cd mediocre best some just downright bad , two standout tracks red hot real gone spinouts(great tune , good hook , excellent slap bass , guitar interplay)the other standout girl my dreams , peter wolves very elvis , maries name era early sixties sounding . majority other tunes just dowright pitiful . if you new rockabilly scene , few helpful suggestions , stray cats , blasters , robert gordon , planet rockers , sun era 56-59 elvis , carl perkins , gene vincent , eddie cochran , list goes better spent dollars quality rockabilly music , apologies these artists , but if this current state rockabilly , please somebody help us !!!!!	-1
i'm not happy negative reports people provided here . my inital exposure clever lyrical content poe initally through conjure one cd i've since bought her other solo material addition these collaborative efforts . poe definately fan milwaukee . songs content this cd engaging light pop orientation vein dj armin van burne , balligomingo , enigma , delerium . i've getting into act this genre called collide band happens my favorite genre . this album however , played daily my ipod last two weeks . i can't get song " extra ordinary ways " out my head . if you like these other bands then this line up great . i'd love chance see how they collaborate some behind scenes stuff how rhyes ( spelling ) worked these other artists how his collaborative procesess work . i also secretly wonder if he hip other projects out there outside this genre like dream theater ? well , if you like pretty or vocal trance music this you . it more poppy flavor than energizer bunny trance sounds definately more loungy . enjoy it	1
first off i like bolton early work late 70 mid 80 . bolton first albums blackjack 1979 , worlds apart 1980 , michael bolton 1983 , everybody crazy 1985 all pretty good melodic rockers , but this end . soul provider beginning soul failure . only good songs here how we lovers you wouldn't know love . these songs catchy chorus rock somewha t.t he rest album garbage . why you sell out bolton ? it such shame what could . if bolton stayed melodic metal/rock path he would rocker still this day most likely dam good one like he early mid 80 . it cryin shame	-1
all i say i thrilled i found cs stevie all his greatest hits . i am 80 freak so you imagine how happy i find this cd . what made me happier i got my cd 3 days listening it everyday since then ..	1
well , i bought this cd because my son , neil harrison , loves marc anthony tina arena song " i want spend my lifetime loving you " , which played end movie . he heard song first time when he around two months old , i noticed he loved it , so i played end movie over over over until he went sleep . i figured it easier buy cd play it him bedtime , so that what we , i sing it him cd he goes sleep peacefully . i think if my baby liked it , it get great review ! i loved all other songs too , it great cd	1
i loved every dmb album up until this one . after 10 years making most profoundly wonderful music , law averages finally kicked dave crew . i fan since 1997 loved everything this band . every album every song superb ! this album hugh departure tradition dave matthews band all true dmb fans know love . this album also made division old hardcore dmb fans ( fans real band includes all 5 members ) new dmb fans ( " i heard it radio liked it " fans)this album not include all 5 members leroi boyd almost non-existent leaving just guitar , bass , drums ie . meat potatoes band . every band guitar , bass drums making them sound just like every other band out there . now how many bands you know fiddle sax/wind instruments them ? dmb used one them . you won't find adrenaline pumping fiddle solos or heartfelt wind work this album . next we dave playing electric guitar co-writing majority songs over weekend boy it show . he co-wrote these songs new producer glenn ballard who plays piano this one well . only song work art lyrically space . i also like everyday well only because its evolved form true dmb song , #36 ( hani hani ) . this one real treat see live band sometime play both #36 everyday together . yes i say again ... dave plays electric this one . big mistake going what your traditionally known acoustic then going directly electric ... just ask dylan this one . i felt like i it assault my ears took my breath away not good way . my jaw dropped floor disbelief i just could not believe what i hearing . this not dave matthews band ! only song electric worked space due it dark sad ending relationship . great poetry lyrics one song saves star 1/5 . there lot reviews here saying it took few listens before they really liked it . i believe these fans just denial i can't blame them . it take few listens before you fell love this band ? when i first heard crash into me too much i just floored could not believe sounds i hearing . not this so called dmb . band sax fiddle makes it work !!?? wow ! take 4 things out make dmb , dmb you get mediocre any band . 4 things make formula dave matthews band work uplifting awe inspiring explosive fiddle solos boyd ( ants marching ) , emotional wind works leroi ( say goodbye ) , dave lyrics ( #41 i'm not big fan dave vocals but thats every album ... i wish they would put out all instrumental album ) , tricky timings , rhythms , beats carter ( #36 live red rocks ) , all which pretty much not exist this album . this not dmb if you buy it least you won't buy it under false pretense your buying dmb album . go get any other album besides this stand up ( which even more disappointing then everyday)hardcore dmb fans ... you warned	-1

atb one most talented artists i come across long time . his music very differentiated unique . very listenable whether you driving your girlfriend , relaxing beach , sailing out deep blue , or just plain mellowing out your sofa or favorite chair ( not mention moving sensually across dance floor ! ) . it romantic , nostalgic , hot , cool , sexy , temperamental .... awesome ! i can't get enough his music . great music all ages who enjoy fresh , experiential sounds tease imagination tempt memories young old alike . take trip ... buy atb music ... revisit your past while connecting future ( i know ... sounds weird ... but it happens )	1
story tim buckley disquieting familiarity - dead 28 he already through classic cycle : raw prodigy , hot property , creative disillusionment , unpopular experimentation , bitter confrontations industry executives . many gems produced during his brief , intense career - happy sad shines most brightly . buckley emerged fully formed folk singer , one many time . 12-string guitar rang out lush strong , astounding voice dancing far wide across 4-octave range , he made very compelling one-man show . buckley voice slightly reminiscent steve winwood's; it same choirboy spirituality . some his high notes simply chilling . time he made happy sad , buckley looking milieu melded jazz folk - no easy trick , but he manages it flawlessly here . this cd feels very integrated , otherworldly sensibility flows seamlessly one track next . said , he clearly taking creative risks , jazzy detours not endear him his folk following . using his voice both storytelling vehicle improvisational instrument , buckley jams other players , most notably ethereal vibes david friedman . happy sad , tim buckley seems bound determined avoid generating hits suited airplay , almost if he deliberately thwarting studio executives . this his most commercially successful project , however , not saying great deal . find rainy day person you love , nail door shut . there special magic this cd doesn't come very often . while buzzin ' fly gypsy woman stand out , every moment happy sad something wonderful tell you .	1
all their albums together , this my favorite . first , impulse out this world job remastering recording , so it sounds like it recorded yesterday . second , both kai jj tip-top shape doing some really great tunes . solos just wonderful blend so well . finally , who beat sidemen this album , c'mon , bill evans ? paul chambers ? roy haynes ? spectacular album ..	1
not many studio albums ever made make you feel like you live concert . this true gem . great piano !!!!	1
this cd raw electric - one my all time favorites . i agree one reviewer who said he keeps trying find r.l. cd this much energy , but can't . i doubt we ever . if you like " quieter " , more traditional style " too bad jim " , you may not find this your taste . but raw power emotion , you won't find anything else like it . i think that why i've played it so much over past 5 years - it just different . first you get lulled " over hill " then crashed into " alice mae " . also , check out often overlooked gem this collection - " tribute fred " . range this cd big style allows . you'll reach this whenever you don't want hear same old sounds	1
past couple years , aaron funk spat out music prolific pace possibly only succeeded merzbow or perhaps scott herren under his batch different pseudonyms . i listened much what funk released venetian snares , while i appreciate what he creates , i am often left cold his work . each album he put out , there always one or two tracks slam my ass , then handfull pretty good , but remainder seems just pound my brain into peaceful submission doesn't really care process it all after awhile . relative terms , rossz csillag alatt sz�letett took little bit longer funk complete , after i'd read several places it easily his most melodic work yet , he learned play violin , even some trumpet release , i started wondering just what tricks he up his sleeve . it turns out , this release definitely least partial turning point funk artist , it mixes his usual hyper-crisp beat programming strings , horns , piano , lots other elements his most musical interesting release yet . after opening track " sikertelens�g " rolls forty seconds dark inprovised piano noodlings , " szerencsetlen " starts off album proper quick bursts string samples flow dash like horror-movie soundtrack spliced together chase-scene before sweet snare-rush blasts familiar amen break start hammering away . track progresses , even more strings pile onto mix , delicious string scampers raise tension even more . " ongyilkos vas�rnap " reworking hungarian track billie holiday turn covered , funk samples holiday sprinkles slow , churning rhythm some sprinklings rhodes piano great effect . if you believe it , there tracks release completely beat-less ( like dark " felbomlasztott ment�kocsi " " galamb egyed�l " ) they don't feel all out-of-place release . fact , tracks act great breathers release almost exclusively runs shadows . all those wondering if release complete change venetian snares , rest assured there still plenty mind-bending hyperactive beat workouts . " m�sodik galamb " opens quick horn stabs even some random spoken-word phrases but soon bursts into frenetic , laser-blasting , horn string nightmare . likewise , " k�tsarku mozgalom " opens layers overlapping strings before cranking up into spastic drill-and-bass attack rises falls goes every which way course almost eight minutes but never , never boring . if i one complaint release , it funk seems use some same drum programming sounds ( amen break serviced quite well different variations ) several times during course album , but given variety rest instrumentation release , it something that not worth quibbling . this now venetian snares release my collection i most assuredly reach nearly every time i wish listen something venetian snares now . other words , even if you haven't enjoyed his previous work , this one might it you . ( almost cool music reviews	1
i bought this cd , desperate new no doubt songs expecting something just pretty good , since it album mostly b-sides songs scrapped before they could make it onto any original no doubt cd . i'm really glad i get it because this cd completely exceeded my expectations . these songs not sound like rejects . they're all good enough made it onto albums they originally recorded . remixes also great . it like listening brand new , original no doubt cd , which we're not likely get while . this definitely must-have any no doubt fan	1

good title ep here , that sure . 9 tracks ? i think they could just entire remix album bonus tracks , or , just make new album altogether . i really liked cover art hau ruck , i can't say same this one , it rather bland . friend mine pre-ordered t-shirt , i didn't really want wearing ruck zuck t-shirt , adios or drug against war shirts looked much better . anyway , anyone who pre-ordered direct kmfdm store , it wasn't exactly best deals , considering they're selling it here more or less same amazon . 1 . free your hate ( kaptn krunch mix)- very disappointed this . i liked original speed it just really rockin ' feel it . i think it lost anything good it . it sounds slow , taken apart . don't get me wrong , it sounds good here , but i hoping faster remix , upbeat techno rhythm or something like . after awhile i hoping some guitar or beat would bust it would get really good , it turned out not bad though . not really good opener ruck zuck . 2 . mini mini mini ( . hogstorm rain city swingin ' samples mix)- considering this cover song , this isn't entirely unexpected . original 60 apparently , i don't listen 60 music , but remix seems fitting here . first french song kmfdm i'm fairly certain . i enjoyed it this way better , doesn't go rest ep though . 3 . professional killer ( one only mix)- i really liked this one . i think it probably most prominent track ruck zuck kmfdm premiering it showing it off longe before any other track . first it just previews , but i think it up myspace , amount listens clearly indicate its popularity . professional killer great hau ruck , but this much better far . i thoroughly relieved when i heard this , ruck zuck looking better . 4 . ready blow ( dwarves mix ) - nothing notable here . original dragged bit , but one my favourite tracks . i would say this really good remix though . i believe jules part this band called dwarves , which sascha konietzko referred jokingly retarded . i didn't find anything special or strikingly unique this one , although it quite good . 5 . hau ruck ( spezial mix)- good remix right there . finally some driving guitars really beat original . original good , but this one just get really alive . 6 . real thing ( nude mix)- i think only fitting word original boring . this didn't really pick up pace all . but , i liked it better than original , remix made it alot better listen . i like diversity remixes ruck zuck , this really calms you down , before der mussolini . 7 . der mussolini- only new song album so speak . cover classic daf song which very popular germany . i haven't heard original , i doubt many other people . i like song here it reminds me helmut ! mein helmut ! beat all kmfdm fan anxious new song should really impressed this one . it german , but lyrics really simple straight forward , considering there total 5 lines chorus , that all that sung throughout song . it oringinally dance classic , i think kmfdm lived up those standards this one really upbeat . 8 . wwiii ( one only ' extended ' mix)- best song ruck zuck . vocals completely rearranged , i think song would sounded better original vocals , but i like beat this song , really hard heavy compared everything else . ruck zuck , this song closely resembles der mussolini . really enjoyable track which relentless it pounding beat . bit late releasing remix wwiii considering it came out 2003 . why not this wwiii live ? i don't know , but i suppose it gives ruck zuck variety , this certainly isn't filler . 9 . ansage - i noticed reviewer gave this 5 stars . why ? it narrative , it shouldn't even rated . this isn't anything like " dogma " narrative xtort . one , this very little background sound , it isn't dorona or cheryl this , it sascha . translation good message , i like it , but if you don't speak german , i don't see how you enjoy listening someone speak language you don't understand . there some english mixed i believe , but very small amount . fun rocking this one . good ep , apparently they tour it . i'm impressed this there really wasn't any filler here all . great news . i'm hoping catch them north bay .	1

named profile section , this my personal top 5 . reasons twofold : it live , brownie there . there something live , when it right - like duke ' 56 newport , diz ' 57 , joao montreaux ' 85 - calls history into sharp focus . this , volume 2 . sure , there ' clam ' or two , like donaldson harmony coming back quot ; split kickquot ; , but it makes it human , more fun . tempos smokin ' without pushed too fast ( blakey makes sure it ) give-and-take players , well conversing mc pee wee marquette , blakey intro quot ; night tunisiaquot ; give feel event . horace silver lou donaldson perfect brownie , blakey plays loose fast this gig . curly russell rounds out quintet . if you like your bop hard soulful , you definately dig this	1

my wife elvis fan , but even i enjoyed listening most christmas songs presented this album . couple songs little too " bluesy " me	1
i always opinion who 1970 live album " live leeds " , often named one ofif not bestlive albums ever made , overrated . i felt they weren't very energetic , didn't play their best overall weren't really fire . i mean , i really always liked it , but didn't feel it worthy lot its praise . i myself always preffered " live isle wight festival 1970 " ( belatedly released 1996 , but worth wait ) . however , after hearing this deluxe edition album , i safely say my opinion changed better . newly improved sound quality greatly helps album quality wise . energy level seems much more apparent , especially songs like " substitute " " shakin ' all over " . i now see why album so highly regarded . i'm still debating whether i still prefer " live isle wight " or this . i hve not listned " tommy " performance second disc , but i'm sure it brilliant . i say liner notes excellent , first disc alone makes this cd must	1

what great work . when i first listened soundtrack , i taught i mistaken . first track begins same thrilling guitar flamenco beats " mask zorro " but james horner went even further this soundtrack , composing score total continuity previous zorro . same entertainment , same joy everytime you listen it . great score somehow brings us 7 years ago , where " mask ... " let us . same themes back new touch maestro , unforgettable . his name horner . james , horner . thank you	1
without doubt , this color me badd top album . songs here so powerful moving , whether it make you get up dance or just sit ponder life general . i never listened cd made me think so many different aspects my life before . quot ; close heavenquot ; quot ; how deepquot ; beautiful songs . i wish i find girl makes me feel words those songs . quot;rosanna little sisterquot ; good beat brings up typical scenario guys - quot ; what you when girl you dating hot younger sister you attracted greatly also likes you too ? quot ; quot ; choosequot ; quot ; time chancequot ; round out best songs . other songs good also , just not , my opinion , same quality five i mentioned . definite buy	1

forget past , let move ' good ' because there so much more than just one song these guys . now granted i love " good " album deluxe friction , baby , but band evovled their sound . any fan long standing band , you must adjust direction they going , all while enjoying their older , more popular , stuff . anyway , review . " burned " starts off nice sing-a-long rock/pop song . lyrics aren't too sappy , happy love song , which good , b/c you won't mind singing it . if managed right , this song would huge hit , very catchy . kevin dreamy-like voice submerges through " daylight . " softens up pace , but not exactly too slow or quiet song . features multitude percussion w/ some backing vocals . good song listen your significant other moonlit night , even though ironically it called " daylight . " somewhat more stripped down " lifetime " appears this album . it still nice version , but personally i like one closer better . this version , however , released single . " it only natural " little eerie twangy , but still not bad song . still very unique song some good lyrics . " overcome " similar radiohead-esque sound it . notes held longer some synthesized music here there . not bad . " special " brings nice kick extra ' oomph ' during chrorus . reminds me song splender called " special " so i don't know if influence . still great song . " american dream " great catchy pop song . it funny how bte keeps putting out these hits hardly anyone here . one best songs ever bte comes " our last night . " lyrics unbelievable meaningful . music outstanding , kevin voice spot . this sort like " stars " combined " lifetime . " quirky story teller springs " southern thing " which down dirty song new orleans , which even made it even more meaningful after katrina hit . i'm glad there something good still coming out big easy . " juicy " might sound familar those desperate houswives commercials . only metronomic guitar kevin high pitched voclals compliments this mix funk disco beats which main focus . if you liked " misunderstood " closer , than you'll like " hollow " which little bit faster . " our finest year " provides great lyrics slower more relaxed ballad type sound . more down earth song " breathless " which ends album nicely . rather shorter finishing number , but not distracting album whole anyway . before robots music not fame . better than ezra already here gone , so this more or less album made fans . i'd say it combination how your garden grow closer . it features some nice dreamy songs some upbeat catchy pop/rock songs . w/ occasional quirkiness band so good .	1

" joy world " eugene ormandy philadelphia orchestra chorus providing rich selection christmas songs , both classical traditional , arranged arthur harris . it former most impressive , although there fewer them , starting mendelssohn " hark ! herald angels sing " tchaikovsky " waltz flowers " " nutcracker , " then ending bach " jesu , joy man desire , " " pastoral symphony " " hallelujan chorus " handel " messiah . " eugene ormandy ( born jen� blau budapest ) one most famous popular american conductors 20th century , known best his long time relationship philadelphia orchestra . originally gaining public notice orchestra when he served last-minute replacement ill arturo toscanini 1931 , ormandy would serve musical director phialdelphia 1938 until 1980 . under his baton philadelphia orchestra became known its warm tones , textured romantic " philadelphia sound , " which well represented this christmas album . i always thought ormandy interpretation rachmaninoff particularly strong , although i not know enough classical music articulate coherent defense position beyond noting when vladimir horowitz played rachmaninoff third concerto occasion 50th anniversary his carnegie hall debut , he picked ormandy conductor orchestra nigh t.t here over hour worth music here you enjoy if you like more classical approach your christmas music . but ormandy work always marked ability bring out emotions music played symphonic orchestra . why standout tracks here " little drummer boy , " " i wonder i wander , " " what child this ?

marion band matured each album while most people recall pop forever young amp ; big japan ( although hardly enough actually make them household name stateside ) this album more mature sophisticated electronic sound . always , gold vocals otherworldly few match his sound range ( accept morten harket a-ha ) music truly elevates his voice . quot ; foolsquot ; quot ; impossible dreamquot ; stand out singles , but quot ; iron johnquot ; so infectious easily greatest alphaville song ever . reggae-tinged quot ; faithquot ; sounds like opening track fun summer blockbuster movie guaranteed get you going morning . title seems so far removed music , perhaps many people can't figure it out , but this album fantastic	1

fledgling uk electropop band hot chip found greater success their second album , " warning , " but thankfully not sold their souls so . this sophomore album simply exploding experiments ideas , so much so otherwise amazing album gets little drippy around edges . give them few more years , hot chip blowing our minds bravest , wildest electronica . moment , they're still trying their wings . it opens retro drones " careful , " right before song suddenly settles into more expansive little groove . it sounds torn retro synth artier edges they so , so good . they stabilize their sound somewhat " i boy school , " its steady beats catchy little melody . there , hot chip experiments just any sound electropop include -- airy little ballads , hip-hoppish dance music , delicate beats like something telepopmusik , grimy robot rock , twinkly little art tunes , some kraftwerk-inspired techno . other words , they twist those amazing art beats into ... anything , really . not many bands every kind music more or less successful results , but hot chip pretty good all kinds music . only problem they seem bit torn popular retro sound , more ou t-t here art sounds . songs like " careful , " it feels awkward unbalanced . but once they work kinks out , hot chip probably few musical flaws all . they knack putting right beats right places , excel deceptively simple melodies never stop catchy -- even quieter ones draw you make you mumble words . they also know just how much pack into single song : beats heavy rough , or delicate crystalline . glimmering synths , spurts bass , funky melodies , buzzes , horns , sonic squiggling , other sounds spice up music . plenty artier moments , without losing catchy dancey beat . alexis taylor sounds bit like benjamin gibbard , his mellow vocals somewhat downbeat attitude . first he seems almost nebulous his own album , but he stands out more more you listen him murmur balloons , colours , " look after me i look after you/that something we both forgot .... " since they nominated mercury award , expect hot chip more prominent than before , hopefully they'll plenty time get even better than they already	1

i fan tim o'brien since his days hot rize . this duet album like-minded multi-instrumentalist darrell scott only reaffirms my opinion o'brien one greatest folk artists performing today . while scott may not household name ( he appeared both o'brien two solo howdy skies outtings : 1999 " crossing " 2001 " two journeys " ) , he complements o'brien nicely playing mandolin , banjo guitar . o'brien plays mandola , mandolin , guitar , bouzouki banjo . two share lead vocals hank williams tune " weary blues waiting " ; otherwise , they alternate lead harmony vocals , including lovely acapella reading hank williams ' " house gold . " rest album consists o'brien scott originals , two traditional tunes ( " little sadie " " keep your lamp trimmed burning " ) . album closes playful " second mouse " including kazoo , toy trombone , slide whistle , harmonica toy guitar accompaniment--it hoot ! album title explained liner notes : " we sat across each other played these songs real time darrell living room .

first , let me point out oasis my favorite band . there isn't oasis song i don't like . so i'm going guide you throughout entire album give you my overall opinion album . masterplan collection oasis b-sides singles covering their first three albums ( definitely maybe , ( what story ) morning glory , here now ) . featured tracks track listing decided online poll oasis fans 1998 . first up : " acquiesce " this probably most famous oasis b-side out there often played live . this song fantastic , combined vocal solos both liam noel gallagher make this song magnificent . noel solo seems sound better than liam , but nevertheless beautiful song . track two : " underneath sky " liam gallagher sings . it sounds good , not strong " acquiesce " but upbeat nice tune . track three : " talk tonight " noel beautiful guitar based song . this something you would hear street performer sing , lyrics sad , but tune relaxing . great song . track four : " going nowhere " noel sings once again , song sad one , but there mix brass string lighten it up . nice soft listen . track five : " fade away " after first few chords you know this definitely maybe era . hard , pure rock oasis good amount " shoegazer " influence . never fails slam good dose energy into me . track six : " swamp song " if you liked untitled filler tracks morning glory wanted whole song , that exactly what " swamp song " . it originally warm up song recording sessions , you tell why . nice hard guitar even mix harmonica it all . fantastic little tune . track seven : " listen up " my personal favorite song album . it plays hard but feels soft . bittersweet beautiful . noel voice shines lyrics flow magnificently . this song should single instead b-side . hidden gem . track eight : " i am walrus ( live ) " first all , this song not played live . it recorded during soundcheck audience noises later added . nevertheless entertaining song , faster paced harder rocking song than original . seems get repetitive end though , but might why oasis sometimes played this song last concerts their early days . track nine : " rockin ' chair " supposedly written noel gallagher back 1990 , this song makes interesting b-side . nice acoustic guitar solos organ mixes well . very well written song it one noel firsts . track ten : " half world away " great song bittersweet one . noel sings very well , while electic guitar organ mix softly nicely . track eleven : " ( it good ) free " hard rocker sounds like " shoegazer " rock opposed britpop . lyrics could use bit support , but i nevertheless enjoy it . there bit nice organ sounds like electric guitar . track twelve : " stay young " famous b-side , featured film " faculty " . lyrics sound like teen revolution , " stay young invincible " , but melody upbeat happy . nice song . track thirteen : " headshrinker " my second favorite song album . sounds like rock overcooked crisp . this hard pure oasis gets . fantastic song . track fourteen : " masterplan " track album named after makes nice finish album . strings brass mixed well bittersweet smooth song . don't miss guitar solo ( reversed recording solo ) . leaves you great aftertaste entire album . now , songs should here but didn't make cut . sadly , my favorite oasis b-side ( quite popular one well ) , " sad song " , missing . fact , they should added all definitely maybe-era b-sides , because they far best . " alive " , " take me away " , " d'yer wanna spaceman " , " cloudburst " some best oasis b-sides but sadly arent masterplan . instead there more focus morning glory-era b-sides . " angel child " b-side here now-era i very much enjoy but just wasn't there . overall , this great album . i highly reccomend it anybody who just loves music . album one my favorites because it encompasses sound oasis through three different albums most songs beautifully bittersweet . i also enjoyed hearing noel voice often , which nice considering liam sings most singles . time writing there supposedly plans sequel " masterplan " covering oasis b-sides their next three albums , it interesting see what makes grade . this indeed fantastic collection oasis b-sides .	1

three composers worked this album , one which infamous nobuo uematsu , it still turned out pretty flat . i feel ashamed say , too , because i've such fan final fantasy music , but there just wasn't whole lot this soundtrack . few songs stood out me , but i really stretch my taste accept them . nothing here bad , though . it just ... not epic , not revolutionary . doesn't make you cry or want sing . it just there . good background music , but you always find plenty . -- one composers , kumi tanioka , entire crystal chronicles soundtrack herself . actually turned out really good , much better than this collection mediocrity	-1
waller armstrong same generation collaborators music 1920s . louis first big leap popular stardom beyond tight group jazz musicians performers came when he introduced " ain't mis behavin '" broadway stage . audiences often forced him three or four encores . folks who seen show before would pay full price just get hear louis sing this one song . recordings late 20s louis all vocals simply my idea best music ever recorded anyone . rather than get them selected this way , you might want get one cds or collections covers period time everything , rather than just songs waller . likewise , while all stars not good his original chicago new york groups , particularly these later all-stars ( i prefer albums great jack teagarden ) , if you get into music you want all too . any rate , there no one else but louis who these songs justice except fat man himself , mr. waller	1

finally , i bought this soundtrack several days ago . but i little disappointed because it not so good my anticipation . when i watched this movie , song " jungle rhythm " my favourite . but when i listened this song soundtrack , i felt it little noisy confuse . lead vocals not so clear . i don't like song " colonel hathi march " all this album , fact , i didn't like this song beginning when i watched movie " jungle book " . my favourite song this album not movie , it " i've got you beat " . i love two children vocal this song , i thought this song real jungle rhythm ! " right where i belong " " braver " wonderful , i loved girl vocal , i felt warm inside when i listened these two songs . there 3 humorous songs which i loved very much , " he lucky , lucky snake " " elephant face " " never smile crocodile " , they always make me laugh ! " w-i-l-d " " queen jungle " wonderful too . generally speaking , except song " i wanna like you " " bare necessities " which sung different ways , every song this album worth listening	1
this album listened multiple times not tire it . instrumental work accompanies dolly wonderful vocals impecable . song mountain angel , despite one reviewer comments quite touching haunting . it story innocent woman who taken advantage jilted thoughtless man . crying harmonies reflect woman mournful cries give you goosebumps . balance such heavy subject material , " i get kick out you " light song sparkles like champagne bubbles . music just flows through you . it well worth getting this one .	1

" i would never learned whippits it not leary . thanks his soliloquy meat , i didn't eat salad until three years ago . even though he best known drugs smoking , i think best part album when he went his musical diatribe : explain it me . heavy metal bands trial because kids commit suicide ? what ? judas priest trial because " my kid bought record , listened lyrics ..... " well that great ! sets legal precedent . mean i sue dan folgerberg making me into ( expletive deleted ) mid-70 . possible , huh ? huh ?!

balancing motherhood her career tough but she mange pull it off this album . i think she great job her part but her promoters slacking there . if she ever chooses album she should consider hiring new crew . i always loved toni music this album reminds me why . i bit disappointed `more than woman ' but `libra ' puts her back where she belongs . lead off single " please " fantastic . it sets album off good way delivers her back into game rather nicely . second single " trippin ( thats way love works ) " also strong . next song " whats good " smooth enjoyable . song " take this ring " it very evident amerie producer wrote this song but holds out very well adds diversity this album . songs " midnite " " i wanna ( your baby ) " really good because it showcases her signature voice beautifully .

eagle glenn frey first solo album came out may , 1982 , it dated little bit , like almost all mainstream rock records 80s . but much " no fun aloud " holds up very well , frey jack tempchin songwriting partnership produced handful really good pop-rock song distinct soul flavour . album produced no fewer than five singles , soaring soul ballad " one you love " peaking #15 billboard 200 ( #2 adult contemporary listings ) . " partytown " got #5 mainsteam rock list , it pretty good little rocker ... it always sounded better live , though . opener " i found somebody " highlight , great mid-tempo soul-rock tune al garth sax . frey goes further into soul territory gentle " i volunteer " swaggering " i've born again " , lays down pretty good rendition huey ' piano ' smith " sea cruise " . latter half album not quite consistent first . synthetic " don't give up " dated really badly , " all those lies " just not particularly memorable . ballad " girl " , co-written fellow detroit native bob seger , perhaps bit too sweet some , but spanish-sounding " she can't let go " real gem . frey plays some lovely acoustic guitar bass parts , his voice perfect instrument this type song . glenn frey liner notes clever very much worthwhile , way , his impeccable vocals knack crafting laid-back love songs take this album long way . 3 1/2 stars . enjoyable forty minutes	1

browsing through cds local store other day , i came upon " way vaselines : complete anthology " ( 1992 ) . name familiar , if not music . i heard vaselines , like lot people , because course nirvana covered few their songs " incesticide " ( 1992 ) " mtv unplugged " ( 1994 ) albums . because ( 1 ) kurt cobain loved band mentioned them numerous times various interviews , ( 2 ) vaselines something indie-pop/rock icons , i decided check their album out . i instantly captivated just one listen " way vaselines : complete anthology . " it truly great cd underappreciated band both instantly addictive remains enjoyable intriguing repeated listens . clocking slightly less than hour , there surprising amount diversity found this single disc which encompasses band entire body work . while vaselines sometimes pigeonholed " indie-pop , " their songs range punk 60s-esque acoustic/folk , " indie-pop . " times it sounds though band strong donovan influence , but then album take 180 degree turn show its punk teeth . there even little new-wave thrown mix off-beat " you think you're man . " contrasting male/female vocal interplay singers/founders eugene kelly frances mckee works very nicely not unlike style , b-52s , more recently lacuna coil . listening this cd , it easy see where kurt cobain , mudhoney , iron wine , no doubt others found inspiration . while vaselines lasted only few years ( 1986-1990 ) produced very small body work , their talent influence shouldn't devalued .	1
if i give " where they now " award , group home would probably receive it . group home debut cd " livin ' proof " rememerable cd back late 1995 . i first heard these guys gang starr " hard earn " lp . what grabbed my attention get this lp everybody said this some dj premier best production . heck , it blessing couple tracks produced primer , let alone entire album . i say this best production i heard comming east coast good minute . if you heard beats " serious rap sh ... " " up against wall " ( thats just some songs here awesome production ) . it seemed like premo just held back his production gang starr jeru , gave them group home . lot people wondered if he gave those same beats artists like nas or jeru damaja what would results would . hell , if he gave beats wackest rapper out right now , it would almost sound like second comming illmatic or such . they're good . group home ( melachi nutcracker lil ' dap ) , they don't bad job holding down rhymes . fact only inferior this album . i've heard better rhymes , but i've also heard way worse . especially all music comming out today , they make this duo sound like lyrical masters . " suspended time " would good song lyrical standpoint . excellent song " 2 thousand " ( hence my review title ) some good rhymes . guru big shug comes song " serious rap sh .. " , well jack ripper smiley ghetto child rhyme song " realness " . jeru damaja talks end one tracks well . so this album excellent fans gang starr primo production . this album some best beats he made his career . although lil ' dap melachi rhyme skills aren't great , they don't make this cd waste . if possible , search instrumentals this lp , because you'll glad you . but this album also keeper . they followed up album 1999 , i check out well . lyrics : c+production : a+guest appearances : a-musical vibes : a-overall : b+favorite tracks : livin ' proof , serious rap sh .., suspended time , sacrifice , up against wall ( both mixes ) , 2 thousand , supa star , realnesspeace everyone !!	1
so many ways , this album oasis destined make . they cocky , over-the-top , excessive group before , but " here now " they really cranked up noise bravado . just look length songs . " my big mouth " ( my personal favorite track ) seems like simple ditty compared colossal songs make up remainder album . " all around world " clocks modest 9 minutes , then reprises end disc . " d'ya know what i mean " begins album bombastic roar never really relents . yet , this exactly road oasis headed very beginning . they always biggest , best point excess . this album culmination lifestyle they enjoying up til ' 97 . that exactly what makes this album so great . it carefree yet bombastic . it fun but overwhelming . it both frustrating engaging . there no other oasis album like it , better or worse . all criticisms mean nothing when you hear song wonderful " stand me " or " magic pie . " oasis nothing if not entertaining ( something can't said their most recent efforts ) . " here now " both celebration funeral britpop . give it chance . i'm sure you'll like it	1

said , it certainly its charms , especially highly technically accomplished standpoint : no one , i think , able gainsay level pure musical brilliance achieved brad his original trio mates , larry grenadier ( bass ) jorge rossy ( drums ) , regularly made manifest this , many ways , remarkable disc . unfortunately , despite its mastery arcane mysteries high-level improvisational music-making , there seems something lacking . soulfulness , perhaps ? yes , music , all its technical brilliance , seems little bloodless , sort like , maybe , brad mfa dissertation summarizing history jazz . this strikes me one those discs our most gifted jazz musicians occasionally get out their systems--it certainly very challenging music probably loads fun play , but it leaves even informed listener scratching his head disconcertedly , hoped more friendly music handed musical snake -- albeit , strikingly beautiful -- when what he wished , simply , bread . certainly worth acquiring , but more admirably than listenable . piano trio jazz absolutely not disappoint , check out frank kimbrough latest , play	1

smooth , sultry sharp three " s " describe mr. alexander o'neal . way before keith sweat , brian mcknight . kelly , alexander o'neal romantic crooner his time . smooth , though forceful approach , mr. o'neal voice make me drop everything take notice , his voice captivating . help musical geniuses ( two sickingly great men who turn anything into hit ) jimmy jam terry lewis , alexander o'neal crafted this musical masterpiece back 1986 . " hearsay " journey it self , slick funk grooves heart sleeve balladry , album follows alex through joys pain love . start " hearsay " party sounds voices , much likings marvin gaye tunes . it starts off album " this album going blow your mind " type vibe . it builds you into what come next . something " what i ( make you love me ) " . three words : funky , funky , funky ! " lovers " ultimate expressway crusing song . i pledged myself when i get my first car , i'm going pop this when i graze my city skyline . thundering keyboards , forceful syncopated vocals tight drum beats make you feel love , real . soulful empowering title track , alex shows his impressive vocal range . biggest hit off here , " fake " snarky , snappy down right funky tune girl who well ... fake ! hilarious lyrics jamming keyboards make you understand why this song such huge hit . next hit , " critize " features some funny dialouge beautiful backing vocals lisa keith . i like how alex her trade off vocals , nicely . this song pulsating piece pre-new jack heaven . my girl , cherrelle ( i love this woman , when i listen her i wonder how hell she not become bigger success ! ) shows up " never knew love like this " . i always enjoy when alex cherrelle duet cause they always sound so passionate . soulful gospel-esqe tune awaits your ears ! " sunshine " nothing but gorgeous it beautiful yet dark ballad . it mesmerizes you start alex really belting it out . " crying overtime " sounds like precursor some stuff boyz ii men would later 90 , it really sounds like " bended knee " ( which jam lewis wrote ) . it lush , heart sleeve tune once again alex it justice his voice . " when party over " cool sultry perfect way end this fantastic album . it truly shame this album mostly negelected much alexander himself . i just don't understand how alexander cherrelle shut out music business ! jimmy jam terry lewis their best work them i understand there such thing " janet jackson factor " . i'm fan janet too , but since i've dug deeper jam lewis catalog un-earthed cherrelle alex , i've come believe only reason why janet became such star because well ... michael little sister . not her music wasn't good ( her music good , no doubt-she talent ) but if you pair her stuff cherrelle alexander it pales comparison . i usually tend push " control " aside make way " hearsay " cherrelle " affair " . i'm truthful . after " hearsay " , alexander never achieved much star power even though he guest star cherrelle 1988 masterpiece " affair " . i never understand why ? maybe he overshadowed luther vandross , who really began become huge his hit " here now " ? or maybe people moving into more hip-hop state mind this time ? i no idea why alexander o'neal became music casuality . i know he still performs released some albums after this but he now resides england performs mostly there . how i wish he would come back show some these young rb crooners how really sing ! get " hearsay " hear singer get caught up funky jamming sounds jam lewis , especially since it digitally remastered all it glory . you not dissapointed!jen top 51 . critizie2 . lovers3 . fake4 . sunshine5 . never knew love like thi	1

kapke74 10/03 review here hit it head : syl " there riot goin ' " indeed relaxing , hypnotic , totally narcotic quality it . heavy bass , slowed down drugged out jams ... tempos melodies ... it like drugs without taking them yourself . musical freestylin ' indulgence ... just jammin ' man ... note sound . import version indeed very good sound quality it . it may not " 20-bit superaudio remaster , " but one might attribute it something much simpler : perhaps it just better master tape . my cd copy made germany we all knew uk/euro/japan versions vinyl pressings always clearly superior us version , so why not cd product ? but back review ... hits here course " family affair , " " ( you caught me ) smilin '" " runnin ' away " ... pretty autobiographical stuff if you know syl story read ( snort ) lines . sorry i just write . still genius prevails . sly family stone first foray into dark side ' 70s ... post-summer love/end-of-the-'60s hangover thang . dig it	1

i just introduced myself captain buying this album spotlightkid/clear spot . i must say this now one my favorite albums all time ! this probably craziest album you'll ever hear but thats good thing . why ? because it never gets old theres enough zany personality dynamics fill 10 cds . every time i notice something new ! pure original ! captain beefheart rock what arnold shoenburgh " classical " music or what ornette coleman jazz . now one things might make this cd confusing 1st there some very serious tracks some very humurous/tounge cheek tracks all same place . but either way madness name game . all songs belong together its just sometimes beefheart observing madness world ( " dachau blues " ) sometimes hes acting it out ( " old fart play " ) . some tracks fall these 2 extremes ( " hobo chang ba " ) all cases its very cathartic me so i love it	1
i thought 4 cds pet sounds its outtakes would too much . i mean , i agree pet sounds colossal album , triumph all times , but 4 cds ? yes . it worth it . if you're big fan album itself , you'll enjoy hearing it dissected , hearing all different parts how they put together . then ... you listen stereo mix final album ( not released time ) you realize hype warranted . pet sounds good .	1

i am huge type o fan . i seen them over 20 times driven hundreds miles so . my wife i waiting this album subsequent tour years . we tickets see them philly last time but thats when peter his drug incident tour canceled . anyhoo , so i pre order album wait baited breath . when it finally arrives , i am almost instantly disappointed . i played bands throughout years i know when jamming group sometimes you try get something going it just isn't working . usually you stop playing move something else . most these songs fall into this category . unfortunately us , type o went ahead finished , recorded , released them . peter usually well crafted lyrics replaced words 6th grader could written . " she burns me down , down , down ground " . what heck ? one reviewer wrote , there only two songs note . one , september sun , ok . this mainly because its rehash their greatest song " love you death " . this song even suffers same silly lyrics repeated ad nauseum last minute or so song . i don't even remember name other song i somewhat liked , but it doesn't matter anyway . all those reviewers rave this album , whats wrong you ? wait , i bet you all liked metallica st. anger too ... any true type o fan , this album grave disappointment . my wife i we're psyched go see them sonar baltimore , but after this album came out , we'll just watch their " symphony devil " dvd loud volume instead . bottom line , don't bother this .	-1

survivor first new release 17 years sees return jimi jamison vocals , joined original members frankie sulivan ( who also produced)on guitars marc droubay drums . album great melodic rock release . best tracks include rocker " fire makes steel " ( which rumored make appearance new rocky movie ) , moody " gimme word , " power ballad " one more chance . " frankie sullivan sings two songs , catchy " talkin ' bout love , which sounds like rembrandt theme tv show " friends " he also sings terrible " nevertheless , " which track three kills momentum album . biggest criticism album too many ballads , but survivor achieved most their success thanks mid-tempo songs found " reach . " unfortunately , album dead water because jamison again left group citing creative differences sullivan , who recruited robin mcauley new vocalist . so fans waited 17 years get new album , then they don't get chance see band live performing new songs ! buy album , it their last classic release .	1
it ruth brown excellent autobiography quot ; miss rhythmquot ; intrigued me pick this compilation . first it obvious collection singles would eventually wound up sounding bit same - succesful quot ; singlesquot ; formula its bit thin when it streches over 21 songs ( difference carefully selected choice lp which usualy varies tempo ) all this great uptempo songs sounds alike . surprisingly enough , i found myself coming back this cd quitte often now i found interesting variety here - brown first single , melancholy ballad quot ; so longquot ; , exciting quot ; mama , he treats your daughter meanquot ; ( clearly inspiration little richard quot ; lucillequot ;) gospel quot ; i see everybody babyquot ; my favourite track , sexy quot ; i dont knowquot ; ( strange enough she commercial twilight time recording ! ) brown passionate involved all way through . althought i still prefer her later-days albums - older brown excatly bad blues mama her father afraid she would became one day - this very good compilation . guess what , after all my intial reservations , i am actually buying her double-cd rhino anthology quot ; miss rhythm morequot ; which bigger selection better variety tempos ( quot ; sentimental journeyquot ; quot ; ol ' man riverquot ;)	1
i guess it " like ' em " or " hate ' em " westlife . problem i love most euro boybands . their freshman album even 1 or 2 strong tracks but this collection weak . it no hooks ! nothing sticks my head . i guess they're going through motions song writing tossing few poorly produced covers . westlife may forever scarred whipped cream mouth sessions offered auditions day ronan keating . it no wonder why close no one usa heard them . my advice ' team ' before any these songs even got pre-production phase would , lose those industry knee pads you all wear think yourselves	-1

when it comes miles " second great quintet , " much made " miles smiles " " nefertiti " classic albums , but i heard next nothing this one . however , when i bought " e.s.p. " it blew my mind , i picked this one up all other albums this group : wayne shorter saxophone , herbie hancock piano , ron carter bass , tony williams drums . this album may not receive much attention others period , but it deserves just much praise undisputed classics . i think there certain things this album better than " miles smiles " " nefertiti ; " when rhythm section playing straight time , they never sounded more pocket or swung harder than here . then within confines few seconds they break out their perfect groove just explode , again , it more effective here than any other albums . central this aspect music tony williams gives what probably best performance his tenure miles . man monster drummer displays major drum chops but also excellent taste amazing knack shaping what rest band doing . part reason williams contributions their very best material plays his personal strengths . tunes themselves may not best compositions this band discography but they vehicles some killer playing . " stuff " band first obvious foray into what would become fusion ; hancock plays fender rhodes carter plays electric bass ( against his ) , williams pushes band his still unmatched jazz-rock feel . then " paraphernalia " features george benson guitar , but not some kind special guest feature gimmick common music industry today . benson there because his guitar adds texture intriguing groove , times almost sounding like something out " west side story " but explosive release which lifts band individual soloists new heights . williams absolutely brilliant his support energy , it often interesting listen his " background " it listen soloists . williams composition " black comedy " fantastic feature this same role ; he makes drums into voice equal partnership musical ideas . then " country son " features truly inspired playing everyone . file this album under difficult understand appreciate . it took me seven years heavy exposure jazz before i could really appreciate or even like this band . it not good place introduced miles though it rock influenced some tunes it doesn't make good crossover . but if you want get into some fantastic , creative , energetic music , try following this band recorded lineage , starting " e.s.p. " which most accessible band music , it first . once you appreciate creative depth this band explorations , it make this album all more enjoyable amazing	1

tcs ' second album masterpiece . while their first album great , quot;i've seen everythingquot ; shows even stronger songwriting no reliance fancy production techniques . don't get me wrong , production here pristine , sparkling , inventive , but omits hazy washes sound first album . songwriting , every song great , wonderful pop hooks quality lyrics . songs build organically don't always go standard verse-chorus etc . form . if you like great british guitar pop late ' 80s/early ' 90s ( think railway children , house love , etc . ) , you enjoy this album	1
randy newman portrait southern united states represents peak his career culmination four albums . begged beaten into music industry friends colleagues ( one them supposedly john lennon , who called newman say all beatles heard his demos ) , newman fourth album original material provides evidence those friends colleagues provided us great service . " good old boys " stands one newman greatest acheivements , arguably one greatest albums 1970s . rolling stone even proclaimed it 393rd best album all time 2003 ( though it probably deserves put much higher ) . furtive glance album title , accompanying peek song titles ( " rednecks " , " birmingham " , naked man " , " guilty " ) would suggest slam dunk satirical no holds barred slash south . not so . newman approaches subject dignity balance not often bequeathed united states ' southern states . not say " good old boys " eulogizes south ( this no " gone wind " ) . bad ugly also creep : racism , prejudice , drunkedness , poverty , populism , obscenity . newman , himself southerner birth , forayed into this territory before . 1970 " 12 songs " included " old kentucky home " " yellow man " , though former contained more nudge nudge satire than " good old boys " . this album expands themes explored those songs expands it into length entire album . results come out more context than they song-by-song basis . example , " birmingham " " marie " , both amazing songs , take different tone when following " rednecks " . " rollin '" represents sigh denial after long arduous inhale . song feels different isolation than it end song cycle " good old boys " . this entails tightly composed well thought out collection amazing songs . they all stand their own but nonetheless take different life context album . " rednecks " newman most shocking song more reasons than its abrasive lyrics . somehow it manages sympathetic , vindictive , satirical , racist , anti-racist sentiments all once . it puts ' redneck ' stereotype under microscope proclaims issues more complex than they seem . it revels southern stereotypes while pointing finger northward justifiably famous lines northern ' cages ' where blacks kept " free " states . indirectly it says " least we're honest it down here " . it all this without promoting stereotypes or racism . this incomprehensible dichotomy pervades entire album . especially newman portrait huey long " every man king " which leads into " kingfish " . newman takes orchestral lessons arrangements learned his previous albums puts them incredible work here . strings , horns , steel guitar , newman distinctive piano all fall together here perfect balance . completely gone instrumental excesses self-conscious arrangements his first two albums ( i.e. , he overused orchestra his first album abandoned it his second ) . " louisiana 1927 " contains one most beautifully orchestrated choruses all pop music , stands one newman best . amazing strings " kingfish " " rollin '" also deserve mention , though all songs notable . 2cd set includes demo " good old boys " called " johnny cutler birthday " . this reveals album origins concept album revolving around one person . this focus proved too narrow subject matter , least six songs demo not make final album . one them revolves around extreme profanity . others fill story line ( narrated newman his solo piano voice takes ) . all top notch newman leave listeners wondering what else lurks newman vault . " good old boys " stands one one newman most impressive achievements . every randy newman fan needs this cd set . both original album demo remain firm solid concrete hard ground some thirty years later	1
i'm coming out closet finally putting myself record saying this paul simon best album solo artist . i also agree other reviewers -- this one fifty best albums twentieth century . although graceland landmark record , there many " outside " issues record . troubles cultural snobbery exploitation ( particularly los lobos ) , unsituated appropriation " third world " musics musicalisms , just plain screwed up " liberal " new york elitism . some still here this album -- even caetano veloso took some pot shots paul simon , carlinhos brown . but great art judged time much anything else , i believe this fascinating moving record , whose subtle shifting rhythms , melodies , harmonies , chords represent perhaps best admixture brazilian , african , american sensibilities history pop music ( jazz music here , course , excepted ; music beyond this discussion entirely separate category ) . single biggest thing sticks out me this album percussion work . you get broad deep emotional working out variety african-matrixed south american percussion styles , perhaps biggest musical achievement simon here his sly sophisticated incorporation stunning variety polyrythms into his already legendary folk folksy pop music . this music times simply gorgeous -- it flows like river , occasion it flows thick lovingly like hot lava . this grown-up , laid back , ( best american/brazilian collaborative tradition ) , intelligent , lovely , wise music . highly recommended .	1
this cd my introduction donnie mcclurkin sometime ago remains my favorite . it passionate inspiring . donnie voice angel words these songs minister spirit .	1
i am thoroughly satisfied this cd -- it everything i both wanted expected . its premise simple : get all theme songs james bond films one disc . this quote-unquote official release , so it neglects " never say never again , " unofficial odd-jobs associated 007 . although it released 2002 , some reason it lacks razzie-winning " die day , " which released year . since it released 2002 , don't expect find " you know my name " " casino royale . " this collection definitely gets five stars including " we all time world . " since this lazenby solo , we seldom hear it ; yet it one best songs come out franchise . like i said , this cd everything i expected , down liner notes . i only two criticisms . first , songs not chronological , so we miss evolution early brassy rat pack themes toned-down anthems epitomized " your eyes only " then techno/hip-hop lite later films . arraigned way they , you get better overall presentation . either way you arrange tracks , you always shuffle . second more criticism franchise opposed cd ( i mentioned how well i liked product ? ) . included two remixes james bond dr. no theme -- moby parodi/fair . now remix definition just same music underlaying drum machine , it solely played dance clubs those annoying subwoofers wheels -- nothing more . i think this keep up gala spirit film , also revamp franchise younger audiences problem there nothing wrong franchise -- six year hiatus due legal quagmire geopolitical shake up associated end cold war . so doing remixes like these really not contribute bond experience . personally , i thought they both condescending obvious . ( then again , where else would you put them ? )so other than these two critiques , i happily recommend this disc bond fan , pleasant memories this music bring	1
man , she get anymore stupid talentless . she needs spend some undeserved bling bling some singing lessons than her skimpy outfits . all songs this album totally unlistenable ! she completely lacks power , vocal range versatility . jennifer lopez represents everything wrong music today . she gets recording contract because her good looks success her acting career . just because your great actor/actress doesn't necessarily mean you sing , too . some actors/actresses able achieve it , but not jennifer lopez . she needs quit music business while she still . please stick acting ... oh , wait ! i forgot , she can't either !	-1
it people letting their personal beliefs block receptors brain signal bad music ? ive listened many bob dylan albums , every one gem . freewheelin ' my favorite , but so what ? it doesn't matter which ones we love , because we all know what bob dylan worst record , its saved . im not one question this man beliefs or anything like , bob dylan deserves all respect universe , but could it bob dylan made transfer christian music help us all see how bad it ? could he made transfer make mockery christian faith ? almost certainly not . but only seriously bad album could planted these seeds my brain	-1

live alive good enough buy my standered ..... i really think this recorded poorly but songs it really good if you play it your car , or bigger speakers so you really hear everything much better . their many good songs included this complination live performence spanning performences montreux jazz festival , austin opera house , dallas starfest . this recordings all 85-through 86 . jimmie vaughan appears willie wimp , love struck baby , look little sister , change it playing guitar , string bass . i think worst song entire complination voodoo chile(slight return ) which kind weird me say because i think truely best song stevie ray played live but this case its not . other than i really think what it it average live performence .	-1

i wonder why robin felt need release this album . it collection bee gees songs but barry not consulted album or selections songs . robin need money he continues throw same songs out fans ? how many copies these hits we really need own ? i don't understand why some songs would even considered ' love ' songs why solo releases if it called bee gees album ? i thought cover strange it didn't contain picture bee gees , maybe because robin failed yet again consult his brother , but wants fans believe it joint effort . sorry robin , but fans know it wasn't . if barry involved , he would mentioned it his web site plus offered album fans buy . lack show barry site shows fans once again you tried mislead people just fatten your wallet . i hope all bee gees fans robin gets over his anger his big brother realizes he just isn't capable doing it his own . this album , why waste your money ! get out blank cd make your own album , i guarantee you come up better song selection look all money you saved .	-1

gershwin lived short life but pieces he made marvelous . his fusion jazz big band creates unique sound very pleasing . listening rhapsody blue , or american paris always gives feeling big bustling american city its prime , full rich color glamour . uneven , busy syncopated rythyms brass percussion add sense workaholic society america during its time . it old timely sound it all makes gershwin so songs irresistable ear . cuban overture sounds equally robust majestic , complete native cuban percussion , quot ; porgy bessquot ; suite , while operatic huge proportion , doesn't stray far its jazz roots . chicago symphony played music gusto vigor , james levine thoughtfully interpreted each piece utmost care way gershwin intended it . i highly recommend this piece anyone fine taste big band , all-american sound . all music i've heard , gershwin music sounds most american them all	1

i've always rejected term " fan " it derived creepy word fanatic so what you call someone who entire perception music changed one band one album never same , crazy ? then commit me . cheap trick debute album flew face everything wrong rock music late seventies ( frequently still ) , pompous , arrogant overblown . one fell swoop boys rockford changed all rules like sherman sea set scorched earth policy would make general proud . what said robin zanders vocals this disc , ballad tv violence he caged banshee relentlessly tearing our ear drums making us beg mercy more , while mandocello he takes us some dark melodic place shows us how feel his pain . rick nielsen master strokes song craft bone jarring riffs gave all us junior high geeks reason beleive maybe , if we ate our vegetables said our prayers , we could grow up guitar hero just like rick . ah , bun ., coolest cat behind drum kit uncanny knack impersonating sound jack hammer concrete , nuff said ! oh sweet growning moaning tom petersson twelve string bass , while rest world trouble only four strings , tom single-handedly informed wanna bass players everywhere maybe it time put damn thing away get real job . cheap trick everything right sex pistols , e.l.o. , sweet move same time made it painfully clear what they lacked , it made us realize what we missing everything else we listened . it greatest non-live , live performance ever captured tape . tunes irreverent , mind numbing , singable , screamable perfect start finish . dare yourself not sing he whore or oh , candy it just resolution you can't keep . if nasa mind shoot one cd into space representation everything right good american music this would one , who could resist higher intelligence belting out hot love ?! truth out there it cheap trick . over twenty years cheap trick reminded us it time get over ourselves little this , there very first album , they've shown us throwing caution wind little scary sometimes but it always one hell ride	1
where this one fits : slow wonder follows new pornographers ' mass romantic electric version , but precedes twin cinema . it transition frenetic power-pop first two np albums deeper , more timeless quality their latest . without burden np " sound " live up , newman stretches , writes ballads pink floyd-y space out songs ( though always concise ) , if anything gets more pet sounds-like his musical arrangements ( gorgeous trumpet " come crash , " driving , rhythmic cello " town halo " ) . newman , quite obviously , very prolific his batting average stunningly high . it okay me if he mixes solo albums his np output , using them places experiment new kinds songs he thinks maybe his np fans won't cotton . but this album full hits , just melodic just many " how he ? " high-wire assemblages melody , rhythm arrangement np delivers . if you like new pornographers , you'll joyous hearing " table , " " mystery drug , " " secretarial " my favorite " town halo . " a.c. newman rapidly becoming most valuable pop artist planet , keeper great tradition pop/rock songwriters nearly died out .	1

although new cast recording faith prince helped me understand show much better ( its surprising how song i listened this original album suddenly seen much clearer light ) . this all mostly because new recording includes dialogue leading into it ( underscoring ) . i would disagree anyone however , who said judy holliday mostly remembered her acting comedy she brings this role not her singing . her singing beautiful her emotions thorougly felt . quot ; party overquot ; amazing deserves far more credit one best score . quot;i'm going backquot ; also terrificly , her voice varies incredibly just one song . quot ; long before i knew youquot ; quot ; just timequot ; also terrific whoever it plays jeff not lack all his vocals . he sings songs so smoothly ... they just flow right him . there also great ensemble numbers quot;it simple little systemquot ; , quot ;d rop namequot ; quot ; midas touchquot ; sooo cute . i'd say if you buy this cd love it ... or already know you loves this cd ... buy new broadway recording faith prince new understanding it . although i dislike how prince sings quot ; party overquot ; ( song you go full out vocals .. she speak-sang much it ) . but course , many tracks new recording wonderful ( its lucky many original arrangements kept ) song quot ; better than dreamquot ; should listened .. i just love it i dont recall it original . anyways ... i defiently reccomend this musical listen singers out there who looking new material quot ; party overquot ; wonderful song perform	1

i must say when i first heard " kick push " i thought myself this guy really something talk because he such metaphoric rhymer his delivery very strong so i know i buy lupe fiasco debut album " food liquor " . after listening this album beginning end i not all disappointed but indeed this album really let me know there still few rappers out there still kicking rhymes issues we deal everyday life instead hearing these other mc dont rap anything except cars , clothes , jewelry , women . i would recommend this album anyone fan real rap because this album open your eyes alot things life . my 5 favorite tracks : 1 . " cool " - this song basically young man who died(not literally ) but he able come back life try make change better but same time he chose live his life same way he lived it once before . song very metaphor deep . 2 . " he say she say " - this song little boy who doesnt visible father it affecting him deeply . 3 . " hurt me soul " - this song talks just any issue you think women degraded rap music , drug dealing , crooked cops , government not offering black people welfare overcharging healthcare , johns prostitutes . song also very nice hook . 4 . " sunshine " - this song this girl he falls love club eventhough he not looking love he cannot resist it this girl . 5 . " pressure " featuring jay-z- very nice concept it lupe standpoint eventhough im not big jay-z fan he still put down nice verse . other songs i like " just might ok " , " daydreaminin " , " kick push " , " i gotcha " , " instrumental " , " american terrorists " . i would recommend this album anyone who true fan real rap because it not disappoint you all !!!!	1

one things makes movie `marie antoinette ' so great brilliant soundtrack put together sophia coppola who i swear modern day genius . this two-disc album offers some great music just sit back enjoy , starting siouxsie banshees track `hong kong garden ' ending cure brilliant `all cat grey ' . disc one standout track whole reason i purchased this album strokes `what ever happened ' which plays one most pivotal scenes film , course track runs throughout majority trailers promoting this brilliant film . other choice tracks include both tracks radio dept ., especially `pulling our weight ' course `i want candy ' . i love new order track `ceremony ' `concerto ' . second disc full some most peaceful recordings placed together one album , aphex twin `jynweythek ylow ' `avril 14th ' standing out favorites their haunting atmosphere . dustin o'halloran `opus 17 ' just plain stunning his `opus 36 ' well . much different feel than first disc , this second album serves such delightful treat , both albums meshing perfectly together deliver one kind musical experience . worth every penny	1

i abide amazons guidelines not criticize particular reviewer . " sinner " very few weak spots i also like contrast rockers slower songs . i especially liked re-make " 100 ft . away " . i seen joanie touring behind every album , even her first , andregardless crowd/club , she holds nothing back . high spots include " . . . " , riddles , watersign , baby blue , everyone knows , bad time . blazing guitars , signature growling vocals , ( soft/caring when necessary) -- all jett constants . i could go but there really not bummer album . if you waiting 1st-class jett album , wait no longer . wait over . frosty prim/veteran live music goe	1
i'm going critical here because all people review tend fans album their reviewing . i've got all roots albums say this middle road . i would say it first album modern roots phase where their style differs creating modern but same time retro feel bottles bells sampling . " dynamite " , " ain't sayin ' nothin new " , " love my life " " you got me " all chilled great songs but don't flow like tracks such " episodes " or " proceed " previous albums . if you like cutting edge 1999 hip hop then you love this . if you don't then you'll still like it if you open your eyes it	-1
" beatles sale " sounds very much like transitional work . though uneven terms structure ( least half tracks cover versions ) , introspective nature " i'm loser , " " no reply " " i'll follow sun " pave way greater glories . overall record would stronger if group deleted " mr. moonlight " " what you're doing " -- two obvious throwaways . still , flawed beatles album better than none	-1
i love this cd ! music wonderful reminds me particular parts movie . great movie , great soundtrack	1
how dooes one cope music so life-affirming , yet twisted fact bradley never lived see it released ? or his band literally own world shadows next year , far less talented musicians aping sublime sound commercial acclaim ? question i've wrestled nigh ten years now . sure darkness creeps " same end " " burritos " , nihilism " april 29 1992 " . light brad radiated his soul outshines every last bit it . " pawn shop " painful reminder all-too-real cost heroin addiction . can't help but wonder where they might gone next , each succesive album evolution one before . speculation pointless . legend sublime grows year year , reputation this , their final album . need pick me up bush administration depression ? listen " caress me down " harken back better days . it it all so simple	-1
i picked up this one " waiting sirens call " same time ( fingerprints " high fidelity " , long beach ) . both albums great , but krafty bending my ear toward newer release . i must drug induced haze or possibly mesmerized some chick time this record came out , because i still republic infinite repeat my cd player time i picked this up , which 06 . but wait , i don't cd player - yes , reality i republic alac format all my ipods . big personal bonus me discovering my great grandfather lived manchester , which , course , nothing way record sounds , but it my 15min so what you care . great record . thank goodness it wasn't 8 years releases again	1
after listening quot ; subversive sounds lovequot ; i realized i should've bought stock frisbie instead horrible internet company folded last month . this band combination intelligent , inspiring , soulful lyrics outstanding musicianship truly classic harmonies . no need compare frisbie beatles , eagles , styx , byrds , or america - they're class all themselves	1
first off , ignore everyone says aly aj just spawn off disney entertainment congolmerate . though one sisters , aly , started her mainstream career disney channel tv show " phil future " then created this album her sister amanda , you should know these girls involved world music since very young age . unlike some disney spawns who just randomly decide " hey , i think i want sing " , aly aj their time coming . they writing songs since very young age . fact , all but 3 songs album written or co-written them . you should probably know i am 21 years old , way outside target demographic , but changing . i first exposed their music when my sister dragged me disneyland last august see them perform live . like most , i pre-conceived image my head disney girls gone singers . boy i wrong . first i ever heard them " rush " live , followed some more songs off album . i so impressed i bought original copy cd almost instantly . i myself seen them perform live 6 times well met them , i honestly say they real . live performances no pre-recorded or lipsynched elements it . they real stage . guitars played , songs sung , it sounds beautiful . it shame recent times , many idols their target teenage girl fallen victim presentation rather than talent . i say , more talent you , better presentation given anyways . note : even if you original copy " into rush " , i highly recommend buying upgrade . i already owned original , well japanese import i didn't hesitate one moment buy deluxe edition . if anything song " chemicals react " worth it . when song first debuted , it totally blew me away . other new song " shine " also one their amazing surprises . though not my favorite ( but far my least favorite ) song , i felt like this song sort like dipping their feet into pool before diving . way gauge response somewhat different style see if they want keep steering direction . i say go i t.t he remixes " something more " " collapsed " also give new feel album . " something more " feels more hard than its original counterpart . more agressive chords , lively beats used chorus well throughout song . pretty good margin , i admit " collapsed " improved quite bit . i already huge fan song before , but this remixed version gives new meaning song . it starts out roughly same , but soon after pseudo 80 style band backs up vocals instead more hardcore sound original . i love diversity song well unorthodox-ness whole layout song . if you too lazy read whole review just read this . buy albu	1
enjoying my purchase lot ; takes me " back day . " arrived timely , good repair . would order you again	1
i like these songs . 1993 these versions songs eagles released benefit preservation land around walden pond . country singers usually good picking up enough way song should it right . almost all these songs so familiar most audiences would know if rendition started fall apart , but all these performances so polished anyone would thrilled hear them . i only know greatest hits songs eagles concert , but final song , quot ; sad cafequot ; only selection this cd i not heard often enough know how it really goes , all songs sound right . i'm inclined pay more attention female vocalists than other kind , i'm glad some ladies got longer songs this cd , `take it limit , ' ( 4:32 ) `new kid town , ' ( 5:07 ) `already gone , ' ( 5:00 ) `the sad cafe ' ( 4:45 ) . four songs guys sing less than 3 or 4 minutes , but longest song `lyin ' eyes ' ( 6:30 ) diamond rio looks like bunch guys picture : lead vocals : marty roe , gene johnson dana williams background vocals . there some great lines eagles ' songs i like , when i could not remember final verse one those songs , today , this cd obvious pick listen because these singers not afraid clearer than originals . my mind digresses too much when listening songs everyone heard millions times , especially time song gets guitar solo , singer giving some country character these songs makes words stand out more than ever . if you ever appreciated songs eagles but got tired listening original versions , this cd give you 13 great songs all variety mainstream country music fans expect	1

many us " boomers " jackson browne one voices we hear our sleep , part sound track runs behind our lives , especially while we try figure out how we got where we which sometimes long way idealism we espoused those early formative days . solo acoustic , me , brings all home . here mature-voiced icon singing banner songs . here clean , crisp guitar work incredibly lean lush piano , distinctive its theatricality . like mark knopfler signature sound , when jackson starts playing , we know who it . multiple tunings , guitars voiced one song only , different sizes shapes , carefully chosen fit words melody , this more than craftsman-like , this song-writing performance taken new level , which i am grateful . some reviewers noted , only problem here there only 12 songs we hope vol . 2 way . also , some introductions less than helpful several aren't all interesting . only couple give some insight song follows . vol . 2 , take out commentary leave it studio ( unless it help us understand music ) give us instead two or three more songs	-1
i divide albums into three categories : 1 ) decent tunes , 2 ) songs listen while washing dishes 3 ) pure junk . mclachlan no " pure junk " here except maybe " ice cream " or whatever it called . but decent tunes category there only couple cuts which , example , you might want turn friends onto : " mary " " possession " . " good enough " " fumbling towards ecstacy " pass . these only songs hooks . rest songs nothing unless you just want hear pretty voice . i love her voice like wash dishes while listening it hooks or not . if you're obsessed sarah mclachlan then you would probably give five stars recording her singing ingredients label package cookies so read reviews fans who not obsessed	-1
don't get me wrong , i love brian stokes mitchell . his deep voice intoxicating beautiful , which why this cd such dissapointment . all his songs high not show off his wonderful low voice . mitchell should stick what he best it not covers songs made tenors . i hope his next album more fit his voice , i'll first line	-1

this cd incredible ride back memory lane ! listening this reminds me sitting math class , cyphers lunch just really loving hiphop , far cry way i feel it now . most other reviews summed up nicely how important this anthology culture tribe incredible influence mcs . you can't help but hear phife when you hear talib kweli just one example . but there one other thing no one touched . see much this cd reminds me high school , i still playing low end theory 3 years later college when diamond psychotic neurotics dropped ' stunts , blunts , hip hop ' classic . i still playing it because it hot just timeless . how many cds you say these so-called ' hiphop ' artists , you play something 3 years later it still feels good ? that what makes it real music , its timeless 10+ years later this entire anthology could keep real hiphop purist party jump all night , just keep it repeat .	1
robben ford " supernatural " now 5 years old certainly aging well . my favorite track bluesy " nothing nobody .

i must say i not like victory records . all . publicity they give their bands disgusting , lines like " pantera gone , metallica old " similar selling points bands just don't deliver ( see sinai beach , atreyu , etc ) . then , these bands forgotten label finds bands they think better than others continue this lame publicity stunt . mind you , victory records few acceptable bands , such euro-influenced darkest hour , goth stylings aiden , band i'm reviewing here , incredibly thrashy buried me . it my heart good see band actual talent make it big label respected ( misled youth , perhaps ) big victory records . when all others fail any staying power , btbam contains winning formula keeps you listening start finish . although , even greatest bands its flaws , all covered this review . let break it all down . lead vocalist/keyboardist tommy rogers quite versatile voice , able comfortably switch deep , guttural growling powerful screams soft , melodic singing , all while keeping soothing ambience his keyboard ( least during soft parts ) . his voice perfectly attuned music keeps purpose music his angry/loving/pseudo-poetical lyrics . lead guitarist paul waggoner above-average guitarist metalcore band this type , compelling , highly technical solos here there some heavy riffing fellow guitarist shane brown . together they put together some thrashy , dense riffs . while bass lines kevin falk aren't very audible amongst monstrous noise rest band , he few brief moments glory show he decent bassist . lastly drummer terry jason roe , who impressive skill pushing out some driving double-bass riffs without compromising his drum style , which impeccable . one few flaws this album repetition ; first three songs blend together into one long song , three songs middle break up monotony some soft acoustic numbers which seem rather long , then heaviness continues like it various interludes . while it sounds rather unfulfilling first listen , album grows you when you learn appreciate what it offer . bottom line : definitely better than most what victory records puts out market , strangely enough one least publicized their roster . if you're fan mathcore or metal general , you'll probably find something this album you like . this album brings shining ray hope hopeless genre . track selections : " lost perfection : coulrophobia " , " mordecai , " " ad dglgmut " 8/1	-1
like many other people my age , i slowly steadily replacing my old cd , originally issued back late 80 early 90 , newly " remastered " versions . i am audiophile , so good sound very important . most remasters bargain ! you get updated sound , new liner notes , unreleased photos , bonus tracks , etc . this 30th anniversary edition steve miller fly like eagle one best ! you get exactly what anyone would expect " special editon " remaster . updated sound quality , bonus tracks ( 3 ) , bonus dvd nice interview steve miller making of/recording fly like eagle ( 30 minutes ) modern performance steve his current bandmates recorded last year ( 2005 ) that over 2 hours long ! don't let other very picky reviewer sway you so called " poor quality " dvd . it not horrible ! what these people failed realize dvd not planned , it just happened , when steve miller himself saw it , he thought it captured " magic " one their better shows . so it decided it would released . dvd simply recording projection screen images used during their concert . i very happy see this classic album finally given updated , newly remastered treatment . it one best special edition packages i bought . let just hope book dreams gets same level attention their next release . would great	1
good " let me go " starts off beautiful string introduction abruptly switches in-your-face vocal . wetton still melodic touch , while downes carries him his pulsating key strokes . their harmonics spot-on . you tend think this song getting out bad relationship , but two commented it getting out record contract . " god walks us " inspirational ballad faith . wetton flexes his powerful pipes confidence conviction . added pan flute piano only enhance track . it sure jerk emotion or two out you . wetton downes keep spirituality theme going " i stand alone " . welcoming church organ section gives way driving aor rocker . " hey josephine " little bit everything driving it ; clean acoustics , piercing electric licks , pulsing keyboards . if you listen words carefully , it bring smile your face when you figure out what it . serine ballad " end " duet john wetton annie haslan . they sing their enduring love devotion . badnothingthe verdictyou know feeling when you reunite old friend after years apart ? you know you can't quite describe it , but you know it feels right . that icon	1
if you play this cd reverse it says " jesus satan . " comets fire dense . blue cathedral punishing wall noise . listening it i felt like one those explorers black white tarzan movies equipped machete inching through foliage . however , once you carved out your own path album rewarded you tenfold . comets unapologetically classic rock , but instead just breaking out old hendrix painting numbers they added some proto-punk echoplex . some thought blue cathedral more attitude than it songwriting , them avatar perfect rebuttal . here faces riffs robert plant vocals slowed down further reveal songs point where someone who hated blue cathedral might actually like avatar . don't worry , there still use echoplex , songs drawn six eight minutes length ( one exception ) , but comets traded some their feral energy more dynamic sound . benefiting most new dynamics bad acid sounding " lucifer memory , " song sounds like flower wilting . there certain cadence plugs chugging vocals pushing song towards its seven minute mark . it quickly become my favorite new song this year . while there still some rockers , such opener " dogwood rust " which sounds if its beginning should found somewhere before you pressed play , just closer sounds if it ends before song stopped , even these rockers sound less brutal than their predecessors . only " holy teeth " same long-haired head banging attitude blue cathedral , it only lasts three minutes ( only minute comets fire time ) . almost nine-minutes " soup smoke " pushes limits pseudo-tribal beats . instead punishing noise comets pounding repetition into our heads . just thirteen more seconds i think i would spiritual vision . only six minutes long closer " hatched upon age " proves it takes more than just length epic more than just noise crescendo . miracle album through all interplay instruments sometimes it just couple simple repetitive piano keys bring it all home . avatar easily one best releases ' 06 . very few bands bring me back feeling i got discovering classic rock bands middle school . but don't break out your eight tracks dust off old bong yet . unlike most bands , retro only half story comets fire . comets fire ultimately timeless . try i might , i cannot lump them all other seventies rockers , but their sound hardly seems contemporary . it if they've found some time wormhole so they rock across ages . i'm there , man , i'm there	1

i caught act tour intrigued . i'll confess my favorite costello long " get happy " so this right down my alley . nevertheless , i'm so impressed toussaint compositions arrangements i need catch up his previous records . this funky very hooky record , well executed costello imposters . costello amazing artist who seemingly try literally anything . he wonderful thing here , bringing toussaint some well-deserved notoriety , scoring couple moral political points title track " broken promise land . " while neither those songs sublime best toussaint songs this record , they tie it back katrina disaster which brought artists back together . my early favorite costello composition this " ascension day " cowritten toussaint featuring just voice piano .	1
some may consider my review heavily biased , since i've huge jada fan since lox days , but i believe this album deserves more shine than its gotten . my opinion huge improvement over first album , cuts like " why " " air it out " really shows jada improvement his lyrical content . like first album , its still very much streets , but same time it now crossover commercial appeal well , without too corny like many other artists nowadays . even more , some cuts actually address viable social issues unlike 90% gangsta rap nowadays . jada his finest	1

i greatly admire pinnock style , directing skill harpsichord playing , but i don't understand variability sound balance achieved his many recordings dg . most recorded henry wood hall same " tonmeister " producers . example his recording bach violin concertos vibrant , full bodied great " presence " , whereas other end spectrum , last disc symphonies , 40 41 , really anemic , pratically no bass . i gave them +12db bass boost try compensate lack bass , but there hardly any difference low end response . order listen this disc , some extent prior two well , i reverted my volume expander used vinyl records 70 . my system very clean deep bass response handles telarc organ recordings great effect , so i not believe it . , i stated violin concertos great presence , point where i visualize bass cello players bowing their instruments . it may different microphone placement larger ensemble latter symphonies , without compensating different acoustic . when it comes archiv 4d recordings english concert , i not like them all . choir mozart coronation mass sounds like it piped down outer space , detached way ethereal . telemann suites not fare any better , thin anemic . don't think extended dynamic range lower threshold noise level helped any way . i should also add i every recording pinnock english concert , really best " original instruments group " out there . my humble opinion , pinnock should " sir " front his name	-1
i've listening ed harcourt since i recieved " here monsters " promotional disc 4 years ago , bought every album since . ed harcourt one best musical talents new millenium , sadly , yet find any sort recognition us . unlike " strangers " , where he tried his hand few poppier tunes , ed finds himself back where he started embraces his dramatic flair turning out very complete utterly satisfying album . like " here monsters " , ed orchestrates elaborate ballads complete horns strings , maintains his brooding style even his most upbeat songs resulting perhaps his most well rounded mature sounding album yet . he takes his songs all right directions , strays pitfalls predictable songwriting keeping his sound fresh giving album incredible replay value . " beautiful lie " like good novel all its chapters joined unifying theme . each song flows first last leaves you wanting replay album soon it finished . if i pick favorite song( -- seriously -- every song great)i would probably pick one " shadowboxing " / " until tomorrow then " /or " good friends hard find " . every track ed harcourt emotes his lyrics genuine passion binds his words his music together paint images sometimes haunting sometimes whimsical , yet always sincere . this his best work definitely deserves much more attention than its going get	1
this full-length concert recording contains several high points few stretches where program seems sag . disc 1 pleasant stew " new " material old standbys like " china cat sunflower " " truckin ' . " audience mildly rude when it not inert . this disc seems go forever , impatience reaching its apogee during weir rendition " me bobby mcgee . " disc 2 kicks off great pigpen showpiece , rascals ' " good lovin ' , " which becomes unrecognizable when pigpen band start funk it up . then nice long " casey jones " closes first set . second set actually begins disc 3 monster " dark star " everyone raved here . much spacier also busier than live/dead version , it ventures way , way out begins break apart when suddenly we're listening brisk version john phillips ' " me my uncle . " song ends loud resounding chord , inciting 15 or 20 minutes gassy " dark star " stuff . second " dark star " first don't really fuse together very well because second grows out preceding song - it doesn't pick up where first " dark star " left off . then , into " wharf rat " solid " sugar magnolia " close second set . sincere applause cheers audience now ! back disc 2 third set , which seems gratuitous light preceding hour fireworks . pleasant performances " he gone " " el paso , " then disc 3 again solid medley " not fade away " " going down road feeling bad " end show . ( encore , " one more saturday night , " glibly introduced " our latest single " which bob weir asks audience go out purchase . ) all , good reflection grateful dead this juncture their career - serving up generous heap mid-tempo americana-type songs , not skimping hallucinogenic bread butter distinguished dead their peers . this not ideal uninitiated - hundred year hall , same tour , more concisely edited version dead europe ' 72 show , europe ' 72 kind " greatest hits " this tour really can't beat - though it lacks 60-minute " dark star .	-1

cd arrived just otherday i'm glad it . those who like techno music , this ones you . it reminds me days back ' 80 when jan hammer(miami vice fame ) hot item . " 24 " theme song strong rendition what this show all . yet , others listed shows plot renditions , it strong , lively point . you close you eyes combine works pink floyd , tomita , jan hammer , other great synthesiser musicians find out sean callery promising upcoming star . some works short , somewhat sad since they lot promise . but callery brings life sole this fast paced show clear crisp fast moving music . yet he know how work feelings jack bauer when his interludes scenes involving jack wife daughter , real soft moving pieces show softer side our beloved hero . all all its pretty good music just listen get juices flowing . lets get some previous season out also . hope they consider follow-up or let callery some freelancing .	1

surprisingly quiet moving score historical wartime epic , quot ; patriotquot ; begins aching solo violin , segues into fifes drums rich brasses williams so often uses , goes through 17 gently throbbing tracks heavy sense time place invoked . once again you wonder how one man immerse himself so thoroughly so many environments , distant deep-space culture quot ; star warsquot ; this thoroughly earth-grounded tale reluctant warrior , make music simultaneously unique each recognizably his own . this not so much music thrill , reflect -- perhaps good cd turntable you look through your latest book heroes 9/11	1

let set record straight - this album slept 1996 reason . pac , nas , fugees , biggie junior mafia ran 96 . most people i know didnt pick up reasonable till 97 . even source gave this album 4 based fact this joint talked lot materialistic subjects biggie pac already blew up . now onto biggest question plagues jay-z career . would he big if tradgedy not occur 96 97 . maybe , maybe not . all i know when jay first came out he small fish big pond , not really break until 2 biggest fish gone . greatest mc all time - it takes much much more actually start fire than it takes great torch carrier	-1
this my fav metallica cd . after diehard fan many years , i would not thought i would ever like hear metallica music goobered up some grandiose moody blues way . but fact , i love this music , i love hearing it new way .

if you're reading this , you already know who neal . i listening neal close thirty years now , i my favorites , like everyone else . what you gotta realize neal shines brightest when he playing searing melodic solos over top melodic music . i love schon/hammer stuff , really love early journey stuff ( think quot ; spacemanquot ; off quot ; nextquot ; album ) , course santana , but c'mon , guys-his most consistently great melodic playing first bunch journey albums w/steve perry ; up time gregg rolie left band . reason because he playing top some really rich songwriting . i think his playing since those days great , there moments brilliance , but overall , blues stuff solo albums don't imho showcase his best attribute , truly genius sense melody . this release blows me away . songs some these reviewers think cheesy one thing common- they great songs . they sound 1000% better neals soulfully crisp tones icing them down . i think it took lot guts ( jeff beck type guts ) his part release this , i'm glad he . i haven't heard him play this good years	1
i've never understood slagging this album got most but not all quarters . its peaks outstrip anything face dances or new , truly lame endless wire ( pete lost his melodic muse , i'm afraid ) , compares very well who numbers who you ? some songs stand townshend best , including athena , known no war , one life enough , utterly amazing why i fall ?, which simply one best townshend songs who performances . entwistle turns some his best writing band well , it your turn dangerous . yes , there few turkeys ( cook county , one day time , excrable eminence front ) , but great songs make it worthy who album , imo	-1
read only moments ago , lee passing , i instantly thought back first time i heard blistering proto-punk " 7 7 " thingking how cool song , but not realizing just how groundbreaking record . unlike any band before them , especially multi-racial unit , love fused wildly disparate influences ( hard rock , folk , flamenco orchestral pop)to forge something entirely new mid late 60 while they never achieved any major chart success , thier influence still felt heard today . arthur lee also scores major cool points essentially introducing jac holzman music jim morrison doors getting them signed elektra records . while " da capo " widely criticized unjustly maligned only ' half great lp ' , ( 19 minute jam comprises side 2 indulgent but not nearly horrid some claimed ) music here still sounds fresh exciting instantly remind listeners what enormous talent we lost . music world just got little less colorful	-1

i strong sarah mclachlan fan up until she released surfacing . now , i like surfacing , but i felt it inferior her earlier albums . then , she took long break , like so many others , i thought " great ! she rested blow us all away ! " wrong , afterglow worst all sarah albums . it unimaginative , boring not musically solid fumbling towards ecstasy , touch solace . case point , last song album , dirty little secret , actually painful listen me . it awkward musically -- choppy discordant -- lyrically it only slightly better than britney spears ' attempt song writing , dear diary ( don't bother listening song -- it trash ) . said all , i like some songs afterglow : stupidfallendriftingthis just not justified purchase ( not mention justified wait 5 years ) . it almost like she realized some point , " oh wait ! i music career , don't i ? i better put something out quick so i support my family .

those you who frequently dislike glass work , don't too quick judge this one . those who love his work , prepare pleasantly surprised . glass taken healthily large step outside his esteemed minimilism style brought wonderful score fits movie perfectly . while maintaining his personal touch composer his repeated arpeggios , complex rhythmic metrical elements brilliant use or orchestration , he manages weave colorful melodies dramatic builds , after seen movie , i could not imagine any other composer providing well adept or fitting score . quite possibly one his best works date i cannot stress enough how perfect it this movie	1

this cd spellbinding rhythms more ethereal tracks - kind relatively slow-paced tracks artfully establish early ' moment connection music ' somehow liberates listeners soul artist vision behind musical track comes life we transported place . whole it unique blend familiar exotic - ethereally exotic rhythms wedded lucidly logical melodic lines . this often-tried experiment , here , quite successful . other tracks high energy - very inspired , all infused brilliant , pleasingly-structured , readily-identifiable sense jazz fusion . stylistically this may ponty singularly most cohesive work . given his output , spans well beyond his most prolific stint during 1970 ' 80 , may well saying something . i haven't heard everything him , but , if your looking something else , imho , gives " cosmic messenger " run it money , may i suggest " mystical adventures " - knockout his . if you look it like i , unresolved toss-up this magnitude nothing but blessing music fans general , fans jazz fusion particular or anyone curious know just what five string electrified violin . i also enjoy " taste passion " , " civilized evil " " enigmatic ocean " . any case , ponty arguably world champion five string electrified violin . not this instrument only feature merit album . ponty , this time frame , surrounds himself truly comparable talent percussion , incredible electric bassist , here , two superb lead guitarists . i don't truly know myself yet if this jean-luc ponty best album , but , so far , i say it my favorite . highly , highly recommended	1
cream blues band first , pretty durned good one . i feel free n.s.u don't really demonstrate band blues side , but they rightful psychadelic cream classics . blues kicks sleepy time time , pretty good original pales comparison some blues covers ( more those later ) . dreaming never ceases annoy me , so i skip it all time . but sweet wine isn't only ginger baker finest cream composition mile , but also one cream better tracks . spoonful ... all i say this one , " whoa . " six-and-a-half minute voodoo blues -- jack bruce sounds positively creepy , even laughing evily one point -- some great harpwork firey guitar playing midsection . if this isn't cream best tune , i don't know what . rollin ' tumblin ' excellent harp playing but annoying singing , cat squirrel dull , four till late forgettable . these other three bad tracks . i'm so glad totally mindless , but benefits ginger baker madman drumming . closing album out would toad , favorite mine . it pretty much drum showcase , baker pounding his drums like he caveman or something . necassary all cream fans , or blues fans general	-1

thin , reedy , weak voice caterwauling caterwauling nonetheless . finally , production adds some much needed depth masculinity this girl-pop trio . let face it , vocals this group previous outings spears-esque , or madonna-lite-like best . try they might , these ladies could never match dalle or love or hynde . but fridmann saved day injecting interesting set distorted textures saved these ladies themselves . this their only worthwhile record , man it good one	-1

there many albums which introduced new combined style music masses ( e.g. " you experienced " , " sargent peppers " , " johnny winter " " texas flood " some ) . this set way ahead its time . butterfield blues band made name itself their first , self-titled , lp great exponents revived blues power . edge this band , say unlike canned heat , they two black musicians howlin wolf band . sam lay , drummer , still considered one best chicago blues drummers ever bassist jerome arnold . this lineup impressive . unlike john mayall , whose album fired interest blues far side atlantic its pre-hendrix like overdriven sound up front guitar . however , pbbb people chicago , home urban blues , who grown up played all greats . butterfield , originally flutist , probably , charlie musselwhite , greatest ever white harp player-his style single note playing ( listen record ) very unique gives it true horn sound . he met elvin bishop university chicago started jamming . bishop , native oklahoman , blues fanatic start . he played traditional blues styles his gibson 335 freddie king , eddie taylor , luther tucker otis rush tradition . mike bloomfield , whose father owned club chicago , only playing 10 years when he made this record . he played jazz , blues fingerpicking styles well . mike took up slide fender telecaster became known around town his fabluous technqiue-similar elmore james . he hired play slide initial album " shake your moneymaker " joined band . ( however , he out whole time-i saw pbbb several times growing up ny bloomfield never line up ) . east-west bloomfield switched gibson les paul ( like clapton ) history made . his lines clear many his runs virtually seamless . amazing effort-one he himself never duplicated- like eric clapton bluesbreakers first lp . mark naftalin great job keyboards . jerome arnold plays bass soul ( especially notice his work " work song " similar duck dunn mgs ) . this band interracial , great thing blues revival they helped start ( like srv 1980s ) . they blues booker mgs . this set combines all genres music but basically shows world what willie dixon always said " blues roots , everything else fruits ! " . they impressive updated ( time ) versions many types tunes . " walking blues " course robert johnson tune probably because clapton " ramblin my mind " mayall lp . " mary , mary " tune monkees !!!!!! you believe it ! " i got mind give up living " b.b. king tune ( redone many times many different titles ) . which me always highlight record . it blues , but new wave type feel arrangement . butterfield sings , but plays no harp ! bloomfield produced his best ever blues solos- slightly understated perfect , especially intro . " two trains running " funky feel nothing like muddy waters original or danny kalb blues project slow version " projections " . this one rocks intro guitar solo fantastic its tension build up . title track no less interesting . it featured ragas india basic jazz background . bloomfield butterfield playing fantastic highly original . this start grateful dead style psychedelic rock came late 60s . ( i remember playing bands 1967 where we " gloria " " light my fire " half hour each !!! ) this track 13 minutes long milestone time- door end 11 minutes ! work song powerful jazz-fusion number bloomfield best solos ever . this someone height their creative powers . whole tune solid explores jazz potential basic blues pentatonic scale . i feel this butterfield instrumental masterpiece . it unfortunate blues gave way soul country 1970s . butterfield subsequent work ( although some excellent ) never sold well ( like mayall well ) he bloomfield drug addictions which killed them both . bishop continues play chart success seventies . naftalin played otis rush others sam lay still chicago institution ( see him howlin wolf dvd fathers sons dvd blues series , 2003 ) . this essential recording history american music should everyone collection .	1
behind " master puppets . " i could never get enough first four tunes here since album 1984 release bit disappointed group released new mix " fade black . " ( they should left alone . ) " fight fire fire " thrash-metal fave still rocks over twenty years later . what amazing fact band didn't suffer creative burnout after releasing this gem but , instead , churned out album introspective heavy-hitters " master puppets " mere two years later ( shorter album consisting covers : " 5.98 ep - garage days revisited " ) . they would continue " ... justice all " 1988 hit their stride so-called " black album " 1991 before going downhill - letting their fame go their heads ( sometimes i wish they would never agreed make videos . perhaps they would remained bit more level-headed ) . my personal gripe aside , discard what corporate radio deems suitable you listen metallica-wise run , don't walk , your nearest ( chain ) record store buy this gem . then yourself favor listen this masterpiece , making sure push " repeat " button cd player because once not enough . - donna di giacom	1
last cd better . but if last cd five star this one four stars . they still better than 90% trash you hear radio . find out why rolling stones looked solomon burke inspiration . find out why solomon burke king rock soul . listen this album tell me why he isn't played every radio station country . waht up personal music taste america when solomon burke isn't mentioned same breath james brown ? this worth your time money .	-1

hank williams arguably all-time best american singer-songwriter he sings his songs better than anybody else . said , it interesting see what several modern singers collection hank songs . i think two interpretations outstanding . emmylou harris splendid " alone forsaken .

despues de lanzar el sobresaliente " all things must pass " el exito rotundo de " concert bangladesh " en el madison square garden , george harrison lanza este disco que en mi opini�n personal , es una excepcional saga despues de esos discos . partiendo con el gran exito " give me love " , que es un tema muy espiritual emocional de parte de george . " sue me , sue you blues " es una critica muy fuerte la situacion de beatles , pero pienso que principalmente se refiere paul mccartney ; tal vez esta cancion podria haber sido polemica junto " too many people " de mccartney " how you sleep " de lennon . " light lighted world " , " who see it " , " day world gets ' round " , " here now " " all " , tal vez sean muy parecidas entre si , pero esta la belleza solidez de george , principalmente en sus espirituales letras . " living material world " es como una especie de humorada que harrison lo hace magistralmente con su slide guitar con un destacado saxo de jim horn . " don't let me wait too long " " lord loves one " , son temas que perfectamente podr�an haber sido sencillos , principalmente la primera que es una balada melancolica muy pegajosa . " try some , buy some " , muchos diran que es el tema mas debil del disco , creo que todo lo contrario , tiene excelentes arreglos cambios de notas musicales muy complejas , con una solida produccion de phil spector . en cuanto los bonus tracks , est� " deep blue " ( lado del single " bangladesh " ) de 1971 " miss o'dell " ( lado del single " give me love " ) , que son excelentes canciones , principalmente la �ltima , que tiene un sonido country-folk lo bob dylan . la remasterizacion de este disco es fresco , limpio nitido con un espectacular sonido , en comparacion con la edicion de 1991 de parlophone que suena muy pobre . al final , creo que este es un disco que obligatoriamente tiene que estar en la discografia solista de harrison , junto " all things must pass " " cloud nine " . rating : 5 estrella	1
absolutely great ! album sade you shouldn't miss . flow , all our love , sweetest gift my favourite ! can't stop listening it . she just knows how make me feel so good	1
even if you haven't seen this show , you'll find cd very funny . it actually captures delivers farsical spirit musical . introductory " tuning " theme very , very brief , yet it inmediately invites listeners world music laughter . spoof present most lyrics , which makes fun times king arthur conventionalities musical genre . songs quite catchy melodious voices , terrific , specially sara ramirez who sings lady lake parts . album brings libretto helps lot follow jokes second reading lyrics . even cover design cute farcical . after grand finale company bow , you surprise - no longer than few seconds - which closes up brilliantly " bright side life " . if you want spend wonderful time listening most amusing musical , don't miss this one . broadway show collectors , it absolute must .	1

when i first heard commissioned child , i found their sound strange unique . however it subconciously left impression me . years later , i rediscovered this dynamic group release their reunion album ( i pleasantly surprised learn fred hammond part this group . he one my favorite gospel artists ) . it great seeing them all together matching faces names voices . they performed many songs i liked past , i surprised they ones sung them . after hearing reunion album , i grew more interested commissioned , soon started started buying their early albums . music took while grow me , but it , soon i looking more . i started looking albums contained hits performed reunion concert , hits such " let me tell it " , " secret place " , " please you more " , " i can't live without you . " i recently bought " state mind " , i got hear " i am here " ( original beautiful ) , " let me tell it " , " everlasting love . " i also bought " time seasons " few weeks later , it interesting hear how they changed over years but their message still same . i particularly like way they seamlessly combine scriptures their songs . they truly anointed lord . songs this album didn't affect me quite way previous ones , but i believe it only matter time . i particularly like " testify " , " psalms 84 " , " clean heart " ( i kept playing one over over ) , " walk right . " this their last studio album , their music blessing 20 years . i like commissioned i hope they're not group . it would nice if they release new studio album their 20th anniversary , but i know it must lord timing , so i am willing wait longer if necessary	-1

meat loaf legendary songwriter jim steinman collaborated 70s produce ground-breaking album " bat out hell " , 1993 produce follow-up " bat out hell ii " . , several other albums released , these more obscure albums still managed produce some memorable songs . this great double-cd collection contains all meat loaf most memorable songs , including " paradise dashboard light " , " bat out hell " , " modern girl " , " i would anything love " , " i'd lie you ( that truth ) " . steinman superior songwriting shines through , meat loaf trademark rock opera sound various instrumentals backing vocals evident each song . although steinman didn't write songs many meat loaf post- " bat out hell " albums , songs these albums contained this collection very good . i've fan meat loaf many years , i am eagerly anticipating release " bat out hell iii " , due out soon . meantime , meat loaf fans truly enjoy this great collection his most memorable hits	1
it finally came . took long enough , but i got it . i'm listening it right now . gutterflower 2002 studio album release goo goo dolls . what my take ? opener , " big machine " , easily one best , most explosive tracks goo goo dolls ever cut . i'm fairly well familiar song , i've downloaded it previously ( itunes ) , but it worth noting it still awesome . it guy who fallen hopelessly apathetic girl who destroying her life through her carelessness , should expected johnny rzeznik , it lyrically honest edge . " think me " all right . because it rzeznik , it head-and-shoulders above your average alternative rock , but it doesn't really stand out brilliant song . third song , " here gone " , i also downloaded listened previously . " big machine " , it still great i think i appreciate it even more now . johnny rzeznik proves he might best vocalist modern top 40 music lyrics quite affecting , even if subject matter nothing new ( girl closes off because past relationship crash , guy tries keep things together somehow ) . " you never know " features robby takac vocals therefore almost unbearable . when johnny rzeznik good he , why can't he sing all band material ? takac isn't too bad when he doing backup vocals , dizzy up girl " bullet proof " , but lead ... he terrible . truly . " what scene " rocker number works well ; gutterflower thankfully full these . it pretty solid song , i enjoy it fair bit . drummer mike malinin shines here ; percussion section very well . then comes " up , up , up " , terribly regrettable takac song , but still better than most his other lead-vocal tracks somehow ( very least ; doesn't say much ) . he doesn't too poorly bass here , though . " it over " very cynical title , you might noticed , lyrics hopeless : after breakup , girl moves guy desperate still needs her . again , despite cliche , rzeznik cuts through it well-crafted honesty his message . that probably why i like this band so much . then there acoustic song , " sympathy " , also downloaded track probably best song album . addition it one best damn music videos i've ever seen , it great song thought-provoking lyrics interpreted multiple ways . way i look it narrator trying fit crowd , or certain person - rzeznik , probably his now-ex-wife - pretending someone he not , now he agonizing over what he given up fake different life , he sorry , but he just can't anymore because it all lie . sympathy strange , though , because he breaking away ... that not bad thing . he realizing he can't live like it time change , he doesn't need sympathy people or person he pretended order get them . " what you need ? " underrated uptempo , aggressive rzeznik tune . lyrics suggest fragmented relationship made desperation , such relationships wont , now falling apart because high tensions emotions . gutterflower very bleak album beneath sheen , owing johnny rzeznik problems his former marriage - it seems emotional catharsis this way , which makes it seem all more honest actually focused . third takac song , " smash " , would pretty good if he wasn't singing it . unfortunately , he . fourth last takac song , unfortunately placed directly after " smash " ( also takac ) , could not redeemed anything save perhaps vocals steve perry , elton john , or phil collins , who seem able sing anything without making it sound lyrically awkward . worst song album . " truth whisper " closes out gutterflower less musically intense level than way " big machine " opens it . it not all catchy , but it all right malinin some nice cymbals going here . it may grow me ; many initially unassuming goo goo dolls songs tend . overall , not good 1998 instant classic dizzy up girl or 2006 let love , but fairly solid offering nonetheless , marred ( always ) voice robby takac cropping up little too often ( one song = too often ) . i already three best songs my hard drive , but it good other songs like " what scene " " what you need ? " album itself	-1
i first came into contact jim malcolm songwriting via poozies ' rendition quot ; neptunequot ; sublime infinite blue album . my first impression it beautifully worded -- lyrics song could read poetry , so facile flow words so lovely imagery -- poozies ' combination moving , melodic arrangements kate rusby melancholy voice gave me very good impression song . so i started listen jim malcolm own recordings , his writing rohallion not disappoint . man sure way words , his melodies strong . however , album hasn't touched me same way poozies track -- malcolm low , even voice lacks dramatic flair , his arrangements rarely build any kind emotional surge , resulting expertly constructed tracks somewhat flat , little too laid back my taste . i still love way he puts together song , however	-1
fratres my favorite this cd . it so crisp , so cutting , so absolutely gorgeous it nearly makes me cry every time i hear it . i used hate violin music . i guess i'm getting old , ( i'm 21 ) because this stuff just absolutely cuts my heart . it not overly complicated music mushes around , it like bared knife , simply elegantly lifting out your innards , higher , domain . buy this cd	1

... but every now then there spark something truly great , cheyenne kimball , if she learns lessons debut album well , should bright future world pop/rock music . based merits first two tracks alone ( " intro " " i want " essentially blend together into one pretty wild tune ) , cheyenne knows far more blending harmonies than most wannabees display half dozen albums . this isn't say day come perfect debut ; 13 tracks , " intro , " " i want , " " hello goodbye , " " breaking your heart , " " full circle " real standouts ... remainders certainly solid performances but they " there , " pop quality that hard dismiss . however , cheyenne definitely future world music , after listening this first adventure hers , i'm definitely interested watching what come up'n'coming on-the-edge-of-rock songbird	-1

i recommend this album those curious magnetic fields but intimidated sprawl ( cost ) quot ; 69 love songsquot ; . quot ; charmquot ; warm , yet detached , study country idiom evokes constant loss loneliness transient lifestyle . music composed unique creative synthetic textures cast over common chord progressions , listener familiar country music 60s 70s recognize many familiar melodies themes . vocals reminiscent dispassionate ian curtis or johnny cash . i no qualms calling quot ; charmquot ; essential magnetic fields recording -- i bought this album 1995 not exhausted it yet	1
when i ripped these cd put them my computer listened them , my heart sank . first , sound so incredibly loud , comparison other cd , one turn down stereo significantly even carry conversation . led me run files through what called wave editor , which shows digital files viewable format . what i saw confirmed what i heard . all tracks recorded zero decibles , maximum any digital sound file . if it louder than , sound clipped there modest significant distortion . i may getting too technical you guys , but old days we vu meter sound could crest into red ( above 0db ) ok -- not digital music . above 0db , file portions simply not heard . 80% music each track file 0db . simplify this you quiet portions each track louder portions each track compressed so each approaches or exceeds 0db . what i saw sounds tha instead peaking or approaching 0db well above value . so instead good zig zag file pattern , one sees big blot red . when i went back listened sections above 0db , you could hear noticeable clipping distortion . lowering volume using any digital sound editor certainly makes cd set more listienable , but not remove distortion clipping . high compression mastering 0db now mistake some cd mastering plants doing . i'm not sure why . audioslave red hot chili peppers two other examples artists doing this make sound appear punchier . sound standpoint , this set sucks . rip capitol vinyl versions or buy japanese versions , both which give you more honest sound greatest rock group ever . i am so disappointed this set .	-1
only just discovered this band i am very impressed . i love this type music after listening this album i can't understand why i only just come across them i wish i could found them earlier ! music classy classic but still very modern you tell how much these guys love playing this stuff i only imagine how much fun their live show must . playing together their sound whole well belanced even when they spread out into different sections well improvised solos their musical understanding each other shines through band just blends togethe	-1
bottom line : if you like tom middleton dance mixes ( sound cosmos , trip ) or jedi knights ' production , you're going love this ! buy it ! ok , this not much like other global communication releases , but that no reason such animosity . legal reasons , duo tom middleton mark pritchard cannot use name jedi knights any more ( remember george lucas guy ? ) . previously , jedi knights their avenue releasing their space-funk oriented material , their popular global communication moniker reserved techno-ambient musings . so , this managed confuse some people , which unfortunate because this album really deserves high praise . this not ambient album , but it superb example sweet booty-shaking tunes these guys also known . just glance track list alone should awake shivers electronic music fanatics , since it features tunes dabrye , trickski , one , vince watson , shur-i-kan , balil ( better known black dog ) well new tune tom middleton himself ! album also ventures into some excellent hip-hop seems disappointing other reviewers , but i am enjoying it lot . however , i feel album just keeps getting better it goes ( although dabrye rule ) end , we're into some sugariest detroit-styled techno you ever hear . it expertly mixed tunes you won't get any other compilation/mix , you know it love since it got gc name . what more you want people ? oh , way , i love 76:14 too , but doesn't mean you can't enjoy other types music well .	1
let get things clear before we begin , i'm black guy trapped white boy body ... i'm actually trying raise money get racial surgery . just kidding ... but i'm not kidding when i say how much i love power funk music . there just something so amazingly raw this music . so much today music overproduced underdone . it just leaves you feeling like , " what crap i just listened it ? " other words , it fast food ears ... this other hand feast soul . it leaves you feeling satisfied , delighted , funked up ! it collection songs you just can't help but smiling when you hear them . issac hayes , curtis mayfield , parliament just few " shining stars " this cd gives you there many , many more . i may white , but i'm not dead . this just terrific stuff . only reason i'm giving it four stars because song " word up " . i got my white butt kicked while song playing background ... it not cameo fault happened , i just happened wrong place right time every time i hear song , i freak ... not good way though ... anyway , it all good , right ? right	-1

wow , they actually put this " anti-classic " cd . seriously , this very bad album . practically none " superstars " sing , other than jimmy hart , they mostly stuck dumb novelty songs . not they fare too well when they sing " serious " songs . nikolai volkoff decent baritone voice , but his thick accent renders " cara mia " unintelligible . probably worst singing here roddy piper , although captain lou albano gives him run money . if you fan bad celebrity singing , you should get this album	-1
bruce springsteen always remembered nebraska , born run , or born usa . nebraska my favorite out those three , but here my second favorite . tunnel love bruce examination his first marriage there some tearjerkers here . he should given respect this album , like dylan blood tracks , his personal opus . favorites include tougher than rest , cautious man , ain't got you , tunnel love , two faces , brilliant disguise , one step up , when you're alone . highly highly recommended	1
arthur grumiaux one greatest violinists 20th century sir georg solti one greatest conductors 20th century . everyone should own least one recording both them , here you get both them playing together two cds ! music glorious , performers glorious , interpretations glorious , sound glorious . oh way , these often hailed defintive recordings . highly recommended	1

always - intro , using woman/rap metaphor like " kick it beat " best part . good upbeat tempo . add-a-cipher - his statement crowd size , cuts dj flo fader , first two guests . deal wid it - this one those songs which , j-live fan hearing it like , alright , that cool message , but you wouldn't want one your mainstream friends hear it because they would say he just crying over his life which non-gansta begin . get live - worst song ep , which means its worth listening it comes around rotation but you wouldn't skip . it problem chorus which just yelling get live !, but verses hot dope always so you can't skip it because chorus man , ' cause you'll miss good stuff . car trouble - second guest appearance here wordsworth , who doesn't rap but plays rider j taxi/rap industry metaphor . 9000 miles - when i first heard this i didn't really like it , i skipping it some , but it grew me , now it my favorite . when you're listening this first time , don't let refrain turn you off because message perfect when you're sort mood , i put it " world hopeless " folder " nights like this " all above . skip proof - outro . verse too short , just like whole ep . beat nothing right home , kind reminscent " don't get it backwards . " buy it . peace . note - i mentioned best part , which j first album , which you can't get amazon , so i hope they won't mind my suggestion getting it off www.sandboxautomatic.com check j website whoever he signed today because there usually link , he www.j-livemusic.net	1

if you ever read insert this album , band admits they trying red hot chilli peppers , primus , mr. bungle all rolled into one , but considering they still teenagers when recording all songs this album you cut them some slack . fungus amongus showed potential these guys . today they thrown away most talent they once order make it big . even though make yourself solid release , it showed signs band selling out . their two latest releases pretty lackluster . its just too bad theyll never make album this quality again . so heres how id rank all lncubus ' albums best worst1 . . . i . . . . . 2 . fungus amongus3 . make yourself4 . crow left murder5 . morning vie	-1

pink floyd now mythical band , released " dark side moon " early 70 today considered land mark one teh greeatest records all time . " wish you here " album came afterwards 1979 also magnificiant double album " wall " . although it hard compare them , i think these 3 albums all 5 stars masterpieces their own without making further analyzations . " wish you here " concept album dedicated pink floyd fouding member syd barrett left band cause mental ilness just after album " saucerful secrets " releasd ( although he appeared sessions ) sadly left us good june 2006 . it jazzy prog/rock influenced album great melodies 5 songs where 2 last over 10 minutes . david gilmour guitar play fantastic all through album when he get chance jam long periods roger water craftmanship compositions always fundamental great floyd album , even richard wright co-wrote some songs , it would take 20 years until he would again . it starts " shine you crazy diamond part 1 " which so long it cut 2 parts , originally it 9 parts but not newer records . first opener second closer , originally there song called " shine " used concerts , but it changed current title made much longer aswell . actually part starts long jazzy gilmour solo which one his best , only end waters joins sings some lyrics ( related syd ) there great saxophone solo dick perry . song title also echoes syd barrett name shine , you diamond . you say there several parts 2 " shine " songs ( 9 correct ) which all diffrent each other . song number two called " welcome machine " classic pink floyd song wonderful special effects , synthesizers guitars . song talks their bad experiences music industry , hence they even changed label " wish you here " . third song " cigar " more straight rock then other songs it " just " 5 minutes long , it feautures piano , synthesizers this time very funky blistering guitar solo david gilmour . it also suppost deal their experiences music industry . " wish you here " also got little less special effects magical sounds , basically it song where lyrics focus , gilmour plays accoutic guitar waters sings always , " wish you here " got one their best hooks great riffs aswell . it deals loss syd barrett waters inner feelings alienation depression stardome . perhaps this band most deepest song them all , says alot . second part " shine " closes album , it uses far more special effects synthesizers , but once again fantastic solo gilmour . perfect closer one most magical albums all time . overall , one greatest pink floyd albums . only 5 songs appear it , but they all excellent their own cause they all significant meaning they express so many diffrent kinds feelings , musically this takes you world it long , often somber recordings influents jazz prog . rock . concept album dedicated syd barrett 1946-2006 . rest peace	1
perales immensely prolific composer , catalogued over 450 songs over his 32-year career singer/songwriter . yet his productivity only surpassed his gift composing incredibly profound poems , all which he later envelopes lovely melodies . anyone who followed his trajectory since 1974 , when he released his first album , knows too well perales ' career spanned three distinct epochs . 1970s , socially-conscious perales challenged materialism social hierarchy his day via gems such " el labrador " " ecos de sociedad . " later , when his pouplarity peaked 1980s , he became somewhat more commercial his love songs , such " el amor " " cuando vuelvas . " today , he evolved into artist who no longer needs sell his music ; rather , he much more interested perfecting his craft composer . he admits his official web site , he hopes his best song one he yet compose . this jazzy-tinged album musical gem , yet radical departure stylistically past efforts . perales opted let music speak itself selecting exceptional musicians only few musical instruments . jazz-flavored arrangements , you'll treated flamenco guitars some surprising basso nova stylings . " como llenar mi tiempo " beautiful tribute his wife , wherein he admits her , her absence , he incomplete . " lo que fue de los dos " tragic recount long-term marriage , which both spouses severed passing time loss passion . " una cancion para la paz , " perales returns one his recurring themes : quest peace reconciliation . this composition , he joined brazilian choir , first this seasoned artist . there so much said this terrific collection , yet i am limited space . if you fan soothing arrangements , poignant poetry , melodious songs , this album you .	1

don't believe anybody who think cocteau twins enya-wannabe or something . this 1984 band true originals . there very small siouxie banshees flavour some their songs , but meanwhile this post-punk era music very hypnotic . somtimes this style called dream-pop . sound cool icy absolute amazing . when i hear liz . i feel like snowflake center snow-blast . when i hear song called lorelei tears goes down my eyes i just don't know why . listening this album good you karma !	1
this album hardy velvety voice ranges over wide variety styles . album begins fun , danceable pop song pure late sixties style , quot ; comment te dire adieuquot ; . afterwards , hardy veers slower songs , making beautiful renditions leonard cohen quot ; suzannequot ; , georges brassens ' classic quot ; il n'y pas d'amour heureuxquot ; ( mas-ter-piece , incredible piano arrangements ) jobim bossa nova quot ; sabiquot ; ( french quot ; le msangequot ;) , well singing couple very sweet own compositions , quot ; quoi sert ? quot ; quot ; la mer , les toiles et le ventquot ; , which demonstrate her talent songwriter . towards end album she includes lively french jazz tune , quot ; etonnez-moi , benotquot ; , which stands oddity , but quite fun . recommended all lovers sixties stuff	-1
i introduced beatles this cd when i maybe 14 . it first time i ever heard beatles . i liked their sound so i illegally downloaded rest their cd . this cd pry one most kids subjected trying pass this great sound into next generation , they could better job especially first five songs . first five songs would good songs nsync perform . i just imagine justin timberlake singin " i want hold your hand . " they should replace first five songs more songs showed pure genious beatles . songs like george harrison masterpieces " here comes sun " , or " while my guitar gently weeps " . psychodelic songs like " lucy sky diamonds " or " strawberry fields forever " would better selections , especially decreases heavy drugs kids use now adays compared 60 . " norwegion wood " , " saw her standing there " , " free bird " , " here , there , everywhere " would much better selections then there early boy band music . they included some great beatle songs like " ballad john yoko " spectacular " hey jude " . i understand this cd could not possibly included all their amazing music , but they should made better selections showed off their complete range . it quite possible this only cd beatles young people ever here . they should given better selection their music .	-1
this album not type person who wants not listen hard want they're hearing . if you don't like complicated , intent listening requiring music , this not you - don't get it . but if you like stuff this perfect you !!! if you're thinking buying it now , read . if not , go review or somthing . this really amazing stuff . lines , though they may not seem glimps , beautiful . this album transition point modern jazz you almost feel miles searching new things play just while listening . i'm not great reviewer but what i'm trying say , " get this album becuase it really amazing , beautiful , interesting , other things " get this !!!!	1
rather surprisingly , this great album . i don't think many ' 24 ' viewers rate callery music vital series , it almost always plays background colors scenes without containing hum-along themes grandeur heroism . but cd callery score reveals itself complex , extremely varied worthy more than casual listen . great liner notes comments each piece it usage series . recommended	-1
gy ! unlike anything else i listen , yet they've never fallen out my rotation very long . this pretty impressive thing , way i listen music tends sorta streaming or cyclical , so things i listen bring mind something else i like so i go listen so forth . this tends mean bands i like bit different or don't fall into typical genres i listen tend fall out rotation without my really intending them . gy ! probably most different or incongrous band i listen , but they somehow manage never forgotten very long . ' yanqui u.x.o ' my favorite album their , it probably one my 10 favorite albums all time . it good . many noted , this album bit different their earlier stuff it lacks samples found sounds , tends build slower , generally calmer overall . this makes it take bit longer get into , or it me anyway , but once you've really listened it thoroughly i think you'll find it their most consistently intriguing album . certainly , gy ! hardly ever got boring before , but their sound wasn't tight , lotsa outros intermediary passages which may somewhat interesting themselves , but didn't necessarily add whole composition all much . everything here seems tie together bit more cleanly . sound , overall , more desolate then before , but still plenty emotional power . ( moreso then any other band i've heard , matter fact . ) still , basic sounds still their : roaring , wind-like guitars , some slowly chiming , repeating guitar lines , simple cyclical string sections , pulsing bass inexplicably yet undeniabkt moving drums . 5 tracks , this album 3 main compositions . opening one , ' 09-15-00 ' weakest them , but it still fantastic . opening movement slow , dreamlike simple melodies chiming one over . real power song , comes 8 minutes prominent strings combining their electronic howling create their patented gy ! waves sound , this time particularly dark hypnotic variety . sadly , closing quarter track least interesting bit album , some more minimalistic stuff doesn't really add up much melody or atmosphere . it decent stuff , but not up their standards . first half ' rockets fall rocket falls ' more classicist gy ! , building crumbling again again . second half more reflective their newer style , incredibly slow building perpetual bass/percussive thudding tremolo guitars/strings . i'll admit it , i find this portion bit dull initially , but i've really gotten into it since . it got some very nice woodwinds it , extended prelude makes it all more moving when it really kicks up volume . ' motherf --- er = reedeemer ' best composition album , best thing i've ever heard them . first track it , 21 minutes long , some most low-key stuff they've , but it got melody textural variety make it all work . first 10 minutes , though low-key their standards , still pulse energy some nice string lines driving , bass cymbal drum patterns next ten or so minutes , some their absolutely most minimalistic stuff , minutes what really shine , however . it mostly just slowly cycling , 3-6 note guitar lines , some windy atmospherics behind it some beautiful , sorrowful bass lines . eventually it allows bit volume string howling guitar combination punctuation desolation periodically , allowing some most powerful , moving moments i've ever heard any band . i've listened this so damn many times , but it always gets me . volume finally kick again final track , some most sad yet triumphant music gy ! ever made . it perfect punctuation mark album whole , provides nice bit hope overall dreariness . writing review this tough , cause i don't like get all pseudo-poetic everyone , but that really all you if you wanna talk gy ! . individual parts their compositions tend simplicity themselves , but no one else dream understanding texture tone emotion way they . it all comes together make some most beautiful ethereal music you're ever gonna hear . get it .	1

when approached new revival kander ebb bob fosse defining classic cabaret hit shelves i knew moment i saw it i couldn't miss out . however , upon hearing it first time i initially somewhat disappointed . natasha richardson one thing cannot sing far i am concerned however she brings boldness into cd more " acting voice " which describes lyrics us oppossed belty musical theatre pelt . it certain richness it but definitely not something rave . don't expect liza minnelli . allan cumming ' portrayal sinisterly perverted emcee my opinion surpasses joel gray attempt both film original broadway production . exact amount camp , seedyness , evil cheek cumming creates truly unforgetable character amazing voice amazing looks he almost steals cd . this good thing considering emcee appears practically every song . however , ( me ) highlight cd michelle pawk amazing vocal talents her two songs- " tomorrow belongs me " " married " . her brassy portrayal evil villainess fraulein kost steals record not missed . mary louise wilson lost her touch somewhat but still belt out her main numbers maintaining same sass style she always ( despite her age ) . astounding , " blow you away " male female ensemble , enseemble numbers such " willkommen " , " money , money " " tomorrow belongs me " ( amongst others ) pleasure listen . other artists include : ron rifkin ( disappointment ) john benjamin hickey ( his amazingly great singing voice wasted but few lines ) denis o ' hare ( good always . i may only 14 but take my advice buy it ! tis truly great listen	-1
i grew up listening my mom play " teddy bear " , " phantom 309 " etc ., i think they some most interesting heart wrenching songs i ever heard . even today " daddys girl " reminds me times i spent my own father , who passed away last year . red sovine put into words so many years ago what many people felt still think today	-1

i not make comparisons nick drake lightly , but alexi murdoch tunes " time without consequence " rightly compared pink moon , river man , or other legendary drake songs . alexi quiet , confident performances , sung hushed voice guitar ( mostly ) minimal instrumentation , beautiful , haunting , soothing without boring or saccharin . but while alexi murdoch terrific cd may reflect drake style he also clearly his own performer , experimenting different sounds approaches his music . his voice not deepest or strongest you'll hear , but doesn't matter when what conveyed emotion beauty . this cd feels like private performance worth revisiting , few weeks since it released i listened it dozens time keep hearing something new interesting each time . loud world , this cd whispers your attention genuinely deserves it	1
... or you just paranoid ? you sure ? you even know whether you awake or dreaming ? such atmosphere created this minimalistic , dark work . it though you trapped deep underground some pitch black cave , yet place you far too surreal situation quite simple . while not quite desolate or dark lustmord other work , this definitely not anyone looking upbeat material . fact , this album probably more introduce dark ambient genre more people than any work recent memory , deservedly so ; it engaging piece ( all tracks flow together if they one ) it certainly one best its kind . these two guys should definitely collaborate again . if you like this cd , you should also check out ' cold summer ' lull , , course , lustmord own ' heresy .	-1
other than obvious hits ; highlights include power equality , if you ask , i could lied , righteous wicked , naked rain sir psycho sexy . frusciante begins evolve band begins break new ground ( they continued over years [ it makes you wonder what if hillel slovak hadn't died ]) . cool party vibe throughout disc , not all dark melancholy like some later albums . bssm all around great album even 15 years later ; other rhcp albums remastered , so why not this one ? we miss you " huckleberry " , thank god john :)	1
me , thing seperates very good albums great albums consistency -- i listen entire album without wanting skip any tracks ? i've found only few albums like , but this one them . despite title , there actually 11 tracks here , each one quite different last . but album works , very consistent . i can't name favorite track because they're all very good , though my least favorite would " it probably me " -- though i don't dislike it enough skip over it . if you're new sting , this album i would recommend picking up first . not only it my favorite sting album , but one my favorite albums , period	1
brandon cruz trying recapture something he never . his credibility artist . why else would he redo songs written kyle instead writing his own ? kyle toucher backbone dr. know ! i am utterly amazed how brandon take truly amazing songs butcher them beyond recognition . i recommend quot ; best dr. knowquot ; if you want hear these songs they intended	-1
here some thoughts i regarding ray davies ' thanksgiving day ep : 1 . title track reminds me lot otis redding . i imagine him covering it . i especially enjoyed horns . i look muscian credits see if they memphis horns ( surprised see they weren't ) . 2 . i also enjoyed other three tracks , although i preferred original version london song , since i felt , words reviewer bluegrass state , it " rocked " more . 3 . not it anything ep , but i think it interesting when ray started out this country , his labelmates included dean martin trini lopez now they include white stripes . 4 . speaking reviewer bluegrass state , my feeling ray , well any member any group , every right perform release solo , especially since dave released solo projects past . i'm looking forward ray album next february , which this ep good taster . ( note : mention reviewer bluegrass state referred negative review deleted who bascially said ray selfish pursuing solo career instead getting kinks back together brother dave " rocked "	-1
this album isn't babe party all guys flock around . this album cute girl plain dress no make-up you ask out when you finally realize you've great time talking her last two hours . solid but unflashy musicianship supports songs personal their specifics , but universal their feel . mostly just electric acoustic guitars , bass , drums , they stay out way , letting edwards ' breathy voice carry melodies you find yourself humming days later . if you like fist-pumping anthems , you bored this album . if your idea first date going clubbing until 3 a.m. , don't come here . but if your idea first date sitting coffee shop talking hours , then here your coffee shop .	-1
remarkable irs compilation just released , question presented ... could this cd good one ? i am not going compare this cd one , irs cd heads above this one , but because music era simply better or because songs this cd don't cover period expertly more recent best ? i feel fine covers six year period ... this one adds decade figure . yes , rem , but out albums more frequently irs than band its current run warner brothers . but you five albums plus irs best , warners 7 cds worth material , which one main problems , music r.e.m. changed great deal throughout period critics who maintain music not all play cohesively together correct . much better compliation would time best r.e.m. 1988-1996 , or all r.e.m. albums feature original line up . seperating non berry songs into future possible best part iii disc would created more central focus band their most univerally popular era music much stronger album overall album presented here should looked something like this : 1 . " man moon " i no problem this song first cd it prime example stipes writing bands playing this time , plus it aftp which central album middle era rem put out . 2 . " great beyond " released out era presented , song feature r.e.m. top later stage game . this song work well following prequel song before it one few times eras mix well . if i break rules , i would leave this song . but i also think it would work well " third " best cd , one where r.e.m taking look back their catalog . era where they movies inspired songs they made . taking this song out i would replace it " country feedback " song which flow nicely following " man moon " like " radio free europe " signature song after opening mood setting track . 3 . bad day , this little bit cheating their part . it clearly irs years , which perhaps why i like it so much . it deserves some kind best . or , they could saved it put it opening track around sun , perhaps setting better tone entire album . i feel fine doesn't need any new material its best portion it benifits greatly it . take bad day out , base album around it it wouldn't feel out place . perhaps here would good place more up tempo green number such " pop song 89 " . 4 . " what frequency , kenneth " . fits right here . 5 . " all way reno " , not bad song , but clearly out place , its rather lounge vibe . move it third best put no exuse leaving it off " drive " here . 6 . " losing my religon " all better after " drive " nice one two punch . 7 . " e-bow letter " leave it here . great song . 8 . " orange crush " ditto . 9 . " imitation life " this song works , one few blends , i think its great song but integrity , put " bittersweet me " here instead , one many naihf songs skipped . 10 . " daysleeper " again good but more later day , why not " world leader pretend " overall mood ? 11 . " animal " i am tempted say this worst song here glaringly proves point two eras don't mix . take it out go back out time " near wild heaven " yeah , let mills mix things up little here , this discs " rockville " 12 . " sidewinder sleeps tonite " some critical this song ( even band ) , little too close " shiny " but it must moment this disc . it would weird without it . 13 . " stand " can't leave this out even if many fans hate it . call this required part disc . 14 . " electrolite " always little iffy me but popular highlight new adventures so it stay , many love it . 15 . " all right friends " belongs second disc i feel fine . here , it feels forced carrot thrown out place warner brothers . 16 . " everybody hurts " worthy must . 17 . " my most beautiful " love song , clearly off up though representative beach boys faze they would fully explore reveal . more fitting song would " you everything " overlooked song green . 15 . " strange currencies " sets up closer very nicely . 18 . nightswiming , great ending album . so album should without much altering would consist : 1 . man moon 2 . country feedback 3 . pop song 89 4 . what frequency , kenneth 5 . drive 6 . losing my religon 7 . e-bow letter 8 . orange crush 9 . bittersweet me 0 . world leader pretend 1 . near wild heaven 2 . sidewinder sleeps tonite 3 . stand 4 . electrolite 5 . everybody hurts 6 . you everything 7 . strange currencies 8 . nightswimming so there you my opinion much better mix , like i feel fine , good mixture all cds ( you add more bang blame , leave maybe me honey if we match 21 songs ) still no shiny happy people . you left very worthy , if still slightly inferior sequel irs disc .	-1
alternative world beat ? psychedelic electro-rock ? i not imagine what hell this album . nor , when thinking it , sound layers seem like they would make compatable song -bulgarian(i think ... ) goth-enya lyrics rock-solid wall electric guitar . but , murky pool these influences rises misty vapor mesmerizing just any cd i've heard ages . this music very edgy , almost disturbing . unlike good chunk ebm ( stretch call it so ... ) , i think it really important turn down volume bit really take what this album . truthfully , i can't wait listen it again become once more lost mysteriously dark mix ... erm ... whatever this . rhea obsession stands alone	1
i heard mahler symphony #2 many time performance recordings . my opinion , none equals this fantastic effort mehta . it revelation beginning end . my first experience piece hearing bruno walter conduct new york philharmonic captivating performance long ago . introduction this apotheosis romantic music pales comparison . there very good reason why this recording never out print . it simply best .	1
this cd most phsychadelic cd i ever heard . what amaizing fact it achieves this feat without sounding egotistical . pitchfork write ok computer more revolutionary . pitchfork write all day , but it never make it true . every song this cd makes me feel emotion without even understanding lyrics , extent it almost makes me feel physically high . listening ok computer makes me feel too , but not extent loveless . ok computer not near inventive or wierd loveless ultimately not good loveless	1
there so many fabulous reviews this cd i agree them . i've billie holiday fan years own many discs her music , but i find myself reaching this one lot . it great collection songs her voice so sweet true here . she top form arrangements songs all excellent . whoever put this cd together knew what they doing . this definitely billie during earlier part her career there real lightness this music . ( her later music great too , but very different . ) most songs this cd classics even if you're unfamiliar her , you'll probably still recognize many them . there some crackling background noise some songs , since they recorded back late thirties/early forties , though it not bad most time you barely notice it . some stand outs " you go my head " , " very thought you " , " let it " , " way you look tonight " , just name few . i think this would great introductory cd someone who curious her would like hear some her music	1

power metal kings strike again black halo which one amazing piece metal mastery . opener march miphesto i enthralled this album its soaring melodies , driving beats intricate guitar solos ... i mesmerized . roy amazing vocal range really shown off here tracks like : haunting , soul society abandoned . all songs incredibly melodic catchy yet still make you want bang your head . one other thing mention here symphonic parts which give this album its epic feel really helps round out band sound . black halo one incredible musical journey one which everyone should take .	1
i am big fan cassandra wilson duped into buying this disc after reading reviews here elsewhere . i knew after first 3 songs trouble brewing they all sounded alike . indeed , entire thing suffers same muddy mix monotone vocals . what waste . no diversity song selection no vocal range . she should lose t-bone burnett her next effort . * note * she displayed this same poor judgment concert her song list	-1
quot;let get it , quot ; particularly this reissue , deserves no fewer than five stars . while alternate versions demos aren't essential original album itself , they still provide wonderful insight into how marvin gaye created this masterpiece . if you're casual fan , go regular edition ; if you enjoy gaye anything more than surface level , though , this cd worth your money	1
it interesting discover most low ratings this album got andrea bocelli fans who seemed threatened cd potential . it not really fair compare two artists honestly , they different leagues altogether although they share duet once ( remarkable one ... ) i first heard sarah brightman harem tour one experience unlikely forgotten . i thought harem pinnacle , but then i discovered la luna , pinnacle eclipsed moon . not one single song out place , all together , they lend this mystic feeling one round listening isn't enough , you just press replay button again again . i won't claim i know all background story surrounding each song . apparently , most cover some you taken particular dislike just single fact . except dido " here me " , i've never heard songs before i think sarah voice more than capable giving them justice . it really hard find standout song , because all them exceptionally . but if i'm gonna pushed wall forced just pick couple , la califfa very haunting heartwrenching . course title track , la luna . i wish i hear more-operatic version it just soothe my curiosity . eagerly awaiting her next thematic offering ..	1
most songs great ; i didn't know i knew them , but when i heard them , they amazing . couple left something desired , however . overall , though , it great cd	-1
if you don't sade " diamond life " or even if you , this " best " cd welcome addition any music collection . this unique singer continues haunt me like girl ipanema .	-1
it nine years since so so def ceo ( now virgin records ' president black music ) jermaine dupri released label gold-certified compilation so so def bass all stars , vol . 1 . since then he steered careers rappers da brat bow wow well releasing three other compilations showcasing diversity talent among south . past , all dupri compilations launching pads regional artists well critically-acclaimed albums . not so his latest effort , young , fly flashy vol . 1 ( so so def/virgin ) . poor attempt showcasing newest so so def signees , album falls short providing taste how innovative dope southern hip-hop . instead we given project full lackluster tracks , recycled concepts artists whose passion just not enough set them part popular players today burgeoning southern rap scene . newcomers young capone kid slim fail impress tracks like " i'm hot " tedious " 10 toes " . talented artists like boyz da hood slim thug repping heavily south , competition too fierce dupri newest draft picks deliver no originality . party joints like " gotta getcha " , which too short enjoyed , kp envyi " put cha hands up " both mediocre attempts club-friendly radio songs . " put cha hands up " just not get party started same way duo 1997 hit " shorty swing my way " . what could hot ode exotic dancers if it just little longer ( " gotta getcha " ) , clocks less than three minutes . but southern enthusiasts don't fret ; all not lost this lp there few tracks worth checking . " kodak moment " authentic down-south rider music featuring kavious , pastor troy ugk bun . addictive " i think they like me " ( remix ) made stuntin ' your ride worth listen just hear da brat scene-stealing bars . atl veteran pastor troy shines again " just fight " , which reminiscent his classics " no more play ga " " i declare war .

i thought i'd write review this cd . this great recording ocean night pounding crashing waves distant foghorns . i experimented this cd burn't it my hardrive using musicmatch than i downloaded it my rca lyra mp3 player just see how it sounds mp3 . it sounds great you hear every detail waves foghorn course you always take it off mp3 player . but it could relaxing walk nature sounds . i still listen cd though . i use lyra mostley music but nature sounds sound great too . since this recording 60 minutes long it take little longer download your mp3 player . it took it 2 minutes mine it only takes second music . but if you this cd , musicmatch or windowsmedia player mp3 player you may want try listening this while your walking	1
wow . i remember going cd store 1997 seeing two riverdales cds . quot ; hmmmquot ; i thought myself .... quot;they're lookout ! records they look pretty coolquot ; . well , 3 years i didn't think them until i found out they sounded ungodly amount like ramones , one my favorite bands . so , i checked them out , sure enough , they rocked . storm streets great , solid album i don't even own , but am obsessed it already . i there first one which rocks well , but storm streets seems so much more structered well-produced(judging songs i've heard ) . ever heard huntingtons ? huntingtons huge rip-off riverdales .... they sound exactly like them . i really like huntingtons , but riverdales get more respect because they came first . so fans screeching weasel , huntingtons , queers , course ramones , enjoy this albu	1
this one my most favorite commissioned albums ever . reason because fred marvin great singers this last project they together before their solo careers really took flight . i love this album , " dare believe " classic . " i'm learning " one my all-time favorites . " love way " " come home " two blazing , bumping tracks get you bobbing your head . then album goes urban praise worship last few tracks which uplifting spiritual . " draw me nearer " , vocally , commissioned its best . one add collection	1
this album huge transition cold . since their last album , " year spider " band deal loss both guitarists , let go their record label , public lashing tour mates evanescence scooter ward ongoing personal issues . lyrically this album compares well any cold previous work . it obvious scooter ward driving force behind cold lyrical poetry . if you're fan previous work , especially tracks " year spider " . cold sound really evolved their first album their second addition terry balsamo guitarist songwriter . music took great turn second album improved musicianship somewhat familiar nu-metal sound . although two new guitarists very talented , music this release definitely lacks some bite previous two albums . there no stand-out aggressive track album full softer melodic tunes . sure , there great songs this album ; " different kind pain " , " happens all time " , " feel it your heart " , " when heaven not far away " , " god song " , " when angels fly away " . album solid throughout , no filler all . songs those strong hard hitting introspective lyrics typical cold music , musicianship remains solid , sam mccandless again stand out drums . it just album feels like there no progress their last album , almost though these songs written same time , just didn't make last album . i think it obvious terry balsamo departure hurt band music writing department , they just weren't comfortable letting mike booth matt loughran cut loose writing . it shame , album solid , very good , but it fall short compared " 13 ways bleed onstage " " year spider " .	-1
yo , wassup ? this best soundtrack available buy right now , it got great mix dance ramp ; etc you should also buy video , thats even better than soundtrack	1
oo god , one more time ! this collection cream cream great american songbook rock'n'roll singer who contributes nothing all american culture . this rate #1 express my deep deception successful album series . over exposed material which treated so many different ways so many different vocalists artistry should treated respectfully . i am not dictator but i would vote law would impose respect some art expressions which represents treasure american culture . more than , series success reflects lack understanding music context people who should search entertainment more valid truer way . that deal : there truth missing , there sensation money-make production . mellow arrangements , neglectable performances , lacking creativeness . completely forgotten some years ahead .	-1
i find it strangely curious everyone doesn't think this best rb album ever . well maybe if en vogue weren't their record company , everyone might . but how everyone know when heralding single dropped two weeks before album . two weeks not enough time promote album , elektra -- shame you . never i heard mainstream music so well-crafted . time it took them complete this album more than justified . riding coat tails classical pieces brilliant concept : dance sugarplum fairies ; moonlight sonata ; habanera ; etc . it so unfortuante very few either still interested or even knew en vogue then new album . this effort , my mind , blew every other album out water . operatic height they soared this collection amazing : love won't take me out ; vocal complexity sad but true ; cute odd no , no , no . it would truly " masterpiece " it not ill-placed love suite , afterwhich makes me want turn album off ( it feels too much like end ) . while number one man alright song , it latin soul mar overall classical , vocal styling well-written feel this album . girlgroup aspect only viable comparison original en vogue destiny child . destiny child interesteing hear look , but comparisons always confounded me : destiny child not harmony group ; there no lead singer en vogue ; every member en vogue hit song singing lead vocal ; every member en vogue her chance sing her ass off . im not feeling new line-up or music en vogue , but hopefully they'll soon get original members back together studio , promised . i've ignored soul flower because i'm awaiting real en vogue return what sorely missed rb : rich , harmonized , classy music sings love , not sex . cindy ( no more kids , lol , we need you)max ( girl get it together)terry ( miss faithful can't it alone)dawn ( girl you'd better stop playin ' )	1
some want argue statement made title this review but i proudly stand behind my claim . others might confused , but rest assured , " nasty " good thing jazz-rock realm . i tell my trombone player he nasty after just every gig , he . nasty emotional reaction , like funky , comes only music ( i never heard nasty painting or nasty piece architecture , nothing concrete life gives you this reaction ) makes you all kinds nasty things , like curling your lip or dancing badly , or whooping or going " whoaaa " or howling or stomping ... you get idea , it like funky but even more pronounced energetic ... but anyway this album nasty ! miles assembled fantastic band this project , film score documentary boxer jack johnson . band comprised miles , john mclaughlin guitar , michael " nasty " henderson bass ( okay i made nickname up , but he ) , billy cobham drums , herbie hancock organ ( he reportedly stopped studio middle session bag groceries his new album show miles , miles insisted , recording happening , he sit down organ take solo . he it nasty . my only complaint steve grossman , saxophonist , not quite same league rest musicians but his contribution okay nonetheless . first track , " right off , " 25 minutes nastiness , heavy rock roll shuffle featuring mclaughlin most in-your-face guitar solo . few minutes , miles comes , key changes , miles takes what i would consider one his greatest solos ever ; he absolute command his instrument uses whole range blowing highly charged , funky-yet-out solo over persistent yet flexible shuffle groove . there one moment where miles trades exclamatory short blasts rest band everyone so locked it incredible . first eight minutes or so this track worth cost cd these two solos . that not say rest album isn't good , but it not quite good amazing beginning . rest " right off " features hancock organ well grossman saxophone remains healthily nasty throughout , exception reflective section spliced producer teo macero , whose contribution editing this album slightly more prominent than usual . this even more evident second track , " yesternow , " which almost cut-and-paste feeling probably more effective documentary than continuous listening experience without it . there one section " silent way , " just minute long , which miles solos himself over lush , memorable groove earlier album . i found effect this section remind me how much i love album , not one hand . but it still interesting contrast nasty first tune . this tough album place terms accessibility ; it really in-your-face loud , almost distorted guitar but there nothing particularly weird here would turn off casual listener . my friend , trumpeter miles expert , maintains this not jazz album but rather rock album , i would tend agree , though improvisation plays huge role making this music happen ( nothing written beforehand very little rehearsed ) . this actually great bridge into jazz heavier rock , better than any other electric miles which often acquired taste abstract side . jazz fans appreciate miles ' assertiveness interplay happening here ( this not lifeless or stagnant fusion could ) long they not closed-minded incorporation rock into jazz or jazz into rock . all all , first track phenomenal second musing , so this album comes together masterpiece one my favorites miles	1
like many performers who tragically passed away before their time , last twenty five years seen vocalist billy mackenzie elevated minor deity scores unquestioning associates devotees . but this first associates album recorded when equal talents fellow-associate alan rankine allowed showcase themselves . what talent indeed ! it rankine sublime guitar hooks bass lines caused me replay my old audio cassette until paper-thin these last twenty five years . affectionate punch remixed 1982 remix became official release . results disappointing . remix managed tone down rankine guitars almost inaudible level billy helium-high voice takes center stage . it over-worked effort they should left original alone . many years masters original version ' lost ' ( or destroyed mackenzie rumored ) , but second master tape found pressing plant europe few years back results breath-taking reminder why this album cherished me these many years . affectionate punch magazine real life changed face music then since stood test time . buy them both !	1
john quintessential beatle - ambassador world peace , great songwriter , singer lyricist . tragically , he died way before his time . i always wondered what he would accomplished he lived longer . must any music collection . instant karma , always , remains inspirational piece transendant lyrics nobody told me piercing evaluation modern times . probably his best lyrical composition . mind games give peace chance classic lennon songs - outward , communal insightful . no wonder beatles so good .	1

led zeppelin simply most overrated band all time who just bad nirvana acdc . they only made decent song " stairway heaven " . rest songs just stink !!! plant sounds more like big monkey than real singer can't sing all , he just screams . like good singers ??????? i recommend go foreigner , dire straits who equally greatest bands greatest singers lou gramm , mark knopfler . they billion times better than led zeppelin . don't listen five star reviewers this page , avoid this piece junk go foreigner insted . they legends , not zeppelin !!	-1
they're all here this cd . every one great hits defined one most talented rock groups history . it really strange hear what passes great music today , when you listen this . creedence certain soul-something real you hear it loud clear . talent ? yes , but more than . it just sort reaches inside you , takes hold doesn't let go . this one great cd	1
i agree people who said this isn't best stooges album . it isn't . out big three ( this , raw power , funhouse ) , it definitley worst . but it still good music . thing i love stooges they so original time ( superior mc5 , who we're they're " big brother " band apparently ... whatever ) . they're music sloppy , distorted , whiny , but there something inventive , spontaneous , melodic it too . whether or not stooges ( other bands like them ) fueled fire punk rock movement arguable , but they definitely drove rock into direction it hadn't yet explored . i think alone should merit respect all rock fans . album itself , highlights definitely i wanna your dog , real cool time , 1969 , little doll . but other songs aren't terrible either . even 10-minute track we fall , which i am not fan , still interesting experimentally creative effort something different ( almost sounds like pink floyd ) again they deserve respect . stooges made great music . period . it like nothing else anyone heard , much rock pioneering credibility led zep , black sabbath , doors . if you like funhouse raw power , get this . but if you don't any stooges , get other albums first	-1

just mention this review rca ' living stereo ' release , not later sacd compatible version . rca famous it ground-breaking work mid-to-late fifties when it came vivid , immersive stereo sound it reputation lives this day . i'm not sure if reviewer below experienced vintage classical recordings predating digital era . yes , they contain some tape hiss but it really insignificant what value performances themselves soundstage very vibrant . i personally listened recordings solti decca , jansons emi fischer philips these fine works bartok none come close passionate intensity interpretations or wonderful recorded sound these reiner versions capture . reiner account concerto orchestra , one most famous 20th-century orchestral works , everyone list truly exceptional . music strings , percussion celesta receives just kind wicked , eerie , powerhouse performance make you fan bartok life this piece particular . if you're going own one bela bartok cd , this one best choices market today . after you've ingrained this music into your mind , time miraculous mandarin , piano concertos string quartets follow .	1
this cd truely torture . you start track one course . after several months playing it over over again while rest your cd collection goes unused ( i'm not kidding this ) leaves you suspicious you may going around bend . finally , reason begins return you force yourself listen track 5 , reason you bought cd firt place . you break out again , soon discover track 10 , then track 12 . you feel pathetic because you don't know names songs , just your cd player shows only those numbers . i sometimes compare maysa anita baker , i feel there striking similarities but also very distinct flavors . some tracks little hokey , they no meaning me personally , but you tell they come very personal experiences she lived . oh well , i give her this opportunity , fair trade what she gives me rest this cd . thanks maysa , you babe	1
i wrote superb review two days ago , it posted yesterday now its gone , so i'll write review ( without insulting more people ).: van halen , one greatest debuts all time . sure , rock healthy this time : ac/dc just stepped into rock circuit making name themselves , led zeppelin recent album " presence " made it #1 ( i think first band ) , kissmania taking over america , boston debut became fastest selling debut history . also notbale tour acts like ted nugent , blue oyster cult , nazareth , legendary black sabbath , who weren't real succesful record wise but amazing status touring giants . but then punk occured real rock jeopardy . solution ? these four guys : david lee roth(had put him first satisfy his big ego ) , eddie van halen(who every public poll taken beaten likes angus young , eric clapton , yes even your beloved jimmy page ) , alex van halen(who pretty sick drummer ) , micheal anthony(who should nicknamed ' god backup vocals ' ) because these guys rock ' roll given second chance live , chance retard groups like clash shut hell up . i hate writing debut reviews , because you say what band introduced , which takes friggn forever , so i'm going write normal album review : 1 . runnin devil ( 3:32 ): introduction extremely loud music ! my brother woke me up this once full blast i ear damage ! quality this amazing , sounds like this song recorded just yesterday . while eddie solo not his best it still trademark wail it eddie so acclaimed . 2 . eruption ( 1:42 ): most amazing studio recorded guitar solo ever ! all three instruments featured here but most obvious eddie alex . alex drumbeats set path eddie amazing fingertap solo , much like metal blitzkreig kills everything its path (?) ! 3 . you really got me ( 2:37 ): they took good song made it better . listen old one then listen this , there definite improvement it , it like boys recreated song scratch . 4 . ain't talkin ' ' bout love ( 3:37 ): most popular song off this album , very kiss-like atmosphere it heavier riffs dave trademark falsetto scream . 5 . i'm one ( 3:44 ): big band back again metal form !! you see many people complain van halen destroying music , contrary : they brought music back ! this song perfect example how van halen resurrected old 50 music create unique sound . 6 . jamie cryin ' ( 3:30 ): probably first hair metal song ever created ( pretty good if it ) . 7 . atomic punk ( 3:00 ): this song created put salt wound punk music . you see van halen created this extremely heavy virtuosic song reveal kindergarten music talent punk bands world saying " we punk , times 1000000 " ) . i got eddie solo , which not only 100x sound punk solo , but also 100x speed . 8 . feel your love tonight ( 3:40 ): pop-influenced song , can't think anything else , it good listen . 9 . little dreamer ( 3:22 ): sounds like aerosmith influenced sound throughout dark atmosphere . ironic , considering it song succeeding where others say you fail . 10 . ice cream man ( 3:18 ): john brim cover , though many mistake it vh original song . i think acoustic intro both david lee roth eddie , kind interesting hear lighter side band after all their electric songs . then halfway through band turns their instruments create great climax soulful song . 11 . fire ( 3:01 ): intense closer , not very common van halen album . guitar work here one most copied sounds metal history . van halen ranking : 1 . fair warning2 . women children first3 . van halen 4.19845 . van halen ii6 . balance 7.51508 . ou8129 . diver down10 . unlawful carnal knowledge11 . live : right here , right now12 . van halen	1

ronnie martin back much anticipated new joy electric release , " ministry archers " , fourth volume band ongoing " legacy " series its first new subcategory entitled " moog dynasty " . " archers " , we find martin experimenting variety new sounds musical elements . most notable difference this previous joy-e releases rhythms themselves . instead simplistic beats hallmark martin classic sound , rhythms here more driving , heavier border edge industrialism . musical arrangements also tighter eloquently orchestrated . besides this , there two genuine experimental moments heard album instrumentals " hornets horns " " intricacies " which display sound reminiscent early tangerine dream . lyrics , they clever direct anything else released joy-e . end , while there many new exciting sounds heard " ministry archers " , album still sounds like genuine joy electric release ronnie martin greatest achievement yet . minor quibble fact " archers " only clocks 32-minutes total . however , there many albums run twice length maybe only two or three great tracks them rest mediocre . " ministry archers " thankfully no such album all ten tracks excellent . this makes short running time seem lot longer undoubtedly enjoyable listening experience beginning end . instant classic !!! standout tracks include : become murders , most terrible archer , you refrain , title track two aforementioned instrumentals .	1

magnetic field stephin merritt reminds me some other extremely gifted pop producers , or composer/producer/musicians , who gift us their own musical visions , skills enter recording studio deliver this vision which then shared listener . other such music geniuses , individuals such legendary phil spector , brian wilson todd rundgren , eclectic brian eno , indie cult performer east village pipe all come mind . all these men share common ability create music so breathtakingly beautiful it induce tears joy listener . it also seems case nearly all these individuals share common history struggling some inner demon , or personal pathology . case wilson east river pipe , drugs psychosis ; case artist responsible this fine record , sense loneliness lingering depression . it clear while stephin merritt appreciates love ideal state , elusive state mind , he also finds it very hard manage . fact merritt gay both incidental , well essential ( sense it pointing him toward certain types musical lyrical sensibilities past ); hence , there various dualisms stephin merrit t.t his - wasp nest one merritt other bands , 6ths - my favorites his records . i acknowledge greatness his later concept albums , johnny cash meets depeche mode brilliance charm highway strip , i greatly enjoy some magnetic fields ' earlier works . but here , merritt deep baritone , his gentle , subtle arrangements , sheer beauty his songs , gives me nothing but satisfaction . i wonder , there ever love anthem fantastic love lighter than air ? why it not hit , i'll never know .	1
what hell i mean redeemed insanity ? there certain music out there lead you ( if you let yourself led , circumstances right ) very edge " sanity .

this album like everyone said masterpiece . jeff mangum nasal whine not your typical singer voice , but it grows you incredibly fast . guitar chords simple but always convey proper emotion lyrics , i must stress , anything but nonsensical . they incredibly deep full fresh take love struggles life death . album inspired reading anne frank story , it easy detect pieces story filtering through , especially songs holland 1945 oh comely , which masterpiece itself . emotion this album unparalelled . it sparse yet powerful . also , lyrics not nonsensical . they complex figurative , but after struggling them enough listens , they begin make sense . mangum voice so perfectly suited this music because , frankly , lyrics would sound very emo if your typical pop singer singing them . give it chance . it may require multiple listens , but rewards well worth it .	1

i admit , first listening , i found some aspects ms. belle interpretations these pieces disorienting . however , i listened these covers repeatedly , i now say i understand better what vocalist after . not i always agree her george duke , arranger/producer , but i agree their choices their totally new project enjoy my horizons broadened . ms. belle immense talent , superb technique , clear idea each piece , she delivers goods without faltering or compromise . i admire lot performer . her choices ask us reaction we free accept or reject what she offered us . when i first heard these renditions , i quite stand-offish , but over time i come appreciate them more more - almost point addiction - am grateful regina george their strength conviction well their superior musicianship . they not want us listen passive way , they waiting our reaction .. god , this really so , so good .... that true spirit which album should recorded . i'd encourage you get this album because it strong , powerful personal interpretations some great jazz standards regina . you may love everything it , or you may reject aspects her interpretations . but any case you not remain indifferent ; you enriched hearing these pieces clear beautifully personal way . important aspect why i love this imaginative , innovative quality music why this recording invaluable . it cannot said enough her backing band incredible , giving this album necessary push take it over edge . it success because it skilfully avoids categorized . regina courage break out traditional mould make successful cross-over , which some purists may not approve ... only time tell ....	1
early 90 , single " grey cell green " got lot airplay mtv . it catchy song band i never heard so i picked up cassette ( it 90 ) . rest album even better . " throwing things " stands one best songs never become single . " kill your television " standout . all songs extremely catchy , energetic pop tunes . unfortunately , bands follow up albums not much fun . but , few artists could put out album good this one . i since upgraded cd still listen it quite bit .	1
granted , they only need it one composition ( last one , " james bond theme " ) but still , without guitar it just not same . barry didn't compose this one so i suppose it bonus i shouldn't complain , really . rest music all cds fantastic . some stuff i heard before without realizing who composed it . very enjoyable , say least	1
this one makes sense , because fact kidz bop existence very , very scary . you know someone gonna say sooner or later	-1

when i listened sample songs amazon.com " make yourself " album , i knew i get this cd when i heard song " drive . " needless say , it good choice get album . i listened morning view crow left murder before this one , so my expectations little different , but overall , make yourself good album listen o.o ne things i like incubus their diversity their songs ; sure , majority songs make yourself rock songs , but some songs here display how band tried experiment different genres . songs like " i miss you , " " battlestar scralatchtica , " " stellar , " " drive , " just name few . privilege one my favorite tracks album . i dunno why , but i like how vocals sound when track hits " find yourself back door " part . very good song . 9/10nowhere fast also good song . like privilege , this one rock track . although it few slow moments it , it then picks up fast beat again . 8/10consequence nice lyrics . this track shows what it like punished something you've , not bad song all . 8.5 /10the warmth tells you not turned off jerks society , instead encourages you hang nicer people . good lyrics , my opinion , good beat . 8.5 /10when it comes hard rock song , except little steadier than other rock songs this cd . not much else say it . 8/10stellar amazing-sounding song . listen echo morning view album you'll hear what i mean . there nothing else say stellar except it great-sounding song good vocals lyrics . 9/10the actual make yourself song ... bit tricky review . half it lyrics tell you yourself " making yourself . " it good beat well . only thing bothers me this song constant use " " -word throughout song ... this word doesn't even make sense this song . but overall it isn't bad track . 8/10drive undoubtedly best song cd ! it amazing vocals , lyrics , beat , etc . everything it amazing . you know those instances which you favorite song cd ? this one those instances . i listened drive sample right here amazon , my reason getting album . everything song perfect . you should buy cd just this purpose . lyrics explain why it important not let your fears " drive you " , you should " take wheel . " amazing song ! 10/10clean song interesting , yet good , lyrics . lyrics explain how someone tries use insults , yet insults always come out unharmful . other than , this song rock track . 8/10battlestar scralatchtica instrumental songs portraying full talent turntablist , quite amazing . this instance which incubus experiments their sound . 8/10 " i miss you " , my opinion , song some best lyrics cd . it also steady-paced flows smoothly . vocals also nice . 9/10 " pardon me " shows some fast-paced vocals , they sound difficult pull off . its lyrics also hold some meaning . 8.5 /10out under song heaviest beats it whole make yourself album . it also my least favorite track , because my opinion lyrics don't make much sense ( " resist p*ss wind , anyone who end up smelling " ) . 7/10my overall score this album 4/5 because strength tracks such drive , stellar , privilege , consequence . i would given it star if it used bad language less , if down under different lyrics , if make yourself few different lyrics later parts song . but meh ... those only few slight flaws . pay attention all positive stuff this album buy it , because it worth your money .	-1

i hestitated write review " purple rain " years because 1 . i listened this album 4 years everyday ( 1984- 1988 ) never knew what it truly . 2 . many ways it made most profund change me person . 3 . because underneath it sexuality greatest christian rock album all times4 . also greatest musical statment rock era . many ways prince revolution " purple rain " extension classic sly family lineup ( whom he takes probaly his greatest inspiration musically ) their second album together he leaves minneapolis sound somewhat instead punk/funk nu wave vibes 1999 he opts power pop like who kinks songs like " let go crazy " classic clash synth pop townsend -like guitar chrouses but lyrics start him either prayer thearpists chair traditonal gospel intro talking ' afterworld ' or insanity ( much like marvin gaye lyrically his best ) those minneapolis synths coleman dr. fink swirling vamping , song becomes power pop heaven guitar freaks lyrics which captures lust , salvation insanity it perfect guitar solos end it cathraic release siginals we not only listening soundtrack but it core christian rock album but it doesn't sound like newsboys , amy grant or dc talk album because unlike those groups , prince talks flesh ways these artists would never broach album . side one ( i it vinyl , cd tape ) after insanity let go crazy great pop take me u it great arrangement while appolonia vocally limited , she turns great performance this song prince great singer could overwhelmed her vocally but he stays her range " beautiful ones " only rb sounding song side one , beautiful declaration love his girlfriend time susanah melvion . his best smokey robinson/curtis mayfield/eddie kendricks falsetto he pleads great tenderness verse " if i told u baby if i love u baby baby baby we could married would coolin last verses he demands she makes chociedo u want him ? or u want me cause i want utell me baby u want me !!!! i gotta know i gotta knowcomputer blue probaly most song hendrix/funkadelic spirit lyrically musical exceution it wendy lisa sapphic intro bathing each other into most insane prince guitar jam it his sexual id run amuck musically lyric " til i find righteous one computer blue " revolution jamming prince plays some best solos i ever him play it eddie hazel - like first solo before breakdown into ernie isley-like second ( whom i think prince sounds like ) melodic solo til insane ending him screaming like banshee then it fades into most controvesial song whole album , " darling nikki " ( reason there parental advisory tags every album)is visit hotel see girl who ' sex fiend ' song while quite tame today still only gets played late night because lyric mastrubastion . i always thought guitars led zeppelin vibe time but i listened more black alternative albums it sounds like funkadelic it prime . side two ( i know i am still doing vinyl thing ) where you really see spritual side come out opener ' when doves cry ' musical artistic acheivement it lack bassline song sounds like sexual peacan woman , but it actually hwo one dominates or gives up control their interpersonal romantic relationships really cold dark lyrics lament " this what it sounds like when doves cry " even when prince not singing sex it bleeds through lyrics it really sad song many ways but guitar brillance keeps song lite . " i would die 4 u " great pop/funk song faith under quise sexuality god woman , man or something you can't even fathom . me my friends couldn't believe time prince talking god all those mainfestions chrous " i would die 4 u baby i'm star actually most classic minneapolis sounding song those classic keyboard vamps chant " doctor " dr. fink great keyborad solo then finale " purple rain " which he takes marvin gaye staple remdemption where he ties but impluses but marries them godly realm it lyrically double endtree you say he talk himself woman savoiur but it also power god into one life . after watching movie concert you realize years later this album it heart ode god sex like many his classic albums but it greatest christian rock album all time because unlike those christian rock bands , they never touch world they always trying run away those issues their makes their music nothing but empty platitudes unlike prince who like bob marley marvin gaye embraced scared profane came out masterwork ages .	1
where this one fits : slow wonder follows new pornographers ' mass romantic electric version , but precedes twin cinema . it transition frenetic power-pop first two np albums deeper , more timeless quality their latest . without burden np " sound " live up , newman stretches , writes ballads pink floyd-y space out songs ( though always concise ) , if anything gets more pet sounds-like his musical arrangements ( gorgeous trumpet " come crash , " driving , rhythmic cello " town halo " ) . newman , quite obviously , very prolific his batting average stunningly high . it okay me if he mixes solo albums his np output , using them places experiment new kinds songs he thinks maybe his np fans won't cotton . but this album full hits , just melodic just many " how he ? " high-wire assemblages melody , rhythm arrangement np delivers . if you like new pornographers , you'll joyous hearing " table , " " mystery drug , " " secretarial " my favorite " town halo . " a.c. newman rapidly becoming most valuable pop artist planet , keeper great tradition pop/rock songwriters nearly died out .	1
i , like other reviewers , stumbled upon this release absolute joy . ( far i know , there virtually no promotion this 2 cd set . ) i immediately bought it , went home , listened whole thing . i not disappointed . set packaged nicely two cd , two hours ' worth music . set always comes nice booklet beautiful pictures sarah during mirrorball tour , it also includes lyrics all included songs , which nice bonus one usually doesn't see concert release . usual , sarah voice stunning . fact , most songs this set completely eclipse studio versions ( " hold " comes mind first ) . there not many live concert cds i actually buy , simply because not every musician sounds good live , but sarah exception all means . it extremely nice now complete concert all 23 tracks . this set definitely worth price admission . sarah fans , this now essential piece your music collection , even casual sarah listeners highly enjoy this concert ( my mom loved it ! ) . one reviewer previously mentioned , most tracks " seamed " together , i too wish ( though it completely personal thing ) they would gone non-seamed approach this set ( most songs sort just blend into next ) , but please note you get hear sarah interact audience share her insights few songs several occasions throughout two cds . all all , get your hands this soon you ; it'll blow your mind away	1

i'm not bts fanatic . i've never followed them around country , looked up anything doug martsch personal life internet , or any other weird , obsessive behavior concerning band . i simply really like their music . i own albums " perfect now " ( their best , imho ) this one . all four fantastic , honestly any them could your favorite . " perfect " lengthy indie/prog rock . " keep it like secret " more loud indie poppish . " ancient melodies " pop , but dry production cool , low-fi feel . finally , " you reverse " all out jam album . bts stays fairly true many their past formulas ; up-tempo , obvious opening track ( going against your mind ) , radio-friendly ballad track 3 ( liar ) , killer lead single elsewhere ( conventional wisdom ) , mellow closer ( wait ) . this regard , it very similar " ancient melodies . " biggest change focus riffs . yes , some those riffs end up sounding like neil young , but remember their version " cortez , killer " live album ? band abvious affinity young , lot their typical sound indebted him , so no big surprise . end , lot sound album pretty similar . if you can't get into it track five , there little hope you'll like rest . but those us who enjoy album , it excellent music . overall : 7 out 10	-1
dylan goes country he it well . this record far too short . good songs here , but not enough them . it seems like you've just put cd player it over . but other than fact there isn't much music here normal dylan cd , i no complaints . dylan fine voice here , sort country , high pitched twang works very nicely . he tells these songs love loss such sincerity , such honesty . but then he attacks everything he way , so it should no surprise . this just wonderful , if bit too short , record	1
" cookie : anthropological mixtape " album released 2002 possibly artist most commercially accessible album . it fused rap soul subjects politics relationships . it also ndegeocello most explicit album . her last album " bitter " cannot compared any way this offering it completely different style music . i respect ndegeocello , she able change her style her own ease successfully make amazing album . 1 . " dead nigga blvd . ( pt . 1) " - great opener album which good message . her voice hard she raps this song . very good . 2 . " hot night " - catchy political song . it sung well ndegeocello raps also good . background music very well . 3 . " interlude : blah blah blah , dyba dyba dyba " - i don't like interludes so this one annoys me . 4 . " priorities 1-6 " - nice song . great opening nice message . 5 . " pocketbook " - i find this song weaker one album but it still great . i just don't understand why it main single because there better tracks album . still it good ( though instrumentation isn't great ! ) . 6 . " berry farms " - great song same sex relationship didn't work out because other girl denying she knew ndegeocello . great , everything great this track . 7 . " trust " - most sexual song i've heard ndegeocello . it good instrumentation ( especially piano ) ndegeocello vocals like silk . beautiful track . 8 . " akel dama ( field blood) " - acts more poem than song . i love it because it very well written makes perfect sense . this writing its best . " truly reborn you would gouge out your eyes cut out your tongue cry like baby thats snatched away . " 9 . " earth " - brilliant song . instruments good touch add song . ndegeocello sounds beautiful . 10 . " better pound " - great . little less serious than last few tracks placed good part album . it sounds quite spacey , like it belongs her next album " comfort woman " but works well here . 11 . " criterion " - good instrumentation but i don't like start where you hear her puffing cigar because it encourages stereotyping kinda lot everyone else . song developes though very beautiful . 12 . " god . fear . money " - great song funky feel it . lyrics so good make you think . 13 . " jabril " - my favourite track album it feels personal beautiful . ndegeocello voice pure easy listen ! lyrics amazing instrumentation great . this song alone worth purchase cd ( though rest cd also excellent ! ) . this could my favourite ndegeocello song overall which saying lot i love all her work . 14 . " dead nigga blvd . ( pt . 2)- not great first part but still very well . 15 . " interlude : 6 legged griot trio ( weariness) " - i'll honest say i've never actually listened this interlude because i usually don't see them worthy ! 16 . " pocketbook ( rockwilder missy elliott remix) " - not good original simple fact redman ruins song . overall i think this brilliant album . i only complain " pocketbook " remix interlude near start ( i can't really complain last one i never listened it ) . other than it nearly perfect album . i can't say its ndegeocello strongest effort all hers so strong none them sound same . i would strongly advise anyone buy this album any ndegeocello . i would advise you all start " peace beyond passion " though this album takes while get into ! mark- 9/10	1

first , i'd like say you don't need into " dark " or goth music love this . how i didn't know dresden dolls before buying this i'll never know . first track this excellent compilation , " coin operated boy " single video their first official release . it excellent take cabaret , dresden dolls often , it funny voice instrumentation excellent . amanda plays just enough form make it sound extremely fresh . me , best song compilation . then there nicki jaine , who i heard , her collaboration projekt black tape mastermind sam rosenthal revue noir . i really want full-length revue noir , second track truly excellent . i think nicki marlene deitrich/dagmar krause ( but not much acquired taste ) natural her style music , her solo track here , " pretty faces " very strong make you want buy her solo album ( which you won't find here , but i think you guess where look ) . next new artist me jill tracy . she amazing voice . there few almost too-typical goth ( or really dark cabaret ) lyrics , but somehow she pulls it off . hearing this song enough make me want her cd . i'd also never heard katzenjammer kabarett , i'm not sure if they full length yet . but they should , because their track simply great . they alter female vocalist voice , but only so it sounds distant , or maybe voice past . she sings very well , instrumentation definitely cabaret , though it somehow dark playful both . audra i'm familiar , i've never huge fan . first jarring part this male voice , altered very audra way ( though radio or just enough fuzz make you wonder where he coming ) . first take , i thought they should left this off album , but it really catches your mind . i'm not sure i'll buying audra album soon , but if someone plays me one good this track , i could wrong . just bit more beat , bit more electronics , male voice , track comes right time break up album keep it going . female vocals pretty balanced seem echo almost empty cabaret , piano work perfect song . she tends start quiet occasionally build stronger sound , so you listen closely . i'd never heard them either , but i think i need little more exposure . i hope sam , who i adore , won't too unhappy my next statement . sound this black tape mix great , admittedly , but lyric " knock three times your coffin if you want my love " just turned me off . it comes across catchy way , but lyrics whole seem too cliche . male voice great instrumental song well placed order , i'll say . this coming devout black tape fan , so you should just see this nit-picking , probably . not their best song . next track , brides , adds some different instrumentation without going into electronic world ( i think ) , woman voice fits this album . i wouldn't say it one my favorites , but again , it well-placed , you won't skip over it . quite frankly , i'd given up rozz williams quite while ago . but this sparse song , actually moving well-modulated voice simple piano , pretty damn good . coming near end , again , well-placed . thoushaltnot track , male vocalist , definitely weimar style cabaret poisonous tone . it ends album well , though if you this cd your car or auto-repeat let it go back incredible " coin operated boy , " i think you'll happier . all all , price this album one all time bargains . you may not familiar single artist here yet you'll love it want three or four albums people here . production excellent , artwork beautiful cabaret temptress perfect , i can't recommend this any more highly than i , which basically , buy it , you won't disappointed . probably projekt best sampler ever , if you're familiar them i am , that saying lot . i hope " dark cabaret " becomes term becomes genre , because it would make me very happy	1

dark , moody film , lots physical action , most definately music . kind music if you like meatloaf - strong , bold , out there operetic rock . best part movie watching diane lane lip sync strong vocals , dance just look sexy . this movie given positive feature write up " time " magazine when it reviewed unfortunately poorly box office . don't know why movie actually story line , great bad guy , beautiful girl , strong leading man , some great music tracks .	-1
this one best examples music produced west coast latter half 60 . unlike so many other " psych " albums this one holds together superbly - every track merit . songs wide range diversity - rocking " somebody love " , country " my best friend " , raucous " 3/5 mile " , acid laden " white rabbit " haunting tracks " today " " comin ' back me " . musicianship excellent singers both solo harmony work great effect - what voice grace slick this album . if you interest music want add classic album your collection then you could lot worse than buy this one	1
almost long i've listened arch enemy latest studio album , _anthems rebellion_ , song " dead eyes see no future " my favorite piece band . fierce rhythms drumming ( one daniel erlandsson best performances , i think ) , grim vocals ( i still can't get over how effective angela gossow voice , knowing it belongs woman ! ) , one most amazing guitar riffs i've ever heard my entire life ( bridge , when michael amott soloing ) , all only few things i like song . so when i heard it going lead track ep release , i course psyched . granted , ep seemed like it'd something only hardcore arch enemy fans ( myself included ) would want go out their way get , but when i received this christmas 2005 , i no idea it would this good . after title track , there three live performances " burning angel " ( my immediate second-favorite song arch enemy - i usually don't pick favorites ) , " we rise , " " heart darkness , " recorded during paris leg their _anthems_ tour . live performances definitely seem better setting angela . her voice deeper , harsher , more menacing , not mention she uses ( or least these songs , used ) lot more range her voice . this only bodes well naysayers who whine angela not right voice death metal - just wait until they release album , she'll no doubt real monster ! then there song covers . starting them off megadeth " symphony destruction . " i've fan megadeth few years now , when i heard this song going covered arch enemy , i nearly fainted . like any good cover should like , it retains much original song message overall vibe , but adds it ; arch enemy guitars add crushing brutality now-famous riffs created great dave mustaine . drumming overpowering , course , angela voice simply scary . she follows original song vocal patterns well , too - this obvious when she pronounces " acting like robot " " mrracting like robot , " just like how mustaine . i'm not familiar band manowar , so i can't really judge cover their track " kill power , " but nonetheless stands well arch enemy song . " incarnated solvent abuse " cover song grindcore heroes melodeath forefathers carcass . because michael amott used play guitar band , it makes cover interesting nostalgic tribute . finally , there video track " we rise " included multimedia section cd . considering cheap price , this album far more than average ep . i'd recommend it anyone looking get into gossow-era arch enemy , well any fan band . it quite treat	1

butthole surfersin 1983 surfers born their debut ep . record starts off delightfully vulgar song shah sleeps lee harvys grave . it then takes 180 degree turn entertaining hey , followed butthole classic " something " , song apparently gibby hanyes(singer ) how he gonna get back his girlfriend ( violently ) . now before gibby invented gibbytronix , he would play saxophone certain songs , like something bar pope . next song wichita cathedral probably my least favorite song record , its basically gibby rambling how he got drunk wichita . now i tell you now any dead kennedys fan would like next song suicide , very punk . ep then closes revenge anus presley . it easily my favorite song whole album . whether its fear or humor you seeking this song get job . it actually starts out gibby speaking tongues . now if one play it backwards we would hear part " shah " when gibby yells " there time live time die , i smoke elvis presley toenails , when i wanna get high . this ep goes several names such " brown reason live " , pee pee sailor(thats actually name or drawing cd ) butthole surfers . last actually right one . live pcppepin 1984 , surfers released live follow up self title . it starts gibby saxophone cowboy bob , tune later appear " sac " . it then continues better version bar pope , its better cause gibby rambling several things chorus verse . next song simply puzzles me . dance cobras simply paul fooling his guitar weird snake noises background , total 34 seconds . it never appears later albums only found here , so what it ? it just . nothing . we then hear hilarious version shah sleeps lee harvey grave . halfway through song speakers give out few seconds one side concert . we then given idea kind crappy conditions surfers " enjoy " . end we hear gibby audience telling each other shut up . then we hear live versions wichita cathedral , hey something , all excellent . bonus tracks !!!! if 2 ep not sweet enough , surfers added 2 song encore , which consists gary floyd-another song appear ' sac ' matchstick . before gary floyd starts we subject hilarious plead gibby audience , come up butthole , butthole chant . then we track sinister crayon , which put vinyl version humpty dumpty lsd contains saxophone . album closes demo version something . song actually becomes little tiresome when you hear it third time one cd , but it great , none less . this great cd surfers should every fan collection , unless you only heard electric larryland weird revolution , then i would suggest going into some other stuff first	1

first all i would like thank all people wrote review said nj suck . well guess again . also if you not like this type music then not even bother writing review . now greatness this band . josh vocalist this band amazing . if you like what he offer check out his new band chariot they sick well . this band starts cd they enter drums . they just then let nature take them ride . until monsters come out shadow bass guitars . it brings me into world everything blens into forest beauty warmth . then music gets its peek forest getting distroyed lead pouchers kill all animals it . when there no hope , just when you think it useless fight against them there light pretty much what this cd means says me i listen this band . how much i love them so this one greatest cds ever whole intire world . end when entire world depends you when you face face shadow when memphis laid waste when you create somethind out nothing only destroy it . when something going happen , you get message shotgun make mistakes get ideas hating cellphones only hate car accidents . when dead men women stand air realize how devine human face only then you organized beyond recognition . thankyou goodnight	1
this album , spite leaning heavily towards pop side countrypop , produced sung simple manner , which gives it breezy , effortless feel makes it very comfortable listen without lightweight silly . it`s perfect popcountry album all ages all occasions , filled sing-along choruses infecteous hooks . this , my humble (?) opinion , best martina mcbride album date , precious gem which i never grow tired	1
carolyn dawn johnson now household name canada , where she picked up various industry awards , many hit singles this album . songs personal ring true many people like me . previously she wrote hit song chely wright , her breakthorough 1999 hit quot ; single white femalequot ; . album first single quot ; georgiaquot ; , nice ballad strong vocals memorable hook . quot ; complicatedquot ; one biggest hits album , song explained complication love relationships so well . quot ; i don't want you goquot ; also considerably big hit , its catchy chorus immediately recognizable hook . quot ; you arequot ; single canada , song i not care first but its nice pleasant ballad . quot ; one day closer youquot ; also single , nice uptempo song one day closer finding love special person . there some really beautiful songs here , like title track which sad , dedicated her brother who passed . quot ; masterpiecequot ; song family carolyn knew who faced adversity conquered love . there some other reflective songs relationships like quot ; love always worth achequot ; quot ; just girlquot ; . overall very strong debut , i can't wait her second album	1

this cd isn't bad .... its just too predictable most mariah jingles . " never too far " best track my opinion	-1
past never really into thrice due my intense hatred anything whiney . this changed immediately i came upon their performance " earth shake " youtube - one best live videos i've seen lately . not many bands evolve progress this fast their entire careers , let alone one album next . throw out some comparisons you never hear anywhere else : mix tightness rush , snazzy guitar licks drive , beautiful atmosphere u2 or coldplay xy , great , important hardcore cave in " until your heart stops " mature lyrics take themselves seriously without overly pretentious . wow , i like this . some really good production , too . actually , only qualm i this record it so polished some ( just one or two ) parts almost sound like backstreet boys ....	1
times change - what goes out style often very subjective period time we . while tom always maintain core legion fans - if you go back late 1970s early 1980s mention name tom jones , you probably would laughed . however if you went back 1960s , tom jones extremely devoted following . same time , it also seems tom jones somehow gone through renaissance 2000s . people now getting into tom jones again . it not like there this great 1960s cultural renewal - it just tom jones music suddenly come today . although this shot dark , one reason why i think there renewed interest tom jones because success " austin powers " movies . whatever it , when i hear sounds music austin powers - it immediately reminds me tom music . one collection snapshot tom work late 1960s early 1970s collection , " best tom jones " . i think there several reasons why tom jones still appeal 21st century . main reason tom unique baritone voice . tom vocals some strongest music business . whether its pop , dance - or even country techno , tom always found ability adapt his style many different music variants . tom music also some very interesting sounds . one reason i think " austin powers " because tom music movie music almost psychedelic " pop sound " . finally , i think tom strength live performer really helped solidify his appeal . tom somewhat gregarious style stage made him one most frequent recipients women undergarments stage - even today . " best tom jones " pretty good job content collection . it includes 21 classic tracks 1965 through 1974 also includes tom 1989 remake prince " kiss " . i prefer my greatest hits collections chronological order - this allows me see how artist progressed over time . most part ( few exceptions ) , " best tom jones " comes pretty close going chronological order . one example this " puppet man " released " she lady " album , yet it included after songs like " letter lucille " " young new mexican puppeteer " released after " puppet man " . but most part , you get sense how tom progressed . far tom jones collections go , there most certainly no shortage greatest hits collections . here some more popular ones : - " 20th century masters - millennium collection : best tom jones " : this only contains 12 tracks . all twelve these tracks included " best tom jones " . this not chronological order . - " gold " : this more comprehensive collection tom hits . this two-cd collection containing 42 songs . it doesn't include remake " kiss " . it also missing " chills fever " " somethin bout you baby i like " . - " reloaded : greatest hits " : collection 19 tom hits include duets contemporary artists . - " definitive tom jones 1964-2002 " : this most comprehensive tom jones collection out there . this boxed set includes 93 tracks . this contains all songs " best tom jones " exception " somethin bout you baby i like " . - " complete tom jones " : this older collection contains 20 tracks . all songs this collection exception " move closer " included " best tom jones " . overall , while i still know there more comprehensive collections than " best tom jones " , most part i pleased . collection offers some classic tom jones ' tunes such " it not unusual " " she lady " ( latter my favorite tom song ) . this collection one few feature song " somethin bout you baby i like " . although tom some " country " albums 1980s , this particular song demonstrated tom could actually adapt country-music style . i also pleased inclusion " young new mexican puppeteer " - guy wales , this song sure terrific tex-mex flair it . despite inclusion " kiss " , i'm bit disappointed some more tom covers not included - most notably , i would liked see few tom live cuts included . liner notes this collection mixed bag . positive side , there terrific 2-panel write-up listed " extract legend tom jones volume 1 " this write-up basically chronicles early part tom career . i found this very informative . negative side , there little way credits . you aren't told when songs released , you aren't told studio musicians , songwriting credits , what albums songs . there also no lyrics - but greatest hits collections , it typical they not included . overall , i'd look see what best value you get your money terms selecting tom jones compilation . based this , you still may want look " gold " or " definite tom jones " boxed set . however , this collection still stands solid its own tom jones compilation . it great job capturing tom peak period - highly recommended	-1

put it lightly , this one most devastating funk albums all time . changes tempo mood , played feeling groove . this album should mandatory every american , it should given each citizen their 18th birthday ! presidential debates should include cut-by-cut commentary what politicials feel this album	1
i checked this cd out library i'm so glad i before wasting my money this . miss saigon terrible story full phony emotions static , unsatisfying score . music lacks variety forgettable ( other words , many songs sound same ) . story cliche romeo-and-juliet type " star-crossed lovers " who go through so much when they hardly even know each other . top it , singing isn't good . i cannot comprehend why everyone so fascinated lea salonga . her voice so weak , she tries hard sound strong , but it just doesn't sound good . i never liked jonathan pryce his more-talk-than-sing- voice , but role engineer should more gut strength . simon bowman sounds like classically-trained singer trying sing pop style . two styles completely different should not mixed because , well , it just sounds bad . claire moore peter polycarpou only two performers who demonstrate great vocal ability . however , their roles aren't big kim , engineer , or chris , so even they couldn't save this doomed album . i know this show huge success many people love it , but it just tries too hard reach emotional depth it just fails so many levels .	-1
man oh man , definetly classic times . i am hip hop head listening rap since before many my friends kissing girls . this cd reigns top my lists . it fact this some most classic west coast material ever . all tupac material classic material i over 2 gigs his music my laptop i never skip his songs . don't get it twisted , all eyez me thugged out party ridah bumper , me against world lonely ambitious 2pac , but this cd shows something world never seen before . first all changing his alias makaveli raises many questions . he bringing new deepness meaning his music . he actually incorporating political messages calling all his listeners action demand change . jada right , if 2pac still alive , even if biggie killed 2pac lived , all these wack fools today rap game would asking , you want fries ? haha i love it because it just too true . every track this cd cut . majority songs absolute best beats i ever heard , but 2pacs lyrical ability makes even decent beat tracks classical rap material . early mid 1990 golden era rap hip-hop . this brought terrible end killings 2 kings ( we all know who ) . when i listen this cd , i feel though i am listening person who alsmot super-human , which why i refer 2pac miracle man . only thug this stature could brought such ugly end . go see ressurection you understand what i mean . this cat not know how make bad song . just remeber when you hear 2pac rapping rhyming , you listening higher power coming through human form . if this cd came out instead all eyez me when pac out prison , i would sold even more than all eyez , but just how story go . book like bible could written this man his ideology . but enough ho hum got out get this damn thing !	1
forget history , background , drama , analysis , this music smokes . it groves , it burns , it makes you want dance , it makes you want listen , it provides heat , light , electricity too . two bands smoking . this hotest straight ahead head arrangement swing either group played period . this what makes bands which otherwise overly arranged precision units time this cd made , smoke . production values these tracks must quite low : get two bands studio , get minimum number tracks going , find some tunes blues based standard progressions , let rhythm sections bounce , let soloists rip . rip , rip rip rip away they , it takes long time listening figure out who who what what , time you dont care . you just want beat go , bands keep wailing you don't care whether it count basie duke ellington , or frosty snowman . i am not much new testament or ellington 1960s but you need this groove	-1
" older " may album his gets lost mix , but if you're fan his any way , it well worth listen . despite taking six years release , it typical george michael , therefore wonderful . included upbeat songs like " fastlove " " star people " , well slower moving ones such " you loved " " jesus child " . i also enjoy " strangest thing " " forgiven " . even though george star 20 years now , i still feel he slightly underrated artist . each album his leaves me impressed . if this album doesn't hook you right away , give it try sometime , perhaps when you're " older " .	-1
this great rock-blues album , unique guitar sound touching melodies , you must open minded love it . if you love old blues records you're looking stone blues - it probably not one you , but if you open minded you like crunchy rock sound , you love this cd . it reminded me sprinsteen rock sound but much more blues into it .	1

failte ! ( greetings)my favorite danu recording their dvd , " one night stand . " i would wholeheartedly give it six out five stars one finest offerings ever genre traditional irish music . it recording performance front very live audience , including friends , clan family . this must dvd if this your genre music , dervish " live johnny fox " " midsummer night session , " chieftain " water well , " ( old crew ) solas ' " live " concert recording . several stronger tracks this album dvd . this album well worth price cd play when you don't access dvd player sake those strong tracks , some which danu polished off through hundreds performances their own signature pieces ( macahill medley , reel gan aim , top it off , fairy reel medley ) . lovely presence voice muireann nic amhranai new when this album first cut 2003 . while she offers very strong tracks here any normal standard , her performance ( bouzouki , large mandolin , guitar back up ) much stronger 2006 dvd . " farewell , farewell " beautiful piece this cd not dvd . " beannacht o ri haoine " ( blessings king friday , meaning tgif type fridays pub ) much stronger offering dvd gorgeous bouzouki lead . similarly " county down " great cd but stronger excellent dvd bouzouki lead . i would also say donnchadh gough much stronger both irish drum ( bodhran ) ulienne ( elbow bellows ) bagpipes dvd . macahill reel medley chosen start off number one track cd when played concert big man ripping through very fast paced reel hair flying bouncing his chair . finally there need mention 5 tracks unique this cd only well worth listening . all normal standards , this very good cd worth 5 stars . measuring 2003 danu against 2006 danu ( worth 6 stars )) however , leads respect those three years young band accepting new band member developing strong friendship chemistry over past three years one polished , best bands now setting standard traditional irish music . slainte !

even return rys , there probably not tactical nueral implant . but tech changed , people change , doing somethings over over get old . change good . civilization we come away something bit more rediemable than epitath . first three tracks seem taste what we remember primal days industrial music , something kinda hard gritty , but after fifth track , album slips into ambience coma . stuff should probably side project perhaps . i suppose i still miss days i first got into fla , listened them while playing original " quake .

vangelis released many fascinating albums over years but many ways he never topped this unique electronic score ridley scott blade runner . it unfortunate musician talented vangelis sometimes lumped into eternally derided category " new age " music because vangelis so much more than many hacks who inhabit new age domain . vangelis magician synth-textures instance his melodic gifts quite rare . almost all tracks here great , atmospheric energetic , man it all . this music makes film better it course stands it own quite magnificiently , which what every film composer strives create . vangelis much more than just film composer but it interesting he achieves much his best work working various films blade runner probably best particular category . tiny asking price , there no way blade runner soundtrack should missing your collection . if you crave more this melodically inclined electronic master , check out his albums , " opera sauvage " " direct "	1

during first several years 80 teena marie seldom made musical misstep . her four albums preceeded this brilliant but all failed cross over pop audience-'starchild ' . one big reason might dancable opener " lovergirl " , her biggest hit song most people associate her . musically this album very much follow up ' robbery ' minus loose concept plus more concerted effort write songs tuneful pop oriented . one thing seperates ' starchild ' rest teena maries catalog up until this point complete lack jazz latin musical references . all music this recording either soul ballads , funk or dance-pop . case ' beat crazy ' " help youngblood get freaky party " brilliant " jammin " rap hip-hop musical base . " alibi ' similar structure big hit-something often happens pop albums . it two ballads i believe album almost becomes too predictable . both nearly identicle structure while " we've got stop ( meeting like this ) " make some excellent lyrical points long distance relationships music doesn't really achieve transcendance . title cut superb slice mid 80 funk far most grooving ' song ' album . " my dear mr. gaye " very interesting tribute . first her cosmic lyric matched ( again)to dull sounding ballad . then midway through song structure changes mimic marvin gaye own ' what going ' era sound tribute becomes more obvious . final cut brief gospel piano reference . while ' starchild ' emphasizes smooth rb doesn't any more exotic musical features teena marie previously accociated album find artist place showing her ability remain true her art while accesible broader pop audience . since this also her biggest selling release she certainly succeeded . even though longtime fan her early music might find this polished recording something shock , everyone else this probably this album most fully explores her grasp pop , rb , funk soul great first place get introduction teena marie music	1

it always strange me hear reproductions work where original needs no improvement . i tremendous respect these musicians , yes , they play some great solos over changes , but album basically just recreation tracks excellent vince guaraldi trio records . my personal favorite " linus tells charlie " which features some very sensitive trumpet chris botti , but otherwise this records just little off , i find myself listening only originals these days . original band vince piano just grooves better , although recording perspective sonically slightly inferior ( they probably mixing tv ) something those original performances seem more emotional ... it just nostalgia ? if you looking some fantastic recreations old tv music ( e.g. little rascals , looney tunes , etc ... ) newer bands , check out beau hunks ' material . superb playing excellent attention classic details nuances original scores	-1

even though this release butthole surfers my personal favorite their entire repertoire , i've heard some older fans comment they didn't care it much . ' electric ...

there some very nice tunes here great riffs licks learn if youre guitarist . you tell jimmy page eric clapton ate this stuff up ! unfortunately , his vocals often distorted . seems if no one else really seems matter , so take my review grain sal t.t hese recordings made 50 years ago dont sound bad any means , but thats why it got 4 stars only . i realize they may not too many resources use recourding these tracks back 1956 , but this probably fault engineer . distorted guitar work if thats what youre going , but when vocals distorting then its time turn down level ! otis rush sounds great here though ... i cant recommend something else sounds better - so go ahead pick this up . dont expect super high fidelity though	-1

nick cave powerful artist who not afraid take risk . working bands like current 93 , he proven himself both experimental versatile artist . but i think he might somewhat imposing musical force ( this good thing fans ! ) . staying just out limelight , though he certainly welcome within it , nick cave music dark beautiful . i think this album introduces his material well not simple providing timeline but mix material several albums no regard release date . this great first album get into nick cave great compilation hardened nick cave fan . best part this album it each song very listenable approachable . " red right hand " " carny " " her eternity " tracks all really diverse yet flow very well album . sounds dark , dynamic cool but each great energy strong emotion . overall i think this album well worth money . it one best " best " albums i experienced not just tracks individuals but great artistry which songs arranged . if you want get first nick cave album this one if you all studio albums get this well you enjoy it great car album or pre-made compilation caves work . -- ted muren	1

although this still best turntable album date , it doesn't quite demonstrate just how good m.m.m. . he could probably put out album almost good one live performance . if you've seen him live , you know what i mean . nonetheless , most songs interesting first listen , seem improve subsequent inspection . first half far superior second ... there kind deterioration into simple bass-bumping ( perfect all you bazooka tube/rockford fosgate types ) . all all , well worth money . if you want smooth mood music , stick dj shadow . if you want strapped slab vinyl chucked into space , pick up anti-theft device	-1

its easy see where mastodon gotten their elevated status above most modern metal acts ; cleverly woven hooks , plenty diversity never over-done , ear devastating heaviness , mastodon ' remission ' fits perfectly genious their later efforts . besides putting extremely intense live show , mastodon offer relentless barrage originality served side dish extra-heavy grooves all their releases , including ' remission ' . ' march fire ants ' first song i ever heard these guys , relapse records compilation ' contaminated vol . 5 ' , needless say , i thouroughly attracted songs intricate structure heaviness , accompanied deep , crunchy distortion this album potrays . entire album chock filled songs vary beautifully each other , but not so much give this album too diverse feel . this , after all , heavy metal . all heavy , all gut wrenching groove strictly mastodon . if you loved ' levathian ' , and/or ' blood mountian ' then you damn well better get this .	1

fascinating , beautiful moving music kronos quartet rock band mogwai . i played this cd all day yesterday , i am listening it now 6:18 am morning before work . how describe it ? little like ambient music , only played acoustic instruments rather than synthesizers , not i would objected if it all electronically . moody spaceous music . best soundtrack i've heard since princess mononoke	1
pandora.com served viers ' galaxies my station modelled music kate bush . while viers not belong bush camp , i am really pleased pandora introduced us . she remarkable writer/instrumentalist/vocalist playful , upbeat vibe once fresh strangely familiar . three cuts instant classics which , if you buying music long i [ egad , am i really 42 ? ] you appreciate what feat itself . if you like " folk " musicians such suzanne vega and/or erin mckeown you really like laura viers . highly recommended	1
long time fan sp nearly decade now , i really never found anything interesting band after 94 " process . " even when " greater wrong right " released ... mind you i believe every artist message any material they release , but after hearing clips " mythmaker " i knew i needed own it- any cost ! sp taken their music back their roots added twist . i've heard some negative remarks " mythmaker " especially hook , " jessus wants ugly " too repetetive or annoying , but since when industrial music ever supposed pleasant anyway ? anyone saying anything bad this album clearly needs re-think mass produced crap music industry puts out today or just hit button any radio tune into any station see what annoying or repetetive really means	1
paul oakenfold got his start record producer dj , but this album he gained true worldwide attention . heck , who didn't hear great song " starry-eyed surprise " booming out their radio ? well , i loved song , so i get hold album . album itself mixed bag all sorts different sounding tunes . there frenetic " ready steady go " , soulful " southern sun " , languid " zoo york " , lot more . only track i cannot understand them adding " nixon spirit " . i mean , who wants dance some guy droning voice ? but , said this great album , lot really interesting tunes . i love this album , highly recommend it !	-1
100 reviews here , i debated putting up my two cents , but since it top album my desert island list , my favorite album all time , here goes , i'll brief : where poetry music enmesh , becoming one : chilly desolate , spatial luminous , aural landscape ice endless highways painted words nomadic , romantic dreamer rich , layered melodies , brilliantly underpinned driving rhythms jaco pastorius ' fretless electric bass , this crowning achievement career filled greatness . my favorite lines come title song : " i'm porous travel fever but you know i'm so glad my ownstill sometimes slightest touch strangercan set up trembling my bonesi know -- no one going show me everythingwe all come go unknowneach so deep superficialbetween forceps stone " joni mitchell best this album her best best ! ten stars !!!	1
mack 10 good rapper , but he definitely poser . i'm sure he hustled when he still living inglewood , but doesn't make him special . there three really good songs this album . first quot ; ghetto horror show , quot ; which mack 10 , jayo felony , ice cube compare street life horror movie . cube kills mack this track , though , he album second good song quot ; should i stay or should i go ? quot ; this track very unique mack 10 because it cover clash punk rock classic , it features korn . still , quot ; letterquot ; greatest song mack ever written . this only song entire album no guest lyricists , mack actually sounds like he passionate topic instead just trying cool . album cover brilliant , but album itself doesn't display very much genius	-1
this album acceptably faithful first three , not easy level achieve . rusty hyperness not here kick this thing into overdrive where they used play , but it comes close enough able suddenly turn around look cd cover positioned top turntable other side room when disc playing say aloud , " holy #### , it cactus ! " " day night , " " electric blue , " " jazzed " especially reminescent old style . kunes very good singer fits well . pratt harp helps maintain cactus flavor . only thing this album needed cover something out old blues canon somebody like willie dixon , howlin ' wolf , elmore james , etc ., list endless . " brother bill " " evil " superb renditions , covering one or two would probably put this album over top . i like " blues mr. day " because i make up lyrics sing them it while i'm cooking breakfast or whatever run them past rusty my head . " i up this mornin ' , rockin ' ri-i-sin ' sun . " buy this album	1

teena marie 1986 album quot ; emerald cityquot ; caused critics fans alike scratch their heads confusion . teena yesteryear , rick james protoge , soulful powerhouse behind heart-on-your-sleeve balladry like quot ;d ear loverquot ; seemed taken vacation release quot ; emerald city . quot ; here teena marie whipped her voice around driving funk quot ; lips find u , quot ; who head-banged conviction hard rock singer quot ; you so heavy , quot ; who evoked images torch singer days gone quot ; sunny skies . quot ; quot ; emerald city , quot ; featuring poem chronicling emotions character , quot ; pity , quot ; through theros misunderstood , ( not mention dark cover image teena guitar surrounded eerie green backdrop ) , both hinted this album going something else . it . while not commercially successful previous work , quot ; emerald cityquot ; featured quot ; ivory queen soulquot ; making album , she said interviews , herself . music , bit dependent mid-80 synth production , sound little dated . even so , what makes these cuts memorable way teena sings them : conviction , sass , style . she wraps her vocals around atmospheric , hypnotic quot ; shangri-la , quot ; or scats her way through delicious lyricism quot ; sunny skies , quot ; teena marie deftly showcases her musical tastes excelles each genre she shares listener . quot ; batucada suite , quot ; breathless romp into latin music african percussion , features teena evoking musical heritages many lands , last proclaiming quot ; jesus music heaven-sent , remind us what went . quot ; ( this just goes show teena knack wordplay coupled intense musicality still remains her biggest strength ) . teena writes her own lyrics , she get away such word puzzles , not mention her writing far outshines quot ; baby i love youquot ; same-ness her contemporaries . whole , album runs gamut marie musical influences , ranging psychadelic-stylings title track , familiar funk quot ; once not enoughquot ; quot ; lips find u , quot ; brooding surprise quot ; you so heavy , quot ; spanish-style quot ; batucada suite , quot ; what arguably teena biggest musical strength , jazz ballad quot ; sunny skies , quot ; which lyrically brilliant features saxaphone work bradford marsalias . though underrated , this album worth listening , not once ( you'll think it wierd ) but over over ( you'll find it creative , inspired musical journey through one soul music most talented interpreters ) . intense , surprising , soulful , inspired : quot ; emerald cityquot ; showcases teena marie far-reaching musical scope , illustrating she remains artist true sense word	1

reviews i read ( not all ) , i not see mention what excellent job columbia remastering . i owned lp when it first issued it lifelong favorite ; so it very pleasant surprise hear how much sound improved this release . ( whole series recent columbia remasterings excellent . ) legendary performance ? oh yeahhh , missing voice america tape , philly jo jones driving band ( apocryphally ) rolled up newspaper , dancing blonde black dress who got crowd their feet roaring during gonsalves solo . time cover , renaissance band . performance easily supports weight legends ... format this release , complete studio recordings appended , very interesting ; it corrects completes historical record . it good hear studio recordings , now seeming oversmooth plump , comparison real thing . i consider it essential recording .	1

released 1974 , this grateful dead eight studio album 12th album release overall . original cd 44 minutes long but bonus material gets it up close 80 minutes . like all remastered grateful dead cd , sound quality excellent . it enhanced hdcd sound . i just bought cd player hdcd decoder , this sounds stunning . hdcd 24 bit recording vs . normal 16 bit regular cd . it played back normal cd player , sounds better than normal cd . but , you get best improvement if you cd player hdcd . like all remastered grateful dead cd , this bonus material take it up 80 minutes . quality bonus material hit miss . instance , it poor american beauty . blues allah , bonus material compliments original music enhances whole disc . if there any doubts before , bonus material , this definitely five star disc . i also like there approximately 10 second gap original bonus material , seperate two . this comes nice cardboard case , unlike most cardboard cases , plastic tabs hold cd sturdy not snap off . this part second boxset remastered dead cd . unlike first set , this cd not booklet extensive liner notes . extensive info cd contained book comes boxset , but not available if you buy individual cd . blues allah complex work really flows together start finish . although there seperate distinct songs , it all plays like one long suite . bonus material mostly instrumentals follows same music flow . this terrapin station dead foray into quasi progress rock style . but , same time , it mellow but bright sounding atmosphere , similar wake flood . after this album recorded , band went great american music hall san francisco played live show included all songs this album . it captured double cd , one vault . unlike what said , i don't think live version good this tight wonderfully recorded studio version . also , i heard other live versions blues allah really spacy go hour . i would like official cd release one those shows	1

i don't know what branford trying . it like he taking two steps backward into quot;let never leave distant pastquot ; territory his brother wynton , like he abandoning all artistic progress he made building past stuff like dark keys incredible footsteps our fathers ( check out resolution ) . it not it bad cd , but branford , it awful cd . fans disappointed , but newcomers only misled	-1

those who read 3 most recent reviews i posted - i flatter myself think anyone - it may appear i am some sort kinks kick . this true , but it not first such kick i . my curiousity subsequent fascination kinks first occurred 1999 . i immersed myself all music guide rock , i found many bands i knew very popular apparently released some very good albums i never heard . since i bit anglophile anyway , i decided begin expansion my musical horizons something else kinks . put it mildly , i impressed . my kinks collection quickly included all four band late 60s masterpieces . i read more reviews got know fellow fans , i realized many particular fondness 1968 record kinks village green preservation society . while i very pleased meet like-minded folks , i never thought vgps my personal favorite . i bigger fan something else arthur . i still am , but isn't say i don't love village green . i . it great unique album worthy its reputation . even though i am not fond it most fans , it good know it more listeners result reverence it received . vgps less concept album than arthur , but it strong song cycle all same . it holds together like illustrated anthology children stories . opening title track introduces album like greek chorus , setting presented picturesque songs " blue sky " , " sitting riverside " , " animal farm " , " village green " . diverse cast denizens pop up songs like peaked-in-high school tale " you remember walter ? " , soon inspire real-life punk rocker " johnny thunder " , " phenomenal cat " , " monica " , dave davies-sung " wicked annabella " , which introduces this idyllic village sinister element . finally , although it doesn't fit perfectly into record overall scheme , " all my friends there " one best songs here , expert bit songwriting ray davies . one must careful assessing davies ' fondness things past . while times it sincere , it other times ironic . after all , he only 24 when album released . ( isn't it also bit strange " picture book " recently used commercial promoting cutting-edge technology ? ) although it surely harmless time , lyrics like " we sherlock holmes english-speaking vernacular " might sound almost xenophobic some contemporary american ears , especially right-wingers like pat buchanan supporting idea english should america official language . perfectly honest , his nostalgia gets teensy bit tiresome certain parts record . after all , if village like he describes this record actually exists , surely it somewhere , then he must aware past always survive some form or , even if it gets psychologically further geographically farther away . but this very little subtract overall quality vgps , whose songs uniformly strong personal , which unique treasure start finish . ( unlike other kinks albums re-issued only handful excellent bonus tracks , vgps undergone extensive re-issuing . 2000 version presents 15-track album mono form , 12-track stereo version record it originally set released . mono version sounds bit muffled , while stereo version excludes few tracks , it also features two different ones : " mr. songbird " " days " , ray greatest compositions . apart these two treats , it difficult enthusiastically endorse this re-issue . depending one level interest , original 1968 version may preferrable . then again , if one simply cannot get enough vgps , there 2004 3-cd deluxe edition . fact this only kinks record receive such treatment further confirmation its enduring stature . )	-1
though it may not essential buy , this ep real treat die hard fans . ep begins single edit trigger . its shortened tad album version . track 2 where it gets good watch them feed , which rip roaring hard track . real gem track 3 which cover genesis land confusion . i curious how cover would sound my surprise it really good . some fans no doubt hate it but i dug it . after we get some really pointless remixes cloud connected moonshield . basically your gonna buy this ep two tracks , watch them feed land connfusion . fans like me , its worth every penny	-1

token ' idol ' singles like tradition , which each season singles cheesier than last . unfortunately bo , probably most ridiculous ' idol ' single given him carrie : ' inside your heaven . ' though lyrics don't make sense , i not only enjoy bo rendition but i prefer it carrie ( this coming carrie fan ) . 1 ) ' inside your heaven ' - 7/10 - although it nice sound it , lyrics so nonsensical song loses all potential classic . bo vocals pretty good , yet that probably it positives . 2 ) ' vehicle ' - 6.5 /10 - yes , bo moreso his element this track , but it still isn't great . not great , but still listenable . it sad what ' idol ' producers him trying make him something he not . you dress monkey up human clothes , but end day it still monkey . said , bo best he material provided i only hope he escapes grasp clive crew so he taken seriously	-1

greg brown heartland troubador , both literally metaphorically . based southeast iowa where he grew up , greg strong , deep voice sanity world gone mad . evening call powerful set 12 new songs , featuring brown gravelly baritone , acoustic guitar harmonica reliable accompaniment bo ramsey electric guitar ( plus bass , drums keyboards ) . if you've followed greg brown over years , you recognized his trajectory toward slower lower , closer earth , closer bone , closer heart , closer what real important . evening call takes us closest yet , grounding us earthy love matters soul , face rampant materialism our spiritually sick society world . four songs stand out consistently strong set -- " cold dark wet " downside , hell lovelessness . " bucket " sweet upside , one most perfect greg many songs . " kokomo " raunchy cautionary tale succumbing worldly temptations . " whippoorwill " sings love devotion . only number doesn't it me " eugene , " which isn't song , but rather spoken-word rambling ode camping fishing across us . greg takes his stand realm everday life , rooted here now . he all too aware wider world evidenced " treat each other right , " refrain " we got so evil , i feel troubled tonight . this old world brought us all here , so why can't we treat other right . " song concludes this thought -- " ... i'd say we all better pray each other forgiveness before we all lose our sanity . " amen , greg ! thanks .	1

i won't use this space review incredible music john coltrane quartet . completely unnecessary ! some reviewers commentators dislike presentation pieces order their recording rather than organized albums . i think this minor quibble , especially considering transition lp-era cd-era already " mixed things up " considerably . example , modern cd issue album " transition " drops " dear lord " adds two pieces " kulu se mama . " " dear lord " shows up " dear old stockholm , " which not ' 60s coltrane album . " living space " -- current cd -- not exist then . some coltrane pieces ( " vilia " " dear old stockholm " ) released contemporary albums featuring numerous artists ( " definitive jazz scene , vols 1 , 2 3 " ) . posthumous albums " mastery john coltrane , volumes 1 2 " not all appear cd -- pieces diverted other cds . so , putting his works recording order makes sense me . few albums , such " sun ship , " quartet version " meditations " " love supreme , " appear this collection all tracks together . if you ipod mac , you " recreate " original albums , proper track order . boxed set limited studio recordings performed classic quartet ( few minor allowances drums bass ) , thus two pieces " impressions " missing -- you find them complete 1961 village vanguard set -- only two pieces " live birdland " included , example " alabama . " i wish they made exception included title track album " kulu se mama , " thus bringing album completely into this set . i agree it shame album covers original liner notes missing . i am glad i " love supreme " cd separately .	1
very raw . although similar later beth hart , songwriting isn't complex , nor songs jump you make you remember them . exception " blame moon " this effort good , but obviously freshman effort . still must bh fans	-1

i am huge fan classic broadway musicals . my opinion , my fair lady west side story tie #1 spot best musical all time . i've seen several productions lerner amd loewe loverly masterpiece , ; both professional community theatre , i enjoy collecting various recordings broadway musicals . both original cast recordings my fair lady west side story recorded columbia historic 30th street studios -- aswas this 1976 20th anniversary recording my fair lady . anniversary production achieved respectablerun 384 performances . goddard lieberson , who produced classic original 1956 broadway cast album , again serves producer here . this 20th anniversary recording used available my local public library . i grew up listening 1956 broadway cast album , but i remember also delighted " 20th anniversary . " i used own this version audio cassette tape . i delighted discover amazon.com offered " 20th anniverrsary " remastered cd , i purchased it immediately . first , i must praise didier . deutsch outstanding reissue digital remastering job he here countless other titles sony broadway masterworks . sound quality here sparkling crisp . lightening not exactly strike twice terms casting . those hoping higgins eliza equal magical theatrical partnership rex harrison julie andrews somewhat disappointed . ian richardson bloody annoying flat-out weird higgins . christine andreas , however , thrilling eliza . i know higgins supposed passionate proper pronouncation english language theexclusion all else -- but richardson habit over-emphasizing/over-pronouncing almost every single word musical phrase . overall effect -- there simply no other way describe it -- bizarre weird ! higgins snobby male chauvanist -- but i never thought him crackpot until i heard richardson again . alan jay lerner so wittily wrote his lyrics : " englishman way speaking absolutely classifies him . moment he talks , he makes some other englishman despise him ! " richardson performance proves this point perfectly . but even richardson going wildly over top never brings this recording down . there other compensations splendid performances galore . robert coote makes welcome return his original role col , pickering . he sounds like he hasn't aged aday . good old coote vital vibrant ever . i never fond freddy song " street where you live " ; feeling it just filler while actors portraying higgins eliza get dressed embassy ball . but jerry lanning ( adult " patrick " opposite angela lansbury original broadway cast " mame " ) sings it beautifully . george rose especially robust eliza drunk , garbage-man dad alfred . doolittle . i love how rose bursts into tears his final phrase , " i'm gettin ' married mornin ' . ding- dong ! bells ( sob ! sob ! ) -- ( complete crying collapse ) gonna chime ! " it perfection illustration old joke : : " what difference betweena wedding funeral ? " : " perception . " while julie andrews always definitive eliza doolittle ( her performance won rapturous reviews anddeservedly became theatrical legend ) , christine andreas , my opinion , only other eliza worthy enough follow her -- only other eliza worth listening recording . her performances " wouldn't it loverly ? " , " i could danced all night " , particularly , " show me , " outstanding . christine andreas musical phrasing dramatic emphasis show thorough complete understanding eliza . after emotional argument higgins start act two , eliza runs into street find love-struck freddy waiting her like puppy dog . caught chauvanist snob professor who refuses show her slightest human respect dim-wit suitor who not stop fawning over her , eliza explodes rage . christine andreas perfect she explodes freddy , " i get words all day through -- first him , now you ! all you blighters ? " short , whereas ian richardson goes miserably wrong henry higgins , christine andreas absolutely right eliza doolittle . this 20th anniversary recording still earns its place where it belongs -- shelf next classic 1956 broadway cast recording	-1

( quot ; damp-soundingquot ; saxophone section particularly superb job . ) though bea wain voice not best this kind tune , she treats tune well , without sort melodrama would easy . her little hum end nice , sweet touch . last tune cd , quot ; i want rockquot ; ( all things ) real swinger . excellent arrangement , it hard believe it dates form 1937 or ' 38 ; it more early ' 40s sound it . definitely product amazingly competent band . so scare up scott philharmonic ( figure out way play this cd through it ) , give little slides your sock garters tug , get ready turn foxtrot or two . if you want enjoy late ' 30s swing , this cd you . you may not able go back . but yes , that what 1938 really sounded like	1

celine marie claudette dion born charlamegne , quebec youngest 15 children . she singing since age 5 teenage star her native quebec before discovered musician david foster . she eventually landed deal sony records became instant sucess classic hit " where my heart beat now . " her other hit " if there any other way " also made top 40 proving american public could possibly love her much they quebec . even though this album releaed 1990 there most definately 80 pop sound it which some newer fans may not like . her voice sounds flawless throughout . some critics referred celine voice " technical marvel " i agree . she put emotion power into song unlike any other artist pop singer out there . i highly reccomend this anyone new celine music or open minded music lover . overall grade :	-1

i'm huge fan three songs this collection , but very disappointed much rest . i'm very familiar cale vu catalog , some this later work , but this mid-70s period largely mystery me . there no debating cale talent or passion his music , but there dozen tracks this compilation sound like b-sides just added their respective albums afterthought . " ski patrol " instance just awful song . said , " pablo picasso " , " heartbreak hotel " few others just brilliant performances	-1

" cambia la piel " 9.5 /10ricky sophomore english album ( sixth solo album overall ) picks up where " ricky martin 1999 " left off . thick , slick production aggressive beats work well ricky voice . songs like " amor " , " saint tropez " , " cambia la piel " " jezabel " where things gel together best he sounds assured . there few dull spots such " if you ever saw her " original version " nobody wants lonely . " it mystery why massive hit duet version christina aguliera wasn't included . it should included . luckily , he projects enough charisma make those moments listenable . aside , there enough good moments please most pop fans . other two ballads " come me " " touch " revel ricky more sensitive side quite pleasant . this album well suited fans dance-pop , latin-pop club/dance . this album would not appeal you if you don't like those styles	-1
swv ... i really don't know where start ! swv such good group i just think they don't get much recognition they should , but neither some other acts 90s scene . i think swv also one best female singers ( coco ) , i just think it sad how you see artist now like beyonce , ciara , destiny child , so get all this credit what they but it not half good swv . but remember good moments music i bought this album keep memories real music ! this album so good , but when i first bought it i just bought it here main songs i knew but then one day i decided listen whole album i amazed how great these songs still . if there one song i didn't really like i would say probably track #5 , i didn't skip any song besides one , but it still alright . i advise anyone who wants hear good music buy this album because you pleased . only thing i thought they should've put song " we " best cd , but they different hits cd song there . but besides everything this album great ! so if you don't want sit hear ciara other artist try sing , you should buy " best swv " . ( i would rate this album 10 if they let me !	1

fans clerks movie no doubt love soundtrack , which not only features music movie , but dialog excerpts movie tie into songs . alice chains ' quot ; got me wrongquot ; their quot ; sapquot ; ep fits randal perfectly , which probably why it included soundtrack begin . supernova quot ; chewbaccaquot ; hilarious ties into preceding dialog excerpt dante randal over what better ; empire strikes back return jedi . bad religion quot ; leaders followersquot ; fits dante persona ( film he said he couldn't make altering decisions himself ) , while surprise appearences stabbing westward corrosion conformity nicely add heavy flair package . soul asylum quot;can't even tellquot ; film theme song fits it nicely , not mention clerks dvd video kevin smith directed song included . all all , if you loved clerks movie , you'll dig soundtrack	1

alright , so conor oberst 27 years old now . i stop calling him kid then ? probably not . i don't mean slight him any way . i mean , kid ( see ) amazing . you your own record label when you 14 ? no , i didn't think so . i've listening " four winds " cd single everyday since it came out . just biding my time until new bright eyes album " cassadaga " fell into my hands yesterday . i've foaming mouth it . anyway , my thoughts " cassadaga " ? historically there 3 " types " bright eyes songs . 1)songs immediacy hit you right away hooks , melodies , lyrics charm that undeniable . 2)songs enduring power gifts only reveal themselves after listener " endured " several listens ( these best ones ) . 3)songs head-scratching befuddlement you may never appreciate no matter how many times you try find something redeeming it . there one these every bright eyes album it always cracks me up see everyone reach skip button same time . it usually first song wherein conor tries set mood irritating hell out you . " cassadaga " course all three types songs them . i expect lot ink expended suggesting more mature conor emerged here . rubbish ! kid writing pretty grown-up stuff when he 16 . besides men don't mature . best they just get more adept hiding failure their development . i guess most mature thing " cassadaga " conor become masterful applying his encyclopedic knowledge roots , country , blues his own unique vision . check out mandolin violin " four winds " tell me that not beautifully controlled chaos . janet weiss ( hammer sleater-kinney ) plays drums few tracks here but you wouldn't know it because it sounds exactly how conor arranged it sound . there kind pop bright eyes ' country almost mystical zeppelin quality it ( mythic feeling , not sound ) . cleansing rain wilco foggy foreboding . it entirely possible this may eventually become my favorite bright eyes record . songs all strong ( although " make plan love me " category 3 me ) . it obvious start you'll need spend some time courting this album , but far first date kisses go , this one pretty great . my girlfriend hates his voice . i don't get . how someone who loves johnny cash , willie nelson fail hear intensity oberst . blasphemous comparison ? i don't think so . i hear same passion conviction " if brakeman turns away " i " rock island line " or " funny how time slips away " . when conor sings it ... i buy it . especially when his lyrics so bloody brilliant ! my two favorite lines ( so far ) same song , " soul singer session band " ... " you mean nothing no one but nobody fault . " ... " i lengthy discussion power myth ... post-modern author who didn't exist ... this fictitious world all reality twists ... i hopeless romantic ... now i'm just turning tricks " seriously ... come !?! when anybody so deftly ( or otherwise ) worked bill moyers into rock ( or otherwise ) lyric ? album packed gifted verse sonic landscape worthy them . " cassadaga " promises endlessly rewarding experiance . it good thing too . i didn't last week new stooges !	-1
fifteen years owning this cd this recording never ceases amaze me . i watched miss saigon its grand broadway scale , not mention its ambitious helicopter scene , years back it set bar my theater standards . this recording recaptures aural experience this epic 2-cd compilation . tony award-winner lea salonga shines her youthful bell-like soprano , belts out pure emotion role ill-fated kim , quite possibly only she effectively essay . jonathan pryce perfect his feisty character engineer , his catchy tunes " if you wanna die bed " brings out humor otherwise melodramatic musical . simon bowman lends his powerful voice chris , but many annoyed his excessive vibrato . claire moore , playing ellen ( chris ' wife ) oddity ; she belts out all her songs indiscriminately refuses blend duets . peter polycarpou ( john ) renders moving piece " bui doi " performs excellent supporting role . keith burns ( thui ) plays kim spurned lover displays his wide vocal range confrontation scenes . over years i played this cd over diverse listening environments ; still , it pleasure revisiting musical launched thousand protests raked record-breaking advance ticket sales . though broadway production long gone , its energy catchy tunes still resonate every theater enthusiast	1

why this hasn't reviewed beyond me . what great this album it now over ten years old , hasn't dated or lost any relevance all . dark long nice creeping song , fits semi-seedy lyrics . mmm skyscraper much more upbeat bumps nicely . surfboy weird little song , almost instrumental , shows how well they still make songs even without trademark vocals . spoonman ( no relation soundgarden song ) grown me greatly over years , even shows them trying rap little . tongue mostly just vocals relaxing guitar . dirty epic great long song more subdued tone than others , fades into cowgirl . this reason i bought this album . i'd seen video mtv amp ( sort shame it went away so quickly ) never heard anything like it before . very energetic , showing how economy lyrics even more powerful than too many . river bass aonther laid-back track . m.e. hopeful feeling it , makes good ending track . while any album would make great intro underworld ( which great barometer how good band they ) , this their first , shows how they already fully formed	1

if you read my review " hed kandi : swing city " , you probably lost your lunch overwhelming way i praised kandi releases since acquisition this great label mos . seriously , i even got compare them ones released mark doyle days . but after listened disco heaven 2006 , i hope this album just one little down what seems promising future not what we kandi lovers afreid . hey , don't misunderstand me , it not baaad album ( specially if you're new house music business ) , just i ( maybe many hk fans ) expected so much more , after listened twisted disco swing city , than this hybrid full commercial record . first , let start good things : cover girl notoriously improved since doyle took his gorgeous classic kandi girls him ; check disco kandi 05.05 ' front cover you'll see what i'm talking . now , some tracks vivid grabs you dance floor ... now , what bad things ? well , 1 . some tracks present dark sound ; very huge mistake since uplifting sound reason why we love this series what we expect , not " tracks they forgot " include twisted disco(obviouly they missed concept disco heaven ) , 2 . too much anthems !!!, songs we tired listen over over again , , what worse , bad remixes them . take these one example : fade solu music(track 1 , cd 2 ) ... jesus !!!! this one around since beach house 04.02 .. included mix 2006 , world series paris now this year disco heaven ?? come !!! take me away remix(track 7 , cd 2 ) , rise up ( track 6 , cd 1 ) , jealousy ( track 7 , cd 1 ) , say what you want ( track 10 , cd 1 ) ... even if many these songs other labels ' releases , they just can't pretend we only listen hed kandi , they ? ; nothing different , nothing fresh . course there new songs very good ones , but , like i said before , this not what i expected what supposed quality , original innovative label . not bad , but definitely not good .	-1
social distortions major label debut veritable greatest hits cd . nearly all their " radio hits " this album . ( story my life , ball chain , ring fire ) . mike ness continues transform band angry punk rock early days more country/rockabilly/50 rock sound made them last more than quarter century . only knock this album it bit top-heavy . everyone knows " hits " , but some other songs tend filler material . also , recording quality this album not some classic songs this cd justice not reach quality band later albums . still , this disc well worth money classics it contains . i highly recommend following songs ... -so far away-story my life-sick boys-ring fire-ball chai	-1
this album released 1999 . now , seven years later , this album not even matter . britney spears remembered not her musical talent but her inability parent child . great music lasts dozens years its complexity , innovation , creativity , ability transcend cultures generations . great music stirs something inside listener , matters person who created it . britney spears ridiculous product her record companies created none these things . it saddens me see number copies album such this sells originally . yet , great albums all times sell thousands copies years - decades , even - after their release . music like this , britney spears her peers , disappears into folds time . it not matter .	-1

if you don't this album , you need get this . buy it , don't download it . everyone needs support good hip hop like this . man , i first heard this end 2002 i captivated . beats little grimier than first ablum lp , but they still true hip hop sound , no club banger garbage 50 cent . rhymes clever these guys mesh so well together . rhymes great , whether love/friendship story thin line , battle lyrics one them , old school flavord lyrics day races . they great guests too . legends percee , big daddy kane shine day races . they both showed they still it . ju ju spits fire all glitz glam mc one them ( which thinking it pretty funny because beatnuts seem gearing towards direction . ) supriser , nelly furtado , pop superstar fits well song thin line . get this , this group same breath both old school mc day races , tribe called quest , wu tang , you get picture .	1
christopher cross ' second album " page " came out january 1983 after 3+ year gap this his self-titled debut . his debut masterpiece key album history soft rock adult contemporary music . this follow up , despite gap time , very much continuation same sound , so much so it basically sounds if it could recorded same sessions his debut . although there fuzzy-sounding synths " all right " " deal ' em again " , synths aren't really much more prominent here than they before . acoustic guitar spotlighted more regularly here , but general , sound previous album , its prominent piano electric piano smooth drum sound , fully carried over . his first album massive commercial success , massive artistic success well , so , it`s not surprising he continued use same style . first album , this produced michael omartian , apart one co-write ( " deal ' em again " ) , everything again written cross alone . michael mcdonald don henley both contribute vocals again , this time carl wilson art garfunkel both appear well . this album quickly go gold , but it wasn't even close blockbuster previous album . however , quality album indeed high . cross go extremely heavy romantic ballads here , but there no denying cross real knack them . " nature game " ; heart-wrenchingly tender " talking my sleep " ; yearning " long world " ; incredibly bittersweet ode murdered friend " think laura " each wonderfully melodic soothing ballads built upon cross ' acoustic guitar parts ; his gentle , sighing vocals ideal this material . contemplative , epic ballad " baby says no " also superb uplifting , neatly-arranged background vocals . " what am i supposed believe " duet cross karla bonoff , both great vocalists , track demonstrates how incredibly similar they sound each other vocally . however , song , well album closing " words wisdom " , though not without enjoyable tunefulness , both go overboard slip over into sappiness . he deliver couple upbeat , feel-good tunes --" deal `em again " infectiously catchy fun , although " all right " lyrically slight very sugary , you can't deny its catchiness . album-opening " no time talk " somewhat ballad-ish , but it bouncy fairly uptempo--it really great song ultra-catchy chorus features terrific harmony vocals mcdonald . overall , if you're big soft rock fan and/ or love his debut , this safe buy . ballad-heaviness might scare some away , but song-by-song basis , this really strong record . it not dramatic step down overall quality his debut , there lots terrific tracks easily live up debut high standard . ( p.s. default volume standard cd release this album unbelievably low , so ready crank volume knob .	-1

yes this new direction solas . frankly , i like it . overall , it good album . most material strong ; not every track , but certainly there much admire . i think transforming dylan rock/shuffle quot ;d ignityquot ; into celtic-styled piece particularly brilliant . nick drake quot ; clothes sandquot ; favorite . but , imo upbeat second track alone worth price admission . i wholeheartedly recommend this album	-1
album first appears somewhat more eclectic than your average hootie album . after time listening it , disparate styles music , which cross full-on bouncy pop ( araby ) mellow classics ( hey hey what i ? ) country ( fine line ) golden oldies ( dream baby ) , seem somewhat helter skelter their scattering throughout this album . yet after while , album seems pick up flow almost begins make complete sense . sure , styling somewhat random , but musical quality tracks selected , including soulful live cut ( i hope i don't fall love you ) allows listener enjoy fullest range hootie distinctive easily identifiable sound . i am purchasing this album second time , since continuous play first copy left it so badly scratched i am forced purchase second copy make up unplayability first . i rate this album perhaps very best all hootie albums	-1

it not often you find band that willing experiment several different music styles same album . virgin black sombre romantic features songs black metal style ( quot ;d rink midnight hymnquot ;) , darkwave ( quot ; lamenting kissquot ;) , gothic ( quot ; museum iscariotquot ;) , opera/symphonic ( opening two songs ) , some other goodies thrown . rowan operatic vocals fantastic ; it nice find band trained male vocalist instead screamy 80 metal voice or overused black/death screaming amp ; growling , latter which becoming used all wrong places some bands . there very little black metal screaming this album , when it appear , it used effectively . songs , composed rowan guitarist samantha escarbe , constantly changing never get boring . lyrics show some religious themes , but not try force anything down people throats . it lyrically superb product overall . compositions very solid , although no two songs sound alike , there little disparity quality musicianship . highly recommended fans anything tristania burzum	1
one biggest problems i bread not their music , but my friends who liked jethro tull , black sabbath . alice cooper others various " more serious " rock genres , i , made fun me any time i mentioned bread . well , fact remains i like bread continue like bread time time . david gates great voice maudlin music he sings . song i think most " diary " , poignant song fear all us young males girl we love loves someone else . david gates just rips your heart out his soft mellow words he reveals writings diary his girlfriend weren't fact himself , but guy . talk gut-wrencher . but course gut-wrenching emotion doesn't stop there . here guy singing himself all us our dreams girls women we love . " lost without your love " , " sweet surrender " , " aubrey " , " it don't matter me " , " make it you " , " everything i own " , more ... david gates just refuses let you anything other than morose relationships . but somehow doesn't matter . it seems like there times when i just can't get enough david gates pouring out his heart , making me feel he i one when it comes how women tear our hearts out . but that okay , because it feels good hear it david songs . okay , i admit maybe you little self-destructive listening this music . however , it little cathartic too listen what you feel out loud . just don't listen this music while you drinking lot , you might feel too maudlin your own good . other hand , if it makes you go sing bread song outside window your girlfriend house , or apartment , maybe it good thing . i am unsure why " professional " reviewer would so negative this music . i am unable think anyone music consistently achieved style david gates bread achieved their music . this music " great ? " perhaps not , but who cares ? i like it because it strikes sympathetic chord me , professional reviewers need remember their opinion just , opinion ; one we ignore because we know our romantic heart he wrong . this cd great stuff small doses . well performed mellow soft rock , very romantic . perfect right mood . i wish they still made music like this .	1

goodthere not much say this release really . most part springfield stays true original arrangements songs , albeit different guitar or piano tone here there . songs i recognize , " i'm not love , " " life northern town , " " broken wings , " " baker street , " " waiting girl like you , " " no , " " imagine , " they sound just like originals versions , except their sung rick springfield . all tracks chosen mellow flow nicely together . rick great voice , but doesn't really challenge himself . badit doesn't really make sense include new song ( " cry " ) covers album , but least it fits rest . i would liked heard couple slightly different versions or arrangements . verdicti know i've little critical this album , but overall i like it . they're songs i know , artist i enjoy . best thing rick springfield staying true originals there no room mess them up , which happens sometimes covers albums .	-1
this kalmah fourth album , entitled black waltz . album cover positively ugly ! despite terrible artwork , album very good . perhaps most notable change music vocals . instead usual higher pitched screams ( used black metal ) , we much lower death growls . i actually like these vocals more , although they rather incoherent times . album melodic death metal , thrash parts thrown . keyboards provide grandiose symphonic sound . song lengths range 4 minutes 5 half minutes . ( exception svieri doroga , which minute long ) . comparisons children bodom ridiculous , because bodom more power/melodic death , whereas this much heavier ( less `cheesy ' ) melodic death . keyboard act more instrument , accompanies guitar solos . per usual , twin gothenburg guitars present : one doing lead/solos other rhythm guitar . defeat strong opener eerie symphonic parts mixed bombtastic double bass drumming guitar-keyboard solo . ( good band comparison would wintersun ( minus clean vocals ) , wintersun mixes load genres together , lot keyboard work . ) black metallic side sounds little bit like bodom , but it heavier . time takes us all begins powerful drumming , orchestral keyboard work catchy guitar riffs . gallows mixes minor/diminished chords verse major/minor chords powerful bass work . keyboards not featured much , leaving more raw sound . svieri doroga acoustic/drum interlude . black waltz slower song ( well slow compared first four pounding tracks ) , long drawn out death growls . around 2.50 mark slow string/drum part played , followed beautiful solo . terminal intensity very reminiscent dark tranquillity song , vocals all . there barrage drumming keyboards . it also quite cool thrash-like solo . man king fast frenzy instruments . i love chorus this song . keyboards play rather horror-like melody , empowering chorus . 2.08 mark drums pound out intense rhythm all instruments come together highlight song . groan wind little slower , delightful almost folk-like tune played guitars . it epic , highly melodic song . mindrust heavier song , best solo album . 2.51 there rather distorted , heavy section . one stands catchy bass-drum introduction followed twin guitars . although it last song , it my favourite . this song also quite dark tranquillity like . i'd give this 4.5 because some songs sound too similar . nevertheless musicianship excellent guitar work top form . i recommend this melodic death metal fans , or anyone who likes metal doesn't mind death vocals .	1
i purchased this soren hermansson cd eight months ago , i am completely amazed his wonderful , musical playing . this cd very special several reasons . first , we get hear little-known scandinavian horn player give swedish works other obscure works horn . soren hermansson plays bright , beautiful tone appropriate bringing his sound forefront orchestra . also , we get very rare recording gordon jacob fine horn concerto . furthermore , this cd gives balanced perspective horn players offering different tonal playing concep t.t he jacob horn concerto opens piece . hermansson very rhythmically precise his playing . he full command horn , he plays beauty accuracy . hermansson plays brain-like ease . cadenza first movement beautiful . concerto slow movement beautiful , transcendent , mournful autumnal . hermansson plays very emotionally , result very gripping . he sustains long lines gives good forward motion . last movement jacob horn concerto really cooks ! quarter note equals 132 , hermansson single-tongues it perfectly , no easy feat ! he negotiates very , very difficult acrobatics seeming ease . matyas seiber wrote " nocturno horn strings , " dedicated dennis brain . it difficult piece get into . it almost uncompromising its musical language seiber compatriot , bela bartok . i like bartok-like musical ideas presented . this work very difficult musically emotionally , i not really worked much this piece , myself . hermansson plays great dedication musicality . lars-erik larsson wrote set twelve concertinos solo instruments , hermansson includes one horn orchestra here . opening movement full swedish melodies longing northland . one hear influence carl nielsen , one my favorite composers . there good variety lyrical playing declamatory power , also . second movement strange , detached eerie . hermansson orchestra excellent job giving it air mystery . finale fast , epic , rhythmic jaunt . it requires bounciness , lightness , quick fingerwork . also , there sections which call great power stamina , much like finales strauss horn concertos . max reger " scherzino horn string orchestra " very brief work . it entertaining curiosity , i could not order sheet music because it out print . it small , salon-like piece , there not lot emotional substance it . it nice , though . my favorite work cd , kurt atterberg horn concerto , amazing work . it uses lots colorful orchestration , harmonic modulations , tension release . opening bold forward , almost like spanish bullfight . it very rhythmic , it requires dramatic presence . there plenty swedish idioms here , also . slow movement incredible . it jam-packed emotional lyricism , passion , interesting orchestral uses ( piano cascades up down keyboard regular intervals ) . hermansson incredibly lyrical expressive , even though movement goes too long . finale very much bouncy hunting tradition strauss horn concertos . there frequent modulations very fast , delicate passagework . atterberg horn concerto really awesome . overall , this cd rare treat . soren hermansson wonderful , skilled horn musician , he well accompanied edward tjiviel orchestra . these pieces not readily available elsewhere , you enjoy it . it well worth twenty dollars !	1
writing this 30th anniversary phil death ( 4/9/06 begs question relevancy . how real his perspectives ? how meaningful his observations ? what he singing then make any sense now ? i guess it all depends upon one own point view , but when looking back all he said where we've , one must suck breath gaze upon sully load through years beat us down today . if any relevancy negated through time , how it we gape wonder his lyrical splendor his seeing emperor hairless [ ... ] swinging through air side side ? perhaps idea fruitless protest persists his self-imposed demise , or perhpaps importance standing tall remains his struggle . any , or all situations one picks his/her path shimmys through aisles . no doubt , some special thoughts always remain his listenning . this album valid stream thoughts , timbered melodies , harrowing lyrics . there so many samples workplace , this just one many . however , it short term we continue question who he really , what he really , what we become . give liste	1

i hear lot music . fact , i rarely ever hear album twice because i so many listen consideration airplay . music i hear ranks awful excellent . " tales new west " falls squarely into " excellent " bin . outstanding songwriting coreys dennis kahler coupled buddy jewell warm effective vocals more-than-adequate instrumentation make very satisfactory listening experience . after listening 11 tracks only " downtown matinee " left , i said , " if this final song good one , this one those rare albums where every single song radio-worthy . " that exactly what it turned out . there only few country music albums come my mind when i think those without single bad cut - porter wagoner " thin man west plains " ; confederate railroad self-titled debut cd ; hugh moffatt " loving you " ; hank thompson " most all ; emmylou harris ' " pieces sky " ; " spectacular johnny horton " name few off top my head . " tales new west " now added list . upon listening this cd , one immediately struck creative lyrics . " i get bird " bring smile any mid-westerner like me who sense humor . i would like heard five or six more verses " downtown matinee " - just so all silver screen cowboys could mention . but song brings quite wave nostalgia it . one begins feel like he actually sitting front big screen while listening " pancho villa gold . " this storytelling its best . one who always believed #1 spot charts should determined more strength songwriter than singer , i'm always intrigued when great songwriters like coreys dennis kahler come out woodwork . we only hope it won't long before their work presented us again they receive commercial success they so deserve .	1
... i love this particular cd because i used live turkey i knew every song this album . lyrics sentuous thoughtful i admire his creativity . i say quot ; go tarkan ! quot ; take america rest world ! many ( not all we already see ) admire you love your music , i . i many others looking forward release your english cross-over album !	1
listenening this album reminds one who know better when it actually meant something labled " alternative " " indie " .. not label itself means anything , but fact it used represent aspect music meant dissect normality predictable , zombified sludge sucks life out people passes majority consummed goods our audio markets .. when bands like pavement their prime back 90 , it must felt really good part , opposed marketed indie-esqe bands continue amplify today .. what seperates stephen malkimus wannabe generation follow ? utmost respect his own creative process every track , fortunately he talent back it up .. what may pavements most solid album , singer-songwriter not waste any time trying get know you like you .. if you want get know him his band though , you entitled some first class warped lyrics first class defragmented pop songwriting .	-1
this real treasure . this album romantic you get . there not one second this album disappoints . i never grow weary listening it , especially night my girl my side . only thing disappointing fact it not very long album , however , besides small detail , you can't go wrong making this purchase regardless what kind music you enjoy listening . this one those absolute no-brainers ! if you don't own this , go out buy it right now , you won't regret it second . there no doubt it - johnny hartman greatest singer never became famous history man kind ! okay , so it bit stretch ... but after you listen this album you see why i throw out such lofty praise .	1

sound quality ultra-lounge series excellent , even though songs recorded mostly 50 60 . capitol records packs each cd carefully chosen tracks consistent theme particular volume series . many selections appear here aren't available elsewhere , either because original album which song appeared out print , or because song issued single never collected album . few ' previously unreleased ' tracks also appear here . this series wonderful introduction music by-gone era , each album includes detailed notes each track ( artist , writers , date recorded , how released , etc . ) . i heartily recommend it anyone who interest this type music	1

joe pass simply greatest guitarist ever . his bottomless improvisational techniques boggle mind offer ears something new each repeated listening any his songs . his ability modulate seamlessly fill his melodies harmonized chords walking bass lines take your breath away . pass lightning fast single-note chordal abilities used only when needed , keeping artistry each some song balance its complexity . this double-cd album consists fast slow songs all intensities . most acoustic pass playing alone without missing beat . guitarist point view , while general spoon-fed public continues idolize rather limited skills hendrix , vaughan all other ' novice guitarists ' compared this ultimate virtuoso , joe pass sits quietly jazz world skills so beyond comprehension , it would take more than couple lifetimes scrape his level . but true genius joe pass aside his technical mastery he made beautiful music through gorgeous ornamentation his lush jazz melodies	1

next ( 1977 . ) journey third album . their early days , journey nothing like steve perry-fronted band would rise fame late seventies early eighties . group formed initially neal schon gregg rollie , both whom came santana . although neal schon always group guitarist , gregg rollie only band first few albums , he only served lead vocalist first three albums ( althought he would sing occasional perry-era track later seventies . ) 1977 year tht saw release third journey album , final one feature gregg rollie lead vocalist . read my review next album . put it simply , if you liked first two journey albums ( which also gregg rollie singing ) , you're very much likely like third one line . this album , sound shifts slightly more commercial direction than previous two albums , but band still manages maintain hard space rock sound made their first two albums so great . i admit , this album step down journey look into future before it , making it weakest three albums feature gregg rollie lead vocals , but even weakest rollie album kills best steve perry album dead . start finish , rollie vocals absolutely incredible , neal schon beautifully demonstrates his role music industry guitar god - something he'd lose eighties band gradually sold out went totally commercial poppy . truly , next album end era . five stars rollie last stand . journey first three albums aren't readily available stores better-known perry-era albums , but when you find rollie-era albums stores , you'll notice they priced very low . all searching it takes find them if you're fan progressive heavy space rock - you'll more than satisfied end . next appropriate title journey last album rollie lead vocals , because time their next album came around , band would totally different one one rollie schon gave birth . steve perry would take band more commercial direction , rollie would strictly organist occasional vocalist , before his inevitable departure . first three journey albums depict real journey , before perry changed them . i strongly recommend buying them if you're classic rock fan	1

no one agrees exact definition punk , even if some consensus reached , word " punk " would still evoke images leather clad snotty young men hammering out 3 chord anthems . new wave considered many nothing more than danceable punk music boasting synthesizers pop melody . these reasons , i feel uncomfortable labeling remain light either punk or new wave album . i could say it alternative album , but alternative such broad vague term many fans alternative char t-t opping groups 90 would tilt their head furrow their brows puzzlement upon hearing said alternative masterwork remain light , i wouldn't blame them . this album doesn't " cool " other alternative touchstones such velvet underground nico , unknown pleasures or nevermind . fact , remain light times sounds downright nerdy . my utter worship perhaps even over romanticism this album not take root instantly . fact , when i first heard it , i laughed . this what inspired bands such radiohead ? this what most respected indie critics cite perfection alternative music ? it cannot , this simply bunch panicky inarticulate noise ! i right way , but i wrong way well . first seconds album , you must engage complete undivided attention music or else become instantaneously alienated . casual listening not option if you wish completely appreciate remain light . first , instruments all seem defiantly independent each other , unaware what any others doing . guitars sound almost nervous vocals front man david byrne , beat multifaceted waterlogged almost african-sounding polyrhythms , hardly danceable , least not right away . but reality , this apparently uneasy mess noise exact calculated one mozart symphonies . one complaint common among those who hear this album but don't truly listen its apparent lack hooks . this almost seems case , but closer you listen , more you realize every single song numerous hidden hooks . problem pop fans these hooks not out wide open . it takes many listens grasp musical feel purpose even one track . you aren't supposed get album like remain light . album like remain light designed get you . much album sound accredited participation ambience master brain eno . his production gave talking heads sound spacey , expansive ambient , but not drenched unnecessary reverb or delay effects less skilled producers used try mimic sound this record . but big i am fan not only eno production skills but his own compositions ; biggest contribution sound course due band . every song thousand things going once , first this cause it perceived messy unorganized . but i said before , these noises meticulously crafted . how so much going once , yet not conflict ? it seems comparable situation such da vinci spilling his paints looking down find mona lisa . remain light rarely , if ever , discussed concept album . this baffles me , because me it absolutely clear this album self-realization or lack it . shape-shifting recurring theme societal confusion . now famous single " once lifetime " deals aimlessness life , even among those who proclaim " made it " . one most terrifying tracks " listening wind " which empathizes man who finds himself committing act terrorism ( suicide bombing ? ) against " american man " last ditch effort preserve his culture . but david byrne lyrics something not meant analyzed or written , but heard interpreted listener . this principle actually applies whole album , why i shied away reviewing it past , i feel i still not it justice . remain light not everybody . usually when i like album i find complex wonderful remain light , i cannot help but consider myself somehow superior those who cannot appreciate it , snobbish it sounds most music fans guilty this one point or . but this album this not case . when somebody comes me says they cannot find any merit this alternative opus , i feel genuine pity . remain light indisputably one greatest albums rock history totally ahead its time ; but me , it influence essential status among other alternative masterpieces not near important its seemingly never ending well merit reveals more surprises intrinsic worth each careful listen . buy this album . if you don't like it , don't keep it shelf . give it somebody else who could end up appreciating it . plastic which this album burned should never go waste or forgotten among millions others . remain light album every rock fan should hear , whether they end up liking it or not unimportant . remain light twisted journey every music fan should required take	1

good reason hybrid hailed most forward thinking act club music . this true , but rarely i read any proper reflection what this actually means . back 80 music press used word `wagnerian ' describe high profile productions style trevor horn . bands like abc frankie goes hollywood certainly well-produced but end they nothing wagner . this certainly case hybrid music . it post-romantic classical music ( fex . strauss , mahler , wagner , schoenberg ) transposed club music . it similar kind velvety quality which comes extensive use over octave harmonies . how their third cd place itself into above framework ? expect their most uncommercial release . title " i choose noise " symptomatic sense , progression wa via m-scifi ever increasing presence stabs colours created different kinds sound effects . this record more than its predecessor points ahead . future sounds more pointillistic or even atonal , if ( like this record would suggest ) more more prominence given singular layers sound colours . get proper picture this , just compare ' snyper ' wa ' i choose noise ' ich . they both their core solid cornerstones tonal orchestration , but whereas first case whole piece almost if awaits orchestrated parts enter piece ( this sense gets it fulfilment their introduction ) , second tune refence tonal structures more allusive . piece fast unpredictable stream lava tonal structures seem float this colourful texture like vaporizing icebergs . cd one solid masterpiece degree , i would not single out any personal favourites . only thing i suggest listener pay attention similarity some chords `secret circles ' `just today ' . first one prelude whole record sounds some parts like variation coda end `jft ' , which i guess proves claim one solid piece work ...	1

spoken jimmy cleveland this cd , it bittersweet story . he never contacted record company , didn't even know it reissued . i sent him my copy - he wasn't thrilled i t.t he good news , this cd check him out ! countless incrdible arrangements quincy jones , gigi gryce , benny golson , my surprise , ernie wilkins , who keeps up others , then some . if you only 30 seconds spare , check out opening " long ago far away " taste how cool this cd ! perhaps enjoying this cd , you help set record straight spreading awareness indeed , jimmy cleveland successor . . johnson . give him some greater recognition overisight record company forgiven . jimmy just plays so great this , rhythm sections stellar - max roach , oscar pettiford , paul chambers , art taylor , hank jones , etc . etc . arrangements ... jeez ! also , lucky thompson blows some heart-stopping choruses disc 1 . yow !! don't miss this great double-cd !!!!	1

this seriously most hilarious album i own . my friend found copy parking lot one banks my home town . someone clearly run over case several times their car . i always pull it out parties laugh . almost every song phrase " jyeah ... house , [ ... ] " within 10 seconds start track . synth sounds pretty standard early 90s pop rap . beats tend towards straight quarter notes light accent 3 . if i write parody gansta rap i wouldn't waste my time . it . you're reading review album	1

years clapton bb king wanted make cd together . it took them 30 years but they finally it , it worth wait . several songs covers songs they before previous albums . those would include , ten long years , key highway , three o " clock blues worried life blues . they also covers old sam dave song , hold i'm coming class come rain or come shine . key highway worried life blues acoustic guitars , i enjoy hearing them way . bb king also writes some new songs cd . unfortunately clapton writes nothing new . this blues fans dream , possibly two best blues guitarists ever same album it wont disappoint you	1
arsis what happens intersection singer-songwriter mentality melodic death metal ; arsis , if you , fine wine melodic death metal . many enjoy their work , but there much room ' deeper ' appreciation their artistic efforts . rumor it guitarist james malone drummer michael van dyne products berklee school music , which would not surprise me given compositional maturity musical virtuosity these two players . i can't remember exactly when or where i first heard " celebration guilt , " but i recall experience itself . i completely blown away way arsis balanced level aggressiveness i haven't heard since slaughter soul symphonic sense melody layering . until you listen " celebration guilt " headphones you won't fully appreciate craftsmanship went into this album . while it not uncommon death metal act feature one guitarist ( see : decapitated or hate eternal ) , more melody-oriented groups generally rely two guitarists complete harmonies rhythm/lead sections . malone , however , it clear he neither needed nor wanted help . i count three guitar tracks most points album , again only noticeable headphones because how well layering composed . but i hinted above , what makes arsis real gem their composition skills . if you've read my other reviews you know i am huge stickler good songwriting . bands like darkane , decapitated , , course , my personal favorites , gates , true respect power well-written song . arsis continue this legacy , embracing not only killer riffs but solid song structures carry you through every minute music out missing beat . " celebration guilt " i , however , my complaints . recording very decent but could afford thicker sound . i said , there lot layering multitracking guitars , but overall thickness , meat production , could more present . while drummer van dyne plays consistency metronome , i find myself disagreeing some his fill work . this too i attribute partially albums production , which allows tom work slip into background , but also , i think , more punk thrash-oriented style which he performs ( , when he not blasting away ) . but this all trivial compared overall quality this album . it hailed many critics best 2004 , certainly deserves such accolades . my complaints but hot air next this magnificent work metal artistry .	1

most people who listen miles davis immediately drawn broodingly sensitive tone style which he developed after his formidable stint charlie parker . without getting too far into jazz history lesson , davis wanted make post-bird music sound " pretty " didn't want address madness world time , so speak , boppers so desperately trying portray . expected , considering his background . miles davis singular performer posthumously still one most unique piercing artists musical idiom he could singularly carry recording . louis armstrong hand full other innovators he able express poignant complexity human condition through his playing touches us profoundly emotional spiritual way . what makes this recording monument however addition gil evans beauty genius his arrangements . anyone who fan jazz already knows form , when executed properly , readily capable tapping into pith pathos truly human experience . it addresses issues " proper " classical music ignores . this not say i don't like classical music but , considering general history humanity , emotional content music prior mid-nineteenth century bit antiquated doesn't express true spectrum experience post-atomic society . me this recording displays pinnacle possibilities music . not only arrangements compelling there dynamic musical content , but particular performers give arrangements their due ... ; unbelievable execution throughout .

no doubt truly cutting edge band . this cd 17 rare tracks truly worthwhile . styles vary edgy new wave rock dance oriented tracks soothing reggae two touching versions pretty ballad everything time . excellent hooks touching arrangements both versions it truly cd highlight . my other preferences include upbeat oi world , reggae bopping beauty contest , varying paces new friend , steady under construction . now there mismatch adjective song title you . anyway , i see time i could really like nearly all tunes this recording . even rock steady remixes new approved their moments . not perfect but certainly plus rating minimum	-1

hardly anyone australia heard supergrass ... it real shame because millions people don't know what they're missing out ... nevertheless i fortunate enough hear their self-titled album one night two years ago when band here threw supergrass cd sets ... i havent looked back . " road rouen " sees maturing supergrass . ' tales endurance ( parts 4 , 5 6 )' , ' st. petersburg ' ' low ' elevated moments this too-short album ( 9 songs bit rip-off , hence 4 stars ) sees musical development touched previous ' hollow little reign ' , ' moving ' ' prophet 15 ' . you'll excused thinking like i you're listening titivating rendition " abbey road " ... there no mistaking it ... it very beatleish but that ok because it works without tacky . it low point ' coffee pot " which sounds like it should herb alpert tijuana brass album but supergrass get away it becuase their music so diverse ... i just don't think many people like it . overall album good ; very good . now i just wait next one	-1

english our lady peace fan i not get see band often , i rely power their music cross pond reach out me , make me tap my feet , make me sing catchy cryptic lyrics like previous our lady peace albums . although many weren't , i completely satisfied . healthy paranoid times least 5 songs would make excellent singles : where you , world string , don't stop , angels/losing/sleep future blame us ? although very good album would 12 singles , other 7 songs all serve very different purpose ; power thought provocation . it would too much explain all possible theories each track however : picture , some powerful , thoughtful lines dealing loss someone either through death or relationship breakdown . wipe smile off your face catchy drumbeat slow guitar over top . " i'm not afraid , i'm gunna make you pay " reaveals angry nature song which carries theme revenge . it makes you wonder what raine singing . al genina ( leave light ) mentions raine visits his wife chantal war torn countries , it communicates gulf lifestyles type lives people 3rd world countries . " life different here , its not camoflauged gold " highlights raines accusations 3rd world doesn't get enough attention , joins hand hand cd booklet which indicates what happend world since they started recording . although sung mellow tone , raines voice ability communicate wider audience ; something olp trying since gravity 2002 . overall album more facinating peice music than something you rock out too . our lady peace not stuck crossroads some may assume , they still making powerful music , probing different ways climb ladder success ultimately their music universally recognised . this album certainly takes them up few further rungs ladder .	-1

truly great live albums rare hen teeth when scrutinised closely , but this 1981 live recording billy joel could very well greatest them all . why ? well , hardest task producing live album give it character it own , unique albums which it songs derived . it great challenge live album hold it own face better production studio , give it ' authenticity ' when so many live elements doctored later production . ' songs attic ' packs punch it studio sources cannot match . reasons this owing four elements : i ) joel producer phil ramone went joel ' undiscovered ' tracks - songs predated bj ascendency fame massive success ' stranger ' 1977 . eschewing last 5 years hits , ' songs attic ' album captured fresh definitive versions reasonably unheard tracks . most importantly , these genuinely great compositions deserved reassessed wake joel newfound fame . ii ) these first versions these songs feature joel live band . ramone knew joel band character passion belt out better versions these tracks than more insipid original studio recordings . it rare claim , but i say without any concessions these perfect live performances musicians ; particularly de vito pounding , atmospheric drumming richie cannata brilliant multi-instrumental work . there no better versions any these songs any other live or studio album . ' captain jack ' , ' miami 2017 ' ' i've loved these days ' send chills up your spine , there no filler this record . iii ) so often futzed live albums , ramone production work mixing here astonishingly perfect . he wouldn't better studio . fact , ramone taste overly-clean studio sound nicely tempered grit live environment . unwittingly , it might actually added dimension his production style . decision capture some tracks stadium setting others intimate club works superbly production motif . iv ) billy joel caught here absolute peak his powers , both singer instrumentalist . he completely ' touch ' meaning these songs passion so overt , it can't help but grab you . anyone intrigued what driven joel illustrious career should start this album . it where he tells all his old secrets . this album so utterly unique it almost deserves compared more his studio output than his other live albums . there no hits here ( excepting perhaps ' say goodbye hollywood ' ) but every track magnificent . if you want live version his hits , go fantastic new release ' 12 gardens ' ( 2006 ) . whilst terrific showcase joel hits , it not quite equal transcendent , perfect live experience 1981 ' songs attic ' which unlikely equalled any artist soon	1

his debut solo album , ' perpetual burn , ' jason becker combines unconventional musicality devastating technical prowess gives us one most original compelling all instrumental guitar recordings . it unusual such proficient electric guitarist so many unique musical ideas , but becker instinct bizarre , ear-twisting lines takes us into wondrous new territory where his instrumental dexterity serves him well . it clear he composed this music his brain , not his hands . such exotic melodies elaborate structures play out , his guitar seems , then , like method giving music voice , rather than crutch which he hobbles kicks half-heartedly ideas he cannot fully convict . there grand musical drama here , epic adventure so far beyond most guitar heroes i cannot understand why anyone compares them becker . he real thing , unabashed virtuoso who play anything he wants but chooses varied textures , atmospheres , funky harmonic combinations , notes carefully articulated vibrato bar , thrilling runs where he both throws down speed gauntlet something say doing so . nerdy , cerebral , totally original , this album lot offer . it natural companion your cacophony collection or marty friedman ' dragon kiss .

back 1976 , steve miller recorded batch songs enough fill two complete albums or make one double length album . he chose divide songs into two separate albums released consecutive years : " fly like eagle " 1976 " book dreams " 1977 . both volumes showcase his versatility talent producing variety styles , including his own twist originality many songs . seven tracks " book dreams " found his greatest hits album , which released following year . like it predecesor , this album begins instrumental . " threshold " features organ synthesizer rises falls pitch smoothly , sort like sound airplane taking off , landing , or flying overhead . this track leads directly into " jet airliner " , one popular chart hits found here . long guitar introduction bursts into strumming folk southern rock style reminiscent creedence clearwater revival . this song , guy going trip takes him away family friends , but he doubts his feelings leaving them asks plane not carry him too far away or too long . together , these first two tracks serve introduction album . other popular tracks represent variety styles here this artist . southern rock song hint ccr style " true fine love " , which young man decided it time settle down girl he truely loves , raise family her . southern rock track love song " stake " , guitar work similar eagles or joe walsh . there couple great instrumental sections middle end part . both these songs included greatest hits album . " winter time " folk/soft rock hit features folk guitar harmonica , accompaniment vocals instrumental section . this gentle song dwells features winter : brown leaves , winds , birds flying away summer . it begins ends sound wind . steve very creative production " swingtown " , which he plays instruments . this party song intro starts drums , which soon joined bass guitar , then organ comes next , then acoustic piano , finally strumming guitar . folk style vocals accompanied various instruments , song deals wanting fun after hard day work . instrumental begins middle continues end include variety organ reed " voices " take turns , finally wind marks end other instruments fade . other track steve unique style " jungle love " , rock ' roll number begins ends whistles squeaks probably mimic birds monkeys other creatures found jungle . this whimsical love song love girl out jungle features great instrumental sections electric guitar . this also one his popular hits radio also his greatest hits album . remaining five tracks may not seen among his super hits , but they still trademark steve miller their sound . might expected its title , " wish upon star " gentle lullaby folk soft rock style , featuring accompaniment organ synthesizer bass . theme " it doesn't matter where or who you when you wish upon star . let your dreams into your heart . " second instrumental " electro lux imbroglio " showcases organ fancy space sounds , high flute , electronic tinkle , church organ . this track leads into " sacrifice " , mellow composition longest piece this album . this song girl who not appreciate man she once , therefore sacrificed relationship , marked fancy organ accompaniment tinkling trills , well bass drums instrumental section . " my own space " , last vocal this album , begins wind sounds , later includes instrumental middle fancy organ guitar techniques . this reflective , folk-like song escaping problems worries heading off quiet place like seashore , where clouds pass overhead , he walks sand , picks up seashells , feels spirit life , " where i reach my destiny , i feel free , where i my own space " . this album ends third instrumental , " babes woods " . this novelty piece miller , variety musical instruments such strumming guitar , drums , tinkling triangle , flute sounds , bass . it if instruments themselves players , since there no vocals ; flute guitar seem focal point , while triangle , bass , drums background . this mellow performance marks quiet closing this album . together , this album preceding one , would produce nearly enough popular hits construct greatest hits album , which released following year ; well provide considerable material other greatest hits releases came later . steve seemed reach high point his recording career popularity 1976 1977 , remembered these songs , most part . no one else seems able quite mimic steve unique creativity producing these artistic masterpieces .	1

fawlty towers fans going recognize name i'm barcelona -- that what waiter manuel always says explain odd stuff : " i am barcelona ! " but their debut album " let me introduce my friends " nothing like spanish music . instead , this lovable , enormous swedish band sounds sort like cross architecture helsinki polyphonic spree -- sunny , twinkly , shimmery pop music . it opens emanuel lundgren drawling , " daaaaaaamn ! /oversleeping again/daaaaaaaaamn ! /i can't believe i it once again . " he then describes what he'll " make it time . " it mundane topic pop song , but it framed sparkling pop tune full catchy guitar , twinkly xylophone occasional bell chime . songs follow same mold -- lyrics confusion , chicken pox , broken hearts , stamp collecting , finding spot perfect treehouse . songs wrapped them just charming : folky pop , driving guitars , twee little sugarpuffs , shimmery bell-augmented pop , sprawling orchestral sound " olakola . " " let me introduce my friends " basically pop people who like bands slightly sugary sound , but pleasant melody well . " let me introduce my friends " basically all sunshine , spring grass childlike fun -- very charming . you can't really single out any band members , since there almost thirty them , but instrumentation nicely polished solidly played . songs wrapped unstoppable swirling riffs , banjo , solid percussion , sweeps wobbly and/or sputtering synth , rattling bells what sounds like xylophone . lundgren nice smooth voice , although times he sounds bit like he singing nursery rhyme . lyrics bit short simplistic , but they admittedly sum up childlike enthusiasm music ( " you know i can't believe i'm telling everyone i know/that every stamp my collection place we could go ! " ) . " let me introduce my friends " rather simple songwriting , but deliciously twee pop some solid , catchy tunes . nice , unpretentious fun	-1
just what you want sitting under tree : holiday classics set shrill disco backbeats apparently think they're progressive acid jazz downtempo chill . while there few enjoyable tracks here -- extra-spicy mudfish remix already-lively spanish carol " los peces en el rio " genuinely groovable , creative boot -- majority either occasionally-decent ' original ' tunes ( which 99.999% population means " not holiday music " ) or painfully bad electronic mixes your standard holiday standards ( such those bryan ogden , who not only gifts us two tracks under his own name but two more under inexplicable one-off pseudonyms " hot toddy " " nutcracker sweet " ) . also worth noting despite inapplicable album title , these tracks not remixes , but simply original arrangements best existing melodies . if you're looking genuine downtempo holiday chill , check out reindeer room i or ii ; if actual remixes more your flavour , christmas remixed help you get your holiday	-1

if this single containing just tracks 9-10 it would gotten 5 stars .... likewise if it only contained pitchfork early demos . however , new old tracks no business same disc . imo new songs superior most songs new album , could easily replaced some instrumentals covers we got instead . tracks 5-8 great examples lend some insight into evolution tracks tsl . most them use lyrics made their way into other songs their debut album . if anything , this release shows you how much clutch sound changed ( good or bad depending who you ask ) since their first release . it definitely worth getting just new songs alone -- if you don't own original pitchfork it no-braine	-1

import version this remix collection must-have blondie completists because it remixes some songs not here , well alternate mixes some these track , so track listing slightly different . tracks you find " beautiful " not here : 1 . union city blue ( diddy power passion edit ) 4 . heart glass ( diddy adorable illusion mix ) 5 . sunday girl ( hardly handbag mix ) 6 . call me ( debbie dallas ) 9 . hanging telephone ( nose bleed handbag mix ) if you also own all maxi cd singles released time , you'll few mixes beautiful release already , but it good place get those mixes if you missed out cd singles	-1
this ultra-smart , ultra smooth funky beaty stuff . carefully cultivated filtered bring you very essence oozy jazz funk mixture . only negative i say this music really just pure showmanship . herbie hancock piano master good sense arrengements , but lacks bit creativity . no really great melodies here found , just pedantic bouncing funk patterns . everyone else except ( jazz-)nerds like me turned off	-1
i'm camper fan way back -- i played " telephone free landslide victory " my college radio show 1985 . so i loved this record meta-nostalgic reasons -- every song " new roman times " seems informed relevant anything 2005 pitchfork hot 100 . now initial buzz ( i listened almost nothing else week ) worn off , record seem maybe bit under 5-star mark . i scanned best tracks -- " gum you like , " " rr uzbekistan , " " might makes right " -- into itunes enjoying them mp3 format . probably half songs here don't really stand up repeated listening . thing , all camper records like -- moments brilliant , edgy humor interspersed annoying instrumentals/easy jokes/slaps small-minded conservatism . i'm not sure why other reviewers disappointed this compared earlier records . perhaps they're just getting old	-1
this jazz its best . if you , like me , saving your money long time get this , let me tell you it worth it . this best jazz group ever , playing live its peak , great sound , great packaging extensive linear notes . only sad thing after listening this box set , maybe this pinnacle jazz ; i ofthen ask myself when listening these tracks scotch hand : jazz get any better this ?. this set sounds like it could recorded last night . these guys raised bar way too high . one essential box sets jazz my money , best miles box set	1

when anne-sophie mutter lambert orkis boston last fall , i attended concert featured some mozart violin sonatas these recordings . while i enjoyed immediacy live performance , i felt ms. mutter tended overwhelm mr. orkis both volume style . shame because piano parts mozart violin sonatas always least important violin parts . little disappointed , i , however , wowed during encores when suddenly balance appeared . ms. mutter quieter more restrained mr. orkis seemed less constrained . it magical . thus encouraged , i bought copy this cd set , both performers graciously autographed it . arriving home turning music , i stunned ! this much better music than i just heard , even during encores . i don't recall ever enjoying recording more than live concert same music same performers , but there no comparison this case . both ms. mutter mr. orkis soar enthusiastically . . . while also retreating tactfully touchingly where that appropriate . balance two performers almost perfect . some people criticize ms. mutter putting too much passion personal style into classical works . this case , there bit restraint delivering passion style takes mozart composer prior century transforms his music into rewarding emotional presence now . exuberance his genius seems flow both performers they provide modern ( but not too modern ) interpretation this exceptional music . i find myself listening new understanding these sonatas virtually every day . anne sophie-mutter fans , there no doubt this one her top five recordings . if you don't own it , you've missed treat .	1

i believe first three duran duran albums all essential albums any living person this planet , their debut , ' duran duran ' containing their finest style most romantic/bowiesque songs , like ' planet earth ' ' girls film ' . ' seven ragged tiger ' , no matter how great rest songs , made divine ' reflex ' alone , one greatest single songs ever . but then ' rio ' just simply their best album , most consistent surprising one . ' rio , ' hungry like wolf ' , ' save prayer ' ' hold back rain ' all new romantic classics beyond any doubt , great anything produced 1982 ( year visage ' anvil ' , adam ants ' ' friend or foe ' culture clubs ' kissing clever ' , example ) . but what so wonderful this album not much those songs , but they way all songs this record strong enough stand test time alone . coupled together they make one greatest most thrilling albums ever , only one 1982 rival aforementioned anvil ( which rises same qualities ) . all all new romantic classic , if there ever , , i've already said , it one those few new romantic albums , which able sound divine visage , one those very few new romantic albums , visage apart , don't lack consistency all really up there classic bowie doors	1
leftfield long since disbanded , but their sound still around . most their songs still fresh classy enough warrant re-sampling , re-using , re-appropriation . sasha digweed dug them out bin more than once , just before duo daley barnes parted ways , one their tunes ( " song life " ) used movie " tomb raider . " no wonder . this album may old , but even most modern house heads , it lot offer . leftfield ( once refered kirkland crystal method " best electronic band period " ) doesn't break new ground , per se , but they thumpin ' good time ground they're . consider " release pressure , " ethnic , jungle beat number high pipe whistles progressive , organic rhythms . consider " open up , " acid house track whipped into fantastic frenzy clear incriminating voice john lydon ( formerly sex pistols ) . consider " original , " deceptively sweet itchy song , half-trance/half-deep house , burning buzzing tracers synth pop shadows . " black flute " " space shanty " hard-hitting dance numbers , unapologetically grinding out thruster loops against ever-expanding , ever-accelerating energy . these songs don't just encourage dancing -- they almost force it . even when they're not trying tear walls down their infectious beats , leftfield displays kind virtuoso that hard find these days , least such consistent but versatile way . " melt " plays like deep swamp anthem , weaving toneless beats , muted trumpets , high electro-chords unsloughably melancholy ambience . " afro-left " takes tribally techno turn , checkerboarding artful silences robotic wheezes . " inspection ( check one ) " iron-and-wire industrial/reggae jig sounds lifted straight out chemical brothers album . even spots this album could called weak better than much electronica that produced these days . this house fan , it wonderful surprise find album so accomplished so incredibly fun , even more surprise find it over decade old . just when i'd thought i'd heard it all , something worth noting comes flying out leftfield	1

when i first heard this project , my thought " bad idea " . love belinda , but after all , she american learned french somewhat late life , usually means dreadful pronounciation . besides , i wanted pop album . then i got album . my worries pronounciation weren't all wrong , my toes curl times . but then again , belinda voice french marriage made heaven , so amazing poor pronounciation easily ignored . after hearing album once , i decided this completely right , pop album would not . after all , decade passed belinda release awaam she developed since then . but so her fans . must say " sous le ciel de paris " really charming ..	1
here perfect example how attitude changes entire listening experience . easily most bashed work manchester great back catalogue , called worst album 2000 several occasions , slated worthless pink floyd rip-off no standout tracks , standing shoulder represents career low point oasis -- this first true testament band not immortal , not beatles new age , but fact slipping title brit-rockers-in-chief . sigh . it album die-hard radiohead coldplay fans always refer when discussing oasis ' inferiority , blasting noel gallagher " never progressing song writer . " sigh again . i've never really figured out thunderous disapproval album , i ultimately enjoyed most songs . sotsog contain some garbage ? without doubt , but not nearly enough ruin entire experience , or throw oasis off their high horse most critics claim . here're some facts all listeners need aware : 1 ) `f****n ' bushes , ' `go let it out , ' gas panic!' three best songs oasis ' career . wasn't `go let it out ' #1 hit uk , going right alongside `yellow ' even surpassing `optimistic' ? 2 ) biggest problem sotsog occurs format , unusual psychedelic album such this . if there any real unending quandary here , it worst two songs album , `put your money where your mouth ' `little james ' fall numbers 4 5 respectively . these should either left out or positioned differently , perhaps further down line up while moving high qualities , perhaps `roll it over , ' up track listing . 3 ) album without doubt step up here now , which contains five fillers/b-sides whereas sotsog no more than two . 4 ) giants easy listening . oasis flirts easy listening genre several junctures , most notably `wonderwall ' `cast no shadow ' , but usually sticks anthemic indie sometimes hard rock . i believe this album rejected quality oasis many fans due lack guitars overwhelming presence synthesizers . it doesn't always work -- ` put your money where your mouth ' example -- but it definitely different . not only should it respected appreciated fans , but it should praised its boldness . 5 ) although inaccessible times , sotsog flows unlike any other oasis album . this way , it tops both definitely maybe morning glory ? -- daring yet factual assessment . if nothing else , album worth it `f****n ' bushes , ' `go let it out , ' gas panic!' . but underneath surface , it much more than just singles album like predecessor here now ; it flowing , intelligent collection songs tarnished attitude dismissive fans .	-1

some people claim this album not breaking new ground therefore it not great album . i completely disagree . album great song writing amazing performances musicians . while it doesn't offer some instrumentation never tried before , it feature dave writing songs bill frisell mind which results wide array interesting tunes . frisell dream sort etheral spaciness while rock billy featuers hill billy rocabillia groove . both these moods plus many more present album things you might expect bill frisell album . skeeterism based off his young son interpretations blue monk toy piano . this one best albums past few years .	1

" blue valentine " tendency dismissed so called " transitional " album , it sandwiched into period waits ' critically acclaimed early albums his mid-career foray into unique instrumentation free form music his " rain dogs " period . my opinion when waits ' career viewed whole , every one his albums could classified " transitional " works , because man constantly moving forward his music moving into new territory each record he puts out . said , " blue valentine " great underrated album . my opinion title track one most desperate songs waits ever recorded , spare instrumentation waits ' gravelly voice perfectly captures mood paranoia he sings . lyrics song " blue valentines " one best examples waits ' talent songwriter , he describes man who abandoned his lover tracked down her continues receive her letters . lines " it feels like theres warrant out my arrest , you've got me checkin my rearview mirror , i'm always run , thats why i changed my name , i didn't think you'd ever find me here " , his descriptions blind broken heart nights full whiskey true genius . song remained one my favorites his over years . i also think waits ' voice it best this album " heartattack vine " . grit rasp his pipes these two albums unbelievable . other thing " blue valentine " stands out me " $29.00 " , straight up slow blues jam goes little over eight minutes . hear waits use his voice pure blues setting rare , he spits out lyrics his acid growl way would make howlin ' wolf blush . all instrumental solos song tight , i find myself continuing play song again again . " wrong side road " " whistlin ' past graveyard " two others where his voice unbelievable . classic " christmas card hooker minneapolis " waits ' tales down out individuals , jazzy piano accompaniment . i also think " kentucky avenue " one waits ' best ballads , always gives tug my heartstrings when i hear it . me , only turnoff this album waits ' rendition " somewhere " west side story . while it definitely interesting choice him far cover tunes concerned , it just never grabbed me , although i wouldn't say it bad . while critics may say waits didn't break any new ground this album lyrically or musically , i think they missed boat . this solid album , waits melded blues , jazz , symphonic music onto one disc somehow managed tie it all together way makes sense . while this may not fall into category essential tom waits , this good music . i can't make it any simpler than	-1

return frog queen treasure since i first started listening it . i no doubt jeremy enigk would able come up goods second time , very much enthused anticipation arrival world waits upon my doorstep . return frog queen stripped-down departure sunny day real estate frenetic emotional keening later majestic orchestration . it showed side enigk , left its bare essentials , humble personal songwriter . album narrative seemed craft its own realm folklore themes images contained within songs ranging sweeping orchestration minimalist crooked-folk . world waits , rather than departure , seems more amalgam all best parts where enigk come . songs this cd could out takes fire theft , diary , rising tide , or return frog queen . i built up very high expectations this work , once again jeremy enigk earned his place among names i feel most represent creativity inspiration contemporary rock songwriting its finest . if you've ever liked anything jeremy enigk written , you owe yourself hear his latest . let hope he gives us before 2016	1

characteristically memorable remark , r.l. burnside once suggested " blues aint nothin ' but dance music . " considering fiery grooves guys like lightnin ' hopkins or little walter whipped into now then , statement not seem absurd it surface . but what burnside achieves " bothered mind " total inarguable confirmation : if blues anything more than dance music before burnside took torch it , it sure aint nothing more than now , that hardly bad thing . " bothered mind " sound skip james way beastie boys . " i what i want , " burnside spits " detroit boogie part 1 , " opening cacophony launches into electrified snarling take burnside trademark " look what my buddy . " man not kidding . unlike bo diddley blasphemous " this should not , " burnside eclectic brew funk , hip-hop , blues rock tasteful reinvention storied sound anyone could asked . even unfortunate presence kid rock - talentless poser who seems bent mooching off reputation every elder statesman business - cannot distract burnside energetic menacing vocal performance throughout set . this not attempt dressing up older artist sound make him seem hip younger audience . it startlingly successful ( refreshing ) experiment which burnside authenticity never compromised production . bold interpretations standards like " rollin ' tumblin '" or " goin ' away baby " possess addictiveness narcotic . when martin scorsesee blues film box-set came out , there lot talk blues music fading american consciousness , like some relic human expression . most disconcertingly , blues not seem connect younger audiences way rap , hip-hop or even rock . changes now , who better than r.l. burnside lead charge	1

after success mariah carey emotions , music box saw day light 1993 , venturing become mariah best selling album worldwide . music box spawned some mariah biggest hits ; without you , dreamlover hero while also providing mariah carey massive popularity within europe . upbeat bubbly dreamlover released introduce people music box , it landed mariah no . 1 position single chart america . song r'n'b sound it , perhaps indicating mariah already knew what direction she wanted her music steer towards . dreamlover one my favorite songs it this particularly song , which got me interested mariah music . power-ballad hero favorite among many , its uplifting lyrics tad corny childish my liling . yet i never big hero fan ; however it must somewhat impact it managed reach no . 1 america . anytime you need friend clearly one best offerings music box . its gospel-like features choir assisting mariah work perfectly together . title-track not all interesting . fact , many non-released songs blend forgettable . case mariah emotions album , music box also suffers weak ending album . songs such just hold you once again , i've thinking you , all i've ever wanted everything fades nice songs ; however i tend skip them . sure , they listenable - yet i cannot remember what they sound like until i actually hear them myself . now i know never forget you enjoyable songs . now i know distinguishes itself rest songs album . its fast pace contagious beat makes song welcoming offering . never forget you babyface production - just think madonna take bow , tlc red light special diggin you well toni braxton breathe again - which , my opinion , far superior songs never forget you . despite corny lyrics , slowly mid-tempo never forget you not all bad . i still enjoy listening it despite its flaws . without you probably mariah biggest hit europe , landing miss carey her first uk no . 1 . it powerful ballad , which surely displays mariah carey ability take cover version make it her own . i not consider music box among mariah carey best albums , yet it certainly not among her worst . singles definitely highlights album : dreamlover , hero , anytime you need friend without you . they reasons buying album . however , there too many dull average ballads . buy mariah carey greatest hits , if you newcomer her music . however , music box nice record among your other carey albums . overall rating : 7/10	-1

leisure debut album blur , most important english rock band last 15 years . more creative than oasis ( hey , who isn't ? ) more innovative than radiohead ( beating them punch 1997 1999 ) , this album would seem landmark , right ? well , no . certainly weakest blur albums , this one still some great cuts , like she so high , there no other way , bad day , birthday , repetition . however , damon albarn yet discover his lyrical gift go his melodic genius . album whole quite listenable its entirety , but suffers simply too many producers . definitely worthwhile checking out , but their weakest , especially compared their later triumphs . if you live usa it worth getting uk version simply sing , american version i know ... get ' em both	-1
although i don't much classical music i appreciate occasional seranade . there certain times lend more listening this type music so maybe why they came up night-night title . it extremely relaxing if you not careful or too tired you might begin cutting some zzz . actually i find this perfect music reading before bedtime it stimulates just enough perk your attention but doesn't grab it take you away concentrating your book . although i'm not big classical music person some music sounds very familiar so maybe those know you might recognize some old wolfgang best or most well known works . after looking over liner notes credits it seems most these recording older but put together here theme . some recording date back far 1970 newest 1994 . i guess this classical music novice , sort compilation some his adagio , andannte larghetto . now if i only knew how differenciate these identifying terms ! it just sounds real soothing . price right people just dabble this type music occasionally not hard core serious classical music listeners . it part phillips classics releases includes whole line various major composers music set theme . example , they one mozart more lively entitled quot ; mozart morningquot ; . i guess anytime right time hearing some these symphonies . try it you just might like it	-1

i'm minority , but " like prayer " isn't top-to-bottom masterpiece suggested other reviewers . not say there isn't lot here like ... there ... some it ranks amongst her best recordings ever . shoot , " express yourself " one great singles ever , anyone . but there few things go wrong here . first off , first time , she takes her voice places she not ready yet . listen this , then " i'm breathless " , then " evita " then " ray light . " her voice , during certain passages " like prayer " , gets wobbly . there range notes she tries hold can't . it same octave she can't hold " promise try " . she shrill " spanish eyes . " second , some songs aren't knock-it-out-of-the-park pop classics we've come expect . but those relatively minor points . " like prayer " justifiably lauded pop anthem , but it stills pales comparison epic " express yourself . " this song sounded awesome first five-hundredth time you hear it . but " love song " ... mount rushmore meeting two decade ... nay , century ... music icons , prince madonna , results ho-hum , minimally melodic time waster . other hand , confessionals go , it hard expose yourself any more than " til death us part " . man , if this isn't sean penn ... then madonna way better actress than we ever expected . " promise try " weak " live tell . " nuff said . " cherish " magnificent pop achievement ... easy ears , simple fun ... video just plays your head forever . i love " dear jessie " . i think it cute . it almost kids ' song ... pink elephants lemonade , " la-la-la " background , calliope-like synthesizers . " oh father ' tease ; how autobiographical she getting here ? song , strictly speaking , it not much ... but it sure interesting listen armchair analyze . " keep it together " sounds like outtake first two madonna albums , that compliment . " spanish eyes ' kinda awful , " act contrition " added-on , edited-together sound collage . you'll never listen more than once , i guarantee . cd desperately need remaster . but sheer number songs unavailable her compilations , you're gonna need get this one too ..	-1
since so many people written reviews , let me just say various records aphex twin , this my all time favorite remix album . i love many types music but this gotham project best electronic music i heard . ( course , i might prefect varese but music long ago . ) evidentally i write more since amazon not want accept this review . let see , i could talk each track but many already or i could compare it suzuki or other remixes dorfmeister . i like suzuki lot but prefer these sessions . i don't know much kruder but could search .	1
i admit , i never saw " passion christ " nor i any desire other than i know story so why would i want see glorified violent version it big screen ? only reason i own copy film score film simply because i love music . when i saw trailers film couple years ago , music really stood out especially during crucifixion scene . john debney film score reminds me hans zimmer lisa gerrard work " gladiator " film bit dead dance middle eastern influences music . orchestral film score truly epic proportions . john debney certainly knows music play important key role movies . despite not seen film , titles tracks match songs themselves . i almost envision emotions characters particular scene song accompanies . regardless my personal feelings actual film , i absolutely love music " passion christ " .	1

what said converge ? rather , what left said ? since they debuted 1994 , nobody able match this massachusetts ' quintet jaw-dropping intensity , scalding energy , raw urgency , innovative songwriting , godly musicianship , brain-scrambling technicality . so why should things any different now ? " no heroes , " their sixth record , flat-out amazing . although it recaptures much same intensity before , it no means tries rehash past glories . instead , this album takes everything great band before simultaneously expands their dynamic range adding ... get this ... texture even little harmony ! shocked ? i know i am ! that not say , however , vast majority " no heroes " isn't massive , brutally devastating trainwreck . fact , some it might converge most ferocious stuff date . frenetic , belligerent riffing , hammering , rapid-fire drums , rigid bass lines , rabid , atonal screams constantly run amuck , listener engulfed wave after wave furious , visceral aggression . converge musical abilities astounding , but it even more impressive they never sound like product studio perfection -- every song here brimming live energy genuine urgency . since it would take days cover all album meticulous details , nuances , nooks crannies , i'll limit myself describing only biggest highlights . crowbar-reminiscent " heartache , " which pounding beat , menacing feedback , doomy , earth-shaking riffs , strong set opener . later , " sacrifice " very caustic number guitar leads grumble like lawn mower engine , remarkably fast , driving blast beats , piercing , hellish shrieks ; " vengeance " propelled streamlined , smoke-inducing buzzsaw guitars deft , walloping drums ; title track explosive , ear-splitting , take-no-prisoners onslaught notable bass work . " grim heart/black rose " quite possibly best most infectious memorable epic converge ever written . slow acoustic strums beginning ethereal , frontman jacob bannon sweet , limpid , sometimes soaring vocals positively mindblowing . first two-thirds this song gentle restrained , wealth texture , sunny melody , unbelievable harmony , but electric power chords storm back onto scene around six minutes , they eventually erupt into full metallic fury near end . after such raging slabs chaotic dissonance 2004 " you fail me " 2001 " jane doe , " it seemed converge going last band earth consider experimenting semi-pleasant or agreeable sounds . but they , results stunning . even though math/noise/hardcore album touch melody wasn't totally unheard before now ( see dillinger escape plan " miss machine " norma jean " redeemer " proof ) , " no heroes " still sounds unique novel . but then again , this one smartest most inventive amazing bands last fifteen years , so we should probably never underestimate what they're capable . " no heroes " utterly brilliant , masterful , vigorous , engrossing thrill ride start finish . now question : how world they ever going top this one ?	1

my wife got this cd me because i like music movie cast away . she saw words quot ; cast awayquot ; large prominent print . she saw picture tom hanks , very large . she assumed it soundtrack movie not just 10th track 10 cd . hindsight she should read entire panel cd . i guess producers this cd didn't think rest music could stand its own so they deceptively packaged it this way figuring most people wouldn't waste time returning it . if you it listed rate column , i would give it negative rating instead just one star	-1

band , byrds one greatest certainly one most influential bands rock roll history . adding legacy , " mr. tamborine man " status one greatest debut albums rock history almost without question . this band could it all ; country , folk , rock , jam , psychedelica , etc , etc . this debut perhaps pinnacle their achievements . though they would venture into much more adventurous territory ( " notorious byrd brothers " ) , this where band most solid , most tight collectively . dylan influence everywhere get-go ; 4 his songs span album , including title track which byrd turned into his only #1 hit . elsewhere , there two other covers , but songs best longevity originals , mostly penned gene clark . witness tortured romance " i'll feel whole lot better " " here without you " tell me he wasn't great songwriter . roger mcguinn ( or jim , if you like ) quick finding his signature nasally croon would go influence tom petty , among others . obviously , not everyone found their place ; songs chris hillman david crosby nowhere found . but " mr. tamborine man " stand today every bit tall early works dylan beatles . this album set standard folk-rock then , buffalo springfield rem toad wet sprocket most current emo bands . overall : 10 out 10	1

my only real frame reference movie sinatra brando . maybe not best campare , even so i say , exception nathan lane faith prince , performances cd lacked life i would expected . maybe it effect he going suave , worldly gambler , but peter gallagher sky masterson just came across bored . his voice also not quality i would expected broadway-caliber performer . i almost hate admit it , but i even prefer brando rendition " luck lady " over one this cd . movie version " sit down , you're rockin ' boat " also far superior . some " sky " songs ( complete songs , not snippets/samples ) also found peter gallagher web site . i found cd my local library , so i avoided pay disappointment . i would recommend you try borrow copy before deciding whether it actually worth buying	1
this impressive effort . this cd played fairly constantly my car past 3 weeks . what impresses me i consistently find new bits stand out depending my mood . there some great grooves , brilliant fills , rocking riffs classic eric johnson style first movement , ' prelude ' . opener ' bloom ' ' good me ' probably highlights there . mr. johnson then turns it down bit during ' courante ' , second movement . ' sad legacy ' ' my heart ' both great introspective songs . ' sad legacy ' builds sense urgency ' my heart ' mellower , rb feel nice jazzy runs . these two probably my favorites off album . last movement , ' allemande ' starts off nice old-school style jazzy number , ' hesistant ' . ' magnetized ' gets things rocking again , before very good atmospheric classical guitar piece , ' ciel ' ends ride . eric plays wide variety styles this release manages keep it all together one cohesive piece , one small exception . tribute jerry reed , while nice bit picking doesn't fit this cd me , especially after sitar ' cruise nile ' . i'd recommend this cd anyone who enjoyed ah via musicom or venus isle . or , if you aren't familiar eric johnson already , then yourself favor pick up cd . this one good any his studio albums start off .	1
i fan sting ever since i college . i actually got see him person late 80 . i just every cd he ever put out so when this one i ran right out bought it . every song it great it one my most favorite cd i own .	1
this actually first lp album i ever bought over thirty years ago . i listened it again after very long time when this remastered version released . i think some hype said this album way overblown , although it very good record one seventies most notable also-rans . some ian hunter dylanesque dylanisms overly dylany , " ballad mott " " i wish i your mother " , but overall strength songwriting outweighs his croaking out his sometimes clumsy lyrics . worth owning immortal " all way memphis " alone , but rest album fun ride .	1
i saw this band concert nickleback - they fabulous ! cd just great . lead singer similarity steven tyler	1
their follow up 2005 " rock ages " complation , def leppard decided release covers album " yeah " pay tribute their influences . bands credit they stay away most artists they chose covers biggest hits , when they could easily choose songs where better known . i only knew around four songs before i heard " yeah " . i find " yeah " what good covers album should . band turns their influences makes many songs into their own . highlights include : no matter what , 20th century boy , hanging telephone , hellraiser . phil collen vocal stay me awesome , it sounded so much like rod stewart . " yeah " good album old new fans def leppard . there little something everyone " yeah "	1
let me start saying after endless exposure karl jenkins ' most famous work ( " diamond forever " commercial theme ) , i doubted i'd ever like anything he wrote . i am glad say i mistaken . jenkins ' requiem without question modern work , although its mold probably bit closer britten war requiem , or even herbert howells ' " hymnus paradisi " , than other modern requiems , such those faur , durufl , or rutter . jenkins ' use haikus japanese -- his intertwining haikus text near end -- add extra dimension work , even though those movements substantially different sound than rest work . even " dies irae , " its unusual orchestration ( i won't spoil surprise ) , success . fact there no well-known names here doesn't matter ; orchestral choral sounds both excellent . better still , rather than making this sole work cd , emi adds " these stones horizons sing , " work sung partly welsh , which rounds out this disc more marvelous melodies , particular , ending third track , " gray " . [ please note track listing above incorrect . ] fans jenkins ' music definitely want this disc . i look forward hearing more his music myself	1
this album , several jarrett other albums completely improvised . you imagine how difficult it must just sit down piano play 26 minutes render something this exceptional ? problem some reviewers casting negative comments based repetitiveness absurd . many parts this work not even melodic . i highly recommend i 0:00 - 16:00 , iia , iic . there many parts these works melodic -not- repetitive . trick this sort improvisational music transitions . jarrett able create logical transitions sometimes flounder bit ... you think , " oh boy , i think he lost it here ... " then he starts something completely new rescues piece , blazes new trail , but still succeeds maintaining original thematic element or melody piece . i literally probably listened i 100 times , i learn something new every time . it actually possible sit down piano play some song ear , except crazy runs here there . i've read this bestselling all jarrett work , it easy see why . you imagine stepping into concert hall koln germany one night , not any idea what this pianist going play or if you invested your money well ticket ? no idea what he going play . yet he pounds out this collection music ? this type improvisation what i would liken impressionistic art . when you try paint photorealistically , you stay lines copy something exactly ; just classical or some jazz music . this album collection notes splashed canvas order unplanned , chaotic , -beautiful- .	1
human beings this wonderful opportunity because suffering . instead constantly resisting dissatisfaction , trying sweep it under carpet or lament grieve it pained it , we should grateful it . it our very best teacher . ~ ayya khemathe soundtrack elements wicked sense humor darker elements plot , like suddenly first track ; playful music stops scratch record turns more ominous . times music lullaby qualities or mood child room music box playing background . sense peace quiet presents moments great beauty , but there always ominous element lurking beneath notes waiting create those nagging feelings doubt . reptile room track beautiful exotic , while unpleasant incident track sounds like track horror movie or someone running danger . you may start see movie running through your mind various points even if you only seen it once . sheer cacophony some pieces takes angst entire new levels . it all quite wonderful if you enjoyed movie you might enjoy soundtrack its own even more . ~ therebeccareview.com	1

his unique blend folk , bluegrass americana very soothing . some his song titles kind strange , but when you listen actual songs they all make sense . he one my new favorite artists . i like him because he his own signature sound . music today all phoney bands carbon copies . banjo interesting sound , i never really listened it other albums before listening this album . i don't see this music mainstreram , but thats whats so good it , hopefully it never get played out loose it indie charm	1
arguably their greatest album ever . it so many different musical styles it unbelieveble . many consider check your head better effort but this good they ever go t.t his album gets my personal vote best album 1994	1
not just hip hop its best , but music its best ! if you love music , you'll love this cd . it considered true classic one day	1
clapton god : this grafitti time . no other guitar player called god ... except maybe jimi hendrix ... importance record , reviewer chuck voellinger says it all . anyone who ever laid hands guitar should study this record first . it essential , although i think album layla clapton his best ever .	1
i little suspicious ensemble so hiply marketed boac , but this really enjoyable recording beautiful piece riley . it striking think while europeans producing such moving ( often beautiful ) pieces angst alienation , horror war-weary self-loathing , riley came up this piece so inventive yet so sunny simply beautiful . easy connections glass reich , course , but it also reminds me various kronos quartet recordings ( oddly ) mccartney experiments sound textures fireman : rushes . recommended curious those arriving contemporary chamber orchestral music way pop rock	1
i made my way sufjan stevens way iron wine . this cd suggested me friend , i must say it some most hauntingly beautiful songs i've heard quite while . i am not big fan sufjan newer work , which evidently puts me minority . i wish he wouldn't abandoned intimate , acoustic style dominates seven swans . he lot say , says it very well just acoustic guitar minimal arrangements . i would suggest this cd anyone who enjoys artists such iron wine , elliot smith , or . ward ...... good acoustic guitar , strong songs , lyrics go beyond jack johnson 5th grade drible . i only hope sufjan makes his way back this style , least once while .	1
i honest . first time i heard they're only chasing safety , i only liked one song , i said myself , this screamo crap , it all felt like it same . only song i liked boy brushed red ; it . some reason i started listening it again , some point album just clicked me . i started like more songs each time i listened it . me least , when i actually listened it open mind , i found something amazing something i missed before . this album just pure engergy . its not best album ever made , its not groundbreaking or totally original , nor it music look deeply analyze . what it tho , crack music form . its full energy , catchy hooks , great riffs , raw power emotion . believe me , this energy music if there ever any . it pumps me up , i love listening it my car . it music you just feel , you don't think it . it really gets under your skin you can't stop listening it . you give album credit when it you . kudos . i havn't got sick it yet , so says something it well . i'm not really into hardcore/screamo , but this really well record , it hit you hard . believe me	1
this excellent album . first , it sounds mediocre-but give it time ! easy silence one best songs i've ever heard	1
most god awful cd i ever listened . i bought it randomly cd store , it huge waste money . i like some bands really messy ( like guitar wolf ) , but this just garbage . it isn't even understandable . it isn't music , it noise . i can't believe these guys got record deal . don't believe anyone says it good . if you buy this album you seriously regret it	-1

owned this album well over two years i figured it time finally write review . if you don't know who dave attell , you must living under really big rock or don't cable ... which i guess same thing . attell portly alcoholic host comedy central ' insomniac ' also one , if not , funniest standup comics working scene today . now , dave attell isn't really everyone . some people some reason feel need politically correct attell most definitely not pc . his humor somewhat focused following topics : poop , midgets , ugly women , alcohol , sex , child abuse , homophobia . covers it . he not political . he not trying make any social statements . he just very funny(and vulgar)comic who timing , delivery , subject matter make you crap your pants laughter . ' skanks ... ' flat-out single best comedy album ever released . it simply hilarious beginning end . attell riffs how defensive women , his midget buddy , getting lonely bug personal favorites . but entire album consistently hilarious . go buy it right now . man brilliant you won't disappointed . i've listening it over two years its still funny . i'm just waiting second album ..	1
every song this cd great . i would definately recommend it	1

" neruda " one most creative interesting albums released 2004 . among other questions , it raised this one : what luciana souza possibly encore ? same question raised 1969 who " tommy " , first popular " rock opera . " encore , course , consisted who going back its roots one greatest rock albums ever recorded , " who next . " , same way , luciana souza gone back her roots this , her second album brazilian duets various brazilian guitarists . like " who next " , this one not disappoin t.t his album recorded ms. souza ( sans percussion , voice only ) four guitarists : romero lubambo , marco pereira , swami , jr. ( yep , that his name , fellow americans ) guilherme monteiro . every cut sounds heavenly . this album remind you laurindo almeida astrud gilberto , only it better -- basically because ms. souza far superior singer , imo . special note four tracks . " trocando en mudos " same sense longing desire permeated " neruda " disc . but lest you think ms. souza only " moody " , listen how she clips guitarists " sambadalu ( para luciana souza ) " " chorino pra ele . " ( fact , great vocal exercise vocal jazz ensemble would all singers double try keep up ms. souza latter ! )and then there last track , " voce . " rather than acoustic , mr. monteiro swithces electric guitar , pedals , creates this vast , open sound similar creations bill frisell or ben monder . vocalization it tremendous . terrific end terrific album . highly recommended .	1
i over 50 boxed sets , far this best packaged i ever seen . i shown all my friends all very impressed . it comes conventional sized women hat box carrying rope . you remove lid open box , 4 cd individual cardboard cd cases centered box black felt cardboard material filling round box . round lid listings songs artists , top 4 cd 200 page booklet pertinent information each artist song . there pictures almost every artist , well pictures original 45 labels . bios artists songs informational entertaining . each cd many familiar songs many never heard before , including songs big name artists released before they became successful . 2 examples : song cher , written sonny , released 2 years before they released " i got you babe . " pop song released 1964 dolly parton before she became country star . there 120 songs 4 cd most ignored totally radio . there only one song out 120 i absolutely hated ; rest not only listenable , but most cases very good excellent . this definitely worthwhile purchase if you're into sixties music .	1

although i loved-loved clash ( saw them ' 82 ) , i admit , after initial brief orientation joe strummer solo work mid ' 90 , i mistakenly put him aside . big mistake . then , joe tragically died few years back . year ago i friend place party i caught music playing , which sounded like joe voice but music so friggin ' hip sounding . wow !, i said when i told it joe strummer mescaleros . much music connaisseur i am , point i felt very inadequate . then , streetcore , x-ray , go-go permanent staples my cd player . remarkable thing they never get played out no matter how many times i hear them . combination acoustic electronic instruments punk style vocals various rhythms beats greatest thing i've ever , ever heard last , oh , 20 years . i get little older , i welcome mellower sounding music , especially if it punk soul great lyrics . streetcore other mescalero recordings best both worlds also totally versatile . they good parties , chilling out , driving , cleaning house , or just spacing out . i typically give cd i like 5 star ratings . well global go-go , rock art x-ray style , streetcore , all masterpieces music deserve their own category beyond ratings . rip joe . this music never die .	1

catherine wheel ( ) one my favorite bands , so i'd like guide new listeners toward what i consider their greatest album ( despite opinions certain ferment fans this forum ) -- chrome . best songs chrome ( particular , " broken head " " pain " ) reach absolute pinnacle " shoegazer , " known its sensuous walls atmosphere derived primarily mutated guitar textures . ferment contain cw signature song blueprint things come , " black metallic , " worthy underground hit still one their best songs ever . but most other songs this cd not represent their best songwriting , perfectly honest . while " i want touch you " " she my friend " good songs , " shoegaze " sound underdeveloped these tracks it most ferment . i consider ferment evolutionary step toward majestic brilliance chrome ( see my review , if you so choose ) , not good but still worthy addition my cd collection , considered whole , more consistent album than chrome . however , you should note my opinion may rather unorthodox according your typical cw acolyte . unorthodox view : i like actual songs happy days more than ones ferment ( overall ) even though they largely abandoned shoegazer sound happy days . therefore , you might want take my opinion grain salt ( you should all opinions , really ) . .	1

hey , i love west coast , well california ( hope live there one day ) . i believe they come most creative hip hop game , try support anything they . but you not know how mad i am this album ! when i heard dogg pound comming new album , i couldn't wait cop it , because comming some veterans west coast ( my favorites i might add ) , i high expectations this . this very dissapointing album . i guess flaws right my face . i really don't want accept fact west coast fell off , i keep beliving they're going get back their feet , but this keeps sending me few steps backwards . basically spotlight reviewer " constant " made perfect statement this album . this trio rhymes skills kinda bad lately like song " sittin 23 " . it like each member tries rhyme , they okay some points , but fail most time . songs like " hard hoe " " fake***hoes " just horrible . album name " cali iz active " you'd think they would bring many west coast artists this album , but they didn't . lady rage , rbx , nate dogg , ice cube appear this , but fact david banner , . diddy , pall wall this damages albums image . also many reviewers stated , they're rhyme style hasn't really changed since 1992 . now thats huge problem . there some good tracks this here , when i say " good " , i mean they barely pass listenable . i believe self titled track " cali iz active " good one well how they brought all artists west video shoot , i hoped it would like album . although many beats not west coast like , they still little nodding like " keep it gangsta " although lady rage outshines kurupt daz . " it all hood " one those " good " songs here ( i meantioned what i meant " good " ) . overall , this not good album . me this huge dissapointment . i denied my self kept believing this good album , but i heard it over over again , it got worse worse . if anyone remembers when west top rap game , knows this not way you bring it back . new listeners , who unfamiliar it domination might like this album . i can't accept this all . lyrics : cproduction : c-guest appearances : c-musical vibes : doverall : c-favorite tracks : cali iz active , slow your roll , don't sweat it , honorable mention tracks : keep it gangsta , throwin up da	1
i just love lead guitar work " desolation row . " lead guitar punches up dylan voice those surreal lyrics make this song like no other . i shudder whole eleven minutes every time my husband plays this song he plays it lot . you never get tired this . mr. dylan really raised bar this one . " like rolling stone " rocker extrodinaire it goes six minutes , which big deal when it came out , because most hit records never when over something like three minutes , ten seconds . dylan really broke mold " stone " , opened up scene others record long songs . this super cd . one you just own	1

i opportunity get early glimpse cd found it fairly good session . i say because it not gerald best work , but definitely not his worst . i am true fan gerald music eagerly wait anticipation each release which seems come every two years after several years back back projects . what you like this project title track `new beginnings ' featuring patrice rushen which brings back fond old school memories grover washington jr. also , `last but not least ' catchy beat you tapping your feet ( i see this one getting some radio air time ) . but gerald really shows his sax ability his rendition `georgia my mind ' . `i need you ' `all love ' puts little modern day vocalize rhythm cd . he gets somewhat funky `big shoes ' `we got groove ' which turned out quite enjoyable deserves radio air time . other selections ok best . cd good mix , good enough add your collection , but if you looking " live birdland west ' you may wait couple more years . ~ jazzeone	1
i pleasantly surprised how good this album . every song its own hook , its own sound . not all songs fast hard ( although ones , good ) . good melodies impassioned singing . one best albums early ' 80s	1
soundgarden my favourite band but i never decide what my favourite soundgarden album it really just depends my mood but non soundgarden lovers it probably depends more your taste music because each soundgardens albums very different . if you like heavy dirty grunge you'll like this album , something cleaner more arty superunknown , something more 80 ultramega ok or louder than love summer psychedelic feel get down upside . every soundgarden album great so get them all because you can't judge them one album	1

i am huge fan psychedelic furs early work . i believe sleep comes down , love my way sister europe absoletly flawless . despite brilliant musicianship unique lyrics dark , brooding cinematic feel , reall draw furs best work richard butler inspired rasp . many compared him bowie , indeed two men share some vocal similarities . however , while mr. bowie unafraid jump latest production trend or bandwagon when it comes his latter day records ( few early ones ) butler pretty much stuck his guns far guitar , bass , drum , keyboard configuration his output . all changed , what change it ! glorious atmospherics mixed his usual brooding lyrics order day . but wait , high end register his voice ? rasp buried underneath sweet , almost plaintif vulnerable lilt ? who this creature where he hiding so many years . standout album one modern musics most influential under-appreciated singers . but whole album - every track standout !	1
i've reading over reviews , i'd say most them completely miss point . i don't think too many people buying this album care whether these songs pieces musical genius or not , they're meant entertaining kids ( kidz even title ) . if you're going complain who they get sing these songs i'd say you're probably already over age range this album targeting . play this kids , they'll love it . they able dance sing , both which great because we should getting our kids interested music . furthermore , you don't need go scavenging clean versions everything or pay bunch money tons albums . now all you older people , unless you're idea great musical talent what found radio today , then i'd call these better than originals ! let face it , most stuff radio joke ... really these kids terrible singers ( they're mostly shouting ... just like all kids ) . so i'd say they're making songs originally bad worse funny . which much more entertaining than just bad . :	1

i'm sure there very little i say this double album hasn't already said . this pure masterepiece -- elton john his absolute best . elton 40 some lp releases over past 37 years , goodbye yellow brick road his top work my opinion . there some come close -- madman across water , honky chateu , rock westies come mind -- but they can't quite touch this gem . songs here not only musical but visual -- if crating movie blind . list song titles here incredible . it basically consist who who elton john songs . many familiar funeral friend/love lies bleeding , benny jets , harmony , candle wind , title track . there also wonderful lesser known songs . one which comes mind funky rocker , dirty little girl -- one my favorites years . if you could own no other elton john album , this would one choose . easily par beatle white album or stones , exile main street , goodbye yellow brick road remained one rock most valuable creations past 33 years	1
this collection mixed bag . biggest problem i title . i am unsure how they decided these 16 songs " biggest " hits , but it obvious many other worthy johnny cash songs left off cd . if you looking more comprehensive collection , i recommend either " essential johnny cash , " which 16 tracks , or " legend " boxed set , which more than 100 songs . best this collection introduction johnny cash . many my favorite johnny cash songs included this collection . " i walk line " made famous anew recent movie same name . note how bass guitar used this song . " don't take your guns town " more spoken than sung , classic country there . " ring fire " classic cash song , written june carter merle kilgore . " folsom prison blues " seemed ever-present radio 60s . carl perkins song " daddy sang bass " late 60s hit cash . " boy named sue " mega-hit cash 1969 both country pop charts , seemed every it combined light-hearted humor cash down-to-earth style . i am unhappy this version song because one portion bleeped out . funny song nearly impossible learn radio " one piece time , " story how auto worker built cadillac parts procured piece time over more than 30 years . course this collection includes many more songs . many these songs received lot airplay helped secure cash early entry into rock roll hall fame , country music hall fame , songwriters hall fame , one very few people who inducted all three ( hank williams , sr. jimmie rodgers others date this review ) . difficulty singer such cash , who received numerous country music awards , grammy awards other awards , there so much music choose meets requirements " best . " thus , this cd should never called " best " because it not . if you really looking " best " real justice johnny cash , try either " essential johnny cash " or " legend " boxed set . price both makes either worthwhile , particularly if you looking something more than just tantalizing introduction one most influential singers music history .	1

i always heard godspeed you ! black emperor certain friends mine record critics hailing their brilliance , but i didn't really give them much listen until few months ago , when i downloaded songs " east hastings " " dead flag blues " off internet . i amazed what i heard : slow , mournful almost classical musical pieces haunting violins heavily reverbed guitar , giving way repeated melody until it climaxes into powerful burst sound , then simmering back into beauty it started . i truly impressed . i then bought their first album , #a #oo , it one finest debut albums i've ever heard . after i listened it few months , i decided get their most recent album , yanqui u.x.o. , it one best albums i heard long time . starters , it very different gy ! . older material very basic idea ( build-build-release ) , it always worked , but this time around , gy ! decided play around their formula . there no found vocals album ( where older material sound clips various movies interviews ) , some material doesn't repeat much early stuff . opener , " 9-15-00 " closest thing early godspeed . slow mournful guitar melody gives way more instruments varying melody , then repeating central hook until song explodes noise , then simmering into long ambient section . song divided into two tracks , which great if you want hear particular part . " rockets fall rockets fall " new step collective . spooky sounding echoed guitar begins song , followed sad violin heavily phased guitar , not sounding too far wendy carlos ' evil soundtrack clockwork orange . after long section scary bleak chords , we treated simulation bomb falling down clarinets tubas providing descend . then , timpani plays slow harrowing beat , all members slowly play very eerie sounding melody , very much like soundtrack 1960 sci-fi movie end world ( planet apes , perhaps ? ) . then , song explodes out nowhere , we back apocalypse , all bombs rockets bursting , signalling end human race . pretty bleak stuff . " motherf***er = redeemer " quite different anything gy ! past . droning xylaphone begins song , sounding lot like sigur ros new album , there , song begins . we treated lot fragile guitar work , song once again gets louder , but then real treat comes . song become quiet long long time , fragile guitar beginning slow bass lines coming through speakers , lulling you sleep . then , amazing second part comes , funky ( very suprising ! ) bassline coming , gy ! playing very sad deafining music funk groove playing background . it quite different anything they've yet , i applaud them new risks they took album . this their best work yet , i cannot wait next album come out , though i'm not sure when it come out . if they though , i hope it step right direction this album shown . gy ! can't wrong ever	1

i bought this cd 1995 , it great friend these past ten years . i'm not dance music kinda guy , but i make exception new order ( or future sound london ! ) , their music not devoid substance vast majority music exists make us shake our rumps . there hard-to-define melancholy running through much this music , almost mystical feeling . i often find myself quietly singing these songs am not surprised when they conjure up some strange emotions , or longing ache solar plexus . " vanishing point " always reminded me william blake .	1
one those albums you cannot stop listening . beautiful melodies , crunchy beats - really nice amalgamation electronic acoustic instrumentation .	1
this one first dark ambient albums i ever exposed , but remains my current rotation albums its incredible textures balance ominous beautiful . pairing robert rich brian williams ( lustmord ) somewhat odd one , robert rich ambient stylings always leaned more towards ethereal worldbeat genres execution ( though final product fortunately strays quite far confines those genres ) lustmord built his name sort proto-industrial sound engineer creator dark , abrasive musique concrete . however , their pairing make incredible textured dark listen . what album lacks abrasiveness , it makes up its ability instill feeling foreboding listener . this isn't quite lines most dark ambient , but nonetheless fantastic album surprisingly great pairing . admittedly , i've fallen away robert rich style quite bit late , this album his strata collaboration steve roach remained two favorite albums mine i discovered myself last year	1
i found this band looking music resembled bravery , depeche mode , few my other favorite bands . while ' i love you ... " different band altogether , i very happy add this album my collection . music very dreamy even though song start strong bass or drum riff , you surprised how song descend into calming soundscape . me , this band perfect listen when you mood relax . not gym music . newbies band should check out their first single " according plan " . me , i don't particularly favorite song because album blends together so well i simply enjoy it whole ( although one would pleased check out " we choose faces " ) . this one album you happy say you own , band you proud say you started listening before they hit it big .	1
i bought this cd , almost immediately after i saw " dance me , " theaters , back 1998 . though , film left me cold , songs continued sizzle my memory , resonated my steps dance floor . some best songs this album include : " magalenha , " great sergio mendes tune utilized dance competition sequence film . it lively samba , gets you up your feet moving . " atrevete ( no puedes conmigo ) " dark latin groove awesome , sizzling salsa , combining fiery vocals huey dunbar , salsa/reggae elements fragancia james " da barba . " what shame those guys broke up ........ overall , this cd combines soft ballads up-tempo dance numbers . it great background music party . only reason i didn't give it five stars because luke warm bonus cuts ( " suavemente " remix elvis crespo -- which sounds too repetitive " pantera en libertad " monica naranjo , which just sounds like she screaming -- no real melody ) . you definitely need get this album , well , because it just too flavorful resist !	1

metalheads , this album classic ! there absolutely nothing like this when it came out . even though band last two albums heavy their time , this album kicked heaviness up notch . several notches fact ! exciter metal classic , perfect opener . rob wails like there no tomorrow solos here rule . gotta love double bass les binks throws here . this old school speed metal , no kidding ! white heat red hot slows things down , but still stays heavy . this track pretty darn catchy , i love rob vocals here . better you better than me catchy tune , but it cover spooky tooth song . i love guitar here , sounds like classic rock rather than heavy metal but it still rocks ! savage starts off some high yells rob this song just smokes , chorus definitely highlight . how heck man reach those notes ? heavy riffs here too ! invader starts off some cool guitar effects ( sounds like ufo landing ) goes into kick ass song darn catchy chorus , i know you sing this one yourselves ! even guitar solo catchy ! saints hell heavy song . riffs here so heavy , i mean they practically beat you upside head . i love it when rob shrieks " wake dead , saints hell ! " you know you love ! heroes end some killer riff-work , just flat out rocks . stained class famous galloping riff we all know love some notes rob hits here amazing ! guitar solo here very melodic , i love it when , towards end , song gets heavier . back then , those probably some heaviest riffs ever heard ! beyond realms death f*cking masterpiece . acoustic work beautiful , when song picks up rob begins his yelling , your mind blown i guarantee it ! no one convey emotion rob during slow parts ! glenn solo breathtakingly emotional , while . . ' fast paced crushing . it all ends rob brilliant shriek " beyond realms death " . very nice . bonus tracks include cool live version better you better than me fire burns below . it nice keyboard playing very experimental . too bad it wasn't released earlier ( i hear it meant turbo or ram it down , i can't remember ) . i am sorry but you need this album if you want metalhead , this pushed metal light years beyond what it time . no one else played these heavy riffs all . so buy this album enjoy what these guys gave us	1

this album largely underappreciated when it first came out . but truth it improves springsteen first record , " greetings asbury park , " practically every aspect . bruce vocals stronger more confident . street band rhythm section improved . this especially noticeable funky , upbeat numbers like " street shuffle " " kittys back " , where you vividly imagine crowd getting into groove bars clubs band likely playing time . slower songs better well , example " sandy " blows away " mary queen arkansas " - draggy ballad first album . lyrics also grew , words became less derivative dylan more uniquely bruce , especially his ability convey beauty ugliness life jersey boardwalk . finally , " rosalita " comes roaring through best song bruce written up this point . here all romance , adventure courage youth bruce calls out rosie leave her overprotective family join him highway , where they escape " swamps jersey " seek out " pretty little place southern california " he dreams . course , this search freedom escape powerful theme which continues resonant springsteen future music . this record also marked transitional phase , bruce began leave behind flowerly words experimental sounds create tighter , more precise lyrics music his later albums . but , bruce " glory days " jersey shore this record highlight	1

face dances should never made . townshend , who chief songwriter , put all his best post-moon material empty glass , leaving table scraps this album . music pop-synth oriented , uninspired bloody boring . " don't let go coat " " cache cache " ( " ... there ain't no bears there , cache cache ... " huh ? ) embarrasing . other than " you better you bet , " songs forgetful best . poor kenny jones target who fan anger 25 years , but this lackluster album not his fault . he just drummer . face dances lousy because songwriting , not drumming . live act , who good enough mr. jones skins , it makes sense they tried jump start their careers him . understandably , band shaken after keith death , but why even bother putting out new material this bad ? least next who mach ii album , it hard , some great songs . even bonus tracks , face dances bargain bin album . don't waste your money this ; go out get empty glass , all best cowboys chinese eyes it hard .	1

late-seventies early-eighties , foreigner one top bands , placing 12 songs top 40 1977 1982 including three million-selling singles . what puzzling why rhino released this latest collection which technically simply abbreviated version rhino 2000 2-disc collection jukebox heroes . earlier release contains all 30 tracks found definitive collection plus nine additional tracks including album cuts , minor singles couple spooky tooth tracks mick jones ' previous band . so math . how deleting nine songs anthology that still print make it " definitive " ? answer : it doesn't!if you're looking most comprehensive collection , stick jukebox heroes . sure it few dollars more , but it tells foreigner story more thoroughly , it only anthology include tracks their 1995 release mr . moonlight . music definitive collection certainly first rate , but when you look other choices ( including 2002 excellent single-disc complete greatest hits ) , this latest release unnecessary	1
holy toledo this album absolutely amazing . all yoko kanno stuff cowboy bebop , most her stuff general , mind-blowingly varied , creative , engaging , but this jewel crown . it pinnacle seatbelts music collective , it features deep wonderous sampling all group capable . when playing this disc friends , i feel need say , " this same band " every track , because they're all so different . album -- which soundtrack " cowboy bebop : movie " -- opens " 24 hours open , " strange circus-esque carnival chaos which both amusing , disturbing highly forgettable . but there album takes off . " pushing sky " aggressive , echoing anthem rock . " time know " flute-tinged waltz what appears japanese rapping end . " clutch " some best freeform jazz i've ever heard . " musawe " sounds like arabian folk . " yo pumpkinhead ! " big band extravaganza ( martian halloween parade , those who seen movie ) . " digging " bluesrock . so . nearly every song different genre ( " 7 minutes , " orchestral techno metal number 7:4 time , qualifies several ) nearly every song masterwork said genre . " fingers " flowing piano/fingerpiano dub . " butterly " gorgeously subdued ballad . " gotta knock little harder " awesomely crafted pop anthem reminiscent annie lennox her very best . that just first disc . bonus second disc 11 more songs , which range ambient electro ( " chapter 23 " ) stomping scavenger pop ( " ask dna , " which might owe its existence beck " where it " ) . few songs , particularly disc 2 , show , not movie , but these all so good they fit right you won't care . i cannot say enough this album . it one greatest triumphs music i've ever heard , tribute 100 years american musical tradition fair amount japanese music well , outstanding release its own right . it worth whatever you pay it	1

unfortunately , only people who listen stooges type people who concerned history rock music more than music itself . type people who've spent more time reading rock music than actually listening it . kind people who organize their record collections relevance . other words , rock snobs . first , i'll get rock history surrounding this album out way before talking why this such great rock roll record while attempting not confuse two subjects . proto-punk category tough define since nobody knew what punk rock music going . further confuse matters , punk doesn't really universal definition . purpose this review , i'll define punk loud , raw nihilistic rock music . velvet underground largely recognized beginning punk rock . lyrics dark hateful music some raw moments . if you listen very closely , you may able hear those elements . however , surface they sound much closer bob dylan than sex pistols . mc5 definitely loud , aggressive raw enough musically qualify punk , but lyrically weren't nihilistic . they preached left-wing politics which certainly shock value most people time . people who feel clash definitive punk band should check out mc5 since clash owes quite bit mc5 both lyrically musically . new york dolls shock factor most people equate punk they played sloppier than most `77 punk bands . lyrics trashy sleazy enough considered nihilistic . only thing held them back annoying piano made their sound too large . stooges every element place fuel perfect punk rock fire " raw power . " describe their music loud raw just doesn't it justice . it sounds like destruction their instruments through overdrive . nihilistic lyrics ? it not possible get much more nihilistic than lyrical content this album . top , iggy pop delivered it all absolute sincerity disturbing emotion . it actually much more raw hard than many `77 punk albums . punk unquestionably began this album . it preceded new york dolls 1973 debut album few months . punk bands 1976 - `77 almost universally influenced " raw power . " when ramones kick started punk movement their debut album , only other things they added punk sound created stooges faster tempo they eliminated all other instruments besides guitar , bass , drums . remixing remastering album `90 , it depends whether you value actual sound instruments or history . most people realize you listen music hear instruments like you remix . it really tough hear history unless you've read or heard it , which completely unnecessary enjoyment music reality . there isn't any re-recording or anything else new mixed here , so don't fear " raiders lost ark " type tampering . most record reviews this album include word " primal . " that accurate , but it goes even further than . rock roll yet achieve such physical experience this album provides 1973 few albums able since . tapping into human drive sex violence provides enjoyment all parties involved . it entertainment sense power instigator euphoric experience recipient . stimulation those instincts leads break false reality materialistic society . other words , living instinct leads true freedom . over-driven guitar certainly dominates sound record which accounts violence people associate this music . " search destroy , " " your pretty face going hell , " " raw power " riffs qualities slash , burn , rip every touch . rhythm section more than keep time rhythm . it gives music heartbeat keeps it breathing heavy . bass lays down sweaty grooves throbs which demands much attention guitar songs like " penetration , " " i need somebody . " say drumming drives whole thing understatement . songs like " shake appeal " all but take control everything song feeling like rest musicians no choice but play . through whole album drums pound snap like stampede wild bores . iggy vocals style lyrics compliment everything perfectly . sleazy , sick , hateful , strange , wild , insane . whether if he sounds subdued or frenzied , he always feels menacing . fear incited through vocals heightens this experience beyond audio stimulation . " raw power " rock roll its peak potential . it just essential all other rock roll greats ranging hendrix led zeppelin ac/dc . it too bad album only known underground music fans , but it hard imagine any these songs any radio station .	1
i find it hard believe this same ray parker jr. played guitar barry white hits ' 70s . he really benefited hits he raydio solo artist . i still love funky catchy you can't change ! i could play 50 times never get tired it ! jack jill i still love . funk beds those who like groove i still loooove ! i still like macho sounding bad boy -- shame you ray lyrics funky groove ! he makes lovely smooth ballads woman needs love , let me go , two places others . some songs like jamie girls more fun don't age very well their dinky keyboards . i still can't get over sounds little like lionel richie me . but i still love ghostbusters its driving , funky groove ! it huge pop hit , movie huge hit just made ray well received artist . but it just clicks fact ray played most music musicians like martin page song too ! he one ' 80s best artists musicians this album proves it !	1
first foremost , not frightened slightly bling-like nature album cover depicts . saying goes " don't judge book its cover " , same this cd . nowhere here canibus acting jiggy or throwing us life-less garbage microphone like most mainstream artists . this cd sorta like canibus crack going mainstream again , but keeping it grimey enough not alienate his long-time fans . production handled nicely nottz other producers , but not every beat blazing , some fall ' average ' pile not stand out . majority negative reviews this album received because they unfairly comparing it bootleg wasn't supposed released . they just upset not every song ' new material ' . this album spoiled early bootlegging beginning 2005 . album originally supposed released may , but 14 tracks ( 6 which appear altered formats this album ) leaked through unreleased ' virtruvian man ' mixtape ... honestly , virtruvian man slightly better than this album ( probably because it supposed pressed hiphop sale - exception freestyled tracks ) ... rather , some tracks virtruvian man released hh4s some newer unheard tracks ... tracks *' appeared virtruvian man ( i unbiased possible song reviews)its no other than * ( 5 out 5 ) --- this album first single this joint banger . nottz produced really funky track bis triumphantly screaming over it . this version remastered virtruvian man extra vocals added into it . back wit heat * --- ( 4.5 out 5 ) nottz track , but much grimier feel than its no other than . here bis showcasing his ability craft some menacing rhymes over darker production . this version remastered its original one . benny riley --- ( 4 out 5 ) beat real funky grimey , although bis vocals way too raspy over this . still good track though . show em how * --- ( 4 out 5 ) this really funky beat nottz . bis spitting comical lethal rhymes listener . dear academy * ( 3.5 out 5 ) --- this track everyone loves hate . personally it not crazy other tracks , but it provides cool introspective canibus he talking all people he worked past who've blown up since then ... i gotcha * ( 3.5 out 5 ) --- this track original version virtruvian man better . dmp this version though , but their vocals too quiet . mixing this track ruined what otherwise hot song . so into you ( 2.5 out 5 ) --- interesting , pretty much sums up review here . canibus spittin love ballad , oddly enough its still pretty decent although very unorthodox . he gets points versatility ... da facelift * ( 10 out 5 ) --- this track appear virtuvian man but different beat . production this version godly . canibus old 100% present here . absolute banger track !!! hip hop body rock ( 5 out 5 ) --- like ' so into you ' this side canibus i didn't see coming , however , this representation shown much better . very funky crazy track ! take dat ( 3.5 out 5 ) --- two very lackluster tracks close off album . production this track very lacking bis vocals although its not bad beat . main problem after first minute track bis spittin you get 2 no-names after . punchlines ( 3 out 5 ) --- i want like this song but i cannot . lyrically its hot , but beat just eeeeehhhhh depressing ... all all this still decent album , but overall hotness it comes random times . complaint its only 42 minutes long . i want hear more !!! i just wish virtuvian man never leaked because i garauntee hiphop 4 $ale would've much hotter!!!i'd still cop it though	1
perpetual complaint j.j. cale he always records same record . i'm happy report charge may true . bright side , end result mr. cale never recorded bad album , his songs always soulful beautiful passionate no matter how simple or laidback they . emotional core his music what makes songs/albums appear all alike , this consistency makes him artist unlike any other . or , okey , like very selected few . album front you , " 5 , " perhaps one his best . ( many fans - many personal favorites you'll find . ) it certainly high my list , i'll admit it . it pure j.j. magic : mix bag blues , country , soul , subdued funk , traces early digital life ( simple rhythm machines echoes synths , remember , this 1979 ) suggestions what would later defined " americana , " - mix makes mr. cale sound so unique . never taking himself very seriously , j.j. created opus serene colorful life west , mixing effortlessly bits sadness humor earnestness joy paint mini pictures life simple pleasures ( or troubles , depending where you stand ) . songs make you smile your own blues , justifying feeling while making it bit ridiculous . what makes this album stand out whole opus one track - " sensitive kind , " which i like define perhaps only song ever presented cinemascope old fashioned technicolor . if you imagine . it simple love song preaches better understanding promotes patience everlasting battle sexes , but it so touching it'll make your skin crawl . strings horns mellow solo guitar rhodes piano ... ah , pure beauty . if record worth , anything - it this track . i'm not saying rest bad - i love " friday , " " boilin ' pot , " " mona , " " don't cry sister , " name just few - it just " sensitive kind " such standout track , it towers over whole mr cale lifetime achievements . pretty much makes this album one . bit warning : although listed , latest universal pressing this cd doesn't contain " katy kool lady " if track you crave , you may end up disappointed ; instead , there mysterious track it place which bonus hardcore fans but some could upset if they want exact replica original lp . ( i'm lucky , i original vynil so i'm not complaining . ) also raises question : why universal music group so cheap ? i'm not even sure they properly remastered . . ' catalog they own , reprinted covers so poorly designed i'm thinking i'd better job converting my vynils into digital tracks just xeroxing covers . instead , why not expand existing albums outakes and/or some rare tracks - i'm sure there some lying around , one included here mistake living proof - maybe add liner notes fan or cale opus connoisseur , or even some musicians who admire him so much , why not make it worthy such great talent mr. cale ? unless happens soon , stick this edition , you not regret single note music here	1
wow i just don't know where start this album . well , album itself : i think this best explained band , so here what they think- " how strange , innocence " our first attempt album . we recorded it january 2000 austin : recording took two days , mixing one day , mastering one day . altogether we pressed 300 cd-r copies this album ... we band seven months when we recorded these songs . lot feelings ( excitement/confusion/glimpses visions/waking dreams/inability play instruments ) went into this record , but we didn't quite know what those feelings , none us even really studio before , it shows recording , songs show it , too--it young record . there no tricks it . there lightness few songs we probably won't reach again . it sounds strange say instrumental songs something , but us these songs were/are such things couple walking through park winter day , child playing 70 shag carpet , story boy hero leading revolution against tyranny coal mines . we've bit love/embarrassment relationship record . certain points way several us wanted buy back all copies burn them . listening now this album , it almost seems like different band composed four different people . we finally feel okay re-releasing it , probably because we've now made couple records recorded better closer our visions them . anyway , we truly appreciate anyone who interested listening . thank you . " cd itself- hope you found helpful . i like this cd two reasons . 1 . wonderful way explosions sky tell story through their instruments . 2 . this album distinct sound- one all its own . if you didn't like explosions sky before , you once you listen this album . -sherman .	1

it amazes me material artists like sonny james so poorly represented todays marketplace . quot ; gentleman southquot ; still holds record most consecutive #1 hits billboard country charts ( 16 ) charted over 20 #1 hits . so where they all ??? his years capitol records ( covered this disc ) would fill 15 disc box set . these all great tunes but there just aren't enough them	1

if that exaggeration , it not big one . this thing went my ipod shuffle soon i got it , i can't stop listening . sound quality unbelievably good , song choices practically " best " their early work . if anything , i'd say lot songs sound even better than their studio versions , especially green manalishi ( where halford delivers hellishly haunting wail reminiscient original peter green version ) , victim changes ( much faster heavier ) . four (!) additional live tracks apperently same concert (?) make already spectacular live album much better . if only ever buy one priest cd , make it this one . it just good	1
cheyenne kimball sure rocking it her first album ! it took me 25 days listen it , but it consistent effort . this succeeds far beyond mtv show she making this album . all numbers full energy , solid melodies rhythms , heavy guitars ! her guitar playing dynamic all numbers she good songwriter . sure , she people like kara dioguardi , greg wells , eddie head , raine maida , chantal kreviazuk , billy mann , scott cutler anne preven produce songs , but this album all cheyenne . course she new , but her approach gives kelly clarkson run her money rock end . you don't even think outside help 7 producers this effort , because you all into cheyenne own sound musical vision . one more exciting refreshing debuts i've listened this year	1
dylan authentic sounds so this acoustic guitar voice cd . songs great classics , but recording weak insofar lyrics not clear . this album would so much better if you could hear great classic lyrics these great songs . so , 4 stars instead 5 , weak recording detracts what otherwise would classic .	1
i'd known gits while ( seattle underground music scene great until nirvana broke big oversaturated country its own brand quasi-grunge ) , but i hadn't heard gits ' music very long time . i recently saw updated episode ae cold case show . it reminded me give gits listen , but most all , it reminded me how much talent world lost when it lost mia . thankfully , mia murder solved ( albeit just few months back ) . i must say gits definitely special band , most unique frontwoman . mia gravely , emotion-tinged voice conveyed alienation , loneliness , introspection way art-poseur junkie like cobain never could . it total shame mia isn't around anymore .	1
i owned all albums buena vista social club veterans this one i waited great anticipation . i'm proud say i am not disappointed . all selections this album superb guajiro mirabal playing trumpet simply superb , most specially , if you aware he more than 70 years old . trumpet sound very annoying because its inherent loudness but hands(or mouth ) guajiro mirabal , it simply intoxicating . i played album any time day it never failed amaze me . you listen it any kind mood you . morning . late afternoon . late night . i highly recommend this album , all albums buena vista social club members . let enjoy this music . this kind music you not get tired listening . why ? because they made real musicians . all sounds you hear coming real instruments all recorded live studio . if you tired listening " manufactured " music , this kind music surely give you entirely different experience	1

i just imagine excitement this set must generated among dylan fans when this set released . biograph so much more than retrospective because all unreleased material it . set opens " visions johanna " sixty-six tour draws you right into music . just imagine , dylan fans wait two more decades finally get whole sixty-six show legal bootleg series . " quinn eskimo " third song record recorded mr. d isle white show sixty-nine curiously enough left off " self portrait " where you find more songs show . " you're big girl now " " tangled up blue " out takes " blood tracks . " " i wanna your lover " " crawl out your window " both songs left over sixty-six .

this great compilation , but i never pay close $90 used copies . before i saw these highway robbery prices i dead set against record piracy . too bad i'll never get own it , unless it reissued resonable price . i thoroughly despise remakes great songs , so his greatest hits album no good either . 5 stars cd , zero price tag	1
i like album more than loveless . don't get my wrong , loveless great , but it very calculated every song shares same sort sound dense layers voice turned down . isn't anything pure shoegaze . this album rocks funky songs like soft snow seven girls galore , bleak " sueisfine " " you never should " , this really great album worthy its follow-up worth listen	1
warren really missed boat . he go down hip hop history introduced his cousin snoop dogg dr. dre , semi-hit michael mcdonald-sampling " regulators " . " regulate- funk era " quite possibly single most overlooked album all time . these days , dr. dre universally regarded number one beatmaker , warren hold his own against doc . " chronic " considered one greatest hip-hop albums all time ; " regulate- funk era " should regarded similarly its funky parliament-influenced production streetwise sermons ( some things catapaulted chronic " classic status " ) . what i'm trying say , era g-funk , when dr. dre , d.o.c. , n.w.a. , snoop dogg , eazy revered kings game , warren criminally overlooked . he most likely never get respect he deserves making this classic album . fans every artist album i've mentioned . standouts include " regulators " , " so many ways " , " this shack " .	1
i am no means expert loreena mckennitt works . i own just this album her most popular album book secrets . although book secrets made ms. mckennitt popular because song mummer dance , which received air play even some popular music stations , visit contains some wonderful songs . all souls night quick song ancient celtic holiday samhain . pagans believed october 31st , last day summer , spirits dead wandered landscape looking bodies inhabit . living lit bonfires , sang songs , dressed scary costumes frighten away dead . if you let your mind wander , this song almost transport you ancient ireland . historians know so little certain ancient pagan beliefs , mckennitt well-studied songs lyrics help bring this lost culture back life . lady shalott masterpiece this album . adapted poem alfred tennyson , mckennitt sets it music brings poem life . over 11 minutes long , mckennitt deleted hardly word original poem , yet music intonation rivet listener attention . poem spirit or elfish woman drawn ancient mythical city camelot beauty castle sir lancelot . even way mckennitt pronounces word camelot song conveys sacred nature this most important legend english mythology . poem song touch your heart . me , i watch modern england quickly losing it historic culture , this song serves reminder england once . mckennitt adapts long poem english literature her later album book secrets . mckennit faithfully puts word alfred noyes ' highwayman into heart-wrenching song . again , over 10 minutes long , this formula mckennitt very well . if i choose just one album loreena mckennitt , it would book secrets . but it would cruel choice make . i look forward someday owning all her works anxiously await her next recording .	1
i wasn't ry cooder fan but i've discovered respect him after these associations . previous posters seem think ry cooder only guitarist , which would surprise manuel galban . ibrahim voice amazing his story . bvsc film basically film sessions this album . i think ry deserves ' props ' bringing this music much wider audience than expected . i'm sure people read ' whiter ' audience well . lighten up , shake off ghost dance . i would also like mention production this other bvsc incredible , much better than other productions modern latin music	1
they've pretty well captured some problems this particular album , which rare wonderful event . if you've listened paul simon songbook , you know , while he could occasional good job ( kathy song ) , his early twenties , paul simon not much songwriter . this relatively direct , unnuanced , pretentious record what essentially direct , unnuanced , pretentious time . times , it sound like angsty teenage girl private poetry collection . these all correct valid assertions , if sort thing going bother you , you might better advised stay away . what album also , however , number quality musical efforts . kathy song april , come she both good indicators what come paul simon his later work . while this may among least simon garfunkel collective output , worst their five records still better than large body other music . regarding bonus material , this also one those happy instances where i actually recommend buyers interested getting newly expanded cd they buy it . rather than mess demos mono mixes sound essentially same ( policy columbia pursued much other paul simon rereleases ) , this cd actually four previously unavailable , mostly good songs its credit . i could personally lived my life without hearing simon garfunkel interpretation barbriallen , but fans happy all additional material . other listeners , if you're just looking " best " simon garfunkel record , or start duo , it might better try bookends or bridge over troubled water first . fans , well , you probably already own this record i'm not sure why you're still listening . more casual listeners just search good overview , you'll probably satisfied best simon garfunkel ( twenty song collection - rather than greatest hits - gives more thorough overview ) . people who just like good music , however , while i can't recommend this their best record , it certainly worthy listen	1

reason i bought this cd track " remedy . " it would play often local hard rock station every time i heard it i knew i wanted check out cd . i finally jotted down many lyrics i could search found seether . i loved first two tracks right away but wasn't sure rest cd . i recently purchased " one " three days grace listening constantly several weeks . i think i immediately compared two cds didn't think " karma effect " measured up . more i listen seether cd , though , more i like . booklet very creative . pages artwork or strange photographs , , matted , semi-transparent , plastic sheets lyrics printed silver . i thought cool first until i tried read them . even paper underneath , they're difficult read . oh well , least they're trying different . there photo band behind cd holder . now tracks : " because me " : awesome opener ! energetic explosive catchy hooks chorus . like " remedy , " it grabbed me right away wouldn't let go . " remedy " : reason i bought this cd ! verses sound lot like nirvana " come you " ( it almost sounds like kurt cobain singing , too ) . this track flat out rocks ! " truth " : slower verses picks up into hard rockin ' , yet catchy chorus . additional guitar during final chorus awesome ! heavier than other tracks here . becoming one my favorites . " gift " : beginning offers slow verse nice guitar accompaniment followed accessible , power chorus . almost country flavor ( it not country , don't worry ) . it nice but it tend drag . it 5:34 sounds every bit long . " burrito " : one heavier tracks here . it very dark sound like tool . " given " : this more accessible track than " burrito " but incorporate some korn/ill nino-like screams . " never leave " : slower , power song really sticks my head better or worse . " world falls away " : rocker ! guitar accompanying verses highlight . then some korn/ill nino-like screams build intensity . one line end " i'm just like you , just not cool " ( line throughout track " just not fool " ) so mundane . " tongue " : track begins line " well tongue inside my mouth not sale " ( uh , ok ) . slower , power song but this one excellent chorus . " i'm one " : now we're rocking ! this may my favorite this cd ( it right up there first two tracks , anyway ) . check out these lyrics : " here she coming she drunk again / she only seventeen / here daddy said `well that enough come my little queen ' / now he touching her wrong again / he going give her disease / he never wanted it anyway / he only he please / won't you tell her i said i'm one / i couldn't hurt her like everyone / tell her i said i'm one / i don't deserve her . " killer ! " simplest mistake " : heavy track . some bursts intensity but lighter , catchy chorus . " diseased " : this different-sounding track . it soft , dark , mysterious guitar-work . like " burrito , " it very tool-like . " plastic man " : kurt cobain-sounding ballad . i checked song credits see if he wrote it lyrics not included booklet . he didn't write it . anyway , it gorgeous track beautiful guitar-work . hidden track : just some quirky guitar singing language . not really worth 5 minute wait	1
i tend think fa one-hit wonder -- which they -- though i always liked one hit : quot ; western unionquot ; fine , fine pop song . this disc , however , brings light other , surprisingly enjoyable music followed , band struggled build their commercial momentum . they shamelessly repeated riffs motifs song follow-up singles ( quot ; zip code , quot ; example ) , but they also delved into rich lode melodic pop , this generously programmed , 25-song retrospective gives nice , balanced view their work 1965-69 . course they eventually shed their clean-cut image got all druggie psychedelic , that certainly half fun . recommended	1
well , i'm not " drunken frat boy " one reviewers suggested . i've life long love rock roll music . however , growing up i heard my mom country music , what they call now " old country " . me it true country sound , only one i knew growing up . i got turned onto hank iii , when looking online my mom old song hank sr. when i saw hank iii listed - i curious - course . went his web site got hear straight hell online listened entire 1st cd ............. it great , hooked ! this country my mom listened back 60 70 before , country my gpa listened 40 50 before ............. but it here , now very much alive . this cd great - if you can't handle it , well , your not country music lover . nashville country different ..... bad different ..... if you can't hear it , your tone deaf ! rock hank iii - just fan illinois . jbradford5775@cdnet.cod.edup . . if you come back illinois , my mom i want come hear you ! keep creating your great sound	1
this cd captured songs i fondly remembered carmen miranda ( aka , " samba queen " ) . my almost-forgotten favorite songs her , " man lollipop , " " chica chica boom , " " tico-tico , " more , nicely restored this cd coming drabby non-stereo , analog-to-digital high-digital techniques . amazing . but what more amazing these songs first recorded 1930 , 1940's!! it vintage history ( document ) , which we should never ever forget insatiable carmen miranda her work art , nonetheless . this must item those who also like song " mama eu quiero " ( remember bugs bunny stage performing singing it during 1970s cartoon bugs bunny ; he performed chiquita banana woman song , also known carmen miranda ) . execs this cd , thanks capturing ( fun ) history !	1
i bought this cd 1991 still play many tracks it , especially " valerie loves me " , " diane " " very first lie . " all songs i used listen early 90s , " valerie " still holds one my all time favorites i used know someone name many , many , many years ago . it too bad rest material issue mercury catalog gone out print because jim ellison his band ability write record fairly wide variety musical styles . if you ever find copy " destination universe " buy it because it some best power pop ballads i ever heard 1990s . mercury should reissue this well " freak city soundtrack " put out greatest hits compilation feature cover tracks " bus stop " , " bad time , " " cowboy song " " blockbuster " long out print	1
i love prince music . some looked this album step down purple rain but complete b.s. it more creative artistic move prince revolution . my personal favorite track ladder . back up vocals superb wendy , lisa , susannah , taja sevelle . i love it .	1
when this cd came out , i like ... " okay , this going new wave 21st century ! " plantation lullabies " so far ahead it time its not funny ! but fact mainstream success continues elude this truly original genius beyond me ! if you like delving into new , now , future , beyond all boundaries genre ho-hum radio ga-ga .. then this album quench your thirst like no other	1
bring family one most easily likable records 80s , probably most instantly accessible hiatt career . he still featurs couple songs off here his live shows . band ( hiatt , nick lowe bass , ry cooder guitar , jim keltner drums ) would reconvene 1992 overlooked gem , little village . here cooder gentle sweeping guitar perfect compliment hiatt " lipstick sunset " " tip my tongue , " two most exquisite songs you're likely hear . course big hit " thing called love , " although not until bonnie raitt put it out following year . quintessentially american record , probably best one our true masters . place where rock , folk , country , blues converge form real , authentic american music . i'm calling it classic	1
this album perfect pop album . everything album brillant . number tracks , length ( 38 minutes ) , production , lyrics , voice , not mention every track catchy , only thing i complain there not booklet lyrics but minor thing . you huming these songs days . every track great . it my top 10 list this year right now it number 2 behind chili peppers " stadium arcadium . " only two albums coming out may beat it ( i think ) jayhawks related release golden smog , tom petty . if you enjoy jayhawks or good pop music give this listen , you won't disappointed . favorite tracks : " that game , " " ivy , " " girl/world , " " just like you	1
travis tritt one most unique ( stylistic ) singers arrive " modern " country music scene . while not nearly traditional dwight , not gifted guitarist his cohort , marty , travis tritt one most recognizable , original , true-to-form artist our genre ; his voice , although original , beckons back glory days early hank jr conway twitty .... throw little greg allman while we're it . personally , i prefer traditional country sound , but admit occasionally dabbling southern rock ; travis taken over where bocephus left off early ' 90 . this album combination his more rolicking " southern-fried " boogie numbers well some true honky-tonk classics . not many artists ability include hard driving rock-induced numbers " t-r-o-u-b-l-e " " ... drive your country " such traditional songs like " help me hold " " sometimes she forgets ( song written much thinner literate steve earle ) " . course , there standard ' 90 fare : " drift off dream " , " anymore " , " tell me i dreaming " . , if wasn't enough , his duet marty " whiskey aint working " also included . overall , good album	1
cowboy bebop o.s.t. 2 no disk great soundtrack brings out all little songs make bebop what it . most these songs recieve short treatment show but . never less , make it just so much better . some people may not like songs so this sound track serious fans	1
isley brothers featuring ronald isley a.k.a. mr. biggs - baby makin ' music ( def soul , 2006)maybe introduction ronald isley alter ego , mr. biggs , wasn't so bad after all . it got young people buy isley brothers music ( their new albums ) it revitalized ronald himself . besides , it eleven years since mr. biggs attacked . kelly " down low " it seems if he here say . but after you listen this album , it may seem like ron trying let it go . baby makin ' music may corny title this album ( it better suited isley love ballad compilation ; besides , very few these songs " baby-makin '" persuasion ) but album itself gold major improvement over 2003 body kiss . biggs character brings out some interesting music " forever mackin '" . before you cringe title , song really player until woman he really loves comes him . also , he approaches girl club " pretty woman " . sure , it death but uptempo beat pleasing enough . better songs come form " just came here chill " . written gordon chambers ( who never seem wrong ) ron himself , ron says , " i'm not mr. biggs/tonight i'm just ronald isley . " fast-forward " you helped me write this song " you'll hear him trying dismiss mr. biggs altogether while he proposes his girl . although destined get lost shuffle their more classic albums ( 3+3 , go your guns , eternal ) , this album still great . ernie providing more guitar riffs , . kelly only regulated one song ( " blast off " ) fewer trendy references ( which all opposite what happened body kiss ) , this truly return form isleys . -ej	1
best cd(s ) i own , far . i bought this 2003 blown away . i am not big fan live cds not big fan his before this , just joined music club thought i would get it . needless say , i now seen him live 3 times am amazed each time . his guitar playing beyond amazing this cd . singles he releases not show this . trust me , get this you not sorry .	1
i'm not going tell you how much i loved song reptilia because lot people already , even know it great song . i this cd long time , infact this my first strokes cd . now i listened first impressions earth this it whole bunch , i find myself going back listening this one most even know i own all three . i absolutely love part love hate when " never needed anybody " sung catchy yet mellow twangy guitar follow through . 12:51 one most styled songs this cd . i wish strokes would go back writing couple more songs sound more similar 12:51 . this cd makes me look forward next strokes album more than any others	1
first , i won't go how great this 3-cd set . there plenty other fans here offering conga-line superlatives i agree wholeheartadely . all tunes great much cheaper than paying therapist . i think tom easly one top ten musical geniuses performers last 50 years , certainly one few left hasn't sold out . you won't hear tom music beer or car commercials . orphans definite must-have . however , completists out there , there few songs , most collaborations others , didn't make orphans , nor they elusive ( illegal ) factory-pressed tales underground five-disc series ( must all rain dogs , if you find ' em ) . so if you want tom other orphaned tunes didn't make orphans , following tracks found cds here amazon ( perhaps exception hold 4-track bonus disc , which pops up ebay once awhile ): - i know i've changed ( this * not * same version orphans ; it john hammond his album wicked grin)- kitate ( los lobos ride)- going fetal ( eels blinking lights)- big face money ( short but fun mule variations-era tune paired buzz fledderjon ' hold ' bonus disc)- go tell it mountain ( blind boys alabama go tell it mountain)- i'll tell you why ( dan hicks beatin ' heat)- saw sage ( c-side , coffee cigarettes soundtrack)enjoy ! p.s. tom , if you read this , remember you still owe me twenty bucks gas .	1
anthony hamilton third album entitled " ain't nobody worryin '" . twelve beautiful songs this album produced : mark batson , raphael saadiq , christopher pottinger , james poyser , andre harris vidal davis last but not least kelvin wooten . it necessary mention these producers because together anthony they great job . there variety subjects anthony hamilton addresses " ain't nobody worryin '" . besides loves songs-sung different points view- you'll hear songs critical note towards society some deep comtemporary gospel songs . we know anthony his soulful rnb-songs but there high quality reggae surprise called " everybody " included this album . throughout album you'll hear anthony hamilton singer who born raised south he his roots church . he'll bring you joy , drama , love , hope consolation . " preacher daughter " featuring his wife tarsha ' mcmillian hamilton , it like you hear vicar speaking . anthony hamilton voice gorgeous . it dark , clear so full apparently real emotions which lifts him up far above level average good singer . his lyrics so cleverly chosen combined everyone feels what he singing . example this title song which critical towards society but yet hopeful individual person . song like " pass me over " feels so good soul . two smashing old school beauties " ain't nobody worryin '" that'll take you right down memory lane " never love again " " change your world " . " ain't nobody worryin '" excellent album big southern country boy .	1
this album broken love . there so much sadness here . but there also best cowboy ballad this record since marty robbins ' " el paso " " big iron . " " lily , rosemary jack hearts " just goes , seemingly without end , then poof , it over jack hearts gotten away all cash . you need refreshing , uplifting song like this balance out all heartbreak . once again , bob dylan proven he absolute best whatever he attempts . once again he turned out record once listened , becomes part you . it seems he lot , still doing it	1

momeries 80 . cd all ages , even my 6 yr old loves it	1
i really enjoyed first two books albums , i bought thought food almost immediately after lemon pink because i enjoyed it so much . i found their sound quite original interesting balance emotion humor balance electronic acoustic music . so i really disappointed when i heard their new album . this record clearly intended their breakthrough , far more vocals regular song structure less expirementalism . record even reuses some samples old albums which really annoying . this album lacks interesting , unexpected twists their previous works , result comes off generally bland sometimes even cheesy . if you want books album , please check out other two first	1
well , here we . one true works electronic genre 90 , " lifeforms " true sonic adventure . this obviously some best work fsol ever . " lifeforms " double album electronic ambient moments spliced together , interchanged meshed . ambient work , it lot randomness bright detail thrown rapid pace . there lot energy terse grab songs , despite their ambient . it very original , i praise originality music . give it try , put some " flower " " bird wings " or some " elaborate burn .	1
some people say it mindless racing all , but drifting takes so much skill it not even funny . don't hate , appreciate btw anyone know song scene where han enter his little " club like " place this crib start making out girls	1
after incredibly popular late 80 she some problems regain same popularity 90 when " confide me " " put yourself my place " some few hits i recall . when " lightyears " released she eventually found new image again making disco influented songs . this first three albums this kind sound , although this album got more retro disco other one more modern electro inspired neo-disco influence . this album kicks off " spinning around " biggest hit this album also floorfiller . i prefer " night like this " it neu disco sound happy melody . songs 3-7 typical disco songs , " your disco needs you " sounds like village people . " please stay " pop-disco song , reminds me belinda carlisle " circle sand " bit hook , but it one my favorite songs here just same . " bittersweet goodbye " ballad . not good really . 10-11 also disco songs , " im so high more towards pop . " kids " robbie williams highlight only rock inspired song , but it good alot energy good hook too . it ends neo-disco song " lightyears " also sound she adapted her next album . overall , this great album hence 4 stars . many highlights floorfillers fresh sound . perhaps bit too many retro songs included . i would liked some more rock perhaps one or two decent ballads . but " new " kylie sound sold millions it re-launched her career again . good album nonetheless	1
receiving this album like opening christmas present mid summer . if great songwriting your thing you love sweet melodies , then daniel wylie what you need . this album filled beautiful songs sound like his cosmic rough riders work enjoy melodic sunshine . it more same disc . you love ' define love , ' move me ' especially ' i wouldn't lie ' . tthis stand out song among many great songs . please buy enjoy . i enjoy it	1
while i bought both this cd quot ; telewackerquot ; redd guitar work , my favorite part both cds vocal numbers . redd chooses semi-obscure but classic honky-tonkers his vocal workouts his every-guy voice ( there actually some similarity junior brown ) suits them just fine . standout vocal cuts this cd quot ; big big lovequot ; swing number quot ; end line . quot ; these two cuts alone worth price cd . guitar work this cd , course , excellent . unlike some other guitarists turning out solo albums these days ( scotty anderson comes mind ) , redd doesn't shy away pieces emphasize tone taste over flash notes per second . his instrumental take quot ; i forget you every dayquot ; merle haggard makes some really great listening without resorting needless pyrotechnics . i especially like redd liberal use steel guitar breaks both his cds . this cd he features norman hamlet ( formerly merle haggard ) who adds plenty solid steel . this really enjoyable cd anyone who likes straight ahead country music swing . some original instrumentals nothing special , but there always seems killer cut just around next bend . keep it up , redd ! keep including those vocal numbers	1
all trouble world today , listening this guy you just know everything all right	1
i discovered this album because song , " aguas de marco . " each two artists talented his/her own ; but , combination greater than sum its parts . elis regina sings effortlessly , bringing authentic emotion each song . her voice sexy , sad , joyful , even playful . tom jobim voice music complement elis regina . their music transports listener back simpler time ... even if simplicity mere illusion ( i.e. 1974 wasn't " simpler time " ) . ps -- those who like printed lyrics , this cd all songs ' lyrics portuguese , they all translated into english	1
although always praised critics , lindsey solo album never sold same arena his band , fleetwood mac , or his female counterpart stevie nicks , which shame , because his albums always inspired , never created sake commercial - they his heart soul . this album would my personal favourite buckingham album , because songs like " someones gotta change your mind " " down rodeo " some best songs he produced , fleetwood mac or otherwise , recent years . other stand-outs this collection amazing title track , " shut us down " amazing rolling stones cover , " i am waiting " . fans fleetwood mac amazing guitar work should not look this album .	1
i've listening gypsy kings since i kid now im 21 i still listen them . i these group friends who also listening gk music since their childhood days . it practically our theme song whenever we go beach soak sun . we can't get enough songs ' cause they bring us new world where life just so relaxing . we even put songs during any our dinner parties . it makes us feel like we all spain relaxing glass sanggria just good time	1
this one best power pop albums ever made , great songs like " oldest story world " , " inch inch " , course classic " million miles away " . little history : 1976 band called nerves , made up peter case ( later plimsouls ) , paul collins ( later beat , a.k.a. paul collins ' beat ) , jack lee , recorded 4 song ep . one songs jack lee " hanging telephone " , which became famous 1978 when cover version blondie became hit . this time nerves broken up , various members each gone their separate ways . jack lee released solo album , " greatest hits vol . 1 " , 1981 obscure label , maiden america records . paul collins ' band , beat , made 2 albums 1 ep . peter case band , plimsouls , made ep followed 2 lps , best which this album , " everywhere once " . both case collins subsequent solo albums , plimsouls reformed later album late ' 90s , " kool trash " . so there wealth material fans track down their collections . much it never issued cd , some it very hard find . now good news : 2001 spanish label , penniman records , reissued original nerves 4-song ep , combined 2 other nerves studio tracks , 10 " vinyl-only collection called " 25th anniversary " . only 2000 copies issued , i don't know if it still available but if you find it , i highly recommend it - great stuff . there also french reissue late ' 80s , now long since out print , same 6 nerves songs , plus 4 more live tracks . anyway , i searching those nerves songs years before finally finding penniman records release just few weeks ago . if anyone reading this searching nerves like i , i hope this helps you find it . beware , though , recordings different band also called nerves , which made few albums recently . check record label or personnel info carefully . further collecting , paul collins stuff still not too hard find vinyl , but jack lee album very rare	1
vast majority ( handful ) people who gave this soundtrack less than 4 stars either put off some or all rock bands or out usual ' if they're weird , but enjoyed more than roomful people , they suck/overrated/sold out etc ' . yet , after almost decade , it remains best reason give soundtracks half chance . you're bound skip around , but this absolutely essential album any ' real ' music fan , , able appreciate dark , popular , dark but still popular . like lynch films it conjure all sorts self-conscious meanderings round ' i cool/weird if i like/hate this ' miasma , but make it through enjoy , enjoy more .	1
ok , before we get this album , let clear up few things surrounding ol ' max cavalera lot critiscism that leveled him since beginning soulfly . 1) " his lyrics gone all christian " so guy beliefs don't match up your own ? so what ? why going stop you enjoying his music ? i adore emperor , even though faust neo-nazi homophobic nutjob - nothing music . besides , max lyrics aren't strictly speaking christian . they suggest max believes some kind higher power deity but they also hint strong belief oneself , idea which far more common romanticsm , paganism , even some traditional strands satanism other beliefs incorporated bands like bathory rather than strict , narrow-minded monotheistic belief systems favoured artists like james hetfield dave mustaine ... but that never stopped you playing ' master puppets ' ' rust peace ' million one times , now , it ? 2 ) " he keeps messing around tribal elements pointless instrumentals " tribal element important part sepultura day one . granted , it wasn't always so blatant it soulfly , but these rythyms part all max work ( possible excpetion nailbomb , but even then he still brings little ) . instrumentals , well , i personally love them , think it awesome relatively mainstream metal musician this day age willing broaden their pallete experiment such things . 3 ) " he dyed his dreads pink brought stupid ammount guests ! " again , like first point , fact he anything his physical appearance irrelevant . you know those toddlers enjoy pop bands purely based their image ? if you're refusing listen max because anything trivial colour his hair then there nothing seperating two you , don't so ridiculous . yes , number guest appearances get bit silly during primitive , yes , this produce some terrible music . but lot them worked sounded really cool , lets not forget sepultura began collaborating lot various different tribal artists after while , very impressive results . 4 ) " he song fred durst ! " ok .... you've got me there . i see no way justifying , but hey , everyone makes mistakes , right ? need i remind you limp bizkit nabbed house pain dj ... you going stop listening house pain because ? so , you gonna ignore all max astonishing work sepultura all great music he went make because one poor collaboration ? i'm not saying you listen this song ( i've only able listen it once or twice without wanting wretch myself ) but don't judge artist based one song . 5 ) " he doesn't write thrash anymore ! " enter ' dark ages ' ... without doubt , this best soulfly album max ever written . it much better than new sepultura stuff , even . after hit-and-miss sludgery debut , below-par ' primitive ' no t-t oo-hot ' 3 ' , you'd forgiven maybe thinking max past it , but then ' prophecy ' began pick up pace again set songs not too similair sepultura ' roots ' but definite soulfly feel . well , this soulfly ' chaos ad ' . epic , triumphant thrash successfully married tribal rythyms , eastern folk , dub reggae amongst others . if you ever sepultura fan , you owe it yourself check this out . very impressive .	1
beautiful sound , montana skies flawlessly combines cello guitar into melodies depart ordinary classical . one feel passion they their music . music resonates within one , long after last note . i find myself humming tunes all time ! there something everyone this album . these stressful times i use it work car relax detach hectic day-to-day . aptly named " chasing sun " brings some sun into my day every time i play it .	1

all-time quarterback ! shows what potential your kids could . death cab cutie ben gibbard plays around kid instruments comes up warm charming low-fi masterpiece . half this 11-song , 28-minute disc originally recorded walkman many songs previously released part 1999 all-time quarterback ! cd-ep home-recording cassette-only envelope sessions . whole , all-time quarterback ! feel album hidden tracks or studio outtakes . " plans get complex " simply sing-song its toy guitar broken casio underpinning . previously unreleased " dinner eight suburbs " jaunty " untitled " sound like early pet sounds demos while gibbard employs toy piano seriously alter mood his cover magnetic fields ' " why i cry . " unfortunately , despite this present collection , gibbard hung up atq mantle writing it off fun one-off side project . all-time quarterback ! fine example songs stand their own merits , recordings haven't seen pro tools , combination both into darn good album	1
this tough one call . admittedly , sound quality erato recording rostropovich performing dvorak cello concerto tchaikovsky rocco variations still better than deutsche grammophon digital image bit remastered version rostropovich accompanied karajan berlin philharmonic . certainly both recordings , rostropovich gives warm , passionate performances these works ; his interpretations erato recording may sound more vibrant than these deutsche grammophon cd , but this may more sound quality than his splendidly lyrical playing . however , without question , deutsche grammophon recording offer karajan berlin philharmonic its best . i doubt i heard better concerto recording them ; most noteworthy lush , warm tone created strings , sounding almost warm any i heard vienna philharmonic string sections . you certainly won't go wrong acquiring either deutsche grammophon or erato cds ; i own both enjoy them immensely	1
anybody who regards this album disappointment feels it not quite live up its predecessor ' morning view ' clearly knows nothing incubus ' music . real disappointment infact ' morning view ' , which closest incubus come ' selling out ' or moving into mainstream . much i liked album , i expecting something lot better following two classics ' science ' ' make yourself ' . ' crow left murder ' represents fine return form band . whilst ' morning view ' slow , repetitive boring , this album punchy , interesting , absorbing really shows musical talent each member . also , they seem matured greatly earlier days . ' science ' fun packed full-on angst ridden overcharged heaviness , but this album uses much more appropriate balance styles . anybody could listen it find something they could relate somewhere its journey . incubus what most bands fail ; take metal music make it appeal masses without toning theirselves down all . they simply matured their music . brandon really shows his melodic capabilities aswell admirable extent his vocal range ( see ' talk shows mute ' ' made tv movie ' ) , mike einziger finds true direction adds complex guitar riffs solos his work (' sick sad little world ' amazing ) , new bassist ben kenney adds not just solid basslines but also harmonies which perfectly accompany einziger guitar sections ( hear ' pistola ' ' priceless ' ) . unfortunately , turntablist chris kilmore doesn't quite get chance shine this record ; plenty interesting samples but there noticeable absense scratching comparison bands ' earlier releases . opening track first single ' megalomaniac ' probably incubus ' most impressive start album , politically charged lyrics really show brandon songwriting stature . ' talk shows mute ' , second single album , one softest tracks album shows this band definately capable writing calming songs . ' sick sad little world ' longest song album purely amazing instrumental point view . great riffs , energetic drumming , two-minute long guitar solo middle section this track astound any guitar players who buy this record . ' southern girl ' probably most emotional track album , brandon lyrics beautifully poetic . ' here my room ' shows off guitarist mike einziger true musical talent he incorporates piano first time incubus record . overall , this truly amazing album ... whether you're fan incubus or not i seriously recommend you give this one listen	1

projector dark tranquillity most experimental album date . dark tranquillity one founders gothenburg death metal sound . projector bands walked away typical sound . there still typical melodic death metal riffs harsh vocals , but musical spectrum projector much wider . whole album got more gothic vibe . especially clean vocals use keyboards give album gothic touch . clean vocals sound deep melancholic . guitarists use less melodic death metal riffs play more atmospheric distortion less parts . guitarists use more effects guitars , like flanger-effect . one only fast songs " sun fired blanks " song still rather mid-tempo compared songs earlier albums . song " undo control " band gets little help female quest vocalist . song one my favourite songs . strangest song " day end " , which atmospheric song , without guitars . song consists clean vocals keyboard-sounds . album could heavier parts , but because songs varied well written i highly recommend this album . if you like melancholic metal some melodic death metal elements you like both clean melancholic harsh vocals , then check out projector	1

there particular scene movie " crash " literally left me breathless when i first saw it . this soundtrack , it scene goes track 10 , called " really good cloak . " those who seen film probably already know which scene i'm talking . listening mark isham score itself , months after haveing seen film , i ran across track again found it same effect me . just listening music , i became short breath , i got chills down my spine , one particular point , i felt sting tears first welling my eyes , then spilling down my cheeks . i seeing scene film again , clearly if i watching it all over , feeling same thing before . all because i listening this beautiful , haunting music . after i gathered myself little , i tried imagine same scene different music , or even no music all . while i'm sure it would still powerful moment film , i don't think it could ever so affecting , so purely poignant , it particular piece . clearly , isham crafted piece meticulously scene , just right mix wonder , awe , beauty bring viewer ( listener ) right point where i . quite frankly , anyone listen piece not it affect them all ... well , they're made sterner stuff than i . thing , whole cd sort like . music excellent its own . it ethereally beautiful way we rarely hear anymore . vocals float up out sweeping electronic harmonies , singing words i don't comprehend but nevertheless feel glean meaning . strange , slow rhythms counterpoint dark ambience create rich complex moods . truly , just terms composition , this heady stuff . but when it comes down it , this still music composed film , this case , it music made film such good one . same film different music simply would not powerful or affecting it isham score . music married film story it tells , like any good marriage it manages elevate film something higher than it might otherwise . what mark isham music " crash " nothing short remarkable . he created music which evoke moods feelings all its own , but once brought together visual medium film , it suddenly takes more depth meaning , while adding depth meaning film well . music made because movie ... but end , it music made movie good it	1

it too damn good . dark side moon , perhaps more so than any other album rock roll history , tends liked because certain cool factor ( possibly tied nevermind zeppelin iv ) . every stoner wannabe stoner put this their top 5 say things like " it trip , maaaaan " , while making sure wear dark side t-shirt let everybody know they cool status . nevertheless , i must give credit where it due , this truly one most innovative pleasing works past 50 years . fact , only pink floyd album tops it imo wall , which i would rank single greatest album all time . anyway this album which absolutely must listened straight through , whole greater than sum parts . fortunately parts pretty damn great their own . evidenced fact half these songs heard regular rotation every classic rock station english speaking world . those hits include " breathe " , " time " , " money " , " us them " , " brain damage " , but sweetest slice this pie may " great gig sky " , where piano vocals complement one take you emotional ride thought impossible means mere music	1
i actaully made point not re-reading all reviews because all i remember them quot;' then something ... ' much better , quot ; short , i don't agree . i found electropura more emotion , songs seemed grow me more , but once they they really stuck i didn't get sick them . track 2 , 4 , 6 , 11 best my opinion . course , yo la tengo their worst , least , still yo la tengo ..	1

no need elaborate many excellent reviews precede mine . this among best performances this work ever recorded ( if it not best ; i believe it ) . reviewer hsu below intimated he almost cried upon first hearing this ; i tell you after almost 30 years listening mehta work his magic this symphony , i still cry every time i listen it . zubin mehta responsible number excellent recordings decca/london during his tenure los angeles . this recording comes us help even finer orchestra nothing lessen maestro work here iin states , though : his equally splendid holst planets one most collectible vinyl records there .	1

this second album , bates could very well become barry white country music . opening " long slow kisses " seductive style kix brooks , but lowered couple notes infuse white bedroom power . throughout his sophomore release bates displays level vulnerability emotional nakedness that uncommon among nashville modern male stars , harkening back provocative works conway twitty charlie rich . tone turns tender romantic playfully salacious " hands man " cover billy " crash " craddock " rub it , " album takes wry turn human foibles " good people " challenging daily choices " that'll get you ten . " bates original voice -- both sonically lyrically -- producer blake chancey makes most each backings include guitar-and-fiddle-driven twang , steel-lined weepers sophisticated modern country ballads . this fine example how nashville contemporary without losing its country ethos .

i just saw " little women " last night boston , opera house , incredible theatre , built 1920 , judging audience reaction , this terrific show much better road than it broadway , where it unfairly ripped ny times critic , ben brantley , didn't get attention respect it deserved . simply put , music wonderful , overall , several standout numbers , including " days plenty , " " some things meant me , " " astonishing . " wonderful number , beginning , which binds four sisters together , " our finest dreams , " lovely spirited . it very difficult take classic book make it into musical . certainly some depth characters taken out , but enough there carry story across , what more , show i attended , there many teens children audience , theatre offered free child ticket every adult ticket bought - what struck me how beautiful this story female empowerment - sisterhood . every time sisters seem coming apart , they remind each other their love support each other . what courageous , wonderful message ! mother , played beautifully maureen mcgovern , instrumental keeping home hearth together while girls ' father away war . real war going iraq , this production much more moving . i disagree many negative comments - music lyrics high quality , often moving , sincere , literate , emotional . this may not rodgers hammerstein , but what these days ? this closer old-fashioned musical than many - it heart class . it certainly better than something like " hello , dolly ! " which really bogus story only couple decent songs . here , you involving story , terrific protagonist jo , surrounded other compelling characters , whole world brought life ( production i saw stunning sets , costumes , lighting ) , passion clarity . fact i saw " little women " boston , just stone throw away concord , where louisa may alcott actually lived - where her home preserved - may something overwhelmingly positive reaction i this fine production , but listen yourself . music lyrics hopeful moving - it story our times reminds us innocence , sacrifice , good morals . it great show entire family - says something young girls positive life affirming . it all things really matter life it certainly worth few dollars - bargain , if you ask me - listen this fine cd . better thing catch show tour , where i predict it great success . you won't disappointed	1

alan vega martin rev waaay ahead their time . though their debut wasn't officially released until ' 78 ( even then , it predated debuts joy division , killing joke , cure , possibly even pil year or so ) , this guitarless ny duo around since ' 71 . anyway this album genesis post-punk/new wave , performed beat-up organ/synthesizer rev probably found back alley music shop , decrepit but chugging drum machine brings futuristic pulse eerie synths alan vega voice , which sounds like elvis detained guantanomo . very original , very creepy , very cool . material varies what would otherwise poppy tracks made slightly unnerving due their foreboding starkness ( girl , cheree , keep your dreams ) more haunting atmospheric songs ( ghost rider , rocket usa , che ) even one track sounds bit like primitive doors cut ( i remember ) . then there 10-minute frankie teardrop -- perhaps one most terrifying claustrophobic songs ever released , vega banshee screams punctuating narrative young factory worker who kills himself his own family out desperation wakes up hell . conclusion , its ominous synths vega sounding if he going insane horror around him , leave scar your mind . bonus material includes decent , if roughly recorded cbgb performance confrontational chaotic " 23 minutes over brussels " show which important historical reasons , i suppose , but isn't worth listening more than once or twice . first disc all you need know . bit primitive dated places , but still vital , influential , amazing fans genre .	1
most buyers aren't market complete mahler cycle one conductor , but if they , two bernstein contain many great performances . i've reviewed contents sixties cycle sony this later one eighties ( contianing many live performances ) dg , taking them one symphony time . but it worthwhile give sense strongest weakest parts each set . cycle #1 : general consensus performance sym . #3 one glories this cycle perhaps most inspired mahler condcuting bernstein disc . it all freshness discovery -- lb new mahler 1961 . sony 20-bit remastering makes original analog sound quite good -- fact , there no need comment sound quality these ny phil . recordings , none which bad . expect deep sound stage wide stereo separation columbia records favored time . bernstein also put his stamp sym . #7 such way no one would ever hear it same again . ' song night , ' this work dubbed , almost no life either disc or concert stage ( mahler champions prominent bruno wlater never performed it ) . not only lb prove this coherent music , he made unforgettable drama out seventh . this his signature recording work . two other great performances stand out : sym . #2 #4 , each rendered amazing imagination huge range emotions . accusation lb went over top second unjustified -- he often tender delicate -- but there no doubt he takes apocalyptic view finale . whatever you think his approach , he single-handedly revolutionized way resurrection sym . played . sym . #4 classic recording bruno walter , but lb added more depth , imaginaiton , excitement . lyric soprano reri grist come good deal criticism vocal finale , but i think she fits beautifully into lb overall conception . middle pack , it , we get lb readings sym . #1 #9 . he went conduct greater readings both works , especially ninth . person lb first real showpiece , but somehow sony sonics not up conductor vision . cse ninth , ny version would qualify outstanding performance if there weren't so many truly great ones karajan , bruno walter , james levine , barbirolli , among others . bernstein himself would add two greatest , both dg . i find few problems wiht sym . #5 , #6 , #8 first cycle . many critics all three great recordings . some reason , i never warmed up either lb versions sym . #5 , where once he manipulate exaggerate point spirit work seems lost histrionics . sym . #6 too brisk first movement let music expand its visionary potential , other movements bernstein seems less expressive than he could . eighth unmathced excitement joyousness part 1 , some listeners whole symphony remains exalted level . i find lb too studied part 2 , my attention wasn't held . he elicit very beautiful singing playing , however . it should noted this performance london sym . host fine english singers . end his life bernstein resisted deryck cooke completion tenth sym ., agreeing conduct only shattering adagio . which mahler essentially finished full score . bernstein reading ny phil . one most searing accounts this magnificent fragment ever received , equaled his later live reading incomparable vienna phil . cycle #2 : it should said right off dg digital sonics different league what lb got new york . even though several venues involved ( vienna , amsterdam , new york ) , many recordings under live concert conditions , dg engineers triumphed . they favor closer mike posiitons , solo highlighting , vivid sound stage compared their predecessors new york . interprettions , few exceptions -- most prominent sym . #6 -- bernstein not drastically change his views first cycle , some cases readings feel almost identical ( sym . #2 #7 , example ) . most interest centers works where lb clearly outdoes his younger self . top list i would put sym . #6 #9 . former he achieved one classic mahler reacordings modern era . his sixth slowed down 2 min . first movement , giving music room expand properly . andante heartbreaking heartwarming same time . finale explosion genius mahler part lb resonates perfectly . almost same said ninth , where conducting reaches deeply moving areas expression . finale drastically slow ( levine , similar devastating effect ) , which some critics find excessive . but it truism no tempo right or wrong ; everything depends upon drawn into world music . lb achieved great ninth but would surpass himself live performance berlin 1979 , also dg . almost great sym . #1 , which dg receives flawless performance packed excitement . i'm not sure lb reading actually changed , but superlative sonics spine-tingling playing concertgebiuw weren't matched new york . next thing ask where bernstein fell short his earlier versions . sym . #2 , #3 , #4 new york one kind , representing lb early most exciting explorations mahler world . their counterparts dg also strong , but i don't think they rise heights he achieved earlier . only sharp criticism i use boy soprano finale fourth ; musical he , boy too undeveloped capture what mahler intended . it should said , however , if earlier ny versions didn't exist , these would outstanding performances . i feel much same sym . #7 , where lb first recording set standard only two or three rivals come close , but his dg remake , which return ny phil . oncert lincoln center(as sym . #2 #3 ) , feels fractionally less overwhelming . it better sound , however . one symphony i can't compare fifth , which doesn't satisfy me either cycle . dg version vienna phil . convinces many listeners , some critics call unsurpassable , but i am not its wavelength . leaves sym . #8 , which bernstein didn't live record commercial release . dg reached into its vaults live 1975 radio tape vienna , although it flaws execution , including some rough singing part 2 , lb conducting superlative , more ocmpelling than his version london . paired this symphony 1974 reading adagio sym . #10 , also vienna phil . you'd expect , it inspired , searing reading , just like ny version . how ot sum up ? if money no object , i'd own both cycles pleasure bernstein unqiue inspiration . if i pick choose , i'd take sym . #2 , #3 , #4 new york , sym . #8 london , rest form dg cycle .	1
i got hooked beatles ' music listening my parents ' records child . i collected all their albums cd up through rubber soul . my opinion , i think rubber soul their best album . shows band height their career . their songwriting become more mature less teenybopperish . after rubber soul , their albums more drug-influenced less group effort their songwriting becomes sub-par , exception few gems here there . here those few gems , i recommend getting beatles 1	1

this album designed relax you . it very good job . doctors could prescribe this album releive stress ! it quiets down room , masking sound life outside . playing it causes your breathing slow , takes edge off cruel difficult world . environments produced least two " psychologically ultimate " albums including this one " psychologically ultimate thunderstorm . " i them ever since they first came out vinyl ' 70s . i lost my copy this album years ago , but managed find thunderstorm album vinyl . i then recorded it cd play it all night long sleep . i know ultimate thunderstorm not real thunderstorm , but white noise some sound effects top . i later found copy this album vinyl recorded it my computer , set up 10 hour playlist which simply repeats seashore play it help me relax , when i work home , when i go sleep . it more relaxing than thunderstorm because it doesn't thunderstorm sometimes intrusive rumbling thunder . accordingly , it gets played more than thunderstorm . it interesting see reviews below state psychologically ultimate seashore recorded night because there no gull noises . it my recollection it not actually recording or seashore , but simulation designed relaxing -- just like ultimate thunderstorm . this reason it self described " psychologically ultimate . " it sounds so good . comments show how good simulation it ! i've purchased actual recordings ocean thunderstorms they not relaxing . reason album works because it contains white noise . white noise sound contains every frequencywithin range human hearing equal amounts . this static type sound you get when radio dial isn't tuned station . pink noise variant white noise , except tonal balance different . this sound moving water makes . when used properly , it here , low level pink noise it very relaxing . because this album contains all frequencies , it masks noise intruding outside world . synthetic silence . they managed use technology record love peace ! it sounds better than real thing	1

brahms monumental piano concertos my very favorite piano concertos . therefore , i own many recordings same . nevertheless , this recording gilels jochum my absolute favorite ! it recording i've listened , least , once week many years . gilels jochum truly play these " monsters form " wonderfully capturing brahms fierceness well his tenderness beautifully . truth known , i slightly prefer 1st concerto-i know musical sacrilege . my god , gilels plays hell out work delivering those ( what i call ) " trills death " first movement such manner it still sends chills up down my spine no matter how many time i listened work . dgg superb job it transfer this " new " cd form . i owned original vinyl recordings ; however , i feel these cds give recording more depth sound far richer . if you want hear legendary sublime recording brahms piano concertos , buy these discs .	1
oh yeah .. music playing , isn't it ? i put this album listen it again so i could write review , then my mind started wandering . little later i remembered i supposed paying attention writing review .. i looked down cd changer , it five minutes into third track . might give you some insight into what kind music this . music that underwhelming enough you just randomly lose track it long periods time , even while trying pay special attention it so you articulate what you like dislike i t.t hat said , times when i remember it playing , i enjoy it . every song meticulously crafted creative sounds creative dynamics . understated vocal performance enhances handful beautiful collages mellow sounding synthetic instrumentation . few tracks border experimental side . but all creativity beauty caribou basic sound doesn't make up boringness emotionlessness songcrafting . die-hard indie fans who pray altar pitchfork love this album , anyone who liked his previous work under name ' manitoba ' . anyone else should probably skip it	1
i into explosions sky few years now they highly influential towards me my fellow band members writing . this album i find their most experimental ( apart " rescue " which isn't million miles off impossible get your hands actual copy , other than it free download off their site ) . this album my favourite alongside " earth not cold dead place " , every song this record extremely well written timed . song " you passed through this night ? " only song they recorded vocals extremely well placed dead centre album . classic formula progressive build up wall noise finally isn't better any other band , songs like " poor mans memory " back my point up undoubtedly . listening this album you see how it takes them so long write record each track/album ( sometimes taking up six months just write one track ) they composed perfectly beautifully . through my eyes what ever emotion you feeling before you play this record only added masterpieces songs , sadness , bliss , ecstatic ness , despair etc . this bands ability fuel emotions thought patterns quite astounding , i think every song personal effect everyone who listens it . album artwork sweet good use line , textures tone . ever person i recommended this band two come back me expressed nothing but glee towards their listening experience . so i say two you don't show hesitation towards purchasing this album .	1

i rarely write reviews music but feel i must share my impressions this cd . i long heard some my favorite singers praise songwriting prowess townes but somehow never got around buying one his records . i finally picked this one up because it two songs covered two my favorite singers -- lyle lovett- " lungs " ( among others ) steve earle- " tecumseh valley " . i blown away sheer beauty poetry every song this recording . other reviewers seem comparing this other townes ' records . i come different angle . someone who long heard townes sopken highest praise , i say this disk not disappoint influence me fill out my collection his recordings . i also say i am deeply frustrated i never took advantage chance see townes perform while he alive .	1
i originally heard many tracks ( more or less same remix ) best club hits 1 european party vacation . they sound just good here this amazing double-disk compilation . most tracks disk 1 lyrics making them more palatable mainstream dance enthuse while still keeping beat going underground clubber . you'll recognize vocalists like moby or disk 1 , track 13 , " i'll fly you " masterfully blended bleed into previous tracks . i wasn't tiered either disk or find beats repetitive or dull after party faded dawn . i liked it so much i took best club hits 1 downtown tokyo went 4-hour run . manic colorful energy this enormous city made unforgettable visual impact , perfected only its best club hits 1 soundtrack	1

auspicious title really say it all this collection trumpeter miles davis ' 1949 nonet dates . these dozen performances whole new school jazz created , former beboppers davis drummer max roach joined forces progressive composers , arrangers players such gil evans , gerry mulligan john lewis explore subtler moodier side genre vituoso standpoint . mellow results most part , there world complexity detail found here which no self-respecting jazzhead ( nor anyone else who really cares music ) afford miss . would often case throughout his long varied career , davis featured these sessions primarily player crafter atmosphere . despite brought sizeable combo ( which also featured such famed blowers lee konitz alto saxophone kai winding trombone ) together serving its nominal head , maestro takes only one half-credit composer these dates , bulk charts coming mulligan , lewis course evans , whose big band orchestrations provided miles his initial inspiration . these other gentlemen would also incorporate innovations realized birth cool sessions far more extensively into their respective subsequest careers than would trumpeter himself , thus marking this classic set recordings not only once-in-a-lifetime supergroup summit , but truly pivotal moment jazz history	1

just i walking onto my street school some guy passenger seat ford mustang leans out side yells , " happy 420 !! hey !! " ho damn i just cracked up knew england , approximately 1 square kilometer , there atleast 7 people smoking weed . anyways here almost unheard cd released sometime ago when green day just sapped up fame their-then newly released american idiot . however , order sap this review any shame , i won't talk green day anymore . what we treated here simply amazing . jari previously viking metal band ensiferum , but schelduled recording wintersun ensiferum tour during same date . jari forced choose his booked recording wintersun ensiferum . he eventually chose wintersun forced leave ensiferum behind . my case , smart move ... " beyond dark sun " comprised strong power metal drumming , melodic catchy riffs rounded out death metal vocals . guitar work jari pretty amazing . it flashy , technical , impressive without going over top . things really slow down better " death healing . " folk vibe well tact , but musically , things brought down several notches . jari guitar work really fantastic here because he shows audience he doesn't play lightning fast get job . it laid back you feel emotion he puts into it well . some tracks here tend get long , but because there so much going here it never gets boring . " beautiful death " just over seven minutes you would think this genre you can't or should go past four minute mark , but guys so talented composing there no time think boredom because tracks only get more beautifully complex multi dimensional . i think fans different genres music get into this because there so much offer . galloping riffs beats plentiful here . jari kai so talented handle each instrument great pride intelligence . there nothing lethargic or lagging here . this grade music . not too forget mentioning cover , which grabbed my attention way back late 2005 . view fallen man during winter unforgiving reign . sun shines brightly it , unable break void winter punishing atmosphere , wind , vibe . it very calm though , night fading absence life . one thing creeped me out most though orangish/brownish aura off right distance away snow corpse . something it just made we wish i wasn't night out woods if i saw it . i never liked too much black metal or very power metal stuff , but this cd emotion , skill , talent plundered within . two men handling responsibility create great music soul , mind , metalhead . not just any metalhead ... but one who appreciate culture mind eye represented not just this , but world only brings forth epic music	1

i am one those hard-core jazz heads really like footprints-live ! but ask most dedicated fans they tell you : wayne shorter great , music heavy - but its not particularly moving . not particularly energetic . i'll admit , footprints more than little cerebral . i went carnegie hall check out quartet live summer 2003 show interesting , but not remotely exciting . beyond sound barrier sounds like totally different band . while inescapable complexity still there , exciting forcefulness bubbles underneath everything . result effusive , rhythmically assertive sections overflowing action energy quieter more introspective section seem simmer potential energy . this wayne shorter we , who knew him , remember love . he leads this ensemble their radical sonic shifts plays beautiful throughout . rhythm section danilo , john , brian among best i ever heard live or record . they simply seem get it one . this album beautiful . its great see some musicians create such great music their golden years opposed usual sad story desperation lost skill . here wayne shorter - may he live long ( even still ) keep creating music we catch up	1

all fairness , i concede i late adopter sister hazel musical stylings . it wasn't until i saw them perform house blues hollywood back 2001 i found myself sold their brand rock roll . it wasn't long before i went out slowly collected all their cd . after purchased listened their album " live live , " i asked " lift " my birthday , thinking there no way they could go wrong . i mean every album i've gotten them , i've absolutely loved . how quickly i proved wrong . when i first began listening , i actually started wonder if cd case fact sister hazel cd . their sound totally watered down processed point where i haven't able find one track i like , all all , i feel little cheated . given their last real album -- " chasing daylight " -- wonderful , i'm loss words . while " chasing ...

first off , this great album . starting off album " one these days , " instrumental piece mainly showing off drummer nick mason skills , but also featuring catchy bass riff roger waters , david gilmour finger sliding guitar . next " pillow winds , " personally one my favorite pink floyd song ever . it very soft song features mostly pastoral lyrics . next " fearless , " sort southern rock , non-pink floyd sounding song , but highly listenable . then there san tropez , seamus . easily my least favorite off album . these two songs something you probably wouldn't expect pink floyd . then finally there " echoes , " 20 minute piece gives you taste what new pink floyd would bring . this song wonderful lyrics music . all together great album collector piece any pink floyd fan	1

i worshipped nellie birchmere 1/22 while she performed nearly everything " get away me " intermixed her new creations sony unreleased " pretty little head .

you really get full band feel throughout most this album they add horns many tracks well . only problem this album it their longest features most amount songs longer than their trademark under 3 minutes , even 2 minutes . there number songs here longer than 4 some just feel longer . certain point it just feels if album stayed past its welcome . i'm not sure if it . i like this album because it shows influence grunge few tracks while also staying true stylistic flipping song song they known . you might not make it through entire album one sitting , but it still high quality	1

early sixties there stir going musically brand new world pop rock music around area quiet cathedral city canterbury kent . catalyst all this , which wittily called " canterbury sound " , stemmed band calling themselves " wilde flowers " ( appropriate sixties misspelling like " beatles " " byrds " . ) formed 1963 band imploded 1967 , splitting into two major fractions , one side , more avant-garde jazz/rock fusion minded musicians , robert wyatt , hugh hopper , kevin ayers , going off form " soft machine " which later begat such bands '' gong '' , " kevin ayers whole world " , matching mole , etc . while other more pop/rock members richard coughlan , pye hastings , david sinclair , his bass playing cousin richard sinclair , went off formed " caravan " . four members caravan went off what every self respecting band much beloved era , went into retreat country " get it together " after year camping just outside nearby seaside resort whitstable , rehearsing every night nearby church hall , fighting off starvation , they became one tightest little musical outfits british isles without even playing gig . 1968 they snapped up american record label verve who released their first album caravan ( 1968 ) . which went completely unnoticed record buying public , which hardly surprising nobody heard them , there next no publicity verve went bust anyway . this all put right , when great enthusiasm giant decca records signed up our young heroes recording contract , not only prepared them their second album , but sent them out road get them public eye . this included not only playing any place would them , but such major events kraalingen pop festival rotterdam holland front 250,000 people same bill " pink floyd " , " jefferson airplane " , " santana " , " frank zappa " , admittedly " caravan " first second morning , so most people probably asleep , but some them must taken notice holland always stronghold " caravan " fans . caravan second album wonderfully titled " if i could it again i would it all over you " ( 1970 ) which released far greater fanfare critical acclaim . enabling band enlarge their following develop their natural talents . after six months road promoting album band ushered back into air london studio , under inspirational eye young producer david hitchcock record follow up album . when band came back out studio released results it waiting public they come out what many people consider seminal moment early seventies . " land grey pink " (1971 ) one most unique instantly recognisable sounds history rock , perhaps little whimsical some , but then lot its charm . those fondly remembered days innocence , anything written any member band considered band composition , songwriting royalties equally shared amongst band members , far cry today mercenary contracts . " land grey pink " , what you actually get three richard sinclair finest ever songs , one pye hastings ( according pye fair enough he written most first two albums ) , then side two vinyl album taken up one twenty-two minute opus " nine feet underground " which came five separate movements , four bridges , mainly written david sinclair , others linking all parts together , adding bits here there . album opens ' golf girl ' wonderful song love ( there no songs war , hate or politics ' caravan repertoire , just songs idealised life we all relate our happier moments ) richard sinclair future wife . this song should played regularly all pattaya many golf bars , no song could improve atmosphere bar more . " golf girl " followed richard sinclair song " winter wine " song fairy tales dreams which weaves perfectly feeling well laid down first song . next up pye hastings composition " love love you ( tonight pigs fly ) " . lyrics this very hummable song extremely naughty , not smutty , or crude , just enjoyably naughty . title track richard sinclair number nursery rhyme set music if sung children , including one most beautiful piano solo ever put down tape , lyrics would soften most jaded soul , " not leaving your dad out rain , those nasty grumbley grimblies , cleaning your teeth sea " songs final verse sung bubble you would sing six month old baby , quite delightful . albums epic " nine feet underground " stunning display exactly how well members caravan mastered their chosen instruments , including duel lead vocals pye hastings richard sinclair . obviously it mainly david sinclair keyboard fore through out , deservedly so he par any player his day , piano , hammond organ mellotron all given thorough workouts space allowed nine feet underground twenty two minutes , but this not detract jazzy bass work richard sinclair , melodic lead guitar work pye hastings , or rock solid drumming richard coughlan . there also room pye brother jimmy hastings come add some flute tenor saxophone . although albums not great commercial success time it never taken out print sells steadily this day , decca just released remastered version thirty minutes extra music , including two tracks recorded time but left off because time limitations , demo versions two richard sinclair songs , plus alternative ending " nine feet underground " where " caravan " prove they could rock hard any their contemporaries if they wanted . commercial failure album lead great internal stresses within caravan , david sinclair pack up his keyboards leave almost immediately , going off search his musical ideal robert wyatt " matching mole " . cousin richard lasted one more album , ' waterloo lily ' ( 1972 ) before he cast off roam afield musical world , later forming " hatfield north " , before joining " camel " caravan stumbled , but never match magnificence ' land grey pink " only reforming one off gigs nineties financial reasons . mott	1

" what you , " " anything , " make me believe " " there you " all sounded terrific " i love you " -- little pop-py country music ( i'd never huge country fan , but phase country junior high ) but still country ( la presence steel guitar almost every song ) . 1999 emotion martina mcbride surprised me extremely delectable combination perfect country-pop . definitely suggested buy any country fan	1

i stumbled across this album through blog sites which reviewed unknown , obscure or forgotten bands various genres . buffalo band formed early 70 australia , following blues hard rock tradition . their first lp dipped into variety hard rock blues styles , some which very good , but overall lacked cohesiveness . during their tour they went back studio cranked out this masterpiece , which straight up heavy hard rock . there not bad tune bunch , " sunrise , " what became their signature concert tune , " shylock , " one heaviest tunes come out 70s . how decribe it ? think steppenwolf vocals sabbath rhythm section , you come close . quick , pounding tunes 9+ minute epics , volcanic rock unheard 70 hard rock masterpiece criminally overlooked overseas . now cd , listeners chance check out one great australian rock bands 70s . bonus cuts include mono single version " sunrise , " live version " shylock " which sounds like audience recording -- not very good sound quality , but it gives insight their live performance	1
although it hard say sure which marley album best i say this one ranks very high my list . all songs based around same theme which holds album together making it complete listen . i could listen this album forever	1

exit(1981 ) . tangerine dream 14th (?) studio album . all throughout 70s , tangerine dream experimenting limits various keyboard , pedal synthesizer , sequence effects order create very atmospheric musical soundscapes . they weren't meant everyone , but each album proved interesting listen those who could get into them . every release would very few , yet lengthy tracks , aspect didn't really change much over years . phaedra(1974 ) rubycon(1975 ) peak output those type td albums , served first real means gaining cult fanbase . then force majeure(1979 ) saw group beginning incorporate rhythms into music , making it more accessible new listeners . this culminated 1980 tangram , which last album feature one giant album-length song . shortly thereafter , band created soundtrack movie thief(1981 ) , shortening lengths each instrumental making them more numerous , this would carry over onto exi t.t his album first one theirs more than four tracks , most them rarely go beyond 5-6 minutes . unlike most td output released throughout 80s , exit carries dark , futuristic feel it , it felt all over album . white eagle(1982 ) continued explore same vein , hyperborea(1983 ) went dark ambient sound cultural references , but exit probably pulled theme off best during this period . much style brought over their thief soundtrack score given its own breathing space exit . high-reverb keyboards begun incorporated heavily into melodies , although sounding very 80s maybe coming off cold some people , it works its warish 1984-type atmosphere . speaking future wars , first track ' kiev mission ' delivers 10 minutes melodic rhythm mayhem . story here this track written protest statement against cold war russia , many copies this album sold throughout country get message across . it starts out few bangs , then slowly synthetic drum beat pulses carries powerful theme around , shortly before unnamed russian girl vocalist whispers her plea against world war . this where whole " protest " theme came . it doesn't end strong it starts , but final part kiev mission shouldn't skipped . ' pilots purple twighlight ' run without any drumming , but carries awesome melody repeats several minutes . ' chorozon ' bit more upbeat positive sounding , could easily fit white eagle . i love title track slow , dark , powerful bass synth plods , complete memorable keyboard line rain sound effects . then ' network 23 ' surprisingly non-dated techno drum sequence which sort serves prototype some 80s 90s techno . finishing off exit outstanding ' remote viewing ' which goes through few different transitions its 8-minute span . first 3 minutes or so sort dark soundscape reminding fans td still held onto their 70s era extent , wouldn't abandon it completely over next couple albums . 80s td may somewhat less complex than td earlier material , but it still very well produced . then song ends lighter section repeats number times . replayability : medium . enter exit often ( pun intended ) . although album length slightly less than 40 minutes , each exit tracks high quality , so i'll give it 5 stars . it ended up my fifth purchase ( many ! ) td , but i would say it makes good starting point if you're first getting into 80s td . highly recommended . sad thing every album out print ! even remasters ! so don't expect find these stores . unless you know used cd shop happens get td albums time time , you're best off ordering them online . there many , many albums , but thankfully most all them found very cheap . either version album works . there no bonus tracks , volume difference only minimal , so buying any them ok . see also : -tangram(1980)-force majeure(1979)-white eagle(1982)-thief(1981)-hyperborea(1983	1

this great showcase american string quartet , innovation , vision , iconoclasm , all elements which we often overlook forget easily . but only elliot carter missing , that because he what ! five quartets now . inclusion first carter would rounded things out . earle brown here neglected masterwork . based graphic notation performers don't improvise so much given entrance freedoms within prescribed range . affect mysterious , haunting , also innovative wide pallette extended techniques , bridge , sul ponticello , plucking . we often forget traditional beauty cage engaged early part his career , forties . this quartet fine consummate example , soft , gentle lines , very sparce , transparent , also he limits himself few tones , tossed around various voices . structures feldman early work here , quartet treated one monolith sound , indistinguishable voices playing harmonics , cello playing where violin plays , same range . all feldman floating gentleness here well , perhaps too much times , like it overspends its welcome . crumb black angels classic , kronos takened this around block many times , crumb always works well programmatic agenda place , here he transforms quartets introspective consititution more drammatic focus . druckman well also works well program but here there none . he fine imagination sonoric structures , balance , but its doesn't seem amount much . wolpe one his best works . his creativity uneven , here violence charged motives he found place jump , reiterate , toss around environment high energy . wolff summer early work prior his metamorphosis into utilization political imagery comparison , this beautiful work , but cold , wolff also needs program , which he profoundly found , he alater quartet he wrote eighties more compelling	1

my title suggests this excellent compilation some very refreshing remixes people who appreciate both original versions open-minded enough understand how remixes need constructed so they beat-matched dj proper " big room " sound works so well clubs . needless say couple tunes " radio edits " -- why remix compilation used dj other clubbers label wouldn't include only 12 " versions beyond me . regardless pick this cd up b/c virtually all tunes amazing . particular bowie remix " live " crowd cheering effects which when played nightclub " trick ear " dancefloor into thinking everyone around them raving mad . course this then encourages crowd respond similarly creating even more powerful effect club , which something all dj love see ... hopefully , makers this excellent remix series refrain " radio edits " future compilations	1

dylan band made each other ; you tell this album , " planet waves " bootleg series album features his 1966 concert newcastle , england . ( disc , way , band drummer levon helm absent , he quit tour . ) i'd like correct something said previous reviewer , though . reviewer stephen . walsh says , " first time bob toured band ( then hawks ) 1966 , they booed everywhere they went . that because so-called " liberal " folkies actually reactionaries when it came their singers . they wanted them stick woody guthrie mode , beat up acoustic denim workshirt , talkin ' ' singin ' dust bowl . " actually , mr. walsh , tour you refer took place england , not america ; dylan wasn't booed " denim workshirt " liberal american crowd , he booed snobbish brits who still adjusting radical change sound . politics nothing it . dylan " electric " show met resistance previously " denim workshirt " crowd newport folk festival . but more ) really crappy sound mix , which made dylan his backup band ( mostly studio musicians who'd played " like rolling stone " ) sound like fingernails chalkboard , ) fact it newport folk festival . if you bluegrass festival , how would you react if , say , metallica showed up ? 1966 , " like rolling stone " already smash hit , " denim workshirt " crowd more than adjusted dylan new sound . so , let leave not-so-subtle rightwing attacks against liberal politics out it , okay	1
i saw great show fishlips bakersfield last wednesday : wayne " train " hancock . he sang like modern-day hank williams , great band , just jake stand up bass , johnny telecaster . wayne just strummed acoustic guitar , one stroke per beat , but always right pocket , his guitar holding down tempo while electric guitar filled when he wasn't singing , bass just kept beat going like crazy . it testament trio chops they could inspire someone dance right first song . they really crazy rhythm going it never let up . there not even drummer band . bass player always pushing beat , but perfect placement , intonation , which ain't easy fretless stand up bass . wayne played 2 hours , he let his girlfriend gina play few songs while he took break . i took opportunity get wayne autograph . when he got back stage he sang talked all counties where he incarcerated . quite few . i loved show , it prodigious display musical virtuosity . if you closed your eyes you could sworn it hank williams , yet he his own style , wasn't just clone hank . he what hank would sound like if he alive just little bit older than hank williams iii , his grandson right now . songs tulsa great , whether he live or studio , he sounds fantastic . wayne hancock refuses compromise his music , sweeten it , make it more commercial , anything other than play music he really feels deep down inside , make you feel it deep down inside , too .	1

this cd , essence , not same band you heard recorded masterful album becoming . parted ways kelli dayton ( now kelli ali ) , their first highly definitive lead singer , sneaker pimps underwent sort reinvention . while their initial sound extremely bass heavy , eerie , focused less guitar-range notation , bloodsport finds itself drastically less dark ambience . rather than sexy club mystique old , this cd offers much more cynical perspective . this rather successful venture : outset , songs like " kiro tv " " small town witch " driving powerful , enough traces trip hop left feed your hunger some dance grooves . where their original moody dance sound become less prevalent , however , it replaced tinges alternative rock post-grunge , especially case songs like " sick " . this daunting change sneaker pimps , who so capable their previous trip hop ambience . but it seems worked , because album quite coherent cohesive , rarely if ever falling into tangential realms sound past or future . there what i consider couple weak points songs " black sheep " " fuel " , however , which may simply because they represent unsuccessful return slow mood sneaker pimps ' older material . this setting , especially through chris corner voice , songs become dryly emotional such way bore death . say what you raw emotion brought corner voice , but electronic tracks such these unjustifiably slow moody without any emotional return listener . one feels certain blandness rather than sympathy ought desired . lyrics add dead-ballad feel , succeeding elsewhere album but these songs falling flat their faces . but spite these small failings , this good album . those who loved kelli ali bubblegum stylings sneaker pimps dark , rich trip hop feel she brought band probably disappointed , but this band deserves better than those expectations imposed upon wholly different lineup . look this recording coming separate artist it much easier enjoy , ultimately quite worth time .	1

this collection showcases wide range music various celtic countries . quality selections varies considerably : 4 yn bar knockout ( i wish their albums easier find -- i've no luck so far ) , poozies ( love name ! ) altan tracks great , quot;culloden harvestquot ; beautifully heart-rending . maire breatnach contribution lovely , too , i've subsequently bought both her albums . milladoiro selection pleasant but not typical their style , which lively point raucous times . other end spectrum , quot ; treequot ; puts me sleep , quot ; lone harperquot ; only so-so , clarsach accompaniment final track amazingly inept although vocal very sweet . this album great way become acquainted variety groups musical styles , but it definitely mixed bag	1

this best these sides sounded ever , period . it really treat hear early basie band lester young all its glory . sound restoration some these tracks just unbelievable , i check linear notes make sure these 1940 recordigs , because they sounded so different muddy/scratchy sound i grew used . linear notes alone worth price this box set . one full disc most unreleased live tracks , many lester young billie holiday ? you math . many people , i am not included , waiting full columbia sessions remastered , but me , this what i waiting many years . track secuence annoying , i still cant understand why not doing it chronological , but its just minor flaw	1
thelonious monk signed columbia records early 60's; because this , he able get his music out many more listeners than he could his previous labels . his first studio album columbia entitled monk dream , it introduced him lot new listeners who never heard him . criss-cross his second studio album columbia , it awesome follow-up . my opinion , it better than monk dream . monk quartet here : charlie rouse tenor sax , thelonious monk piano , john ore bass , frankie dunlop drums . this album mainly monk originals quartet , but there also two standards which monk interprets brilliantly . compositions monk always brilliant . his best songs this album dark jagged quot ; criss-crossquot ; , slow swinging quot ; pannonicaquot ; , sparse colorful quot ; crepuscule nelliequot ; , uptempo boppish quot ; eronelquot ; . but quot ; rhythm-a-ningquot ; also awesome because monk puts very original rhythmic melody rhythm changes , which bop cliche ' . also , quot ; think onequot ; demonstrates monk ability make one note interesting catchy melody . so , i would say this album superb showcase his compositions . however , this album demonstrates something else thelonious : his ability take standard transform it make it sound like he wrote it . main example trio performance quot ; tea twoquot ; . it starts bass playing verse only drums . then monk comes chorus , you tell he lot harmonic thinking this . standout his solo piano performance quot;don't blame mequot ; . monk one my favorite solo piano players becuase his ability make every song interesting different while still sounding like monk . quot;don't blame mequot ; darker more dissonant than original melody ; monk alterations here remind me quot;monk moodquot ; . bonus tracks here also interesting listen . two out three alternate takes , but quot ; coming hudsonquot ; monk song unorthodox metric structure ( sections 5 bars long , bridge 3 1/2 bars long ) . i see why this didn't make cut album because rouse sounds like he trying desperately hang odd form . but , composition sounds very natural very catchy even its unusual structure . i would recommend this album all jazz fans , especially those who haven't gotten much into monk . if you're only going own one monk album rest your life , own this one	1
picture bird gliding over surface water honest advertisement album could made . music once light graceful yet reality there lot work going here . back 1972 when this released , this album could passed " new age " except there no such phrase time . but return forever perfect keeping image ecm time high quality playing matched somewhat removed austere air . but keeping image " effortless gliding " these four selections tend put listener relaxed , light breezy mood . this saying something because if you actually focus music it quite busy jam packed twists turns distinct " latin " feel . chick corea keeps electric keyboard he used under miles davis . joe farrell uses both set flutes saxophones good effect yet it never strikes one this " saxophone " album . stanley clarke airto moreira give jazz lesson performing rhythm taste complete service band leader . flora purim ( never particularly one my favorites ) sings only two occasions during this album actually manages blend her vocals her band mates such way they become part brew rather than noise standing apar t.t hat all said , this still very much corea album stands one best he ever made . given somewhat " free jazz " past , corea returned popular appeal making record easy understand yet off beaten path . this over years led some dismiss return forever piece fluff-ear candy more " shallow " jazz audience . only thing one say this kind snobbery : " if it so easy you it . " but easy or not , it reward you each listening .	1

yeah , elo gets bad rap stuffy critics , but i'll hogtied if they didn't make some most delectable , silly pop since beatles started fighting . time one their very best later classics , full starry-eyed optimistic pop only jeff lynne could write , produce perform , well some comically enjoyable electronic effects synthesizers still sound great despite their obviously dated sounds . jeff elo loved making ridiculous concept albums , like eldorado tale universal dreamer romp through dream world , time tells fractured tale unwilling time traveler . opening vocoder monologue introduction , you know you're ridiculous ride , music certainly doesn't disappoint . " twilight " shines overdubbed vocal arrangements keyboard riff shamelessly lifted " baba o'riley . " " yours truly , 2095 " might album most ridiculously corny cuts , it all better it -- tale man who falls love robot who " iq 1001 , she jumpsuit , she also telephone . " throw top robot voice repeating " 2095 " " i love you sincerely , yours truly , " you've got shamelessly glitzy work pop art . " remember good old 1980 " kicks off surprisingly effective ( if schmaltzy ) " ticket moon , " operatic ballad . jangly acoustic guitars peppy rhythms power some typical elo rock " way life meant " apocalyptic " rain falling . " dance beats heavy bass thumps power similar tracks " end world " " here news . " " lights go down " one my favorites--it got great lynne falsetto chorus sounds like stolen version zeppelin " d'yer mak'er . " " hold tight , " its great french verses , last song album , cutting up futuristic vibe blast rockabilly . all all , there nothing time whole load substance , though lynne meditations future sometimes eerily spot-on resonant . it doesn't matter me , though -- elo all records like this . it catchy , delightfully tacky pop forged master craftsman who knows all right buttons push super hooks . it may tacky , but time still whole lot fun 25 years later	1

usually artists newely revised versions their old previous successful numbers after they washed out can't seem recreate magic they years back when they highly successful . well , theory may or may not apply vince guaraldi his 1968 release oh , good grief . though some years back , guaraldi highly successful his first version linus lucy , when it appeared cbs special , merry christmas charlie brown , soundrack special , perhaps many who so love guaraldi his music back early 1960 , forgotten guaraldi . popular side guaraldi . then there people who know guaraldi musician say he just getting his way more adventurous side himself , his albums more free , his experimentation various keyboards highly creative parts his career . said , this album revised cuts previously successful selections he earlier decade . perhaps , there great reason guaraldi update his old classics . guraldi here , re-does these tunes harpsichord electric piano . sound different new . though some may call music this cd very , " elevator , " i say it new exciting turn guaraldi his music . eddie duran gives life this happy bright quartet . his raunchy guitar sound compliments guaraldi assortment electric keyboards . stanely gilbert bass , carl burnett drums , perfect match guaraldi duran . though serious jazz fans may snicker this album , i love this album . guaraldi clearly didn't care stereotypes jazz . he his own man , just loved make music . albums like this examples . if you're looking cheerful , perhaps holiday album , try this size . you might like it . i sure !	1

first let me say this .. i love tim skold contribution kmfdm/mdfmk ... he great vocalist dark hard techno-ish music .. much needed break grunters like sascha , en esch , raymond watts .... i infact hate marilyn manson passion well ! sorry tim , no doubt you cool , but joining manson nasty move me . anyways , what great follow-up adios ... this also good because you arent really expecting kmfdm ... i mean sascha really only member true kmfdm blood this project .. so basically they covered their arses those nit-picking fans who would called this " worst kmfdm album " or said " this isnt kmfdm . " ... i personally think they should continued this direction ... maybe change things up little bit , but enough sound fresh excellent ... dare i say mdfmk should kmfdm new millenia ?... i mean really , worst part this album definately cover linear note design ... where brute when you need him ?.. well now kmfdm back while they arent what they used ... if they still mdfmk , they could excused easily . japanese version very tempting , but yet cd still incomplete because it still lacks " missing time . " so i would say stick us release simply because 30 extra bucks isn't worth it 2 extra tracks ... if it 4-9 extra tracks , i could understand ... i mean unless you live , eat , sleep breath mdfmk .... where accompanying 4 track ep when you need it	1

picking up this album/dvd passing , i did'nt know what expect . what luck , this very well-done set really showcases their fine body work . far dvd concerned , i blown away . some things editing perfect , use studio footage layered over top concert footage executed without flaw . sound , this one best mixes i've heard modern rock act yet . far buying this , you should buy this album " fun machine took **** died " alone . i highly recommend this anyone who bought album qotsa past , someone not used bands eclectic rock this might further alienate them . but , around $14 dvd album you can't really go wrong	1
matt nathanson one artists sadly likely never achieve mainstream success , but it not lack ability . truly talented artists rarely get noticed because they aren't hip or flashy don't get counter space they deserve . true music lovers get greatest thrills unearthing talented musicians sharing their work their friends . nathanson one those artists who i found through amazon " if you like this artist , try this " . paying $4.00 brand new copy through amazon used , this album worth every penny more . nathanson major label full-length debut album entitled beneath these fireworks , work showcases his interesting melodies lyrics his songwriter ability write songs capture attention . listen tracks suspended , sad songs , bare , pretty world you hooked . nathanson voice fits perfectly his melodies , overall result strong acoustic based folk/pop/rock album found firm place my cd rotation . matt philosophy : " able translate feelings emotions words , pull things out air create something it way turns me such amazing feeling . it so much better than any other feeling world . " sentiments music like , i am looking forward hearing more nathanson future .	1
average musicianship , derivative , reminds me some early 90 late 80 " art bands " , only " color number version " ... some catchy melodies , unsophisticated , attractive musicians should play well video ( especially bass player , but don't let her sing without pitch correction ! ) . it gets better more you hear it . they might make go it insightful management .	1
so lovely hear more this enchanting script score . casting seems dead . piano harp beautifully complementary very articulate . i highly recommend this recording . it takes nothing away original , but advanced recording techniques make terrific listening	1

westside connection united three west coast strongest rappers 1996 their first album , " bow down " . " bow down " great because it one hardest , most unapologetically gangsta rap albums released west coast since days nwa compton most wanted . while ice cube doesn't rap stunning consciousness or social relevance he his solo albums , he well surrounded fellow vets mack 10 wc , who display great chemistry play off each other verses . consistent word describe this album . every track just hard-hittin ' last one , threatening lyrics chanted hooks that'll you yelling them . production fights against reign g-funk taken over west coast nineties , using simple , hard drums synths create vibe reminiscent earlier west coast sound . while this not most original album emerge west coast , it great album ride around or play any time , it angry entertaining ride three west coast greatest , whole feel album great . i recommend it any fan west coast hip hop or 90s rap , it really underrated album . " bow down " great start , trio drops threatening , murderous lyrics great hook over awesome , super-tough beat . " gangstas make world go round " represents their style coast , it good production funny chorus . they throw their two cents east-west coast beef " all critics new york " , which followed entertaining " you like criminals " . " gangsta , killer , dope dealer " best beat album , ultra-rough song where they straight-up represent . " cross ' em out put " you chanting hook , guaranteed , awesome song . " king hill " " 3 time felons " , wscg ignites beef cypress hill would ensue next few years . both good songs too . " westward ho " humorous funky song dealings women , i really like it . " hoo-bangin '" awesome song , i love hook beat , one might call it classic . granted , " bow down " not most artistic or original album ever created , listeners looking " death certificate " or album nature should look elsewhere . but this album some most entertaining , roughest , menacing music hip hop ever offer . supergroup mack 10 , ice cube , wc rarely passed terms talent , this album shows why . highly recommended any hip hop fan	1

first thing first -- this release properly titled " perfect drug versions " -- original mix not this album . if you're looking , you've either got get rather expensive import copies this or " lost highway " soundtrack . gotten out way , turning this issue -- this five mixes track " perfect drug " , such folks meat beat manifesto , plug , nine inch nails , spacetime continuum orb . i'm really pretty ignorant dance/techno/drum-n-bass/whatever music , so couple these names mean nothing me . these all dance/house/dub mixes , i.e. vocals lifted them relegated either sample or repititious lines . direct , this isn't my thing . some dub mixes showed up earlier singles i found tolerable , but context rest material single , this nearly 40 minutes this sort stuff i don't listen , i find it nearly unlistenable . one one , some tracks certainly interesting , meat beat manifesto remix most listenable i think best beats arrangement . not really sure what make spacetime continuum mix , they seem ditched original song except written something new sampling line chorus once or twice . orb remix full good ideas , but falls short succeeding drags seemingly endlessly . i found both plug nin remixes irritating , quite frankly . so maybe i'm not best person review this -- if you like this sort thing , you'll probably like this more than i , but i find this painful listen . you're your own whether or not you should get this	-1

-hatebreeder- ... ahh , how this stands bodom greatest . or it ? me , pretty much , but ya this becomes question because -follow reaper- released two years later . all means they both serve well their endeavors , but i just personal connection -hatebreeder- more than -follow reaper- , but don't get me wrong it less superior this . overall mood , vibe , atmosphere this record doesn't seem stardom struck -follow reaper- , it feels more secluded secret . i find alexi scream/yell more bearable here than -follow reaper- , but it works well there too . thing makes this sound very well brooded use keyboards , which even though more elaborate longer than -something wild- , they appear only best times best lengths . different way putting this roy scythe . look out how obvious it looks like this , then look his scythe -follow reaper- post albums . it larger therefore broader than what seems little personal here . " warheart " springs forth subtle thoughtful words roy before it speeds through keyboard ticks aloft itself riffage . " silent night , bodom night " kicks off catchy lead while it trills itself miniature solos until both alex alexi duet until catch-up . keyboards lay good role until everyone else lays nice beat . guitar solo drives through while everyone keeps it loose . " bed razors " drifts above perfect keyboard volume , only till guitars pick up pace thereafter . goes into pretty standard riffage during verse occasional nah nah , nah nah , nah nah shreds . this one song i find this perfect melody sounds ultimately successful such speed . 2:20 , keyboards take part again briefly until devastatingly melodious solo , packed hereafter greatest keyboard comeback solo entire album . so much beauty intricacy packed 15 seconds ; janne master his art . " wrath within " starts incredibly fast catchy , much more powerful loud than rest . guitars bass take control throughout beginning . keyboards make brief appearance , shedding some melody finger-flinching playing . alexi then rips solo herein displays what only -hatebreeder- deliver , especially keyboard running down bridge , eventually finding its own time display power matching alexi . very sweet duet alexi janne before ending minute . " downfall " already deemed fan classic . picks up janne delivering nice solo , alexi alex grabbing pieces into what become fabulous masterpiece . this song never lets up any way . henkka his own little moment until alexi shreds his grandest stage solo . this essential melodic death metal album only common sense add your bodom collection if not so already . every track , even though i only mentioned half them , all carry their worth living here . -hatebreeder- felt like it didn't need achieve anything greater than previous , it just came out way . bodom improved what they felt needed improvement , why i feel -hatebreeder- comes out my top favorite	1
live album like this one missing bruce springsteen catalogue . more restrained than 3�-hour " live 1975-85 " , , well , better than " mtv ( un)plugged " , " live new york " really shows what evening out bruce band like . there aren't too many single hits here , rather collection fan favorites obscurities , so " live new york " probably not most casual springsteen fans . but more experienced fans delighted tough , sweaty , sincere renditions " out street " , " prove it all night " , " badlands " , " two hearts " many more , two new songs excellent , particularly " 41 shots " . uncredited " born run " tucked away disc 1 , it sounds great , filled urgency conviction . e-street band magnificent , springsteen vocals good , too ( even if he sounds little out breath couple occations ) . listen his almost-acapella rendition first two verses " mansion hill " , sincerity which he delivers solemn " american skin ( 41 shots ) " . this may not essential addition bruce springsteen catalogue , casual admirer find hits missing ( which they ) , but if you're fan it hard not warm this raw , sincere performance	1

if you like mountain you'll need this . any version nantucket sleirghride makes it cd worth buying . sure it 1/2 hour or so long , but it 70 afterall , hardly decade restraint or good taste . but there some tasty leslie west licks sleighride jams . great road music , if heading down cape or up vermont ski . you'll also hear great version quot ; theme imaginary western . quot ; even roll over bethoven sounds good , i never thought i'd say any version tired old song . contrary what reviewer said alan schwartzberg , he decent drummer . one whine not someone lineup , but i would enjoy what we here instead , lets face it , felix pappalardi isn't making anymore live recordings	1
i always big fan group alabama , this my favorite record yet . if you liked songs inspiration , you love this effort . it many more uptempo songs really striking its variety , stone country ( when it comes my time go ) , cowboy campfire ballad ( love lifted me ) , dixieland jazz ( down riverside ) , several other styles . very clever original takes some classic , fast-moving , quick-tempoed songs . i loved first songs inspiration , but this one lot more " fun " flows better beginning end . album even more spiritual than first theme which resonate many- fleeting nature life earth eternal joy we when we see our loved one again " other side .

somewhat misnomer album ben oscar " met " recorded together often before they made this one 1959 . but take nothing away great music they made together here . where often slow ballad tempos dominated webster recording sessions , we get brighter tempos throughout this cd . sunday actually wailer , it nice reminded just how hard swinger ben could . touch your lips relaxed medium swinger , light feather , but not all piece fluff . ray brown takes nice solo this track . bye bye blackbird also taken medium-tempo playing delicious all around . when you lover gone perhaps taken tad too slow , though it only plays just under 4 minutes , yet it might only feel way because other selections livelier than usual . this great album ben webster ( oscar too ) certainly worth acquiring	1

" roses " probably joni mitchell least recognized work merits rapt attention . other cds fabulous , close perfection , but " roses " delivers way positions it among best mitchell recordings . " blue " amazing , no denying . how could artist top it ? mitchell imposed exile herself after tremendous response " blue " reflection , study , time get out race . result musical jump carried maturity wasn't exactly missing previous releases , but discernable growth obvious . " banquet " , opening track , such panoramic view way people dealing complex society . again , fairly simple terms , but loaded meaning . " cold blue steel ... " chronicled crushing lament addiction ; mired squalor while unable resist . " lessons survival " seamlessly flows into " let wind carry me " , suite says lover family " i love you , please accept my essence . " " roses " provides first glimpse into mitchell disenchantment music industry ... it also open letter help her friends business cope fickle nature entertainment . " judgment moon stars ( ludwigs tune ) " thoughtful ode beethoven , talking him " condemned wires hammers " ... or , laymen terms , cold comfort his piano . intense , isolated study served increase mitchell doubt absolute truth , but it also formed basis overlooked masterpiece . incidentally , her first top forty single came this cd ; " you turn me , i'm radio " campy attempt appeasing djs who control fate much needed " hit " . it works , though , context light moment among serious depth .	1

mariah carey entered music scene 1990 her debut single vision love , she certainly caught attention millions . her brilliant voice combined excellent pop songs proved perfect formula success . her self-titled album mariah carey sold millions , ending up selling over impressive 15 million copies . however , it not until dreamlover released first single her music box album , i paid any attention songbird - yet she become one few artists , i always keep eye . vision love introduced world mariah carey , it obvious miss carey would force reckon . her debut single among my favorite mariah carey songs . impressive pop ballad haunting heartfelt offering . especially , part where mariah repeats lyrics , twice , wonderful - it almost functions duet . this carey , when she her absolute best ; vocally musically . there got way lovely up-tempo song problems world how , title suggests , there got way unite human race , resolving problems world . catchy chorus certainly most memorable part song . favorite no . 1 single , i believe , sad i don't wanna cry , which emotional ballad , showcasing mariah vocal range . up-tempo someday infectious beat lyrics stating someday former boyfriend regret leaving he come back , begging taken back . version album quite good ; however , version mariah unplugged ep album preferred , my opinion . vanishing power-ballad album . overall , it display mariah various vocal talents . '' big '' vocals tend overshadow song general . however , vanishing simply impressive both vocally production-wise . haunting lyrics mariah emotional voice perfect mix . all your mind starts off slowly , soon picks up pace , culminating faster chorus . song nice offering mariah acrobatic vocals near end song impressive . alone love bland mid-tempo ballad quite forgettable - except vocals miss carey . you found me mixture '' rock '' pop . it certainly inspired tougher sound . i , actually , like chorus . sent up above tad corny , yet it still enjoyable song . moving , prisoner up-tempo song mariah carey attempt rapping - she not very good job - yet you cannot help smile while carey her thing . unlike others , i simply not understand appeal love takes times . admittedly , it nice ballad but hardly no . 1 material nor mariah carey classic . each their own liking , i guess . mariah self-titled debut quite impressive , yet it not without flaws . there some mariah best material album : vision love , i don't wanna cry , someday , vanishing all my mind . however , her debut album also contains lackluster material : sent up above , alone love prisoner mediocre material , which keeps album receiving perfect 4 . said , album still treat listen due excellent vocals fantastic pop songs . overall rating : 7.5 /1	1

most part , deciphering where band hails solely sound band music usually impossible . sigur ros ' agaetis byrjun , ' you quickly learn expect impossible . iceland sons definitely make their mother country proud because within music you see cool weather sparse yet bountiful landscapes comprise their home . every song , emotion stressed rather than finesse , they execute it so well it hard not get locked . specifically " vi�rar vel til loft�r�sa . " beginning piano chords climax send shivers down your spine make your hair stand up your arms while simultaneously causing goosebumps erupt . it captivating experience say least . i gave this album five stars because i believe it sigur ros ' best work but mainly because it utterly beautiful . it icy sunrise ; dive into vibrant deep ; synaesthetic dream ; bow electric guitar .	1

i first saw tristeza 7 years ago independant music festival wayne , michigan . fest centered around hardcore punk ( generous handful fugazi rip-offs ) it lasted three days long . some point during day 2 , band dressed all dark clothing took stage didn't even address crowd beginning their set . this faux pas made me raise eyebrow . they started playing this slow , yet driving music i just stood there front watching ... waiting vocals kick . they never came . time ( all i listening thrash ) , my predictable add reaction this would've walk away bum around vinyl distros , but i didn't . i just stood there stumped my jaw dropped wondering where hell this band came . my tastes instantly expanded my record collection changed forever . this record , ways , doesn't stand up likes ( some)mogwai , tortoise , don caballero , directions music ... but debut full length young band ( bunch san diegons * one hometown boy * , coming scene where no one seemed slowing down ) its worth listen . hopefully it turn few their later , more mature material hopefully those few get chance see them live ... its worth it .	1

kind magic similar works ( 84 ) game ( 80 ) where there number great tracks several good tracks without ever rising unique greatness some their earlier efforts 70 . it keeps rock rediscovered works turns it up notch most tracks . 1 . one vision great song released stand alone single after live aid 85 . it appears here somewhat bonus track . 2 . kind magic one queen best . written roger , brian guitar work awesome . he got award queen it . 3 . one year love nice ballad written john . single some countries . 4 . pain so close pleasure good solid track without great one . 5 . friends friends also good track . nothing new offer here , just inoffensive run mill pop songs . 6 . who wants live forever great track . good orchestral work nice brian vocal intro . freddie sings all vocals highlander version . i would love hear full version . 7 . gimme prize heavy rocker ( one queen heaviest ) . would better if it didn't exerts movie though . 8 . don't lose your head probably weakest track album . run mill stuff , sounds bit like side track . 9 . princes universe one queen all time best . hard rocking unique . opening brilliant . solid album , but all their 80 albums it seems like they writing radio , not breaking new ground like their early days . i guess it sign times . ranking wise it sits middle below queen 2 , above night opera .	1

" shake you donkey up " raucous hoe-down ; like three brits overalls , drenched pig slop . country-blues guitar riffs , loud " yeee-hawww "' , even fiddle ! what more could you ask ? other highlights first side include bubblegum sea chanty " all you pretty girls " , poignant post-nuclear holocaust ballad " this world over " , " seagulls screaming kiss her , kiss her " , sort seafoam-molasses psychedelic reggae shuffle ( loaded lots eerie synthesizer effects great lyrics)side opens insanely catchy " small town " , pure brit-pop , ten years before blur made it popular again . then , there " i bought myself liarbird " ( nice little slam-dunk greedy manager ) , " reign blows " ( awesome caterwauling mess blues , pop , rock tons reverb other cool effects ) , " you're wish you i " ( cocktail jazz + dream pop chorus ) , " i remember sun " ( wistful , steely dan like jazz rock ) , deranged , tempo-shifting closer " train running low soul coal " . there also few bonus songs end ( or , middle if you earlier version ) . " red brick dream " best crop - hazy brew pea-soup thick dreamy psychedelia . don't give up after one listen . it loud , yes . but there lots great hooks buried this thing . one xtc most rewarding best albums . best songs : seagulls screaming .., i bought myself liarbird , reign blows , you're wish you i , train running low soul coal	1

i first heard amy rigby when she interviewed npr ; i driving i-80 . her album seemed like perfect soundtrack driving alone , night . she so impressed me candor her songs . i bought this album not regretted it least . ' don't ever change , ' ' break up boots , ' ' even weak survive ' continue favorites i'll listen repeat , over over . her lyrics smart , snappy , insightful . i've always sucker lyrics . rigby voice sometimes waxes thin reedy , but her lyrics more than make up what might musically lacking	1
i huge cure fan many years excited get this gift when my baby born . what i love this cd songs recognizable cure , but very baby friendly way . my husband dismay , i this cd going nonstop while since it quiet enough play baby fell asleep but also nice listen while feeding him . that not say my son won't also hearing original versions songs , but those 3am feedings , this just thing !!	1
this not compilation , but rather vastly expanded edition albert king second lp , " born under bad sign " , 1967 . one widely ( deservedly ) considered his best , tremendous collection soulful urban blues highlighted " crosscut saw " , " laundromat blues " , " years go passing " , " pretty woman " , " down don't bother me " , course title track . " king blues guitar " brings together all 11 tracks original lp , combines them six king excellent non-lp stax singles , including tough " cold feet " , instrumentals " funk-shun " " overall junction " , slow grind " you're gonna need me " , patented king molologues " i love lucy " " you sure drive hard bargain " . it must said this disc can't quite match 2001 version " born under bad sign " cd ( digipack ) far fidelity concerned , digipack edition notably louder , which nice , but difference not great , this certainly minor quibble . unless you already own " born under bad sign " , or rhino tremendous " essential collection " , this excellent way get all " sign " extra handful early stax sides no additional cost ! highly recommended	1

i forgot these guys . i recently rediscovered these cds deep recesses my collection . i took them out , loved them , suddenly big blues traveler fan again . then , just like , it gone . i tried listen second time through couple days later . i enough . it little miniature recapitulation my original relationship he group . there time ' 91 , i think , or thereabouts , when grateful dead this huge insurgence " jam scene " new concept . people all around me , all sudden , very into blues traveler . they played my college campus , then i saw them live couple times red rocks colorado . good shows . rolling stone ran cover story new bands coming up modeling themselves dead , far focusing unique , improvisational live performances allowing fans bootleg trade shows . if i remember right , blues traveler featured band new generation , phish , widespread panic , spin doctors getting their own blurbs . good ol ' ' 91 . popper singing grated me little , deep quavering vibrato changes notes so many times same syllable it just becomes waterlogged garbles . but he really amazing harmonica . he sings hard then he blows hard . personally , i liked old fat popper , not post-gastric bypass popper . that my own selfish thing . i like idea lovable loser guy getting stage coming alive manic intensity . but gastric bypass good operation , i'm happy him he lost weigh t.t hey're pretty fun little bit . but , then , like any small ensemble , their music started all sound same . popper harmonica still great , great when he collaborates other musicians , but songs got boring . but anyway . thumbs up , high energy live performance . this good music keep around deep your collection , occasionally bust out . key me little doses .	1
well i must say jayo felony really caught my attention first hit song his titled ( take ride ) what hit song . i remember when they used play radio all time . i agree it like other guy said it almost just good cronic . thinking only song i going like take ride i wrong i ended up liking whole cd if you should buy this cd well ... what you think i say anymore it just way it sounded ( take ride ) well it like oldschool sounding but then new rap same time it just grabed my attention all other songs became hit me even if not hits . buy this album hey i know it came out 1995 but who cares it still good cd !!	1
... you still need 1991 sony double-cd ben hur soundtrack ( now out print ) if you want two original , 1950 vinyl lp cd . i bought 1991 sony two-cd set years ago loved it ever since . i recently bought 1996 turner set what disappoints me some music soundtrack lp seems missing ; e.g. , prologue frankenland state symphony orchestra . there other differences well	1
i can't even remember where i got this cd , or when exactly ( early twenties kinda blur ) , probally when i hungry anything fnm . there plenty energy here , m.p. let it all out bag . anybody looking live fnm ( pre-angel dust)would'nt disappointed . some really sweet tracks . you would think brits would critical any sabbath cover , but m.p. gets them sing . live version " we care lot " (discovery channels dirty jobs theme song ) new kid spoof(does anybody remember them ? ) fnm always satisfied fans stage antics ( like snl)and it comes through this live release . but wait there more , " cowboy song " studio track guitar solo that'll blow your mind	1
excellent definitely " old school " . i played it our family reunion everybody stopped what they doing got into it ! jai4	1
years ago i lp " hawk talks " . i more into rock roll back then , but i remembered hawkin amazing rich tone years after i ditched my turntable records cd player . naturally , i started listening more jazz , i wanted some hawk my collection . if there better record out there , i yet hear it . warmth , richness elegance hawkin playing hardly seem like something this world . supporting cast stellar . reviewer put it well , there not wrong note this album . buy it , turn lights down , enjoy work master top his game	1

" o'connor " johnny appleseed suite " his 1994 orchestration children music he originally composed garrison keillor disc nominated grammy best children recording . friends john jarvis ( piano ) bryan sutton ( guitar ) join o'connor orchestra resplendent string journey . long exquisite lines provide us nostalgic views lost passing time . album closes mark splendid rendition " amazing grace " orchestra . his fluid , lyrical , emotional style truly heartwarming . i first became familiar marin alsop , emerging superstar conductor when she podium eugene symphony orchestra . her insight , instinct , intuition interpretation music resulted o'connor calling her " best friend american composer . " mark collaboration nadja spanned six years , he considers her " one greatest violinists not only our time but all time . " diverse musician who made considerable name himself many walks life , o'connor down-to-earth style which impeccable . salerno-sonnenberg second violin played more regimented classical approach . however , both excellent command techniques impressively play difficult passages responses complement each other . there occasional flurries notes rapid-fire commentary , but two indefatigable maestros fully understand each other . ( joe ross , roseburg , or . )	1
i never get tired this album . band tight they sound like they loving every second it . santana plays bottom his toes -- every note earned . after listening this , if you aren't grinning like idiot , you must not like music	1

production-wise this album get somewhat boring few tracks around halfway through , but cuts like " keep ya head up " " i get around " more than make up weaker points . " last wordz " features ice cube ice probably my favorite track . it shows 3 best ever it west coast trading mics easily over nice beat . you'll notice lot scratching here provide hooks production sounds more like it new york , but just shows pac versatility . 4.5 star album because weak tracks , but i'll round up give it 5 . definitely buy this well all pac other cds before death row " all eyez me "	1
if so , it probably starts here . what you when you've finished recording half your second album ( despite you your partner trying pull it opposite directions while dealing screwy studio equipment ) , then run out money your label refuse advance you any more ? klaus dinger michael rother chalked one up spite finished neu ! 2 anyway , presumably through sheer force . tracks doubled , stretched , compressed , sped up , slowed down , remixed voila - enough new material finish record . it probably wasn't intended avant-garde or new experient strange recording techniques , let alone spawn whole genre niche its own , but it amazing how things take life their own . if neu ! self-titled exploration simplicity repetitive grooves , this album sound idea gnawed gerbils , composted , half-torn apart , spit out mess tangled tapes reassembled frazzled sound engineer hurry his day off . i realize makes it sound like hopeless mess , but it not , really . off-the-wall wackiness what makes finished work so fresh intriguing . " super " closes album out nicely trademark smooth-chillin neu ! groove , but before we get there we hear part it once half speed once zippy hyper pace leaves your head spinning . " neuschnee " put through similar treatment get " neuschnee 78 , " i can't even tell what source " cassetto " , since track consists tape chewed up player . fun stuff . elsewhere some moments sheer motorik satori , creating more same blissful clockwork-cruising grooves first record . dreamy " f�r immer " alone probably worth price , traveling beautiful highway cruise trippy outer-space groove back again without missing beat . " neuschnee " " lila engel " ( even though it got some questionable vocals side ) similar patches ear-pleasing krautrock , which usually enough keep flow whole thing listenable amid freaky parts . neu ! 2 may my least favorite three most rarely listened ( it probably anyone who usually prefers sound finished product sound half-baked one put through broken paper shredder ) , but it got its own musical value all same . course " f�r immer " sheer aural perfection any way you look it . go neu ! ' 75 most listenable taste , then come here make your day little more surreal	1
alice cooper gem !! title track = hard rock excellent guitar work , heart pounding bass , heavy drums , alice his usual cut right through your body vocals .

" blue turk " = band jazzy side coming out excellent form . " my stars " = just close your eyes take ride through starry universe alice-you'll love where he takes you here . " public animal #9 " = hard rocker rebellious side-take teachers principals ! " alma mater " = alice gets mellow here-just substitute your schools name it everyones tune . " grand finale " = top notch synthesizer work rest band showcasing other areas there musical talent . all all , outstanding album one could listen over over again never get tired it !!	1

i own every monk album commercially released many others not , five spot recordings my favorites them all . here my opinion * perfect * monk quartet . each musician shining star melded into super creative force . they know this music . griffin soars sax , his bop chops impeccable . he knows monk changes inside out wrings breathtaking surprises out them . his playing more monk-ish than rouse , coltrane , etc . abdul-malik , probably most underrated if not unknown jazz bassist , similarly makes his instrument sing here . he backs group drive verve his true-to-monk solos among finest you ever hear monk group . roy haynes drums perfect drummer monk -- blakey ( except two genius modern music ) dunlop overpowered music , i love blakey -- because always musical roy haynes got inside subtleties textures escape others . his cymbal work unparalled ; his snare/bass drum interactions riveting , his solos creative , unexpected thoroughly satisfying . thelonious playing this disk awesome . his chords , his comping , his solos , his timing ... everything so right ! this recorded time when tunes fresh , lots left explore . none repetitive pianistic cliches monk seemed favor later his career . i could run down tunes track track extolling everything even measure measure , but suffice say together these men all their peak creativity there village late 50 laid down musical history these wonderous tracks . i listened quot ; actionquot ; quot ; misteriosoquot ; ( other equally great five spot recording ) hundreds times never tire it -- music superb . let this one into your head ! it demands repeated listenings . after while pay attention one musician time just follow him because there * artists * work here . sum , buy it you won't disappointed	1
ayla great role model young old . she only 18 she already so mature . this album obviously proves all . entire album awesome . i love enjoy every day each song cd exception two songs , but hey , you can't always get perfect cd everyone adore . i gave this cd five stars because i totally think it deserves it . well , actually lie because i believe it deserves six stars but unfortunatly that not one ratings . believe me when i say when you buy this album you won't regret it . you not wasting your money buying it . whole cd brings out her personality . ayla person who loves her fans actually cares them isn't all fake towards them . if you don't support her or aren't fan her this cd make you want become one . if you don't this album , you're missing out !..... big time ! :	1

cecilia bartoli her fans , no doubt , other reviews this site demonstrate , people who love her warmth tone her impassioned interpretations . these vocal qualities may suit performance conventions nineteenth-century repertoire ; however this anthology eighteenth century sacred arias result unhappy imbalance . problem , my opinion , one clashing calls attention , whose affect distract listener attention music itself . true , god counter-reformation worshipped ecstatically . true , also , i am anti-romantic listener , who grew up those early music performances which valued detached purity tone . this vaunted ideal means interpretation rediscovered seventeenth eighteenth-century repertoire ( it protested too much its rightness , alienated people- but i like it ) . however return subject hand- i find bartoli readings these crypto-erotic arias overblown self-indulgent . i guess this sort coloratura always offered chance bit ego let loose , even church- however when performance goes so far insist attention itself rather than deflecting attention music , i stop enjoying music . this recording not find balance big romantic personality eighteenth-century performance conventions , which , after 30 or 40 years self-critique , some authority . i disliked it very much . i am great admirer mark minkowski opera interpretations , which i think find perfect balance these opposing impulses warm cool- binary we trace throughout aesthetics through ages . here there overbalance favour warm ( hot , fact ) , which performers might argue just sort vivification baroque performance needs . not me . i gave it friend ( she still friend )	-1

much i love 1989-1997 albums closed out john lee amazing career ( healer , mr. lucky , boom boom , chill out , don't look back ) , 1970 hooker ' heat true crown jewel legacy . just johnny winter pure sympatico hand support guided muddy waters through his late-career blue sky albums , canned heat provides most solid driven backing i've heard jlh album . john lee full-blown crawling king snake mode here ... this album he not kindly " elder statesman , " he dangerous man , if you approach his flame , you get burned . late heat vocalist bob " bear " hite limits himself co-producer duties here , so musical dynamics come al " blind owl " wilson ( his final recording ) , guitarist henry " sunflower " vestine ( get ready thoroughly insane 11 minute " boogie chillen no . 2 " ) , antonio de la barreda bass fito de la parra drums . first 9 tracks john lee solo . wilson joins tracks 10 11 , full band backs remaining 6 tracks . make no mistake it ... you get cold chills when hooker bellows " alan ! alan ! blow your horn , baby !

this song i keep singing myself every time i buy falkner record ( exceptions holiday single , sub pop set ) , or any other offering any kind any member involved best band 90 ( jellyfish ) . i didn't discover them post break-up , oh no .... i fanclub wore advance copy bellybutton ( vinyl , yo !! ) out my college radio shift ! i also redd kross fanclub consider them higher than jellies ... yeah , i said it . so , you bet i raging " you-know-what " my pants this record !?!? import price long wait japan later , i am once again ... let down . it painfully obvious while where magic dust came within jellyfish , this testament andy sturmer greatness . i know , they weren't trying make jellyfish album , but songwriting here doesn't hold slightest flicker say , even beatnick beatch tune . if new cars hired faulkner ( who rhymes bad ace frehley spots ) , instead rundgren , they went songwriting ' door door ' , this would very close . this goes beyond " retro sound " straight into justin timberlake trying retro sound . better yet , if you actually enjoyed any duran duran last two records , then this knock your socks off .... fact , send me $30 you this copy . production quality my sincere love past these three guys , keeps me comitting this review one star	1
dandy warhols take lot guff posed , insincere , party-addled . irony thick enough use construction material : it fact this appearance pose pose . ultimately , joke not listener , though , post-velvets/post-13th floor elevators confections they ( regularly ) drop such casual nonchalance betray workmanship sensitivity songwriting tips its hand . this not band party-hardy dilettantes , but informed eclectic group talented musicians who probably stupefyingly impressive record collections . they ( wisely ) steer clear change-the-world soapboxing churn out anthem after anthem -- " 13 tales " their magnum opus ( so far ) . there weaker tracks , where pose overplayed , like " horse pills " or " solid . " but whole , " 13 tales " carefully balances bombast craft such seductive way lyrical foibles quickly forgiven cohesive , anthemic whole -- thick winking guitar snaky organ riffs -- becomes satisfying morning sex .	1

title this recording seems very misleading . although one find most cannonball most popular work ( songs ) here , title should read something like quot ; live cannonballquot ; , since entire recording live performances his band included joe zawinul his brother nat adderly . truthfully , cannonball very little original significance capitol records . said however , i still enjoy this recording very much . two featured bands really cook , cannonball his soulful , playing best , digital sound production michael cuscuna typical par excellence . so despite misleading title , i consider this strong recording good introduction adderley music	1

i found tracks flow well into each other consistent tone . many tracks seem other cds so person may want check their cd collection see if there too many duplicates . it feels like journey lot places moods when you listen them . there lot textures sounds rhythms makes repeated listening enjoyable . bass tones not feel harsh compositions not feel " dark " or " heavy " . many them feel happy or mellow all them feel danceable . because tracks flow seamlessly into each other , i found i could not repeat one track without getting parts surrounding tracks or if i downloaded mp3 natural pauses tracks would more noticable ( i heard some players solved this though ) slightly interupt muscial flow . i found lot trance cds this same characteristic . it means cd best played whole rather than just playing few favorite tracks	1

ok metal fans , music fans alike , this moonspell latest spell , called " antidote " . it really good album , i'm really impressed . first off , i'd like say i'd heard this album way before i actually bought it , didn't think it great , but then i heard " everything invaded " , i hooked . there so many great songs here it even hard me believe i skipped this one year ago when i could've it sooner . antidote fantastic album filled dark , brooding , sometimes beautiful music . it begins classicaly heavy " above men " , which course fan favorite . this song heavy hell , fernando nothing but grunts screams this one .... it excellent . next exotic " lowering skies " which features fernando clean vocals really cool drum beat . chorus raging metal fest . next melodic " everything invaded " , amazing chorus ( when i say amazing , i mean amazing , it just fits so perfectly song ) . up next mosher " southern deathstyle " , which really some great sections where you mosh . believe me , i know haha . next title track , which really some great guitar parts it , awesome lyrics . i love this song , however , something better awaits . " capricorn her feet " amazing 6 minute galactic metal song . now when i say galactic don't expect some star wars metal song , but i mean this song some really trippy moments . now i don't drugs , but i'm sure those great time listening this one . chorus great , fernando vocals shine this one . however , parts i am most talking ending minutes , also include solo ( which one my favorite solos i ever heard , i play it ! ) some great synth work . next up odd but still interesting " lunar still " , which this .... strangely enough , sinister moon feel . it sounds like something you would hear game doom 3 ( come think it , i should try playing this song ! ) . it unique 3 minute intro odd intergalactic synth sounds , then turns into crushing intergalactic sinister doom metal song . " walk darkside " trip back normality this one , really just hard rock doom metal song .... if makes any sense . it really fun listen too . end this cd consists " crystal gazing " " we eternally sleep it " , strangely , i just consider these two same song , i don't know why , but i . anyway , " crystal gazing we eternally sleep it " really good ending this cd , sets mood new moonspell which i hear may appearing sometime 2005/2006 ? anyway , next time your cd store , you see moonspell , pick this one up ... it great musical trip	1
all contemporary country singers emerge nineties , trisha ( remains ) my favorite although not much . this album typical , containing many great songs some finest songwriters around ( annie roboff , jamie o'hara , al anderson , don schlitz , mark sanders , dianne warren , carole king , allison moorer , victoria shaw souther among them ) , yet requiring several plays really appreciated . many songs ballads but there some faster songs provide variation . trisha always careful select songs mean something her . i sense lyrics her personal life difficult time she recorded these songs . album opens there goes my baby , reflective ballad former lover . maybe second track , never let you go again , sequel it getting second chance . net comes song cheating , ain't way i heard it . powerful thing ( up-tempo song love ) country top ten hit . after this comes superb ballsd , love wouldn't lie me , but it . if prove love lies next song , wouldn't any woman , end relationship . contrast , i'll still love you more finds trisha deeply love . heart like sad song woman ( not trisha ) who cannot find lasting love whatever she tries . i don't want one relationship difficulties . bring me all your loving ( allison moorer song ) missing somebody wanting his love , not flowers . allison own version eventually appeared one her albums ( hardest part ) two years after this album released . album closes title track , which excellent duet garth brooks . this not strong overall some trisha early albums but it album very high quality no trisha fan should without	1

angels dirty faces slightly softer edge than matm spectacular previous release , more seduction , but most important aspect new album it shows excellent songwriting exhibited previous disc no fluke . one great song after tumbles out angels , nothing that less than inspired anywhere sight . matm proven they wonderful job covers , but manda original material what shines most brightly here . beyond-catchy songs like say anything , lipstick , simple things boys boys remain one head long after last note played . incredibly fun , catchy songs what allow this record great , but effect listener wouldn't same without strong band back them up . manda plays very capable bass , joe damage offers sharp , very well-crafted guitar work , newly added elias dubok plays important role keyboards , powerhouse drummer mark slak helps bring everything together prevents sound ever getting too soft . there some obvious 80 influences here , but sound not retro - manda co . definining their own little homeplace today musical world . manda marbles want take us all sonic joyride . i can't imagine why anyone who enjoys rock roll would want resist .	1
minus blondie , debbie harry released four solo albums . even best them ( " def dumb blonde " ) spotty , frankly , " koo koo " horrendously over-rated release . album represented here its two main singles , " backfired " " jam moving , " frankly , they most dated sounding songs album . other hand , when songs producer sympathetic , best these singles rates best blondie .

i writing review legendary masterpiece 2-cd set album entitled " all things must pass " quiet one , legendary ex-beatle , george harrison . this 2-cd set album originally released vinyl cassette 1970 infamous capitol records label . i purchased very first release this album cd matrix or id number cdp 7 46689 2 . i also purchased this new 2-cd set release included attached dvd matrix or id number cdp 7243 5 30474 2 9 . if i hear any new information concerning this legendary album , i edit this review so you consumer get best most accurate review possible . my opinion , " all things must pass " should rank one all-time great albums . this album so underrated ! this album life general ! when beatles broke up 1970 , george such pain breakup he wrote songs it recorded them into album . i am aware george came into his own right developed into great songwritter during beatles era but i must confess i never knew george it him write such powerful lyrics ! george must learned alot john lennon because he write powerful lyrics just good john if not better . since there so many song tracks review this album , i am going list briefly review my favorite song tracks their exact order follows : disc one ( 1 . ) " i'd you anytime , " ( beautiful acoustic song ! i love this song . ) ( 2 . ) " my sweet lord , " ( beautiful acoustic song ! sounds like gospel song ! ) ( 3 . ) " wah-wah , " ( great song ! ) ( 4 . ) " isn't it pity , " ( this extremely powerful song ! this song evidently message other three ex-beatles ! lyrics so much meaning we truly realize what we take granted . listen these lyrics closely , its rude awakening ! i never would believed george could write such powerful lyrics ! great song ! ) ( 5 . ) " what life " ( great song ! ) ( 8 . ) " let it down . " ( beautiful song ! ) disc two ( 1 . ) " beware darkness , " ( warning george ! beautiful song ! )(5 . ) " all things must pass , " ( beautiful song powerful lyrics ! i love george lyrics this song ! this song also so much meaning ! this song makes you think twice taking life granted ! rude awakening ! ) ( 11 . ) " plug me , " ( george saves blistering rockers last ! this song ( 12 . ) " i remember jeep , " ( 13 . ) " thanks pepperoni " ( 14 . ) " out blue " kick a*s ! musicians george his band all-star line-up ! too many list but includes such legends badfinger , delany bonnie band , members procol harum , eric clapton , ringo starr phil collins . what great way end this legendary album ! ) this album true encyclopedia gospel rock ' roll ! great album indeed ! there many other song tracks i could easily listed reviewed but you see , this album great collection worth purchasing he or she should own part his or her collection . this album true treasure cherished many years come . closing , george harrison never really got recognition or his due when he beatle or solo artist i think its time george finally received due he truly deserves . its just too bad we lost george so soon ( november 30 , 2001 age 58 ) despite youngest beatle . i believe george still so much give us . george john gone , there only two ex-beatles left ! i'm sure we all now realize beatles reunion never happen again ! r.i.p. george harrison 1943-2001 . thanks reading my long review i hope you enjoyed reading it much i enjoyed writing it all you . i also hope you read all my other reviews near future when time permits . beatles forever ! george harrison forever ! long live rock ' roll ! rock out always take care . j.l.	1

james horner expert capturing essence what emotional movie , breathing musical life into it . i found deep impact , movie , almost unbearably moving sad , yet infused throughout nobility human touch differed movies action-bent , like armageddon . i knocked out my seat deep impact , it caught me surprise . after rushing out buy horner soundtrack , it became clear me perhaps main reason i so moved because this haunting poetic score . there mesmerizing quality evolution one , all-mighty theme , finale still leaves me weakened state sadness euphoria . if you liked titanic score , you love this one	1
i admit i don't many nice things say mnemic . sum up , they're metalcore/nu-metal band hat also combine fear factory vibe , uh , ' tributes ' meshuggah . truth they're not really good fear factory their peak suggesting they're same league meshuggah like saying usa mexico good football soccer france brazil . their riffs nothing write home either , some which sound like blatent meshuggah ripp offs without odd time signitures poly cross rhythms . fact , i don't really understand meshuggah comparisons all . overall vibe nothing like meshuggah clearly people missing just how complex some their rhythms compared rather simple generic ones found scattered throughout this album . vocals decent . they get little nu-metal-esque times they're far original , but something tells me mnemic weren't out reinvent wheel anyway so i'll leave it . bitching aside , they some plus points . first off , they're very tight solid . not especially technical , so one could argue its not hard tighten up what they're doing comepared other , superior metal bands , but they're tight what they which good start . overall sound album isn't all poor played loud volumes when drunk fellow metalheads its enjoyable album . its just its not exceptional all - contrary its rather mediocre these ears . maybe i'm just too picky snobbish metal these days but i just don't feel need praise bands making unoriginal bland metal	1
slayer " show no mercy " , my opinion , their best album . most say " reign blood " their best . i think hellacious album , but doesn't measure this . i think its metal second greatest album all time . every song good , no slowing down this album . great , fast , thrashy riffs , awesome lyrics , scary vocals underrated tom araya , make this metal milestone . ratings : 1 . evil no boundaries-15/10(great opener)2 . anitchrist-12/10(metal classic)3 . die sword-13/10(kinda reminds me halo 2)4 . fight till death-12/105 . metal storm/face slayer-20/10(best song cd)6 . black magic-10/107 . tormetor-8/10(weakest album but still great)8 . final command-18/10(awesome lyrics)9 . crionics-9/1010 . show no mercy-13/10(nice way end awesome cd)overall-140/100 awesome album	1
tom jones ' sumptuous , expressive voice simply astonishing this collection includes many my favorites ... fact only jones favorite mine missing this compilation " these hands " ... all others here : " thunderball " , " ( it looks like ) i'll never fall love again " , " delilah " , " green , green grass home " , many more delight ears give one sense nostalgia days when music like this popular . tom jones burst music scene 1965 " it not unusual " written man who " discovered " him , gordon mills , then , road paved gold jones mills , 1971 , paul anka " she lady " gave him his biggest u.s. hit . this terrific compilation ( only one song i don't care , " daughter darkness " ) , sure please welsh wonder fans . sound good , total playing time 37'26 , not including many times i hit " repeat " button hear his thrilling rendition " ( it looks like ) i'll never fall love again " .	1
there'a warning cover : this compilation " classic " bad co . lineup ( burrell/kirke/ralphs/rodgers ) , dubbed " original " band . make point , cover resembles one their very first lp . so , forget find tracks brian howe era ( 1986 beyond ) , this only goes 1974 1982 , plus 4 new tracks recorded 1998 ( what hook ! ) . anyway , compilation far superior than 10 6 edited long time ago , curiously time band coming back mid-80 different lineup . here you plenty classic tunes popular album tracks ; 3/4 their self-titled debut album included ; 3 songs burnin ' sky lp say " present " here ( not even one song album appeared previous compilation ); there alternate version " right your woman " ; what most interesting , respectable bunch b-sides forgotten tracks rescued vaults see light -and cd player- again . these tracks , one shines above them all " superstar woman " . i don't understand why it hadn't included their debut album , such strong song great melodies , straight drumming intense piano ... 4 new tracks , lead-off single " hey , hey " , its hummable chorus positive vibe , should #1 hit charts ( it some countries ) . its energic guitar intro cowboy feeling , " hammer love " best 4 . musicians still deliver goods : boz burrell enhancing bass lines heavy sound mix , exact beats simon kirke , never out place or overloading tunes , fine riffs licks mick ralphs , paul rodgers ' voice , although darkened bit , passionate unmatchable . i give this double cd 5 stars rating because it lot virtues compilations this kind should imitate : it combines greatest hits classic non-single tracks , satisfying casual fans ; includes non-lp songs , also keeping happy hardcore fans ; 4 new tracks cherry cake . beside music ( which sounds great thanks digital mastering ) , cardboard contains jewel box cool , accompanying booklet plenty rare band photos memorabilia , family tree , lyrics all songs . maybe some complain there aren't more songs some unreleased tracks desolation angels rough diamonds albums recording sessions , but overall i think feel this double cd complete affair . next thing we wanna hear our hands double cd compilation " other " bad company anthology ( 1986-1995 ) . their record company word , hear fans !	1

i bought original 2lp set when it came out 1971 or 1972 waiting get cd . it great hearing body soul afro blue this cd set . coltrane incredible . no matter what he playing , it always works . i wish i could say same pharoah sanders . he not my taste this stage his career . i liked him later his solo albums , but coltrane he not same level musically rest quartet , my opinion . often , coltrane creates mood his solo , only sanders completely destroy it his solo , my opinion . i didn't think sanders listening what rest quartet playing . spite sanders , cd still must long classic coltrane quartet playing	1
anticipated full album german group modeselektor reveals their humorous side beginning tracks but moves into deeper electronic/trance/idm feel . popper bboy , i got album looking alternative break beat . some tracks very industrial feel similar autechre , while others more ambient like something off boards canada album . definitely worth purchase if you're into autechre , boards canada , kraftwerk , aphex twin , mr. oizo , etc . this album ease you into funky-ish groove hold you there ---	1
i wish there more than just this ep . four great songs easily best three kiss-styled eps melvins put out . dale seems only one who took his homework seriously . buzzo gave us one good track , one funny track , couple eh-so-so tracks ; joe wanked ; dale dug down deep pulled out something dark , melancholic tasty . somewhat reminiscent acid king , though little less " stoner "	1

i am not biggest celine dion fan , i'll actually go record say i haven't liked anything after let talk love . however , my mom used own this cd i heard it so much i ended up buying my own copy . bombastic steinman production " it all coming back me now " ( which heard full version ) , beautiful sentimental " because you loved me " poignant " fly " fantastic " call man " " all myself " , where celine made one most dreadfully sappy 70 songs her own made it good , soulful ( think mariah fans attack celine " too vanilla " , whatever ) " declaration love " sexy " seduces me " ... celine dion able something big voice divas usually incapable making ... album consistant . even though all together , i think there more mariah whitney songs out there i like , neither them ever delivered album killer consistant this ( i say these two because those perhaps biggest rivals celine age fanbase ) . i think whole world became celine fan after this album . i also like " let talk love " too but album pales next this record . it deserved it grammy imo	1
john rutter made substantial changes previously most-performed version faure requiem when he recorded this . he went back version 1893 so , rather than using more famous , more heavily orchestrated later version . one difference violins sanctus transposed up octave this cd compared way which they played later requiem . i find this recording beautiful timeless , definitely not over-orchestrated . me , faure great contribution requiem he showed firm refusal judge other people well compassion face death . this went against beliefs catholic church time , which emphasized hellfire brimstone , faure heavily criticized putting little mention he could get away regarding day judgement . this compassion shows his work makes it comforting rather than frightening . it called " lullaby death . " i also enjoy other vocal pieces , particularly ave maria cantique de jean racine , which probably familiar many people who not really aware faure career . these songs pure , clear sound which not ruined through excessive orchestration . my opinion , john rutter fantastic job this material , it one my favorite cds	1
bo-didley names says it all ? best collection his music . i recommend anyone who fan people who tried bo style like stones , eric burden etc ., give listen this . excellent investment your music collection	1
al . sure delivered us his final album which some moments but not appeal lot critics back ' 92 when changing guard going away new jack swing movement into g-funk movement . album starts off promising hits like " right now " , " ui " , " natalie " . then i see where album hits snag uptempo songs kind outdated its time . now devante jodeci produce some uptempo tracks al b cousin kyle west howie tee but it just not appealing . then album gets back track my favorite song album " die you " , this song very underrated because if you really listen message , it talks loving your mate unconditionally you would literally die them , me true love . then next track " i'll never hurt you again " great slow jam really talks true love . last track ok but nothing get excited . me this poor-man version " diary mad band " jodeci dynamic slow jams but below average up-tempo songs . this cd still worth take chance you buy very cheap your local record store	1

most motion picture scores , unfortunately , bland when removed visual stimuli movie images . not so this magnificent howard shore penned masterpiece . like movie which it written , score spellbinding provocative . each individual piece complete unto itself , never failing deliver its unique impact . score its entirety takes listener fantastic passionate journey emotionally aurally . what sets this artistic work apart countless others unique styling offered howard shore stellar guitar playing grammy winning classical guitarist sharon isbin . her subtleties " billy theme " evoke anguish deep emotional conflict leonardo dicaprio portrays onscreen . such powerful performance rare any recording , unheard soundtrack or score . g.e smith slightly processed electric guitar adds yet dimension . i generally not buy " movie " music , but this cd i own . it fabulous recording worthy critical listening	1
honestly , there only two songs i really love album , but those two themselves earn whole thing 5/5 . revolution gets 5/5 . why ? it just plain rock . not any kind metal , punk , alternative , nothing . it rock ' roll , straight up . it well . rescue me gets 5/5 well . it chords flirt every so slightly metal or hard rock , but it retains melody truly great music so it hits hard sounds good doing it	1
this cd sucks . it doesn't contain good music ; it only contains crap . only exceptional tracks quot ; main titlequot ; quot ; farewell , quot ; both which danny elfman . these two tracks what make this movie great . including stupid rock music into movies promote them just stupid . i would rather buy original score this movie than this garbage	1
this cd . maybe you should drive stunt my favorite bnl recordings . they more mature than gordon , but still pleasingly playfull . bnl refreshing experience compared so much loud , heavy , hateful rap-metal-punk bands these days . these canadians continue prove their musical lyrical talents . this good buy . 4 stars	1

i born after all songs this album released ( 1987 ) , but i definitly appreciate each everyone them . i first introduced human league via vh1 i love eighties . there i downloaded " don't you want me " " lebanon . " simply put this become one my favorite records . i'm only 18 , but this solidified my mind my love new wave music . all tracks different crisp sounding original dare ! record . each different mood all extremely enjoyable . second half cd comprised remixes love dancing album . this second half just enjoyable first different reasons . course since songs only remixes they can't new . wrong . yes , they comprise central elements original recordings , but they each journies into soundscape original each song . dance techno enthusiast they would very easy fun dance rivialing many today " top " remixes . buy this if you even heard liked just one human league song ; buy it even if you haven't .	1

i start saying i'm big early heep fan . up until high mighty i thought they could no wrong . they often said poor man deep purple . maybe . but heep much more diversified than purple . they both same lineup : guitar , bass , keyboard , drummer , singer . however , heep 2 lead singers , background harmony vocals , hensley doubled keyboards guitar . now , this live album . my opinion , uriah heep never really transferred studio live very well . often times , guitar mixed down point sometimes difficult hear . background harmonies sometimes out tune , harmonies one characteristics uh set them apart alot other bands . said , this still best live album i've heard heep put out . all classics here , even though most them don't sound much all like studio versions . that not necessarily bad . they intensity ' feel ' them gives impression they hoot performing them . i've seen this particular lineup concert 2 times they good . but , personally , i prefer live version song very similar studio version but heep you don't get . specifically , guitar solo studio version look yourself 40 seconds wah-wah pedalling send chills down your spine . live version kind watered down . also , intro lay sounds like they leading easy living . it fools me every time . overall , nice live album . 5 stars song selection 4 their performances .	1
i really enjoy norah jones . this cd so bad i still haven't listened whole cd . who wants listen same 5 songs preformed 5 different ways ? most remixes hip hop , not really norah jones ' style . best part this cd cover artwork . if i could i would give this cd 0 star	-1

461 ocean boulevard first studio album eric clapton recorded after he kicked his heroin habit . unlike tortured passion layla , album finds mr. clapton still not completely satisfied , but more positive outlook . album opens blistering take traditional song " motherless children " follow-up compassionate " give me strength " . his remake johnny otis classic " willie hand-jive " loose fun . " get ready " , he duets his backup singer yvonne elliman ( pre saturday night fever ) simmering , bluesy number call response vocals backed driving guitar riff . he practically introduced bob marley white rock audience his percolating take marley " i shot sheriff " . combining song reggae roots rock , mr. clapton made memorable song became his first only number one hit . ms. elliman backup vocals provide backbone sweet " let it grow " . album closes burning " mainline florida " which mr. clapton lets it all hang out . 461 ocean boulevard his first number album re-established eric clapton musical force .	1

don't get me wrong , peter gabriel truly gifted artist . i own each every one his albums . but i think it remains said , until now , his music could really use more cowbell ..	1
like countless others , i started listening woody guthrie recordings fan bob dylan . i'm happy say listening woody enhanced my appreciation him singer songwriter , also made me appreciate dylan more once i aware what elements guthrie influence he incorporated into his art which he expanded upon . i highly recommend purchasing this entire collection ( rather than just one or two discs , since they're available individually ) essential dust bowl ballads strong foundation woody guthrie collection ( not mention his amazing autobiography , bound glory ) . what you say 4-disc retrospective such prolific , improvisational songwriter ? my reviews i generally talk some specific songs , but there so many here i'll try not get boring long-winded too many details . discs each loosely-based different theme named ( 1 ) " this land your land , " ( 2 ) " muleskinner blues " ( 3 ) " hard travelin '" ( 4 ) " buffalo skinners . " although track sequencing isn't too strict , songs each generally fall categories patriotic , interpretive ballads ( mostly classic folk covers ) , topical/working class ballads , cowboy ballads . you'll find out , though , these labels aren't too exclusive , woody writes sings pretty much anything you could imagine , he sure good it . legend goes , woody wrote anything he could get his hands , composed songs fly ( freestyle rap anyone ? ) , so this historical document also quite amazing considering asch told guthrie he could drop recorded whenever he wanted . these off-the-cuff recordings not only represent broadness woody musical vision , but also pretty accurate representation spontaneous singing he while wandering country , living ( hearing first-hand ) lives characters his songs . what great songs they . tracks range classics you may or may not known woody wrote sang ; " this land your land , " " grand coulee dam , " " pretty boy floyd , " " so long , it good know you , " " hard travelin ' , " " car song , " name few . what makes wealth music here extraordinary hearing woody come up social anthems , dark ballads , heartbreaking stories , hilarious blues time time again . although folk music simple ( fans more complex chord changes instrumentation may take few listens appreciate what it woody music makes it so classic ) , magic storytelling lyrics . some his talking blues like " talking hard work " " mean talking blues , " example , laugh-out-loud funny , especially repeated listens . some people griped sound quality , but i personally wouldn't it any other way . scratchy , old-timey production fits perfectly , analog sound probably accounts much woody timbre . i'll bet it wouldn't sound half good if recorded digital . woody signature flat-picked acoustic occasional harmonica makes most accompaniment , although cisco houston few others make appearances singing playing acoustic instruments , so there not really any complex overdubbing danger covered up quality . woody voice , it like warm blanket or familiar sound grandfather telling story . even though it simple , there warmth magic , subtle wit there all time only woody could pull off so genuinely . liner notes only add quality this treasure , providing info each song , well great , informative biographical info . taken together , this really academic historical document both paper cd , but it also real pleasure listen . you might guessed , i highly recommend this collection , but if you don't any guthrie recordings yet , i'd probably recommend shorter dust bowl ballads first , since it not daunting size or price . once you're hooked , though , this next place go . i hope you take time discover why woody such legend , treasure this set years come	1

xtc fourth album easily their finest xtc : influental touring rock quartet . they hinted greatness this album 1979 masterful drums wires . let examine shall we ? lp opens their best-ever opener , " respectable street " - dig suburban prentiousness . song may fact their most rockest ( even word ? ) song ever . followed chiming dual guitar attack " generals majors " which succeeds making cold war paranoia ultra hummable ( or whistle-able if you ) . possibly colin moulding finest single , it also features now very popular disco/new wave hi-hat action inluenced terry chambers . " living through cuba " cold war paranoia dance . " love first sight " , fine moulding single , perfect psychedelic new wave it echoing refrain , quirky chorus , stuttering guitarsolo always inventive drumming chambers . " rocket bottle " " buring optomism flames " both upbeat , optomistic songs some great , great playing . formersounds like kinks backing paul mccartney - tuneful but rocking . " no language our lungs " may fact one xtc all-time greatest songs ( feat itself ) . " i would made this instrumental " repeating " way " parts still give me goosebumps . ouch ! " towers london " provided xtc yet english folk ( folk folklore ) classic . " paper iron(notes coins ) " points where people like damon albarn blur learned few tricks . it subject working-class struggle common subject matter but this song above beyond otherslike it we listen band truly working . " sgt . rock " , hit single england fun catchy fluff complete mock hard-rock riffs . " travels nihilon " possibly xtc most haunting song . repetitive thundering drums spooky bass line create atmosphere not accomplised often popular music . it sounds like stumbling upon tribe early homosapiens foggy shore or something . bonus tracks nice well " somnabulist " interesting exceptional . " don't lose your temper " nifty throwaway ( jam rick buler handclaps what it worth ) " smokeless zone " sub-par moulding contribution . rhythym section moulding chambers height their powers . dave gregory andy partridge dual guitar attacks . album went u.s. top 40 spawned five , yes five singles . melodic , atonal , inspired , inspiring great/complex/clever arrangements . complex intelligent rock never sounded so easy except maybe band sixties . what they called again ? oh yeah beatles	1
although this album criticized csn imitation ( what fans often seem forget ) , it still very good lp , standing famous test time . there something magical song horse no name , most imitative song whole ( it could really neil young ) , makes it one best songs history . but other song i find moving pigeon song i wonder why every lover this album seems agree it weak song . text way db sings it ( not far cat stevens style ) create malaise . sorry but me , it other highpoint album	1
title suggests , this ice-t return . but return exactly what ? it could viewed either return forefront hip-hop , or return his roots , end 80s style hip-hop . while i'm sure ice thought former , resulting album doesn't quite achieve any two " return " targets . there two very notable changes ice-t style here . first lyrics department . while ice intelligent witful ever , he toned down his verses lot . gone almost uncontrolled aggression " home invasion " . instead we mostly slow mid-tempo tracks , most which deal topics either rap game its rules , or warns against gangster . this change quite understandable man turn 40 years old . lyrics mostly good point . though i must admit i still find 2 love ballads here somewhat out place . other notable change music . it advanced basic beats noises towards more rich soundscape . most tracks , especially slower ones , attempt develop feeling uneasiness tension , most times it works . so why i think this album one more step way down ? because taken whole , it lacks focus sense general direction " o.g. " maintained perfectly . not single time i cringe , realizing this or track just filler ( " forced dirt " , anyone ? ) . turn off might old-school feeling whole attempt , which simply sounds out tune general development rap . clearly ice-t wanted put himself back game . but much i respect his previous efforts , more often than not i vision man his late 30s who generally unsure what kind music really works 1996 , his songs often sound strained entirely forced ou t.t hat said , long time fans , which i am one , this generally nice little album , worth listened occasionally . but it far mandatory purchase	1
i am not really fan live albums , but everytime i listen this cd , i feel like they performing just me . it great cd	1
you may determined other reviews this cd , juan diego florez controversial artist . high tessitura , athletic vocal agility , penetrating vibrato , mr. florez voice might find more fans europe than us ( where dramatic arias verdi , puccini wagner more popular than jaw-dropping vocal fireworks made rossini famous ) . opera fans who introduced rossini difficult now rarely-heard music 1980s through such great artists mexican tenor francisco araiza ( e.g. , through opera film ' la cenerentola ' jean pierre ponnelle ) , florez may shock . mr. araiza voice deeper , darker , more ' masculine ' than florez voice yet possessed same amazing agility range . however , juan diego florez worthy praise recognition . he ' easy top ' much like pavarotti , high notes avoid bone-grating ' slide ' up high cs db other tenors used rossini operas . young ( barely 30 ) , mr. florez time grow into his powerful voice . we should all hope his talent recognized wider audience lead new , more authentic recordings rossini rare difficult operas such semiramide , tancredi , ermione .	1
well , mariah got it this great cd shows it all ! her label mate co-star columbia/sony years , regina belle ecellent , solid , always uncompromising , engaging consistent performer who churned out some really nice tracks last 18 years . i'm into rnb/soul/hip hop , but i no problem saying i own this really good set songs . her music always ground-breaking , adventurous extremely good . " baby come me " her signature track , most people favourite regina track . it perfect track one which she always able say " classic " . this track get played radio 20 years time . " whole new world " track 90 feel which catchy but it track # 3 " so many tears " which i love . it perfect song someone you love , lyrics what most us think situation . it tracks like this makes regina true star real woman something say . " make it like it " " if i could " two soulful tracks . latter more hearfelt deep mother her child . great stuff . " what goes around " classic regina . it her sophisticated sound . " show me way " heart wrenching number , which some fantastic sax riffs , track which only her voice could make sound so real . she jazz cover-medley classic marvin gaye donny hathaway tracks " save children/someday we'll all free " . its spectacular effort , unmatched masterpiece you won't skipping it . song " whole new world " killer track went number one , really put her firmly map . it still gets lots lots airplay today many years come . i've nearly forgot mention absolute classic duet " all i want forever " . this track superb when it released all those years ago - it still today . regina never superstar status some ( just think somebody like janet jackson or celine dion ... my modest opinion , she outclasses them far !!! ) , but i think she really doesn't care happy making good quality music people enjoy . this set superb listening 74 minutes pure , sublime delight your heart soul .	1
... then this album you . everytime i rough day work i pop this one into my car stereo my way home all my troubles seem vanish within seconds . it softer side coltrane but ooooh so sweet tranquil . how anyone listen this album not touched it i never know . tyner amazing ! if you run out valium or xanax , then this could your next choice . but careful though , because it just addictive ! " coltrane w/ johnny hartman " , this most romantic recording jc ever produced leader it also my wife personal favorite . i listen first song " say it ( over over again ) " twenty times row still not get tired it . what amazing quartet tyner , garrison , course great elvin jones drums all backing up coltrane . this one truly something special anyone new jazz or coltrane this would good place start . if this doesn't get you hooked , nothing . so , kick off your shoes , pour yourself glass wine ( or whatever else you prefer imbibe ) , draw lights down low , grab your honey let music lead you promised land . i hope you all enjoy it !	1
ruben blades " mundo " tasty cd . i compare ruben blades jet li both professionals their craft they both top their game . true , some pure salsa gone moments during this beatiful album , but not really . his band excellent musicians there moments when priceless grooves achieved . ruben blades trascends this album your average performer . his lyrics universal their theme if there one message this : we all human race , where music concerned universality human spirit all matters . kind album first you might mildly dissapointed critical . but once you take tour again these jewels start shinning i decided ruben blades far too talented put out bad cd so good know . he belongs special group artists always satisfy listener , always deliver quality . there , 4.5 stars " mundo " 5 stars man himself . long live ruben blades !	1
let me preface saying i don't own any other luna album -but i love this one . title line suggests , i bought this album whim used cd store seven years ago ( i'm still playing it ) . band sound sort hard describe ; imagine more nasal lou reid singing over warm , quot ; so simple it genuisquot ; , slightly country-tinged pop tunes occasinal wry sense humor similar stephin merrit(the magnetic fields ) add shoegazing sensibility ( reverb touches , multitracked backing vocals ) dean wareham brings his former band galaxie 500 you luna . sans any musical pretention or quot ; look how witty i amquot ; lyrics , luna shines almost every song via liesurely , unemotional vocal delivery , solid quot ; songsmithingquot ; wareham so-effusive-it's-painful guitar solo bits outros ( it not jamming however , no song exceeds 5 minutes length ) . highlights include , quot ; i want everythingquot ; quot ; slidequot ; quot ; slash your tiresquot ; . review i read newest manic street preachers album described it , quot ; intimating emotion without kicking you groin . quot ; i think this applies lunapark well . even when wareham croons : quot;you've got me bad situation/and i want youquot ; soothing , neutral tone he always uses belies words underneath . great	1
metal health ( 1983 . ) quiet riot third album . formed mid-late seventies , early metal group known quiet riot released two albums japan . unfortunately , group split up , guitarist randy rhoads joined first incarnation ozzy osbourne band . fellow quiet riot member , bassist rudy sarzo also joined little bit later , unfortunately , tragedy struck rhoads killed after releasing just two albums ozzy . sarzo decided reform quiet riot . he rejoined former vocalist kevin dubrow , recruited guitarist carlos cavazo fill rhoads ' slot . they also recruited replacement drummer , frankie banali . 1983 , band released its third album , metal health ( this their first album america , but all actuality it their third . first two released japan only ! hope i cleared up . ) let get what matters - album . this classic metal way it meant experienced . there reason this first metal album top charts - it flat out rules . kicking things off title track . it band second biggest hit , what excellent song it . subtitle implies , this song you'll want bang your head . dubrow vocals top notch , nothing less . cum feel noize , band biggest hit all , cover slade song . this better than original , added guitar solo gives cavazo chance shine ( i'm so sick people saying rhoads better than him - they're equally good . ) don't wanna let you go perfect medium hard rock power ballad this track . some reason , this one reminds me triumph tears rain , that good thing . once again , dubrow couldn't sound better . slick black cadillac originally released quiet riot ii album ( released only japan ) , but band decided rerecord it cavazo guitar . this sounds like " seventies glam rock meets eighties hard rock " , it ultimately makes very pleasing track . love bitch slow hard track nothing short excellent . this cut solid proof - hard rock doesn't need fast-paced good . it also proves rock roll songs word " bitch " title always good . breathless one fast frantic rockers so many eighties rock bands tried their hands - this one best ones ! yet again , dubrow vocals steal show ( especially chorus . ) run cover hard rocker , similar several eighties rockers . this excellent track , though it doesn't quite top last one . next up instrumental , battle axe . this track gives cavazo chance shine , he . however , i've never huge fan instrumentals , this probably weakest cut here . however , it still very far bad . let get crazy , if poison cared more their music than their hair , they might sounded little something like this song sounds . i know i've beaten this statement death this review , but dubrow vocals excellent ( there no such thing overpraising this guy . ) closing things out thunderbird . don't let title fool you , this softest ballad album ! basically , it slow soft . every one these eighties metal bands needed some power ballads , this one best . end , it classic metal masterpiece ...... but it doesn't stop there if you bought remasted edition ! remastered version , addition expanded liner notes , you get two bonus cuts ! danger zone , previously unreleased , one band many fast frantic rockers . though normally i praise dubrow vocals only dubrow , true highlight this track backing vocals ( chorus) ! you must hear this track appreciate it . live take slick black cadillac not whole lot different than studio version found earlier album , but it doesn't . bonus cuts make remaster obvious choice if you don't album yet . metal health stands one crowning achievements eighties metal , good reason . it ironic dubrow sings line " i really wanna overrated " title track , because this became first metal album top pop charts ! i don't care what anyone says , this album worthy overrated ! no fan eighties metal should without it !	1
i am reviewing simply best collection after buying listening all best collection . although i owned simply best since it came out 1991 , it not great compilation all best two reasons : 1 . ) it only catalogues tina music recorded capitol label 2 . ) it doesn't reach all way back earlier years tina career ( exception river deep , mountain high ) . nonetheless , it provides good sampling tina biggest hits 1983 through 1989 . everything here let stay together which marked her comeback , what love got it , we don't need hero , typical male , what you get what you see , best , look me heart , steamy windows plus you get four previously unreleased tracks including my favourite love thing , which just rocks ! if you're so-so fan tina music , you may satisfied this compilation but if you're die-hard fan tina musical catalogue , pick up her most recent collection called all best which includes just all her hit singles . let hope tina more new music come . this can't end her career - it only simply best so far ...	1

some people spoke above liking king their positive stance ... i always liked them their realistic stance . they talked things both good bad didn't hide behind platitudes , they real people real problems they want better than they . it great see this honesty , yes , there very small amount language this album , yes , it deals few adult concepts bit escapism , but it honest it admits freely there better ways it wishes it could live up them . it retains hope . those white towers this album might seem like downer , but those us who _are_ depressed deal stuff like this , it light darkness still it one close enough us reach , unlike stupid feel-good rubbish completely unbelievable detached real life . too many christians live denial lie both god themselves everything perfect , refuse even think or talk real problems . king honest real worth so much more because they _share_ their tribulations trials they men trying make it through their lives . enough ... musically this album different what i expected , very john lennon guitar pop type stuff most places . melodic catchy vastly different most places kings . i really like it happily play it more my friends or just leave it background while we're doing something else . not all kings accessible ... hmmm ... maybe this could stepping stone help get someone into king more ..	1

bill cosby very funny this cd . clean , funny . three tracks noah worth price cd	1
i find myself wanting push past first two songs , jump right into " we " continue there . but instead , i take breath listen what band wants us hear . i'm not dissapointed . well , not completely . " ceremony " what one may expected hear come first appleseed cast last album , two conversations , gritty instrumental track following epic low level owl albums . me , two conversations wasn't hiccup , but it didn't seem like natural progression . llo may just too high bar set ( many said ) . now digested peregrine while , two conversations seems natural progression band it relative simplicty more straighforward songwriting combined all came before into this fairly great album , peregrine . this album completely unique mind blowing ? not really , if you've heard appleseed cast before , but this damn good album . " sunlit ascending " " peregrine " probably two standout tracks me , though i like everything this album . weakest point comes second song " woodland hunter ( part 1 ) " it seems bit contrived , but " part 2 " saves it later album giving first part purpose . i given this album any number people who never heard appleseed cast i yet find someone who dislikes it . obviously , some blown away others jump around hit high points , but it hard call this bad album . appleseed cast , peregrine isn't completely original , but their songwriting strong throughout resulting what probably their most accomplished listenable album yet . highly recommended	1
tell you truth , metal my least favorite genres . i hate slayer , judas priest , linkin park etc ..... im more into hip hop/funky type stuff . but friend mine said i litsen this cd , this unbelivebly awesome . so i figured what hell . he right , these guys blew my fu**in ears away . hangar 18 one best songs i ever herd . these guys such amazing guitar solos im actually banging my head like crazy it . got one best rock band 90s not just i think theyre one best rock history . thats all i got say ... cop this albu	1

i really love this cd . it great number her 1927 recordings which display annette could get true jazz feeling going her singing . she wasn't just sweet little singer all . she up jazz which evident " don't take black bottom away " uptempo " ain't grand glorious feeling " " wh o-o o ?, you-oo , that who ! " she also good torch songs such " song ended " . annette hanshaw integral part 20s 30s roster female vocalists . she friends great helen kane annette good impersonating helen style singing . while these songs fun , it best let helen kane sing like helen it joy hear annette sing her own inimitable style . this cd i treasure i highly recommend it . annette recorded 1926-1934 . it too short career but she left many grand glorious recordings	1
it quite easy me forget judy incredible acting talent , i lot non-movie performances my playlist , so i tend get wrapped up her vocal performing talents . however , this gorgeous compilation best her movie songs , i also remember what incredible actress judy well . unlike singers actors today , who either one well but not other or can't either one very well , judy supremely talented both . this compilation covers her entire movie career , pigskin parade , which she made loan 20th century fox , her final movie , i could go singing . within period 1 hour , 18 minutes , 53 seconds , you hear her transition sweet-voiced teenage belter deep throaty-voiced woman she would become later life . you also hear she never lost incredible talent singing . even though sound her voice changed over years , it youthful exuberance stripped away alcohol , drugs , just living tragic life , emotion intensity could not stripped her voice . this collection proves i t.t here not single dud these cds , sound quality excellent . many older tracks some hiss them , well occasional sound anomaly , which expected . however , everything beautifully remastered sounds incredible . liner notes packaging period also incredible . very informative include lots great pictures . i might weird , but i actually like cover art . it nice whimsical , although far away , or pics made really small , it make her look like something dominatrix . * now there side judy you thought you'd never see . ;) * but cariacature actually quite cute , i just think it cute cover . judy would sadly pass away six years after last tracks this compilation recorded . although she may dead physical sense , long her films audio recordings like these available public , judy never really die hearts public , she never forgotten . there only one judy garland , there never like her	1
after six years co-founding member mountain heart , 26-year-old fiddler vancleve stepped front center lead his first solo release . though his mountain heart bandmates on-board , this clearly vancleve record , serving producer chief songwriter , adding lead vocals several tunes . beyond his regular mates , he brought complementary players sessions , including guitarists rob ickes bryan sutton , banjoist ron stewart , vocalists ronnie bowman sonya isaacs . there plenty vancleve bluegrass roots heard here , including tight multipart harmonies hot-picked instrumentals , but there also moodier newgrass tunes diverge standard canon take country , celtic , jazz other influences . this rich solo debut established group player . 3-3/4 stars , if allowed fractional ratings .

i never quite realized how many great songs buddy holly recorded his very short lifetime until i got this cd . rave , it doesn't matter anymore , every day , true love ways all fantastic -- yet all current radio stations only concentrate his famous quot ; peggy suequot ; cut . such low $$ amount this cd , you can't go wrong	1
not much add what already said . it just quite amazing they self-produced this gem . there some delicious production here . perhaps they didn't need george martin come all following year . not too judgemental " muskrat love " - just because ct made it mega-hit later . listen it again open mind . it lovely arrangement too . i'm curious its inclusion though . warner need promote potential radio hit ? it only song not written boys , but they make it ' theirs ' ( not unlike " head heart " previous album ) . it saddens me this effort not commercial success it deserved . there not bad tune this record ( just their two previous albums ) . later , like during declining years 1976 their quite bit more " filler " material . but if you're fan like me , you explore some great songs forgotten later years . my only recommendation this material gets remastered . sound overall fine ear adjusts close balance , but it needs just hint more air around sound like wonderfully sounding " homecoming " album - especially all this incredible production . overall , not bad all simple guitar-based band . not bad indeed ! (by way , final note , i burned car copies store bought cd . homecoming hat trick fit nice snuggily together one cd , well holiday hearts - - hideaway harbor . give it shot yourself !	1

this used my least favorite release due its lackluster production quality comparison releases like antichrist mechanical . but you've got consider time , 1994 . grunge dead something dark more innovative music starting form . portrait beginning this change . its great album , not taken too seriously . it shows mansons roots , his youthful rage , not yet completely clouded his own nihilism . its punky metal industrial fuzz all around edges . start finish its solid album , catchy , enjoyable enough hooks keep your average listener interested . compared lot other bands albums came out around time , portrait sets standard . quality songwriting , overall structure valid message delivered candy coated fist face . just beginning mansons legendary career , definitly worth purchasing .	1

mark hall songwriting incredible !!! all songs he writes come very personal need tell story or portray message ... these not generic songs sound like every other christian song . mix throaty , passionate , pitch-perfect voice , what more i say ? not only , but mark walks walk . he my son youth pastor , he not only cares each every student , but he also challenges them best they ... his best set example without pretending " super christian guy " never struggles setbacks . my favorite songs this album : set me free ( must listened very loudly ... instrumentals out this world . this story legion mark 5 : 1-20 . [ ... ] . ) prodigal ( story prodigal son son point view ... i dig spanish guitar)and now my lifesong sings ( simple melodic ; best vocal album)i bought this cd so many times , gifts , it so good . i may buy yet one because mine starting skip , but it worth it . you won't disappointed	1
what fantastic collection songs ! anybody who gives this cd bad review biggest ignoramous ever lived . sound might not perfect , ( home demos , who knows what kind shape tapes ? )however , great music performances shine through nevertheless . ( i recommend 7 park avenue over more recent far less consistent pete ham cd , quot ; golders greenquot ;) . i think pete ham lot all he going him , i mean , so much songwriting talent , girlfriend who loved him , why he would want take his life . i hear all stories , but , well least we this superb collection his songs cherish , compilation pete would undoudtedly proud released	1
despite eventually dropped their record label , imperial drag band possessed rare ability combine rough , raw energy , thoughtful , even humorous lyrics . their two hit singles , quot ; spyderquot ; quot ; boy or girl , quot ; only tip iceberg . however , gain greater appreciation their sound , you would probably best served check out band preceeded imperial drag ; band jellyfish , it fronted gifted musician andy sturmer , drags roger manning eric dover , current sheryl crow bassist tim smith . jellyfish , like imperial drag , little less than 15 minutes fame , which only goes show successful music business , quot ; catchy simplequot ; continually prevails over quot ; substance music . quot ; too bad . both bands innovative well worth money it costs buy one their cds	1

this imported 5 cd anthology which summarizes career british band free . first three discs contain remastered versions ( excellent sound ) , alternate takes , non-lp tracks unissued tracks their career . fourth disc contains alternate versions unissued tracks their live album . last disc summarizes solo career members band . booklet excellent many pictures , chart information other useful information band . free unjustly overshadowed bluesy vocalist paul rodgers ' drummer simon kirke later band bad company . i find this band much more interesting . while material less commercial than their later work bad company , this material delivered more feeling . late guitarist paul kossoff his impressive blues laden vibrato attack highly influential . ex-john mayall bass player andy fraser excellent musician , witness " mr. big " example . this song anthem " all right now " " wishing well " probably band most requested songs . some my favorites include " i'll creepin '" , " broad daylight " , " stealer " , " little bit love " among many others . free reportedly big influence lynyrd skynyrd . band pretty much burned out departures paul kossoff rodgers ' song writing partner andy fraser . one album released after they departed . band played such festivals isle wight during their halcyon days . it may useful compare this set domestic 2 cd anthology " molten gold " . while this set much more comprehensive " molten gold " contain some tracks which not " songs yesterday " box set . excellent songs such cover albert king " hunter " , great instrumental " mouthful grass " " catch train " among others included " molten gold " anthology but not " songs yesterday " anthology . some cuts " songs yesterday " box set appear only alternate versions while original versions appear 2 cd " molten gold " . however , this comparison aside i recommend " songs yesterday " box set long time fans band like myself or novices alike . price worth every penny rare tracks alternate takes well remastering booklet . if you limited budget least invest " molten gold " 2 disc set you converted	1
seeing " pulp fiction " quite revelation . i thought , " this kind movie i've waited my whole life . " although i only 16 when i saw it movies . so i couldn't wait follow-up pulp . i waited , waited , waited seemingly forever quentin tarantino next movie . finally december 1997 came " jackie brown " . i didn't see movie when it came out but i'd always look soundtrack music stores wondering if i should buy it . after all , soundtrack pulp incredible movie . really , music intregal movie , you can't separate two . so i never bought soundtrack jackie because i hadn't watched movie . then last summer i finally watched movie t.v. i quickly realized it quite good movie some really cool music well . now i'm ashamed say i waited so long watch movie thus buy soundtrack , movie dvd . there great hits here such " midnight confession " , " strawberry letter #23 " , " didn't i blow your mind this time " which essentially movies theme . but there wonderful lost classics such " street life " , minnie ripperton " inside my love " , johnny cash " tennessee stud " , bobby womack singing " across 110th st " , course pam grier herself singing " long time woman " . if you haven't seen movie i recommend you . it excellent . you should probably wait buy soundtrack until after you've seen movie too , otherwise songs won't same impact . either way though it long line quirky , funky , phenomenal tarantino sountracks	1

blaze glory not bon jovi album , but rather jon bon jovi session players doing soundtrack terrible emilio estevez film young guns ii . however , don't let deter you buying this album , because album associated such lame movie , music lyrics remarkably high quality . lyrics seem first standard old west fare , but if your intake omega-3 fatty acids b-vitamins ample , you tell without reading lyric sheet- other words , just listening very hard- there deeper meaning them . songs actually form cautionary suite warns against getting into dangerous situations any kind , inspiring me never go anywhere without telling someone where i'll , well influencing my predilection putting up photos pretty actresses my wall deterrent self-indulgent behavior . if i not believed this interpretation lyrics , i would not living my own right now . if you've just gotten your first apartment , or getting ready , you must buy this album . it jon bon jovi first truly serious work , presaging keep faith two years , making it pivotal moment his career	1
i till late only casual listener tff , fact considerably disappointed their later " seeds love " album . nevertheless , i took chance triple set what seemed least two very good albums ( hurting / big chair ) . listened all three now , i say " hurting " tff masterpiece . album more melodious than its successors ( bar perhaps slightly raucous " prisoner " ) , vocal delivery guitar/synth arrangements much more effective . " big chair " just two great tracks , but this one consistently good beginning end . if you own just one tff record , this should it . " mad world " " pale shelter " alone worth price	1

this spectacular album , unnecessary bonus tracks notwithstanding , almost singlehandedly rescued reputation this band , which tarnished horrifying " tales topographic oceans " tepid " relayer " . every track here like its own universe , there stunning moments each player well tremendous collective songcraft beautiful , uncluttered production . hell , i even like alan white playing this one , i usually can't stand him . i kind feel sorry him actually , because following bill bruford band gotta bit like following jesus jerusalem hilton . just ask pat mastelotto . this record quite ride , beginning crunchy steel guitar madness title track ( punctuated singer humorously self-effacing words deriding his overly " cosmic mind " ) . this song almost sounds like cross " heart sunrise " fragile flying burrito brothers ' " train song , " if you imagine such thing without your head spontaneously explode . next tune yes classic storytelling , sculptor whose muse dies , leaving him attempt resurrect her out stone his work . peaks this song just over moon , culminating transcendent guitar part comes out line how " when we're young , love lingers so " punctuated throughout ultra-gorgeous acoustic arabesques fingers howe floaty , enveloping soundstage production-wise . my personal favorite this disc maybe my all-time favorite yessong . next squire showcase , fat-bottomed " parallels , " which sounds not unlike " hold out your hand " his then-current solo record , excellent fish out water . great super-churchy organ caped crusader here , well some nice multitracking voices . this features trademark , diatonic , positive mood this band was/is famous . side two we begin brief , lush sing-along proceed into conclusion original lp one great yes epics , " awaken , " which just soars like earth 60,000 mph moment morning when sun breaks your particular horizon . call " awaken " celestial character would like calling black sabbath " loud " . anyhow like i said bonus cuts needless , but original album so good it doesn't matter . booklet , however , very well all kinds new photos ( including one original lp gatefold where naughty , half-hidden smoking apparatus visible ! ) .	1
libertines band would fitted perfectly golden days rock'n'roll , it only shame they yet really reform . their debut album , " up bracket , " this london band churns out catchy , gritty rock'n'roll britpop twis t.t he album starts strong note " vertigo , " catchy garage-rocker alternates pete doherty slightly slurred singing , combustive short basslicks . " rapture vertigo/and letting go/me myself i never sure/was it liquor/or it my soul ? " doherty asks . his irreverent edge takes away any softer sentiments . style carries over yowling " horror show " sizzling " boys band , " drapes itself over entire album like worn leather jacket . there handful lower-key guitar rockers , like simmering " begging " smooth " tell king , " well strummy slightly surreal " radio america . " libertines only made two albums , but their kinetic sound made them musical presence both sides pond . what more , it just fun listen -- their music rare quality genuinely catchy , energetic , rough well-written . it difficult enough find one those qualities , so finding one all above rarity . pete doherty , now out band , pretty good service frontman . his vocals strong if bit slurred ; he raise his voice scream , or lower it seductive little chant . but surprisingly , more you listen this , more it becomes obvious other libertines just important their sound . doherty carl barat exceptional double-duty guitarists , all punk riffs deliberately sloppy edges . it all wrapped around strong , lyrics drinking , groupies bad-boy rockers some good music . if doherty doesn't shoot himself up into grave , he undoubtedly regarded masterful rock writer . places , they sound like band disintegrate , but only adds punky-laddish flavour " up bracket .

super-sonic jazz not nearly avantgarde suns albums became starting early sixties , rather this album documents sun earlier more traditional work . those you who didn't know master big band free jazz could swing play blues you should check this stuff out . i love sun ra more demanding avantgarde material sixties , seventies eighties , but this album very cool . you tell sun fancy just begining take flight he starting add different rhythms instrumentation more exotic harmony his repetoire . arrangements compositions just starting get " out . " instance album opener india bit exotica played electric piano . many tunes use tympani odd melody lines such stunning el sound joy . other tunes sound like charles mingus period but odd harmonic sensibility . ra piano recalls thelonius monk his use space occasionally tiny bit sun cecil taylor-like style pokes through . but general he swings solos more traditional though harmonically advanced way . playing his side men top notch . featured john gilmore , pat patrick julian priester . super sonic jazz just really enjoyable listen beginnings one jazz most ou t-t here intriguing composers . its melodic , exotic swinging . bonus it well recorded	1
debut album like one smiths makes one wonder : what life like before it released ? whom could disaffected teens twenty-somethings turn before morrissey made things clear all who heard him ? interestingly , my life more or less smiths-less until i my late-20s . only exposure them came my high school best friend , who everything his power get me like band . alas , i hopelessly devoted classic progressive rock time , wasn't admit contemporary popular music didn't it origins 1970s could worthwhile or ( heaven forbid ) better . thankfully , i became convert time morrissey solo comeback , i feel i more than made up lost time . smiths never known rocking hard , but they always able put their own twist basic rock ' roll . throughout their career , this would often take form rockabilly . their debut , it demonstrated spot-on single " hand glove " , which marries old-fashioned harmonica johnny marr . . . -like , trance-inducing arpeggios . morrissey also presents himself right off bat someone who wouldn't pull any punches terms subject matter . this song , he sings homosexual love something sincere deep or delicate fleeting any other form love . band rocks hardest " miserable lie " , which drummer mike joyce speeds agile fashion . morrissey starts sound like rooster end , but he regains his composure nicely " pretty girls make graves " . latter two tracks began morrissey tradition revealing disposition singer song title itself . obviously most these not ready-made widespread appeal . however , morrissey marr knew just well how craft single hit potential , indicated not only " hand glove " , but also " this charming man " - which propelled excellent groovy bass work andy rourke trademark jangle marr - " what difference it make ? " . perhaps best way illustrate difference singles rest album songs consider contrast first song listeners heard radio ( " hand glove " ) first one they heard record , " reel around fountain " . latter trades all radio-ready punch more intimate feel . difference their singles non-singles noted , " still ill " -also featuring harmonica - may proven hit-worthy its own right . great smiths ' best albums , they each one dud them . queen dead , it " never no one ever " , strangeways , here we come it " death disco dancer " . debut album , it " i don't owe you anything " , which borderline musak . but like songs other records , it not enough make it lesser album , but simply slow its momentum bit . " suffer little children " doesn't pick up pace or lift one spirits , but it closes album affecting listener way smiths song meant . smiths ' 1984 debut one best most important debuts 1980s , history indie/alternative rock . amazingly , although released only 4 albums new material their time together , it one 3 those albums worthy 5 stars . it also start career , terms ratio length quality , only compared beatles . his own review smiths ' singles , amazon friend mine referred smiths completists " vanishing tribe " . my opinion , completist only kind smiths fan .	1
before i'd discovered rjd2 i hadn't even heard instrumental hiphop . but i'd notions it . i listened hiphop , but i always more intrigued beat . i'd ask myself why nobody ever thought dropping mc letting kick , snare , synth take over show . then one day i downloaded whole bunch rjd2 tracks , they pretty much changed my life . i went out bought deadringer saw rj new york columbus ( his hometown ! ) convinced hiphop didn't get much better than this . i'm kind biased towards rjd2 when it comes other turntablists producers - he first guy i heard it well , becuase he kind represents , me , what genre should sound like . more i listen this record , more i appreciate it . rj interpretation hiphop deadringer , me , perfect . he expertly measured out portions soul , jazz , rock mixed it all together . those genres emanate samples he uses , drum rhythms , individual instruments , melodies he constructs . top all three guest mc appearances - serving prove where he came assure any doubters this not trip-hop , this hiphop . i listened big portion dj shadow discography aftwerwards because everybody said he rj influence . it pretty easy spot shadow traces rj work . but there big difference two artists : dj shadow work ( i'm talking " endtroducing " " preemptive strike " ) strays far hiphop , enough leave some people confused what genre it really fits into . that not bad thing ; it pretty amazing . shadow strips down his sound much more experimental way than rj deadringer . it seemed me like rjd2 trying prove through deadringer you eliminate mc , programmed sequenced loops , still call it hiphop . needless say , he it ease	1
this album , first issued 1988 , out print since i became johnny cash fan 1993 . it finally reissued this spring . it great . catchy tunes , guest parts singers such paul mccartney , everly brothers , waylon jennings hank williams jr. but highlight , me , couple really moving songs family love . one grieving song adult children their late mother . it so unusual popular music address parent-child love . there probably one parent-child love song every 1,000 songs infatuation -- almost never ode child parent . this beautiful one . johnny cash enjoyed something resurgence few years ago when people their teens 20s started listening his stuff . but my mind , this album better than anything he more recently	1

playing time - 33:06 -- it seems appropriate john starling , originally alabama , begins his first new album more than decade southerner hit , " waiting train , " jimmie rodgers . while starling doesn't include characteristic singing brakeman yodel , he impart his own remarkably distinctive voice plenty relaxed country hits lilting melodies thought-provoking lyrics . heart full emotion , starling milks lyrics their lament , love hope . john lead vocals rhythm guitar grace all tracks , mike auldridge resophonic guitar tom gray bass . friends years , all three seldom scene connection . john left seminal group 1988 concentrate full-time his medical practice , before rejoining band its guitarist lead singer second time 1992-94 . starling debut solo release ( waitin ' southern train ) showed his eclectic tastes bluegrass , honky tonk , classic country . he also put out highly-acclaimed albums 1987 ( spring training ) 1990 ( long time gone ) . now retired , john invited some his best musical friends collaborate " slidin ' home . " you may recall starling directed award-winning " trio " album linda ronstadt , emmylou harris dolly parton . minor role , emmylou sings john song she co-wrote gram parsons , " my hour darkness . " i'm sure john sees some himself personally relate lines like " but he just country boy , his simple tunes confess . music he him , so very few possess . " other choices he made this album tap reservoirs some crafty profound writers . i've heard missy raines jim hurst sing beautiful " cold hard business " ( their " synergy " album ) , but starling rendition jon randall . oft-covered song passion , leon payne " they'll never take her love me " takes great deal courage present . my goodness , starling still manages impart his seductive charm song sung likes hank williams , george jones , marty robbins , emmylou harris , waylon jennings . i never tire good hard-hitting familiar favorite , it ten years since waylon it . ten cuts spanning 33 minutes , album just tad short . interspersed mellow offerings couple tuneful instrumentals , " south riding tango " " irish spring . " both feature hot licks two guests album -- jimmy gaudreau ( mandolin ) rickie simpkins ( fiddle ) . added embellishment some selection , other guest musicians include jon randall , kent ippolito , jay starling , pete wasner , larry stephenson . auldridge also lays some tracks weissenborn guitar or lap steel . example , former instrument used impart bluesy twang " those two blue eyes , " song we may best remember driving bluegrass number keith whitley released rebel label 1972 . lap steel piano perfectly voice their genial moods lowell george " willin ' , " favorite song john ( recorded linda rondstadt ) . sleepy score truck driver heading home declares strong sentiment - " my head stove , but i'm still my feet , i'm still willin ' . " john starling closes " slidin ' home " one his most tender sentiments epitomizes entire project . sweet endearing tune , " prayer my friends , " comes award-winning tennessee songwriters jeff barbra sarah pirkle . john acknowledges wonderful people whom he depends . " our pathways different but i love them no less ... i'm so grateful people i my life , they help me what right ... my heart here tonight , they're dear my heart all time ... " john new album laid-back textures , he sings life tender , kind empathetic way . ( joe ross , staff writer , bluegrass now , roseburg , or . )	1
masterminded tchort ( silent `t ' i presume ) , former emperor bassist , this astounding concept album one 60-minute track . it not album , it cohesive , one-hour song . i ripped song ten parts even so , it almost impossible only listen one part without wanting hear next , next , so so forth . light day , day darkness impressive beyond comprehension . song never becomes technically demanding or too progressive , nor it ever fall into trap becoming clich� doom rock ( which plagues many clones genre ) repetitive unoriginal riffs . instead , album excels every change melody . kjetil nordhus voice , though not amazing , perfectly morose bleak album dark sinister mood . employing extra musicians add numerous musical elements ( strings , organs , saxophones , choir , death-metal grunt ) , tchort creates album whose changes keep music alive going - not once this song ( except maybe around 30-minute mark where woman starts vocalize ) energy die . none instruments ever used too much , nor any one section ever monopolize attention . additionally , none sections ever too intense or out-of-place . times , album may lack little subtlety , but not so any one moment sounds out place . influences range doom-metal power-metal even nordic folk jazz . my personal favorite " section " " song " last around 10-minute mark 16-minute mark . here , tchort exhibits acoustic guitars , astounding symphonic accompaniments closing riff could scare corpse-paint off any black-metal enthusiast . here how i would divide album ( trust me , this best division there ): part .... start ... finish ... length ... rating ( 0 = bad , 3 = great)i ....... 00:02 ... 06:47 .... 6:43 ..... 3ii ...... 06:47 ... 11:21 .... 4:34 ..... 3iii ..... 11:21 ... 18:01 .... 6:40 ..... 4iv ...... 18:01 ... 21:54 .... 3:53 ..... 2v ....... 21:54 ... 32:45 ... 10:51 ..... 3vi ...... 32:45 ... 37:27 .... 4:42 ..... 1vii ..... 37:27 ... 44:24 .... 6:57 ..... 3viii .... 44:24 ... 52:42 .... 8:18 ..... 2ix ...... 52:42 ... 55:20 .... 2:38 ..... 3x ....... 55:20 ... 60:08 .... 4:48 ..... 2a dark progressive gem unlikely genre , light day , day darkness majestic sets tchort apart true musician . see also : green carnation - blessing disguise , agalloch - mantle	1
it impossible overstate influence buddy holly rock ' roll . it said buddy holly beginning 1960 musically . he massive influence british invasion . it not buddy holly , it doubtful beatles would've happened . what buddy holly crickets laid down tape producer norman petty his clovis , nm studio nothing short revolutionary . this cd goes straight up hillbilly rockabilly holly hop his early decca sessions bradly barn , all way absolutely stunning orchestral pop true love ways raining my heart his very last session month before plane crash took lives holly , ritchie valens big bopper . keep mind this nearly all within space 2 1/2 years . many singers songwriters don't cover amount stylistic ground buddy crickets covered 20 years , much less 2 1/2 . buddy put his soul into all it . many artists music don't anywhere near joyfulness heart buddy music . this music still influencing musicians gaining younger fans because it . there simply nothing else like buddy . there 50 tracks here , all essential buddy . this music not dated all , still sounds fresh it nearly 50 years ago . my ears , it sounds fresher than some things released 5 months ago . my only complaint version peggy sue got married included here fireballs version , it completely inappropriate surf guitar lead nearly drowns out buddy vocals . there version this done(overdubbed jack hansen combo , i believe ) my mind far superior sounds closer how buddy probably intended it . reviewer said these cd not use all their 80 minute running time . i think few tracks i think should've included , like that what they say famous demos he made shortly before his death his apartment greenwich village . but all all , if you're new buddy , get this . you'll thankful you . but it hard listen this not think what else he could've achieved if he hadn't died such young age .	1
this 1974 follow-up masterpiece future days ( 1973 ) , witnessed marked change personnel slight change overall sound . after very subdued performance future days , japanese vocalist damo suzuki left band leaving members holger czukay ( bass ); michael karoli ( guitar , vocals dizzy dizzy chain reaction ); jaki leibezeit ( drums ); irmin schmidt ( piano , synthesizers , vocals come sta , la luna ) carry . although i like damo vocal style much better , michael irmin ok job their alternately buried-in-the-mix electronically altered vocal parts . five tracks album range length 5'44 " 11'12 " most display typical sound , although there more emphasis bouncy rhythms , brighter textures first three tracks . specifically , there bossa nova there come think , splash almost east coast ( hot ) jazz feel it - only loosest sense style however . jaki excellent drummer he fantastic job both styles - fact his propulsive style really drives this entire album . my favorite tracks include pulsating chain reaction ( 11'12 " ) synthesizer heavy atmospheric quantum physics ( 8'33 " ) . it worth noting chain reaction quantum physics seamlessly joined , creating larger track approaches 20 minutes length . my guess this attempt recreate epic nature 20 minute piece bel air ( future days album ) . my opinion it worked very well - it favorite after all . this good album marks transitional period career recommended tago mago ( 1971 ) , ege bamyasi ( 1972 ) , excellent future days ( 1973 )	1
this classic deep purple lineup , legendary mk2 7th final studio album . now maybe it not quite achievement 1984 reunion , let alone glory days 1970-1973 , but it still deep purple . story behind this 1993 album simple , it initially recorded 1992 replacement singer joe lynn turner ( replacing gillan 1989 ) , who fronted rainbow like " slaves masters " album . then , turner got fired half way through making this album , when old record company said ' we want gillan back or no new album . blackmore unwillingly accept record companies wish - rest band well , so they rang up mr. gillan . truth , lord , glover paice wanted turner out gillan , even before record company called . backing tracks already , gillan difficult job creating vocal melodies ideas would work pre-recorded music . actually , help bassist roger glover , they great job . i'm 100% sure this much better than what joe lynn turner written sung . gillan probably most underrated lyricist hard rock/heavy metal field . whereas turner lyrics tend more foreigner ; gillan more dylan . course blackmore wasn't happy bringing gillan back left after european leg tour . thus , " battle rages " final album classic lineup . any legendary band ac zz , would give their soul album this strong , so pick it up if you're fan classic deep purple lineup . highlights : nasty piece work , solitaire , anya title track	1
i hate say this but after listening this cd several times , i've found it more more boring each listen . reba adds nothing new here ... nothing she hasn't covered past . none songs here , possible exception " moving oleta " garner " classic " status my opinion . no song year candidates this bunch . reba way better past . even bluegrass country tunes lack substance because reba just not able pass them off convincingly . it almost sounds if she forced them . i'm talking " i'm gonna climb mountain " " sky full angels " . ballads o.k. ( room breathe , if i any sense left all , once you've learned lonely " ) but reba offers nothing new here them you haven't heard before . most stuff just like stuff she always puts out .... mixture country/pop tunes severence emphasis crossover . we've seen heard it before	-1

this album not i expected it ... i read all great reviews sort anticipated better quality album ... or rather , something more intricate , more creative . it just sounds so repetitive . i am huge fan instrumental rock , godspeed ! you black emperor great orchestral rock group example , mum , sigur ros , album leaf all great examples . tristeza not me , i just dont believe instruments used music perfect instrumental rock ... because theres no variety , you expect same thing over over again . its slow pretty boring . doesn't fit my taste	1
mike kensilla amazing . all his projects different , yet golden their own right . i would compare it further seems forever dashboard , both good but different sound . owen soft indie beautiful lyrics remind me weakerthan lyrics . check out nobodys nothing , ghost what should . two really great songs my opinion . so if you liked kensilla other projects ie american football or owls ; or death cab then this should great cd you	1

ricky skaggs ' first christmas album multiple family affair . addition vocals picking his children molly luke , album also features whites ( buck , sharon , cheryl , rachel ) members skaggs ' band , kentucky thunder . material leans heavily american christmas season standards , both high-spirited ( " let it snow " ) faithful ( " what child this ? " ) , focus multipart harmonies ( rather than bluegrass picking ) add warmth any holiday celebration . playing swings lightly " let it snow " " hangin ' round mistletoe , " picking sprightly instrumental rendition " deck halls .

this nice recording you get some fine vocals elvis but what heck happened scotty guitar work ? he great " elvis presley " recording , which basically rockabilly record , but scotty badly slighted this one . it like they locked his guitar closet or something ! it interesting recording you track transformation or evolution elvis ' music rockabilly rock-n-roll . problem , rockabilly 100 percent better music ! it involved much more musicianship , way more fun listen too got your toes tappin ' way more than this type rock . think some greats who rockabilly stand outs . carl perkins , early elvis , gene vincent host other wonderful talents . it shame rockabilly ever faded into near oblivion it shame this recording could not featured scotty bit more .	1
no cool hawaiin language ( no lyrics all ) , every track same , too much ocean background ( used every track i think ? )	1
one best live cd i ever hear	1
all but one celebrities this album should ashamed themselves ... not only they not sing , but laws ought passed so something like this never perpetrated upon listening public again ... sebastian cabot perhaps worst offender(and least remembered)of celebrities who appear this album ... time cabot , small , rotund englishman , playing jeeves-like butler american sitcom actor brian keith(who not sing any album i am aware of)and two snotty kids .. cabot renditions two early bob dylan tunes enough cause glass shatter(in protest , not because cabot voice strength , say , ella fitzgerald ) ... jack webb first wife , julie london could sing(and very well , too ) .. maybe her vocal success made great stoneface jealous ... or maybe he just got tired known his " jus t-t he-facts-mam " monotone " dragnet " .. any event , his rendering " try little tenderness " proves old saw every intelligent person knows resprects his/her limitations .. joel grey sing , well , sort ... he star original " cabaret " , both broadway movie version ... but sounding like gremlin hollywoodesque nazi-accent his role " cabaret " not same doing " white room " ... i mean , " cabaret " we all knew grey charecter , his vocals , weren't taken seriously .... mae west one foot grave other bannana peel when she inflicted her version " twist shout " listening public .. she also recently completed filming her worst film appearance ever " myra breckinridge " ) .. taken together west final choices much sink star-status impression which hers 1920s 1930s ... andy griffith , mayberry amiable policeman , navigate his way through old time hymns , evidenced his numerous gospel efforts , but singing pop quite beyond his ability .. singing " house rising sun " something akin scooby doo attempting " ave maria " ... shatner nimoy " star trek " fame also appear this disc , but any discussion thier utter lack vocal ability would require page after page(and numerous expletive deleted references)and perhaps better attempted elsewhere ... finally we eddie albert , ww2 war hero , actor , writer , star " green acres " , yes , decent vocalist , who one time sing 1940s big bands ... alas , eddie talents better suited such ballads " jenny kissed me " (one his 1950s hit singles)than doing " blowing wind " .. goof , this album sort funny first time it heard , but like topical joke it becomes very stale thereafte	1
different angle viewing this cd : i'm rock climber , lot indoor climbing through winter . usually i go much more upbeat songs , but guy i met climbing recommended this cd change . wow . something feeling music just feels good . he described it ' chill ' . i can't think better word	1
alone my hotel room working saturday morning mtv-asia background , i first heard " fly away " . hearing demos her website ( it great way - www.corinnemay.com ) several cds later , i am fan , actually more admirer her craf t.t here some artists whose material based what masses want , genres du-jour . i admit those my library . it just i can't too much it - they indulgences . then there artists like corinne may who uses music medium communicate you . what you end up hearing not just notes or arrangement , but message they trying tell you , confiding their most inner listener . she tells you her relationships , both horizontal vertical . you may not know anything her parents or her providence but that beauty music such this . it pulls you process , you experience . i one am deeply appreciative there " corinne mays " out there who stays true their craft uses music means end instead letting music end itself . i recommend you hear it experience it yourself .	1
great collection dance numbers mostly 1930 - 32 . excellent sound quality very good liner notes . musicianship solid , there plenty very tastey licks adrian rollini bass sax . all but one tunes singing , many trio vocals . several tunes jazz standard catalog , but many forgotten little ditties brimming pep optimism . i've played this one alot	1
i rarely review albums unless i read something so stupid it bears responding . this mpd 360 cat or whatever hell his/her/its name flaming retard . why ? let me break it down really quick : . ) he cites linkin parks ' monotony ... then suggests underoath alternative ... underoath one most monotonous emo-rock bands ever ... every single member band looks like clone one guy who cuts himself , wears sweaters doesn't like able see through his dirty blonde hair . . ) he complains songs don't sound like originals ... what retard buys remix album hear original versions ? . ) he somehow manages miss fact linkin park heavily influenced hip hop ... complains there mcs this project ... maybe he never heard rapping original version , noticed band dj , or heard them doing collaborations jay-z collision course ep , dan automator handsome boy modeling school albums ... maybe he just doesn't know . somebody ought tell him , then . . ) he says linkin park uses simplistic chord structures melodies layers ... whether they're top 40 or not , linkin park one most multilayered densely mixed sounds i've ever heard my life ... i get paid review albums . verdict ? this guy retard . i think i'm bit biased , i assumed much soon i heard him pimping underoath ... how someone insults band lacking creativity then lists underoath favorite , i no idea . but that beside point . screw this kid , he no idea what he talking ... probably because his sweater too tight blood loss last time he cut himself starting make him dizzy . record itself , it very well . i think mixing collision course little bit better , but one or two people , this entire rogue gallery hip hop quotables well known alternative musicians singers . personally , i could without jonathan davis one my favorite linkin park songs , though . i say , while i love how far remixes deviate originals , you lose lot feeling put into originals emotion gets muddled mixing cutting pasting ... but it good album far remixes go . if you like this ... check out jay-z/linkin park collision course album , or handsome boy modeling school album " white people " there song there features both mike chester , well dj shadow someone else , i forget who other mc moment . but check out if you love good collaborations . anyone else who thought process similar this mpd 360 cat or whatever eff his name ... some things best left kept yourself	1
why they wait so long put this out ? great find well worth price . fact , it steal	1
album flawless . musicianship so tight economical not single note or beat seems out place(every person i've ever known thrilled hear " pump it up " ) . while one obviously would not cast ec " i pagliacci " , his vocal tones inflections perfect his material , perhaps never more so than this record . but what makes listening this so breathtaking writing . this , armed forces , represents most brilliant songwriting performance history popular music . genre once relied " one-two-three'o'clock , four'o'clock rock " " tutti-fruitti aw rooty " now declan great provide " you want throw me away , but i'm not broken " " i want bite hand feeds me " . forget trying pigeonhole this saying it part this new wave trend or punk scene - this one greatest all rock'n'roll records period should owned everyone .	1
i bought galactic first cd quot ; coolin offquot ; shocked what i heard , musicians galactic know their instuments love playing them . quot ; crazyhorse mongoosequot ; i satisfied , quot ; late futurequot ; . but galactic hadn't reinvented themselves , quot ; ruckusquot ; they , their sound changed little they've drifted away funk , losing solos , adding more vocals . but this album great , some great tracks include : moil , never called you crazy , kid keener , beast , doomed , my favorite , tenderness . buy this album if you want get groove , but buy coolin off first , if you're newcomer galactic	1

jewel crowding up dancefloor her new single standgt ; original classic remixes awesome . they follow more or less path her last two singels but different unique way . although they remixes , it still stays very true original which not case singel intuition . these remixes sound like song which why i love it so much , full lyrics great dance beats , each one different , no repetitions here . also she stays away past remixers goes remixers like mike rizzo , which great . so if you wanna get pumped go out any night , buy this cd pump it up	1
after wham ! broke up it almost inevitable george michael would become solo star , he already solo hit " careless whisper " " diffrent corner " his duet aretha franklin " i know you waiting " also hit . " faith " released 1987 it also sold around 10 millions copies , it without doubt george most comercially succesful album . " faith " shows maturity but it also continues catchy uptempo songs wham ! famous , it great mix effective soul-pop like title track slow personal ballads like " father figure " . it also great streak 5 #1 hits billboard charts . george also became first white male artist reach #1 rb charts . first single " faith " catchy uptempo almost became trademark him . it starts face-up organ most song but eventually one-chord guitar introduced too . it hell song . " father figure " far more moody song , infact it soulish ballad feautures gospel choirs somewhat mysterious sound . both faith father figure #1 hits . " i want you sex lll " indeed 2 diffrent version song , it 9 minutes long . first one soul-pop but second more retro-soul horns , something phil collins would proud . song considered very controvercial upon it release , both title lyrics offensive many people song banned certain stations would only played late night mtv . song #1 hit us nonetheless . " one more try " touching ballad man not willing get into new relationshiop cause he hurt so many times before . it his 4th #1 hit " faith " . " hard day " never released single but would become hit too i think . it uptempo song reminds me " i want your sex " . " hand mouth " also non-single , it great touching slow paced song american dream . it tells story 2 diffrent people both want experience american dream , but none succeeds one shoots people other one ends up becoming prostitute . critizism reagan america , simular recent single " shoot dog " towards bush . " look your hands " jazzy song also brings up social issues , this time domestic violence . " monkey " catchy uptempo aswell , it his 5th #1 hit it not hard understand why . ballad " kissing fool " only reached #5and last single this album . it sound alot like upcoming material he going release later . upcoming song remix " hard day " last one third version " i want your sex " this one very slow paced though . overall , great solo debut george not only sold incredibly well but also flawless song 1 song 11 . all songs worthwile , he makes good mix catchy uptempo touching ballads . 80 classic without doubt	1

i am opinion proper country record cannot made these days unless jim lauderdale sings harmonies . folks like lucinda williams , buddy miller , fabulous chris gaffney dwight yoakum agree me . everyone raves jim lauderdale songwriting ability ( it awesome its power ! ) , but i never read much what great singer he . listen this record see what i mean . start merle world , honky tonk haze , first things first go there . only reason i gave it 4 stars instead 5 because i think del reeves/lauderdale version diesel , diesel , diesel rig rock deluxe record better . this hard country record enough steel guitar ( which means bunch ) . lauderdale voice blends so perfectly steel you'll honky tonk heaven	1

when british press go britpop , ever expected re-invasion american shores wave british bands ' par excellence ' , names oasis , blur pulp always pushed forward great white hopes their generation . personally , only band i ever bought albums wave groups , supergrass . me they only band writing truly creative , innovative pop , while harnessing all tools trade other british invasions proved successful . oasis song , i always heard song it previously band or two . blur , i could always pull out david bowie or xtc album song[s ] reminiscent , or blatantly inspired . pulp , i just truly found them bit boring , nothing kinks hadn't 10x better back 60 . but supergrass , even if i could name influence ( kinks certainly there ) , i absolutely thought song[s ] incredibly catchy , totally supergrassed , most bands would love least 3 songs quality album , let alone issue album after album strong material track track . supergrass , me , britain great white hope . their style influence comes bowie , bolan , pink floyd davies ' pop world , but its absolute quality songs one after other says supergrass takes , but gives back . its very rare group 2nd album outshines their debut , but this album this . their 3rd 4th albums push envelope even further , but its wiser start off their debut album , or this one , get what it means get supergrassed . it sheer pop , i never minded ' slightly kooky ' nature supergrass material or its members , because underneath all band who immensely creative their studio time , plants hooks galore its songs ( there always something placed supergrass song instantly latchable ) , mixes their albums diverse , always interesting material . 60 , 70 , 80 all covered , sometimes within one song , but it always sounds like supergrass . one could say any britpop bands , especially liam gallagher '' vocal '' stylings oasis ( not particularly fan ) , but supergrass it sounds unique . it sounds different , not so reliant hype , but more music , creativity writers . '' richard iii '' anthem . maybe 20 years time , it'll recognised anthem , or least nostalgically remembered anthem could've , but beginning end , song screams ' make me standard ' , ' play me incessantly until people get sick me ' , ' make me institution ' . its theremin guided bridge section , its hard driving opening , '' richard iii '' sets supergrass standard above its more celebrated peers . unfortunately supergrass peers , there lot more material this album matches standard . basically , supergrass only competition itself . that what creative 50% . other 50% enjoying it .	1

this album simply outstanding , one elo 3 very best ( " new world record " " out blue " ) . i don't normally fall love albums upon first listen , needing little time get into used them - but " secret messages " blew me away each highly diverse multi-layered multi-faceted cut very first time heard back 1983 . its predescessor album " time " clever heck but somewhat self-conscious concept album my ears , so " secret messages " felt like incredible return classic elo form . first four songs particular mindblowing - what way start new world record!here track list original unreleased double album : side a1 . secret messages2 . loser gone wild3 . bluebird4 . take me onside b5 . stranger6 . no way out7 . beatles forever8 . letter spain9 . danger aheadside c10 . four little diamonds11 . train gold12 . endless lies13 . buildings eyes14 . rock ' ' roll kingside d15 . mandalay16 . time after time17 . after all18 . hello my old friendall these songs remastered version except " buildings eyes " , " mandalay " , " hello my old friend " ( these three " afterglow " ) , almost impossible-to-find tribute " beatles forever " ( whose lyrics found http://hjem.get2net.dk/10538overture/tekster/elo/beatles%20forever.htm ) . so you patch together something close original unreleased album using itunes , which well worth trouble . here some thought-provoking excerpted " secret " comments paul . johnson only appear amazon review unremastered cd : " jeff lynne solely became elo this point he also found sweet spot producer singer . ... willburys sound born this album . i am still not sure how he got overly processed-yet-dry sound jeff lynne trademark , but it really seems begun ' secret messages .

i refer first three meters albums --" meters " , " look-ka py py " , " struttin' " -- classic meters . this not classic meters , but it not big down step " cabbage alley " . classic meters ' songs based short , pentatonic/blues-scale riffs , they instrumental , predominated distorted hammond fat p-bass . this album predominated guitar , there not one instrumental tune . whole album clear studio-sound , not much " dirt " , but nevertheless groove something new uplifting : horns ! those who look something like " cissy strut " , " sophisticated cissy " , or " chicken strut " might disappointed , though . backing vocals non-highlight tunes " love me " " loving you " don't fit into meters ' sound ( it discussable ) , but horns " people say " " just kissed my baby " perfectly suiting joy-bringing spice . far perfect 12-minute " it ain't no use " bit time-filler ; guitar dominated ( times three overdubbed guitars ) mainstream rock-tune never really lifts , gets less less interesting , just isn't same calibre rest album , which it fills over fifth . bonus tracks aren't satisfaction me either ; they're edited versions " hey-pocky a-way " ( 35 seconds cut ) " people say " ( over 2 minutes cut ) . edits ruin original -- perfect -- arrangements songs furthermore groove like crazy throughout . if meters new you , you're looking album get you started right foot - go classic meters ; it help you appreciate this one later . if you're looking more grooves after listened classic meters , there lots music here won't disappoint ; least every other track album should give you complete satisfaction	1

unfortunately eagles leader glenn frey solo career consistently underrated compared don henley henley continued write ' searing social commentary ' songs made eagles so successful , while frey deliberately ' lightened up ' played mainly soul amp ; ramp ; influenced music . ' strange weather ' this all changes . there songs everything here ronald reagan , environment , la riots just good time ' before ship goes down ' . mood much darker than frey normally lighthearted work . even straight love songs such ' river dreams ' ' walk dark ' you get sense he brooding his own mortality , this also true magnificent , eagles-like ' part me , part you ' . however he throw more humorous songs like ' delicious ' ' big life ' . difference frey henley frey not take himself nearly seriously , he also far superior arranger writer melodies than henley . other major attraction his exhilaratingly pure tenor voice which still sounds good it 1972 . he probably sings more depth emotion this album than he ever . all eagles fans should listen this decide whether overproduced ranting henley albums really good its reputation suggests	1
i've fortunate kept up " overweight lover " all these years but undoubtedly this cd stands out not only his best , but classic five mic album . this when rap fun it wasn't all nonsense beefs ( see game/50 cent , nas/jay-z , lil kim/foxy brown ) , this time where if you couldn't rap , or you couldn't freestyle step up plate when called out , you're career . not like today where mushmouth rappers ( 50 cent g-unit , fabulous , ma$e , all rest those mushmouth , winey rappers we today)can live large off one cd . back then when it came lyrics , heavy right there talent big daddy kane , krs-one , chuck d , kool . rap , . o . . ' , ice cube , biz markie , ll cool j , kool moe dee , run dmc worlds where skills actually made or broke your career , not crossover radio play . where back then , it frowned upon other rap artists fans alike artist strictly make records cross over . however heavy , not only he lyrically gifted , bangin tracks radio just couldn't ignore party , but one first rappers incorporate reggae lyrics ( him jamaican descent ) into his songs ( check out " mood love " ) . while run dmc shattered charts " my adidas " , heavy shattering streets " nike " just when original air force one coming into their own . there not bad cut this lp all gyrlz they love me , probably banginest track here . just add one more piece heavster legacy , i never think one rap artist ever foul thing or bad thing or diss say heavy . which extremely rare today so-called rap climate . goes show not only respect this man garnered his peers , but he also gave same respect back . this what hip-hop supposed , original , skillful raps , staying true you without sellout .	1

this grotesquely underrated album . drum'n'bass purists trashed it its release date , unfair grounds photek sold out , gone house , gone commercial , etc . don't believe it ! not paying attention opinions others instead focusing music he truly wants create , photek created extremely diverse ( god forbid ) upbeat album . drum'n'bass headz everywhere dig infinity ( one best cuts cd , admittedly ) , while those who prefer chicago-style vocal house mine give can't come down , featuring charismatic vocals robert owens . some experimentation trip-hop evident well ( imagine massive attack without vocals ) . true , not atmospheric dark modus operandi , but definitely more soul	1

first off , let me say really appreciate music this cd , you see movie first . but if you're fan classical music , you'll love this . music really sends chill up your spine , take it me , who listens mostly punk/ska music . i adore this cd , quot ; suo ganquot ; haunting first time you hear it it stays you . rest songs great well , i especially enjoy all tracks except darker ones ( 4 , 6 , i think some ending ones , but not 13 , 13 rules ) . darker ones dont anything me , theyre too long i tend zone out . so all all , i recommend this cd 100% . movie great also . its one those films/cds you watch cloudy , wintery day w/ hot cocoa , cry your eyes out , its so emotional . lols , this stuff grea	1
i typically don't listen cw ; i'm more fan groups ' disturbed ' , ' staind ' , ' metallica ' , etc ., but i say this some best country western i've heard date . after listening title track ' when it all goes south ' , i went out bought cd . it laid back , upbeat , thoroughly enjoyable listen	1
run dmc hold special place my heart since they introduced convinced me rap deserves considered aspect music no different than rock , folk , etc . there materials worked , time , because " cross over " nature their songs . they injected true rock sensibility into their raps . i wish more artists today would utilize guitars real drums when rapping . when you listen this , main theme music fun . this roll down windows , crank it up , sing , songs . best songs ones incorporate rock structure pop culture . " its tricky " , " you rock it like " , " my adidas " , " mary , mary " " you illin " grea t.t he highlight " walk this way " . they took song essentially predecessor rap made it even more funky . i challlenge any aerosmith fan debate ... if it not run dmc then aerosmith would still obscure , over hill group 70 . they made aeromsith cool again ! run dmc version improvement over aerosmith . this song ultimate party tune . this cd belongs any essential rock cd collection	1
thanks reading . i love glenn frey . he great singer , he seems so much fun . i heard " one you love " years without knowing glenn frey it . what brilliant song . beautiful , sweet saxaphone , it almost out place not belonging this album . i bought this album strength one song , i wasn't disappointed . fans expecting more same won't get it though , this quite upbeat album . some gems include " i found somebody " also released single i think , " i volunteer " " all those lies " " don't give up " this great early 80s music , might bring back few memories some , although i only bought this few months ago myself ! i loved it- great cdeagles fans love it	1

this my new favorite christmas album . i wish i this years ago	1
why can't i find album which best belinda carlisle solo material together her greatest hits while still go-gos ? people like me love her both incarnations we don't want seek out two different greatest hits compilations completely different material each one . surely some budget label could combine all above . maybe they england , where ( or so my friend told me recently ) belinda . still considered major force pop , selling thousands records year . talk alternate universe ! meantime , until my next trip british record store , i playing this collection -- lot . when ever i'm down or depressed , all i listen " heaven " i get high right away . besides feel good song , it unveils any number intriguing theological speculations : " they say heaven love comes first , we'll make heaven place earth . " belinda begs question how conjoin two different worlds , but i think upfront romanticism track what made it favorite gay men all over world . we all looking world without borders where " love comes first . " ain't happening here this planet , not anytime soon . indeed walls keep climbing higher higher . " world alive sound kids street outside . " i'm not kid any more , neither belinda i'm sure , but we still cherish our dreams youth when anything seemed possible . whole lp filled brilliant touches ecstatic lyricism 1960s combined persuasive synthy percussions 80s . today these sound bit out place , but lp power move you back time . her best tracks evboke poetry california beach life , its transience ecstasy , like " circle sand " or spector-influenced " summer rain , " its claustrophobic , hypnotic mantra , " every time i see lightning/ every time i hear thunder/ every time i close window/ when this happens summer , night so inviting/ i feel you so close i feel you when wind blows right through my heart . " we've all epiphany , whenever summer comes it always time good dose belinda carlisle .	1
pure blues .. not confused stevie ray ... jimmi his own style playing blues ... great album ... well worth price !!	1
it ain't easy interpreter . christopher o'riley accomplished classical pianist , but his biggest claims fame three piano interpretations modern musicians -- two discs worth or re-imagined radiohead , now this excellent exploration elliott smith . most respectable classical musicians don't this sort thing -- they usually stick what deemed respectable composers . ones who bother anything composed after , say , 1925 played anything other than orchestra instruments ? they become little trashy association , exuding faint odor music whoredom they ride rock ' roll gravy train new release section bargain bin . ( this happens whether they're re-interpreting rolling stones or pink floyd or , heaven help us , metallica . ) heck , most musicians general fearful doing too much someone else work , lest they seen bar-band ready tribute acts rather than sainted singer-songwriters they'd like . thank heavens o'riley not like most musicians . he seems see interpretation something like what it used frank sinatra heydey -- something anyone should much they want , provided they're patient enough really take their time it bold enough make someone else songs their own . that true test musician -- not whether or not they cover other people work , but whether they put effort give their audience something more than tracing-paper copy song original outlines . standard , o'riley latest outing smashing success . it demanding listen--don't just pop while riding subway work . i'm thinking headphones home , late night , no distractions , just you chris chris piano elliott ghost . his previous outings , o'riley easier task -- most radiohead songs , lyrics musical tone match pretty well . ( paranoid songs sound paranoid . unhappy songs sound unhappy . ... well , just covers it , actually . not i'm complaining , thom . ) but what made elliott special , among other things , way he so frequently married bleak lyrics depression addiction self-loathing poppy little tunes radio-friendly anything this side early 60s beatles . so o'riley opted here re-imaginings somehow capture trajectory original songs while giving them melancholy feel elliot tragic lyrics aching voice . ( check out " i didn't understand " or " speed trials " or especially sad scared rumble " independence day " if you want know what i'm talking . ) usual , o'riley goes above beyond call duty scouring back catalog songs play . ( if you're like me , means you might miss " pitselah " but feel comforted someone out there much more devoted appreciative elliott smith fan than you'll ever . ) it shame this sort thing doesn't happen more often . then again , there aren't too many modern musicians respectable enough deserve o'riley treatment	1
there reason why every review this disc gives it 5 stars . because it truly example classic live document one rock more creative groups - supertramp . song selection well placement execution , makes this one no-brainer . no . you know what makes this one no-brainer ? it great live disc . so often i hear live disc i'm turned off because ' magic ' somehow eludes live reproduction . this definitely not case paris . top shelf walk down memory lane , when roger hodgson still graced stage supertramp	1

intro this album listener immediately sent into " space-age orbit " this remarkable duo . i am convinced this intro track made listener unwind , spark up blunt after long day or pour yourself drink get your mind ready this space-age vibe . though i feel track 2 " we started this " should not first song record it still shows strong character eighball mjg their stance hip hop culture need some saviors . track 3 , " paid dues " little more like what fans come expect these two , witty , rythmically tight flows meaning which i feel missing today hip hop . my opinion highlights this record track 4 , " it how it go " , track 7 , " daylight " , track 8 ...., track 13 " throw your hands up " , my favorite song record , featuring badass guest appearance outkast classic , last but not least final cut , track 14 " speed " . i recommend this record anyone out there who likes rap , eightball mjg become one my favorite rap groups without doubt . i tend favor mjg delivery but not say eightball slippin ' , not all , thats just my opinion . bottom line , these two real mc gift this rap thing , check it out	1
this great album great band . if you not heard it you missing something quite special . i suppose back 80 lot us fell victim punk dogmas wrote this band off , just shows how unfree we all , sign conformity . but looking back this one some enduring qualities make it stand out . this 25th anniversary edition some extras almost compensate cost , not good value 25th anniversary edition london calling , but worth putting your collection . i think this best first 5 lp but i must admit i not listened anything damned after strawberries lp . tracks really stand out me ones original so i not think any extras trump what it , although there cover old song sweet , ballroom blitz , rips arse . plan 9 channel 7 , melody lee , smash it up parts 1+2 i suppose noise , noise , noise tracks really stand out - but what i say them ... so , yeah , its good , buy it if you	1

david byrne albums always seemed go unnoticed , uh-oh , this truly crime . this album so diverse colorful it really deserves some recognition . help lot different musicians instruments , this very bright happy album . comical opener , quot ; now i'm your momquot ; starts out bit off-beat ( musically subject matter ) , but includes wondefully rhythmic chorus . other highlights include quot ; girls my mindquot ; , which byrne vocal delivery extremely reminiscent latter days talking heads , which cool hear . quot ; hanging upside downquot ; features enjoyable fun lyrics driving guitar throughout . quot ; cowboy mambo ( hey lookit me now)quot ; very jumpy tune which truly captures essence ' uh-oh ' . album closer , quot ; somebodyquot ; , also probably its best track very epic large feeling which ends this album perfectly . get this album now	1

there no denying red octopus one most successful commercial albums ever produced previously counterculture band . this second official release jefferson starship , paul kantner , grace slick , marty balin company boldly toss off last vestiges jefferson airplane era stride boldly into world mid-70s corporate rock . much i truly despise genre , i'd say red octopus manages achieve rare intersection broad commercial appeal quality . what song more symbolic era than miracles ? perhaps only reconstituted fleetwood mac early buckingham-nicks era comes close commercially evoking mid-70s spirit album oriented rock radio . blatantly commercial appeal miracles , i still like it . line " i taste real world ( just drop it ) , when i went down you girl " one most daringly suggestive lines day also one most pointedly passionate . it still sounds way today full version miracles song which i never tire . large , rest red octopus very enjoyable album . never grace slick voice rang out more confidence authority . addition miracles , my favorites fast buck freddy , al garimasu , play love , i want see world , instrumental sandalphon which briefly evocative procol harum . i enjoy bonus tracks well , although shortened version miracles just doesn't it me . play papa john creech musicality pete sears add much aural appeal red octopus . i agree reviewer florida who feels red octopus constitutes apex creativity jefferson starship band . it all downhill here it especially painful hear depths which they ultimately sunk execrable " we built this city " . if i recommend one album jefferson starship , red octopus only one which i give enthusiastic recommendation . not only it good , but it bargain price well . now i've rediscovered it , it never gather dust .	1
i also love this cd ! i used cassette , but no more . anyone willing sell this cd me , please let me know . i also cd player i record cassette or cd if someone willing let me borrow it short time	1

im not writing review talk how old atmosphere better than new atmosphere because i enjoy new one but i just wanted clear up this " hardvolume " oppinion how everyones mad changes they've made group . people not mad change sound atmosphere , fact most dedicated atmosphere fans very pleased production delivery newer releases , its just lyricism takin ' backseat superb production . overcast without question one better debut hip hop records ever . topics great , lyrics clever , hooks catchy without cheesy beats dope . contrary what some people believe becoming more popular doesnt mean underground heads won't like you anymore . i think your favorite atmosphere cd always one got you into them alot us it this one	1
i first heard eroica trio performing austin symphony orchestra , playing beethoven triple concerto . they incredible . but when i hear them again san antonio , performing pieces mendelssohn arrangement bach violin sonata ( chaconne ) , my jaw dropped floor . amount energy passion they enormous . they ended concert encore vocalise ( which this cd ) -- whole audience so quiet pin drop heard ( texas audience never this quiet ! ) :) simply amazing . i'm definitely fan now	1
i very enthusiastically called this cd one best cd 1990 . sure , i listen lot classic rock soundtrack music ( odd combination , i know ) , may not best expert here ( ok , get your " unhelpful " buttons ready ) , but there something charming , sophisticated , gorgeous brilliant going here . i haven't heard cd gets everything so " right " all right places . mr. enigk put together something far surpasses his contemporaries nails 1960 pop british psychedelia some downright heart wrenching vocal performances . i mention orchestral instrumentation impeccable ? ok , i'll stop gushing , but i think you get picture . even most jaded feel heat tracks " explain " " shade black hat " . treat yourself this one .	1
if you looking rising tide part ii , this ain't it , honey . i found this record lacking traditional pop melody sensibilities made trt so special beautiful . prog ? probably . sweeping , passionate beautiful ? probably not . sometimes i get jeremy voice alone , i frog prince . this time i took cd over " sell your stuff " store	1
i read lot this , thought it couldn't good . it . " waltz debby " even finer . this genius work .	1
this undoubtedly my favorite cd last decade definitely sarah brightman best effort date ! her duets andrea bocelli jose cura outstanding ! i especially love ' o mio babbino caro ' , alleluja ' , ' la wally ' . sarah uniquely sensual style evident incredibly beautiful ' bilitis - generique ' , ' no one like you ' ' just show me how love you ' . close your eyes drift away ... it highly unusual me like every song cd , but ' time say goodbye ' , i . it unique way making me feel completely relaxed while encouraging me sing same time . it long past time sequel this wonderful album	1
i don't know you but i bought this cd based potential i heard their first cd puzzle . cd spots greatness spots what i would call good music . man i blown away this cd . it taken tahiti 80 sound gone step beyond . it retained all elements greatness i heard their first cd added it spades this cd . i would say song get yourself together worth price cd alone . there many other spots well . i would recommend listening this great effort headphones it full great sound particuarly well recorded . if i forum list my top 10 2002 it would certainly it . very highly recommended cd indeed	1
one most wonderous moments this album when final clang clamor " out this world " end gorgeous ballad " soul eyes " begins . words fail . coltrane masterpiece . every track standout cut . brilliant touching recording overflows confidence joy displays ( again ) seemingly bottomless well talent this legendary jazz group . classic	1
nazareth one my favorites since 1975 when i heard quot ; hair dogquot ; , their 5th album . but these quot ; greatest hitsquot ; should've called quot ; some greatest hits , some not allquot ; i would slap hands people who composed this stuff ... not again . only one third out 18 songs deserves called quot ; greatestquot ; , others too far . it looks like compilation assembled whatever songs available producer . this crappy approach which allows quot ; novicesquot ; nazareth fans get easily disappointed . i composed 3 (!) my own quot ; greatest hitsquot ; cds nazareth tunes ... it seems producers not familiar nazareth 30-year efforts all . only tunes 3 , 6 , 8 , 11 , 12 , 15 maybe 18 may present nazareth one best groups 70 thru 90 . sad experience ..	1

son volt " trace " fantastic album , especially those you who enjoy fantastic lyrical story telling . music lyrics , while certainly melancholy times dark depressing , paint pictures love lost , loneliness , sadness , desperation , which makes so compelling enjoyable listen . i discovered son volt via internet radio station immediately intrigued their sound . it tough pigeon-hole son volt into particular genre . their sound amalgamation country , rock , little punk , often categorized under " alternative county " heading . fans uncle tupelo , jay farrar early band wilco frontman jeff tweedy should find " trace " just enjoyable , if not more so , than any uncle tupelo release . it tough pick favorite song ; all album strong . album open tune " windfall " conjures up image lonely soul driving down empty highway middle nowhere , running away something . " tear stained eye " country-influenced song tells loneliness , its haunting lap steel guitar fiddle , beautifully accompanied banjo . " ten second news " gem loneliness isolation . just when you start settle into country influence , jay farrar company turn amps guitars up loud heavy " route " minor aor hit , " drown " . this great album start finish . if you enjoy uncle tupelo , ryan adams , wilco , kelly willis , even neil young , you'll definitely love son volt " trace "	1
i fan drive-in , when band fractured into sparta more popular mars volta , i investigated both new bands . mars volta certainly become more well known ; their style bizarre , experimental art-rock/psychedelia/fusion/whatever interesting , but i seriously think this album their counterparts sparta one great underappreciated alt-rock albums all time . pop-inflected , atmoshpheric , creative , otherworldy , artistic , catchy , gritty , expressive .... these all way i could describe this amazing addictive album . both more coherent more well-written than anything mars volta ever ; it really shame this album didn't receive more attention music-buying public . me , this band sunny day real estate veritable apogee alt-rock/emo sound , different ways , without some annoying pretense smug hipness some other bands genre . i still can't get this one out my cd player . modern obscure classic	1
i am person extremely catholic taste music . but , up ' til now , i've reacted so-called " world beat " music i would if i'd seen coffee stand advertising fair trade shade-grown organic blend : i'd conclude their heart right place , then run quickly other direction . i stumbled upon tinariwen completely accident . robert plant compiled music cd british music magazine , his old blues favorites , he included " imidiwaren . " track not only stand-out favorite , it total earworm . i broke down ordered radio tisdas sessions , several months later , it still top my playlist . somewhere way , i also picked up tinariwen other cd , amassakoul ( also incredible ) , am currently obsessively seeking out any track i possibly find this incredible band . what i say music ? i know next nothing band itself , actually learned lot reading several highly informed reviews here . needless say , i can't make heads or tails band lyrics ( though this point , i'd love find lyric sheet , so i sing ) . it haunting , but funky , crazy danceable rhythms badass electric guitars . i'm also very taken call-and-reponse style vocals -- it sounds like virtually everone band sings one point or . think sly family stone without chick who only scream . all i say , when we visited tunisia few years back , i desperately hoping encounter music like this ( though we actuality confronted sublimely terrible eurodisco music every point ) . oh , i also found this completely righteous organic coffee blend ...	1

boy , they weren't kidding when atlantic issued this album originally back ' 68 . it surefire winner start . her third album atlantic proved her talent gospel vocal style could not ignored . " chain fools " good opener . she then cuts out james brown " money won't change you " raw vitality , then churchy " people get reday " . she takes this impressions ' classic blows roof off great improvisatory gospel vocal spot . listen see what i mean . " niki hoeky " indeed catchy ; good bass guitar line , too . then we classics " natural woman " " since you've gone . " listen one ; it sounds like she sings " cinnamon gum " every time she sings title . " good me i am you " bluesy line aretha telling it like it eric clapton doing good guitar feature . then she cuts out ray charles ' " come back " peps one up , quite well rascals ' " groovin '" . finally , we close " ain't no way " ; my personal favorite whole album . what milestone song especially high wailing soprano background which i believe cissy houston . man , oh , man , soul . bonus material includes unedited , longer version " chain fools " , which longer 2 more minutes . it 1 minute intro , added verse , lyrics you're used hearing them placed differently . again , this non-chopped up version . then mono single versions " natural woman " , " since you've gone " its flip " ain't no way . " if there any album made aretha franklin household name , it sure this . you believe it . ever since i got atlantic rhythm blues box set , i've wanting dig deeper into some artists ' music . aretha , i've heard " lady soul " album , decided start there . i wasn't let down , neither you	1
