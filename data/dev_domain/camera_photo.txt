i using this cord year , i problems its durability . it actually worked fine first 5 months , but then it started fall apart . when mounted hotshoe my flash bracket , thin plastic shoe ( where flash attached ) developed crack eventually broke off , making it useless mount flash . i buy replacement part canon ( who charged me $16 this small plastic piece ) . i flipped flash carefully then , but then it still cracked !! i wrote canon asked them reinforce bottom maybe made metal instead thin plastic . so far , there no response . few months later , cord , some unknown reason , makes my 550ex flash switch ettl ttl mode , making flash fire full power , overexposing entire image . i checked flash putting it directly camera hotshoe , flash worked fine , switching back ettl mode . piece equipment canon , it hard imagine it giving so many problems . it like they only paid tons more attention their cameras than their accessories . there no other oem manufacturers this cord , i am forced get one hope best .	-1
this camera incredibly frustrating . i must admit under ideal lighting conditions outdoors moderate fully sunny day , camera takes wonderful pictures . however , photos using indooor mixed lighting conditions leave alot desired . if you want take any indoor pictures natural light , this not camera you . reason if flash not activated or lighting not perfect , camera slows down shutter speed considerably . since camera not very good image stabilization ( if any ) indoor pictures blurry unless you hands surgeon . course you use flash , but then your subject overlit , while background pitch dark . forget taking long range pictures indoors ( i.e. graduation ceremony or wedding ) because if flash , you get black picture because camera not compensate shutter speed distance , it only adjusts whether or not it thinks flash . if it off , your picture blurred because shutter stays open 1-2 seconds . since i take alot indoor pictures , this camera worthless me . if you only plan take outdoor pictures ideal light , this camera you . if you want any natural light photography , forget it .	-1
i got this my s70 . first off , order use it , you set s70 " radio control " ( 9 button pushes ) . then you better stay no further away than six feet or so ( only * front * camera-the remote doesn't work rear ! ) . oh , if you want adjust your framing , forget i t-t he zoom immobilized . if you need " cable release , " i strongly suggest simply using self-timer built into camera . it gives you 2-second 10-second settings , you're almost certain steady tripod time .	-1

i owned this camera year i never really enjoyed it . point shoot it bad , it takes pictures way too slowly i often miss out good shot . it also not user friendly i would hoped it so many scene settings . while i enjoy some them , most time my pictures turn out grainy ( low light ) , whitewashed ( flash ) or blurry ( even slowly moving objects ) . i tried changing exposure time shutter speed counter some these things , but i rarely get good picture when i need it . i never these problems my elph s200 . this camera also lot more bulkier well , cover over lens started stick so it not fully open when turned . if given option i would not buy this camera again	-1

polarizing filters used eliminate glare non-metallic surfaces like glass or water . they also used increase contrast color saturation your image . i use my polarizer not only eliminate glare , but also make skies nice shade blue or get some " pop " out clouds . there so many options consider when purchasing polarizing filter your needs . instance , linear vs . circular , film or digital versions , or quality vs . price . if you making use ttl or auto-focusing system , circular polarizers designed work those features . linear polarizers their uses , but they manufactured differently may not work . unless you certain , just get circular polarizing filter . there some digital circular polarizers market . i am not sure what makes cir-pl lens better digital opposed film . i use canon 20d digital slr see no problems caused using supposed non-digital filter digital camera . most time , when it comes filters ; you get what you pay . mean you need expensive polarizer ? course not , just sure get right filter your needs . what ever polarizing filter you get , make sure it color neutral prevent unwanted tinting . spending more color balanced filter save time post . if you need multiple filter sizes , consider saving money using step down rings . currently i use hoya pro1 filters , canon polarizing filters i previously owned without question bulkier heavier . weight might not seem like much , but when you stick all your items backpack all extra bits weight add up quickly . i spend good amount time my equipment my back so this big concern me . when it came down images , times i would see browning tint my photos . tint easy clean up photoshop cs2 , but i don't see problem hoya pro1 filter . overall , i would recommend against canon polarizing filters . i originally thought , " it canon , it must quality . " since then i replaced all my canon filters . this filter works , but comes cost disadvantages other similarly priced filters . pros : used film or digital cameras eliminates internal reflections ghosting cons : bulky heavy not neutral color balance	-1
i love canon products i complete canon system 10 years . i love everything canon . however i not understand canon reasoning behind producing this lens . reason ef-s lenses offering wider angle getting rear elements lens closer " film " plane . they cannot this film full frame sensor cameras because mirror larger would hit rear elements ef-s lens . they indicated , however , 35 mm advantage gone . why then they produce 60 mm macro lens when they already their macro requirements covered they current three lenses ? i would guess short back focus makes lens cheaper ; but this lens only $60 short excellent 100 2.8 usm macro . i said , if $60 i get lens 40 mm more reach ( 66 1.6 crop cameras ; useful macro photography ) works all canon cameras , i'm not going thinking this lens all . granted , you might not thinking buying ff camera anytime soon , but canon indicated eventually they ff all their dslr , so why bother this lens ? 17-85 or 10-22 very reasonable offerings ef-s lineup , but 60mm macro doesn't make any sense me.my $0.0	-1
i purchased 8 10 photo frame way display photos my wedding reception planned use it my home thereafter . i able get product running load ' test ' set pictures , but product then ' froze ' startup screen . i checked pacific digital support website , which provided steps ( basically , sequence buttons hold down ) ' unfreeze ' reinitialize unit . i tried this sequence several times , no avail , then called pacific digital customer service . after repeated messages left voice mail system ( " we're sorry we missed your call - we'll get back you " ) all times day night , i unable contact anyone company no calls ever returned . long story short - our wedding came went , problem never ( apparently never ) resolved , digital photo frame now $390 paperweight . absolutely useless . my recommendation : not purchase pacific digital product . this clearly fly-by-night outfit	-1
i guess i really shouldn't complain because my husband won camera office rally . but pictures it takes disgraceful samsung product every two three pictures blurred unrecognizably-where you can't even tell what you taken . if you found yourself among fortunate few who actually found success this camera thank your lucky stars . even if it less expensive choice versus other cameras market today spend extra money it would worth it not miss any family moments like my family , this useless piece crap	-1
i this camera month first time it broke , i don't know why it broke . i set it down when i turned it back , it cracked . i then bought lcd screen repaired it myself , but two weeks later , i case it , put it my purse . i carried my purse around not set my purse down . when i took it out , it cracked again . i would not recommend getting this camera	-1
not buy this camera , i repeat not buy this camera ! just read reviews you'll know exactly what i mean . lucky i got this piece junk christmas , so i didn't spend dime it . i opened package before reading any reviews . now i wish i've read reviews before opening box . i don't care what setting you use , i tried them all i yet take picture any better than my cell phones camera . lighting sucks , you either end up dark pictures or super bright ones . i really wanted this camera work , it looks sweet but sadly it can't take pictures .	-1
bought this xmas present myself - bring family photos while business travel . i'm now 2nd unit ( exchanged directly w/phillips ) , am still same issue it not reliably working external ( my case , sony memory sticks ) . internal memory pitiful , unless you want resize all photos you put it , you not going able hold very many internally . i've yet get auto on/off feature work , while it perhaps pc friendly device , it certainly not always mac friendly - controls cumbersome work , directions meager . i wanted able carry this backpack or carryon bag , fact support stand can't folded tight against unit makes it difficult this - course , no mention this product description . also no mention it only supports older memory sticks - no support new , ms produo sticks ( no mention product descriptions either)i thought i would get quality product phillips , this certainly looked like it potential - unfortunately , it turned out piece junk , one i've screwing around so long it probably not returnable . don't waste your time dollars .......................	-1
these glasses should not bushnell name them , which misleads one think they good quality . i bought them my son , time i got around sending them , i discovered plastic housing cracked where front lens screws , so lens misaligned . it past 30-day return date , so i glued crack kept them my own use . they still not right , but i keep them my car occasional use . my advice -- spend some extra money get good pair .	-1
we bought this camera thinking it would our do-all " eurocam " upcoming trip europe . it promised sufficient range performance features easily meet our needs such trip . sadly , camera not up filling this role . we need take camera it . however , we take v705 its wide-angle lens , reason we picked this model first place . it this disparity advertised actual capabilities camera which prompts me contribute this review . need true wide-angle lens both sufficient necessary condition buying this camera . if you not need 23mm lens , or if you not know if you need 23mm lens , then you not need this otherwise mediocre ps ( point shoot ) camera . good : fairly decent 23mm wide-angle lens ; 23mm default lens ; rapid start-up time ; internal focus zoom ; chromatic aberration well controlled ; use 4gb cards ; freeze-frame extract any video frame . mediocre : soft images ; perceptible shutter lag ; slow sho t-t o-shot times ; exposure compensation easy , but steps too small digital , reset when camera turned off ; flash not come close covering 23mm ; image numbering basically limited 4 digits ; flimsy construction ; no manual controls ; no raw format ; no optical viewfinder ; histogram display , but too small useful . bad : absolute worst menu system found camera ; excessive unadjustable jpeg compression ; poor battery life very expensive external charger spare battery ; unacceptable visual noise starting asa-400 ; forced in-camera stitching panoramic images , inability save individual panoramic shots ; panoramic component images forced 5mp ; overlays panoramic delete modes so dark they obscure underlying image ( even display `bright ' ) ; mpeg-4 video compression gives very poor results . synopsis : if you need 23mm lens point shoot , this , older v570 , only choices . if most your images bright light , 7mp v705 gives better images . if most images low light , older , cheaper , 5mp v570 better choice . camera seems very fragile . treat it gently you likely happy wide-angle performance . if you chose this your sole camera , you likely unhappy your choice . only reason buy this camera wide-angle lens . = = = = = some expanded comments = = = = = twenty-three mm wide-angle fixed-focus lens . this lens almost decent optical quality ; though camera processing still produces overly-compressed soft images it . power-up 23mm initially active lens , which ideal us . however , considering this truly specialty lens , it would make more sense `normal ' lens should default . best would menu setting allow selection boot-up lens . better yet would camera only 23mm lens . camera firmware wide-angle distortion correction . this works fairly well , cost even more image softness , but even-so , barrel distortion noticeable degree not present actual 35mm-film camera wide-angle lenses similar focal length . this in-camera correction turned off . doing so allows one see marginal native lens performance . however , able turn off distortion correction exemplifies me how poorly thought out this camera . only people who would wish this those who exploring artistic limits camera - they would seem better served camera such basics : manual settings , physically larger sensor chip , raw image files , or , least , choice degree jpeg compression . other end camera focal length 114/117mm performance shows slightly below average image softness average pincushion distortion . there very few circumstances where one would want use `digital zoom ' , so , all digicams , claimed maximum telephoto length completely bogus . after reaching optical zoom limits , one much better off doing any further ' zooming ' editing program . kodak advertised " 5x optical zoom " , best , misleading . actually , it just flat out untrue . camera two lenses . only lens optically zoomed 39-114mm lens , which not quite 3:1 . wide angle lens fixed focal length . ( note , some places kodak claims 39-114 , others 39-117 optical zoom . ) also misleading claimed " anti-blur technology . " best i tell looking images , exif metadata , all this actually means some given shutter speed camera boosts asa . certainly there no optical image stabilization technology this camera . speaking asa . this opportune time address camera incredibly poor menu system . it byzantine : both awkward time consuming use . adduce , `auto ' asa ranges 50-200 , set faster ( or lock slower ) sensitivity rating requires going through multiple menu levels . change `auto ' next fastest ( 400 ) requires 11 manipulations 2 controls ! either other two pss which we taking it requires 4 pushes 1 control . menu system next unusable field . still asa settings , camera sensitivities up asa/iso 1000 ( though manual only documents asas up 800 , 1000 available camera ) . unless your shot once-in-a-lifetime , never-happen-again moment , then 200 max asa tolerable before noise shadows becomes annoying . 400 entire image suffers noise not really useable any print larger than 4x5 " . previous version this camera , v570 , only 5mp , but same sensor size . increasing pixel count , but not physical size sensor , new v705 camera actually more low-light digital noise than its predecessor . this happened many current ps cameras , makers advertise pixel count measure image quality . my initial experience low-light high asa use this camera you might well set capture size 3 mp , larger files only marginally better printing capability because severe noise artifact . approach dealing sensor noise use one commercially available products which , when calibrated sensor camera , allows subtraction much internally generated noise . doing so allow semi-adequate 8x10 " prints asa 800 . if one really wants get carried away , combining preceding any image stacking programs designed astrophotography ( where dozens/hundreds/thousands images averaged together ) makes 8x10 asa 1000 doable . people willing undertake these manipulations likely not fit kodak target market . back earth . v705 still-image quality below average this generation 7mp ps cameras . mostly i believe this because overly aggressive jpeg compression , which not adjustable ( e.g. `best ' , `good ' , etc ) . my guess compression setting 30-40 used . this results small files , lot compression artifact . 7mp jpegs this camera 1.2 - 1.5 mb size , those 7mp ps i 5-6mb . my 6mp prosumer digital slr jpegs 8-10mb . more compression , worse image . most cameras allow user pick trade-off point . kodak picks it you , picks poorly . v705 video performance very disappointing . it uses mpeg-4 compression , very aggressive compression settings . unless it video your baby first steps , or aliens landing backyard , you likely find it hard watch . total output datastream 0.5 mbs . compare this minidv tape video datastream 25 mbs ( total , adding sound , error correction , time codes , 36 mbs ) . better stuck mpeg-2 which would give less compression , but decent enough ( tv quality ) videos . choice most manufactures made . result , videos my other pss 2 mbs datastream , so much better quality . battery . kodak claim 150 still images per charge . i am getting 100-120 , minimal use flash lcd `energy saver ' . even 150 would poor , compared my other digital pss , where i expect least 200 , often get 250+ if i am all careful power-management . this camera proprietary ( hard remove ) 720 mah battery . my ( several ) other , pss 790-1120 mah batteries , , i suspect , more efficient processors . since we only going using this camera wide-angle , battery likely last most day . we not bought external charger backup battery because cost 25% cost camera . though body aluminum , camera itself overall fragile i doubt hold up more than year or two . battery media doors not appear designed actual repeated use ; there no cover charge socket . media door often dislodges open . truly , my belief kodak designed this camera thought these doors would never used : camera would spend its life simply taken out ( not included this model ) " easyshare " dock system . this would also explain relatively large amount built memory , overly aggressive jpeg compression . shutter lag , b�te noire digital cameras , very evident this model . i not any method actually measuring time pressing shutter , image recorded . however , based over 50 years tripping shutters , it clearly varies , i estimate , best 1/4 second , up bit over 1/2 second . addition shutter lag , there perceptible lag lcd viewfinder screen showing what front lens . together this makes capture fleeting moment , active child particular instant , or wary animal almost impossible . shutter lag much more evident than same-generation/price ps cameras other makers . accompanying `manual ' poorly organized , childishly written . " finish reading this book , so you take share your best pictures ! " best , it written 8 year olds . manual make reference web-address where one download `full manual ' , however address given incorrect . when eventually found , manual better than one enclosed camera - it contains some information one could not figure out oneself - but it also written no more than fourth grade level . panoramics , one advertising points camera , disappointment . basically way it works 2 or 3 images taken `panoramic mode ' , each subsequent shot overlain thin strip preceding image , order allow alignment . most `panoramic modes ' focus exposure locked first image . so far , this all ok ; however , it rapidly goes downhill . first , max image size individual shots limited 5 ( not 7 ) mp . next , image overlay so dark , even lcd set max brightness , it difficult see through mask align elements . however , it gets worse . images must joined in-camera ! individual images cannot stored ! in-camera processing very slow very battery hungry . aligning overlaps grainy 1.5 x2 " lcd field gives , spite camera best efforts , much poorer results than aligning them much bigger , higher quality , computer display comfort controlled lighting your home . best way take panoramas this camera use lightmeter determine exposure each segment , then simply take appropriate series images 7mp single-stills , making exposure compensation adjustments based your light-meter readings . course , my smallest lightmeter almost large this camera , so we not dragging it . you eyeball needed ec close enough should able match exposures up production . much better if v705 allowed individual images saved . reading back through this review , i see it mostly negative . this makes sense , , i disclosed beginning , it my disappointment this camera actual vs advertised capability which led me write review first place . likely i said all needs said . so i just close mentioning only reason we not send camera back because wide-angle lens . except this unique lens , camera performance ease use below similarly priced ps cameras currently market . if you need true wide-angle ps , you need this camera . otherwise forget it	-1

i got this camera when it rather new . i am not extremely pleased it . it not acting this way because it 2 years old ... it like this when i bought it . -first all ... it no lens cover so you keep it camera bag . incase you touch lens without relizing ... all your pictures ruined . -it takes ever take picture . you wait like 2 seconds picture taken . -it eats up batteries like crazy-it takes forever turn on-if you flash setting autoflash , camera still flash bright sunligh t-t he pictures extremly blurry when you print home-it no optical zoom ( but zoom really customer choice .	-1

my primary use this camera take pictures indoors very bright lighting , without use flash . camera couldn't handle taking pictures without flash all , despite it extremely bright room ( 5 different lights plus 3 overhead halogen track lights ) . camera shutter speed so slow it nearly impossible get picture wasn't blurry . maybe 1 every 4 pictures came out clear . i believe fact its 10 megapixel camera what it . i used cannon powershot sd450 awesome , but it stolen so i needed replacement . i no complaints 450 it took same type pictures bright indoor lighting just fine without flash , unlike 900 . i am sure camera would fine people who always use flash or take their pictures bright sunlight but my purpose , this camera horrible it since returned . instead , i just got fuji finepix f30 , which supposed better without flash . we'll see	-1

i own many sony products , including sony cybershot dsc-f717 , which i love . however , i am very disappointed this camera , sony cybershot dsc-t5 . i bought t5 my mother father present . it small , lightweight , portable ; easy use ; stylish . it take nice photos brightly lit environments , especially outside . however , after several months use , few problems become consistently evident : ( 1 ) there horrible red-eye ( white-eye ) artifact many pictures . so-called " red-eye reduction " setting nothing . ( 2 ) dim-light photography very grainy , lots noise . nigh t-t ime photography impossible . these problems not unique our camera ... you find many corroborating reviews above . overall , i am very disappointed this camera , wish i could exchange it something else . not buy this camera . other reviewers suggest t7 or t9 take much better pictures ( they still small pocket-size cameras ) .	-1
i made mistake selecting bundle without reading requirements closely . lens variety canon cameras but adapter only works a6xx series . my adapter arrived it doesn't work my camera . kinda misleading now i spend more buy correct adapter separately . bummer . also , captain jack correct vignetting . this lens sort like magnifying class sits front built-in zoom lens . if you zoom wide angle , you see horrible vignetting he mentioned . if you stay zoomed , it works ok . disappointing	-1
this camcorder terrible just every way : cons : - unacceptably blurry video ; specs say it records 640x480 , but it looks more like 320x240 ( if ! ) blown up vga . - noticeable aura around any dark shape lighter background . - awful light sensitivity ; forget recording indoors -- no matter how brightly room lit , faces come out too dark . built-in led don't help much ( not all distances over 4 feet subject ) . - noisy zoom gets picked up loud clear microphone . - zooming goes irregular steps -- completely useless while recording . - video lags noticeably behind camera movement ; when image stabilization turned , lag becomes so atrocious you can't tell when stop panning -- utterly useless ! - when using av-in av-out cables , firmware frozen me couple times ; only way reset camera remove battery . - video encoding ( through av-in cable ) produces unacceptably noisy undersaturated result . - lcd display very narrow viewing angle ; anything more than 10% you can't make out thing . - still photos taken native 5mp resolution come out strangely grainy uneven -- something like " sharpen " effect gone wrong . i get better looking pictures my 2mp canon powershot a40 camera . - manual recommends keeping camera motionless 2-3 seconds after snapping picture ( that top 3-4 seconds it takes thing focus before it snaps ); but you can't keep subject moving , folks ! welcome psychedelic land image trails ... - flash photos come out wildly different color balance depending color background . - manual sorry affair -- only 17 pages long doesn't go much beyond identifying external controls menu options . - i could go , but i'll stop now , you probably get picture ... pros : - camera body seems sturdily built ; controls also sturdy feel them , battery usb port covers . hmm ... it only nice thing i think say it . maybe child ( think pre-teen ) could find this " camcorder " exciting toy , but i don't see how it enough even undemanding person looking capture occasional life moments video	-1

when i bought this camera sales people tried get me buy battery . they said one came it would only good 20 minutes . now i bought alot items my lifetime , 20 min battery camera just doesnt seem like very good " business " choice . so i said no . so i got camera , charged battery until light went green ( which sucked because i wanted play it right when i got it ) started taking pictures ( oh i also got 2g cf ) worked great .... so i planned go up mountain take soem scenery shots . keeping mind what sales person told me i pocketed charger just incase . well , 6000 ' , 300 pictures , 5 hours later camera still running strong , still 200 shots left trip home , battery life indicator hasnt budged off full button . so all all , i think battery life great , now i see if your taking say thousands pictures all row you may need but just going trip shooting few pictures every stop point , original work fine . quality photos ..... i love them	1

" wow ! " all i say express my reaction after getting prints taken my 17-40 . i've using nikon manual-focus nikkors since 1988 always satisfied color sharpness . however , after using canon " " series , i've sold lot my nikkors . color , clarity , sharpness , detail " " lenses amazing . prints this 3-d effect ( without use those silly red/blue glasses ! ) 8-) within 3 weeks receiving my 17-40 , i ordered 70-200 . those two lenses replace my whole nikkor collection . build really good . " " zooms little bulkier , but very managable . nikkors smaller , but very heavy . but lense technology coatings improved so much 20 years , i see difference . i tested lens pointing it toward sun . 17-40 surprising handles flare very well . sun just outside field view , there very little flare loss contrast . i also make 12x18 prints , this lens handles them easily . body going limiting factor ( refering digital bodies ) . warning : once you use " " glass , you going spoiled . you may not settle consumer lenses anymore , although some non-l lenses quick good what i read	1
i am 67 years old started out photography kid contact printer box camera . i all types cameras over years , mostly 35mm film canon slr . i too bought all sorts these 5-7 mp point shoot digital cameras before returning my true love , slr . i my digital canon rebel xt month now i can't keep my hands off it . it lacks nothing . although kit lense good , i bought 28-135 canon zoom lense image stabilizion produced stunning photo it . i love way you use 7 points focus , i mainly use only center point focus lock never get out focus picture . i guess nicest thing me i now don't urge buy every point shoot camera paraded out qvc or hsn " wonderful " new feature like " low light or non-shake . " this canon every good feature known universe you can't outgrow it . its camera let you good you , it won't hold you back . battery life great , built flash good but i bought 430ex that even better . i never figure i'm wasting money buying accessories this camera it my main squeeze many years come . i always missed my 35mm canon slr now feel i old friend back again , only much much better . believe me , you can't go wrong getting this camera , its beyond description ...	1

i've this lens 2 months now , love it . it my first " " lens i see quality difference this line . first , i tried 28-135 is-pretty good . but i wasn't totally happy , so returned it ordered 24-105 . now i'm happy . contrast , sharpness , ca much better . build quality feel superior well . plus really works . i try get all lens future , i believe it worth extra cost . focusing very quick zoom action smooth steady . if you're budget , 28-135 real nice . but go all way , i recommend this lens . 24-105 quieter i found . price bit steep , but optical quality there , resale value remain good , weather sealing should hopefully keep dust junk getting inside this lens .	1

i purchased this photographic store because professional said you shouldn't go higher than 1.4 . just keep mind -- 1.4 only " 40% better " . it worked really well , but didn't increase zoomage enough . i decided go 2x ( that twice zoomage ) teleconverter kenko instead . i gave this one my brother-in-law christmas . you think what you want -- i want get really close birds . i 70-300mm zoom lens 1.4 takes it 98-420mm . it improvement , but not nearly enough ! if you want get twice close , this isn't going it you . if you want get half-again-as close , this almost gets you there . far quality , quality definitely there . five stars quality , 3 insufficient zoomage	1
unlike many reviewers i am not diver . i bought this peace mind my camera wouldn't get ruined taking pictures my son water park , pool , beach . this equipment exceeded my expectations always clear photo underwater flash . this case out lived s400 s500 . well worth $170 price tag	1
this perfect camera me . i take alot close-up detail shots images come out great . it smaller than my old g3 ( which i loved , but pretty chunky )	1
i bought my k10d dec 06 after owning number pentax cameras over years very pleased engineering . combination features , if executed properly , make this camera best buy 10mp dslrs right now . i postponed my review because i wanted get some real field experience . i just went mexico , panicked because i left camera instruction manual behind . i now report trip . i little fumbling first , mainly because i didn't manual , but i soon able find combinations i wanted , camera performed both flexibly intuitively . af button exposure compensation button very well placed . i found myself difficult lighting situations often , both af exposure metering worked quite well . i also took some hand-held shots i normally would use tripod ( such 450mm ) , very few came out fuzzy because camera movement . few cases , i used bracketing , easily able obtain good balance details one or more bracketed shots . exposure metering worked so well i stopped bracketing . i particularly liked display modes : i could boost brightness see display even bright daylight , deep zooming gave me good check whether shot " soft " or not right scene . rechargeable li ion batteries , although not readily available stores , seem last forever ( even using power zoom , full-bright display , some fill flash ) . i believe i could shot all week ( 700 shots raw ( dng ) + jpeg ) battery grip attached . summary , this camera pleasure hold , very easy use manipulate , resulted high percentage crisp photos ( even if percentage well-composed shots lower because photographer ) . i bought it because its compatibility pentax lenses , 10mp sensor , shake-reduction technology , larger display , especially dust water seals . but what makes me quite happy it its overall ease use good results . i am still discovering its features , but i already know this camera frees me creative ways other cameras not past . some features this camera unique ( new program lines ) some available only cameras costing several hundred dollars more , making k10d good choice best buy . once again pentax , engineering supurb .	1
if you expecting clear professional sound transmission , this not it . that wireless system costing $ 1,000 - $ 3,000 . this system strictly home none professional use . i think people expecting this system deliver hi fidelity sound they hear movies or tv soundtrack . professionals not use this system . reason low price . home movies only .	1
third camera kodak easyshare . great performance pics . slendor size	1
i bought this one cheap extra battery . i seen no differences performance so far would therefore recommend this great extra or replacement battery	1
after reading dozens reviews both this case psc-55 , i still undecided case my canon sd630 . so , i purchased both see myself which one would work . because red my favorite color , i really wanted red case fit ( psc-90 ) . camera fit case , but it very tight fit . i shove camera case make snap close . psc-55 still very snug fit , but allows some extra breathing room which i feel better safety camera . addition , here something consider if you're deciding two cases : inside lining psc-90 more rigid nylon material , while lining psc-55 softer felt material . case overall still rigid , but i like thought my camera resting against softer lining . based alone , i'm going psc-55 - i feel this more friendly 3 " screen sd630 . both cases very nice leather very attractive - i'm pleased canon brand	1
first it little hard get my pictures look good samples , but i found re-sizing them inch or so computer before downloading them they show up alot better . also , ones higher contrast easier see farther away . just look samples come pre-loaded remind yourself it possible get great-looking pics surprisingly high resolution . after few practice downloads i thrilled results . ** plus : this one came wall charger . most plugged usb charge . wall charger makes it perfect share vacation when you're away your computer	1

i stumbled across this little gem accident . i picking up supplies office depot they kodak z650 ( display model ) sale under $100 . it ridiculous impulse buy -- i already own 4 digital cameras ... last thing i needed camera ! but what delighful suprise this camera turned out ! it come closest rivaling image quality my old olympus c-740 . i never seriously looked kodak cameras ... i always steered clear them based bad press negative comments them my friends who " serious " photographers . but i couldn't happier this little bargain ... it basically serves need i wanted fill -- 6mp camera takes kind quality shots i used my c-740 . there few negatives it little slow processing shots , but there very little shutter-lag when taking shots . i've gotten some amazing birds-in-flight shots it -- something i've never able accomplish any my other cameras , including c-740 . some low-contrast shots come out bit noisy , but most part shots very crisp sharp . it handles low-light settings better than any others this class i've tried . less than third price my canon s2-is , this little camera outclasses others mile . i stumbled good find z650 ... it not going give you dlsr quality photos , but no point-and-shoot . this camera perfect any one who likes take great outdoor wildlife shots . i just wish someone would given good report kodak cameras before i spent small fortune others	1
images this camera very high quality . 18x optical zoom very usable only minimal distortion noticeable extremes . optical image stabilization system ( based stabilizing ccd image sensor instead lens elements ) quite good performed well under several different circumstances ( moving car , boat , shaky hands ) . my main gripe this camera lack high speed usb 2.0 support . fine print says usb interface " full speed " which means maximum transfer rate 12 mbit/s instead 480 mbit/s possible high speed usb . so , downloading photos camera through usb interface painfully slow compared most current generation digital cameras such canon sd900 . software provided camera somewhat difficult use slow unresponsive . it would also desirable if camera could accept lithium ion rechargeable battery addition or instead 4 aa batteries it uses . but , battery life both alkaline rechargeable nimh aa batteries adequate .	1
looks exactly posted picture except badge reads " panasonic " , not " lumix " . fits camera perfectly . no extra room memory cards , spare battery , charger , etc . it easier insert camera both zippers down . belt loop won't fit most belts . no straps . however , camera strap good enough . good protection	1
i shot my second feature ( flying tiger ) dvx took it cannes film fest market no one could tell it wasn't film . this camera fantastic if you shoot right . i suggest this camera over all other similarly-priced models . we extensive testing many cameras this my favorite . jvc many thousands more you get less grain it dark areas , true , but money , dvx , if you shoot properly it , get you amazing results . proof , you check out footage shot ton lighting conditions my site . we best luck natural light , simple chimera diffusers . if you're honest yourself don't plan hitting lottery anytime soon ( getting real distribution deal/full 35mm blowup ) you need good looking film fests or dvd , there no way you should shoot film , or camera . we shot full feature no money many distrib offers , all because look this camera gave us . i'm planning using it again my next film . ! viva la revolucion ! put dvx 24p advanced mode rip knob off	1
very easy use , multiple languages , something nice easy even unexperienced users . recommend anybody buy it , it worth it . price right features mp . i would not hesitate pay more this camera . kodak wonderful job this	1

not too hard not too soft . camera fits nicely , compartments just anything you need your camera .	1
this camera easy use makes good quality recording . since it upper end product , it longer learning curve than more simple models but effort worth it added features . there , however , few quirks which could fixed make this much more usable piece equipmen t.t he provided microphone jack 1/8 " stereo . my camera , least , it not mounted very securely . when i external mike connected , i very careful make sure nothing touched it , otherwise , sound would drop off . friend some tools expertise fixed this problem but it should never happened . master switch moves off vcr mode ( up one ) , record tape mode ( down one ) or record stick mode ( down two ) . it intuitive but very easy overshoot mark . this frustrating i cannot help but believe there better design could used . " vcr " controls located top surface camera . they intuitive employ commonly used symbols . they also backlit impossible discern sunshine . you see symbols but there no way tell which , if any , functions selected . it still usable but it pain backside . there multitude things could make interface this camera easier use but it usable it now .	1
i've other 3 digital cameras this best i think , i shots very quick , flash brighty , even soft flash more natural shots . browse pictures very fast lot posibilities edit inside camera , light tiny slim . one best cameras . i don't find negative feature it . i love it	1
i just got my new camcorder start operate it . first all is very easy operate joystick , use still image function allways available , even while shooting video ( nice feature but all camcorders - low quality pitures ) stabalizer ( one reason why i'd preffered cam over other ) great even full zoom you get pretty steady videos . large zoom ( x32 ) also very nice . overall i think this great value my money ....	1
this lens best its class . i wish every lens i this sharp . this thing top notch	1
i picked up canon 350d while i italy . i thinking upgrade camera canon didn't built flash . this flash great , i've only used it few times , but i am more than impressed it functionality . title , i only said " oops " because i think it more flash than i really need , least this camera . overall , i am more than impressed this flash	1
excellent camera high end capabilities . easy use intuitive system controls	1
this standard kit lens comes rebel 20d . this lens most definitely built budget . it ever show ! completely inexcusable lack numbering any kind focusing ring . this very frustrating when it comes taking pictures distant objects , since you cannot simply set it infinity . also , because it goes into macro mode beyond infinity , you cannot simply crank it all way one side ! course , you always use autofocus if you wish . but this doesn't work night photography . fact , you might well forget doing any night photography this lens due inability focus it based estimation distance ( fact autofocus doesn't work dark ) . besides this nagging problem , lens just not very sharp . when i first got my rebel , i very impressed pictures it took , since all i compare it pictures taken point-and-shoots . but after taking several hundred pictures it , i find most cases , pictures very much soft side . this particular problem distant objects . even when focused those distant objects , they never appear really sharp , although objects intermediate distance ( ~ 100ft ) seem okay . let face it . this lens just doesn't it . unless you really hard up cash , steer clear	-1
excellent addition rebel xt . tried lower cost generic flash units . my only regret i waited so long get 430ex	1
exceptional images ! i shoot indoors low light due large aperture . lens bit heavy though ! i choose this lens 24-105 f4l lens . i went 24-70 2.8 wider aperture . i no regrets ! i miss additional reach 24-105 f4l lens , but this compromise i willing make . once again , excellent lens	1
it what it supposed . nothing more , nothing less . if it little cheaper , i would given it 5 stars .	1
this must product any digital rebel xt owner . always carry spare fully charged battery . amazon competitive pricing structure very timely delivery	1
i forgot my wife birthday she subsequently hinted she wanted telephoto lens ... i started looking cheap ones , but decided , i might well it right if i going it all . when it arrived , my wife took it out box we both stunned how massive this lense . it heavier than you might think well ( which means mounting ring come packaged this lens absolute god-send ) . first thing we go out buy mono-pod it . next we took it camping then water-skiing ended up some most incredible , crystal clear shots we've ever seen . autofocus incredibly fast - i able hold down button snap through multiple exposures while speeding across waves . most time - thing right . we then mounted it tri-pod shot family portraits . this first time we all kids grandkids together six years once again - lens didn't let us down photos fantastic . i don't any real training camera ( i use cannon rebel auto-focus most time ) but this lens worth every dime . ... it also worked get me out dog-house my wife ..	1
recycle times fantastic . batteries seem last forever . much less expensive than alternatives	1
up front : if you're considering this lens , stop considering - buy it . i occasion try tamaron zoom this range noticed plastic-y digital qualities some tamaron highlighted-texture areas . none problem this canon beauty . i am using it my normal lens . contrast razor-sharp enough shave . it graphic monochrome colors pure leap off monitor like politician attracted tv camera . it also light weight plenty fast enough practically no spherical abs .... tiny problems include understandable perspective bulging subjects edges . there some blue fringing very high contrast edges . photoshop nails latter dead'er than britney spears ' career . i've need reasonably large blow-ups , most captures cropped , yet still enlarged up prints minimally 13x20 . size not only this lens reproduce subject pores , but you peer down see stuff inside craters .	1
i bought this camera february , it really great job so many different situations . unfortunately , i lost it this past september kicking myself ever since . i purchasing exact same camera again . excellent features include : easy usesmallgood quality ( long they aren't extremely close ) picturesi like software came cameragood accessories , esp . camera caseclear lcd screengreat options picture takinggood features include : fast shutter speed , although not quite fast enough . i'd like take more pictures faster repetition but cannot this camerai recommended this camera my best friend who lighting designer retail spaces ( dolce gabbana , instance ) he gives it excellent review well , so i know it good all types light professional purposes	1
nice intermediate level flash , works great within its perameters	1
this lens very versatile , offering good wide angle good head-and-shoulders portrait length . it internal focusing , which helps speed close-focusing performance , image stabilizer better low-light performance . particular benefit those shoot darker open areas , like wedding photographers churches . , combined flash , allow use get more background detail indoor events . no longer we accept dark , dungeon like backgrounds ! ideally , lens would little bit brighter ( say , f4 top end ) , bit heavier built . but then again , we could $ 1,000 more	1
ok -- allow me mention only thing i dislike charge this camera battery , you remove battery put it small wall charger . battery charge seems weak i charge it lot more than old one . my last sony digital camera ( recent one , too ) plug fit into camera you'd charge it while it sat downloading or just " parked " ... i get bit nervous opening closing battery door constantly . that what nikon coolpix i . :/ now said , i gotta shout - i love this camera . slim fit into my pocket or small purse , lens covers when it off , screen i already plastic guard , photos quality . hard take bad pic this ! i'd say " i'd buy it again ! " but i already -- gift my son ! two thumbs up ease use , quality pics , , great price	1

i lot research picking out camera wish i known this camera before purchasing nikon p3 ( wifi ) . i happened receive refurbished sd700 right before our honeymoon took both test them out . what better place than kauai take some great shots ... so , after first day shooting i came conclusion canon better camera hands down !!! matter fact it best camera i've owned i'll never get brand again . there several things set this camera apart others : 1 . picture quality scene modes ( beautiful beach floral mode)2 . picture quality auto ( true sign good camera)3 . 4x zoom ( unbelievable - best feature ... took pictures lighthouse mile away looked like i right front taking it . i also used camera binoculars see mountain goat wimea canyon picture unbelievably clear)4 . battery life5 . user controls softwarei really can't find anything bad say this camera . i didn't get chance even read manual before our trip figured out all " bells whistles " fairly easily . point shoot camera , this canon delivers professional quality like no other ! definitely great purchase	1
i just purchased this camera lens ( lens different set ) it blown me away so far . pictures just incredible . focus , metering , exposure , flash , color balance ... everything perfect so far . i mainly used camera full automatic mode it really shines . its simple point shoot this mode . i used camera difficult lighting situations photos incredible . there no noticeable shutter lag , which very important me . i 6 yo son who goes smiling one moment looking away next . i missed so many photos past due shutter lag , but not problem this camera . feature helps continuous mode . i take 3 pics second up 100 pics then select best . generally i find i get good pic like 10-15 photos . i used serious photo hobbist during days film , but always problems finding darkroom develop my film . darkroom issue shear cost film paying processing made me abandon hobby . but this camera really bringing back excitement this hobby again without trials expense darkroom . only downside this camera price , but this instance , you get what you pay . you might able save buck or two camera , but i wouldn't even try . i can't imagine camera taking better picture . way , i love this lens . 18 55 mm focal length nice every day lens . its much wider angle then you find point shoot cameras , yet you still get close . i 55-200 mm lens well , but i find i use 18-55 lens more . shorter lens great confined spaces , where you can't easily back away subject , its always better move closer your subject than use long lens ( unless you can't safety reasons ) . my only regret waiting so long get dslr camera this quality . it really opened up old hobby me .	1
love it , it fits my sd450 perfectly . it snug durable fits great my purse when i bring it me . i definitely recommend this !!	1
i rebel xt 8 lenses thinking getting upgraded second camera body . so when it came out 30d logical choice , but it not really much upgrade 20d , which i resisted , so i not really sure what . then i all but decided just take plunge get 30d when i heard first rumblings xti . then i started learn details xti , more mega pixels , same auto focus , same screen , picture styles , dust cleaning ! only areas 30d won my opinion build quality , spot meter , estimated shutter life . those 3 categories not enough convince me 30d worth $300-$400 more than xti especially since xti won or tied most categories . way i look it camera bodies not nearly important lenses , they change so fast it not worth it me spend more longevity when it outdated year anyway . spend $ 1,500 lens , use it lifetime , spend $ 1,500 camera body , regret it year . i fully expect upgrade 30d released within year , now i saved getting xti i all much more put towards it when it comes out . so basically what i am saying , my opinion , xti just good , if not better than semi-pro 30d , so why pay more ? switching xt xti very simple , i use them both now without any problems . batteries , battery grips , remote shutter release , most other accessories also compatible both , which nice keep amount gear you need carry minimum . unless you want move up full frame sensor , i can't see any reasons why you would not want go this camera . if you read books photography just 1 or 2 years ago you realize this " entry level " camera features not even available top line ($ 5,000 +) camera bodies . speed camera bodies advance you might well buy entry level body every year instead making huge investment pro level bodies then shown up something 10% price year or two . not there not reasons buy one those bodies , i just don't seem any them	1
i surprised just how big this rubber blower . it size , it doesn't blow much air out - maybe little bit more than rubber squeeze toy dogs . speaking dog toys , this item squeaks everytime i squeeze bulb . bottom line this item actually works helps remove dust your sensor . because , it solid pick-up ..	1

canon 250d 500d doublet type close-up lenses which corrected chromatic abberation ( " achromat " ) . they offer better performance than less expensive singlet type lens . i happy performance these lenses used ef 100mm/ 2.0 , even when used stacked together higher power ( which canon not recommend )	1
powershot a520 switch stopped working right after i started using camera	-1
this quality piece take good close-up pictures still objects . i looking something capture moving/flying insects , this not what i needed . my fault not lense .	1

this very powerful flash unit works master other canon flash units . you get very nice results small amount experimentation . it what it suppose . i used it 420ex i've several years it worked fine . mounted camera it larger version built popup 30d some extra niceties lots more power . thinking 430ex ? cough up few extra bucks this baby , you'll glad you . it one shot deal , [ no pun intended ] , you'll using it years come . i bought 420ex my elan ii 6 years ago . it great unit . this one recharges faster gobs more power . you'll love it ! don't let all dials switches scare you , read instruction manual	1
i'm no means expert ! this first digital i owned . it took me long time because i so used my film camera . but i searched long hard find what i thought i wanted . so far i am not disappointed . first size threw me because everyone else bigger camera i felt it would hard handle take good pics . but that not case . i like feel , size ... i like able throw it my purse ... it takes great pictures use my e-bay , sending family friends . i haven't any pictures printed it yet , so i don't know how exactly they come out , but i'm thinking they should okay since my online pics great . i haven't single blurry pic , both regular close up . video works well ... it lots little options i don't use .. like sounds each function , but i change those if i want . overall i no complaints	1
this high quality extender great addition my canon ef 70-200 f/4 !! top-notch build quality tough , weather resistant design equal their highly respected line quot ; lquot ; lenses , canon produced great product its unbeatable zoom lens !! although 2x extender renders a/f function useless many canon cameras , i found this very small drawback overall ( i prefer manually focus under many my shooting conditions ) . this extender more suited low f/number lens due 2-stop change brightness , but it still very effective my f/4 normal lighting . lightweight fairly inexpensive way double your focal length , while maintaining incredible optical quality main lens ... my backpack always contain my 2x 1.4 extenders !	1
kodak made printing pictues simple 123 . paper cartridge snaps place quite easily . it removed quickly stored out way because paper protected its own tray convenient lid . this high quality paper protective coating applied photo give it many years durability . i thought price competative other methods printing photo paper	1

what you say , other than it 4 times cheaper than 50f 1.2 . not , but great bright fast quiet lens , small optically superb . crop camera it 80mm portrait lens . super	1
other than months waiting nikon deliver them amazon shipping , battery itself good deal . they work well , charge up easy hold their charge nicely . priced well , they cost less than same type battery than canon or sony . i bought them d80 older en-el3a would not fit . course i 10 older batteries my d70s rather surprised when they didn't fit d80 . basically same size shape , but keyed differently . i also surprised find 3e would fit d70s , meaning they backward compatable .	1
i decided rave this lens after taking 80 portraits , or head shots , children theater production . i set aperture 1.8 shot away inside temple great indirect soft lighting . results exquisite ! background , located five feet behind subjects subtle blur while subjects came life ( single strands hair resolution ) . not bad my first experience shooting portraits . now better part i get equal or better results thousands pictures i taken high school basketball games . i set my iso 400 my digital rebel xt get shutter speeds 1/200 1/1250 . again , intended subject jumps out . there no red eye ( or white eye ) using flash light scene freeze action . so after much experimenting , i prefer this my 70-200 f4/l my 24-105 f4/l lenses indoor sports lens . i love all these lenses . this one wins area price fastest lens . this my lens choice majority my current shooting situations .	1
case made high quality material fits my canon powershot a700 perfectly . i would given it 5 stars if case seperate compartment carrying extra set batteries . there just enough room carry camera extra memory chip . no extra batteries .	1
i am railfan , very large range zoom important . shooting fly distant bridge shot closeup coming around bend . focuses quickly too . i canon 10d i hate changing lenses because it gets dust inside camera . this 28-200mm very practical my hobby , gets used waterfall other outdoor scenery too . one note interest , it hard get super-sharp background details this lens , compared any lenses or series lenses , ( buddy i shot same closeup shot ore dock way background dock details looked lot sharper his 28-135 lens ) . same camera , same settings . closeup focused object looked great both , just when looking out-of-focus objects , lenses seemed better . this lens worth price my opinion , superb amateurs hobby-photographers like myself . but those looking touch more distant details out focused field , 28-135 usm lens canon seems little step ahead this . series lenses , course , league their own	1
this lens extremely fast ( quiet ) focus , razor sharp . what more could you want , when photographing wildlife up close	1
ive it couple months now . i notice no difference it my canon bp511 . my only gripe it its cheazy silver plastic color , but hey , who looks your batteries	1
battery works great , shipping amazon took too long . i purchased other items same day other retailers they delivered 5 days sooner than amazon item	1
i've only this lens few days i say it impressed me . it drawbacks , needs lots light somewhat heavy . i would not like carry all day , but my need it isn't problem . i couple photos display taken first day i purchased lens . it very overcast day i think they turned out reasonable weather . my test home when sun popped out outstanding . push pull adjustment i see no problem it . i think little more experience it very good purchase my budget . i know there higher quality lens but price becomes issue , when you amature hobbiest like i am . i would recommend any one who likes take wildlife photos . 5 star rating money quality it very good lens !	1
i've using these rebel xt since two weeks . friday i went show local bar took 600 shots medium low light conditions ( just small stage lights lighting up band ) finally killed battery after 2 1/2 hours/600 shots	1
i like color . it fits camera perfectly . it really cute not bulky . it not just ordinary black camera case everyone else . it classy	1
this item great .... i love it ... i my 35 mm digital camera it everything else i need ..	1

this timer/cable release lot features . works well . cord somewhat short though , it cheap plastic construction . hard imaging it costs this much . i think it over priced . but it job .	1
i originally bought brand blower clean my digital camera , but after using it once i ended up introducing more dirt and/or rubber bits than i care remember . long story short i don't use my camera anymore it took me long time get all crud out my camera . but then i decided give brand try since so many people seemed able use blower bulbs without any problems . when i got my new blower my sensor already fairly clean , but after using it it little cleaner . you still sometimes those stuck particles ( i use sterile pec pads eclipse solution get rid those pretty good results , but this your own risk since it voids most camera manufacturers warranties . ) i also keep my blower original packaging keep it clean possible , i guess i am little gun shy after my first experience	1
i got this camera my 17th birthday last summer , it great . much i'd love canon powershot , it bit out my price range . all people who think using lcd screen runs out batteries after quot ; 2-4 picturesquot ; lying you . i bought rechargable batteries radioshack , i've taken up 400 picture without batteries needing changed . this good camera good quality good lighting . dark or overcast situations , it look bit grainy , but that easily photoshopped . i recommend when uploading , plug it into wall digital camera adapter , because uploading sucks all battery power right out . i recommend this someone who hasn't owned digital camera before , or someone wants good quality not-so-crazy price	1
i am portrait professional photographer over 40 years . i needed wide angle lens weddings wanted know quality kit lens . i test using rebel xt kit lens canon 16-35mm lens which costs somewhere around $ 1,500 . i set both cameras 18mm focal length tripod . i took shots outdoors indoors . images exactly same . outdoor shots show objects infinity well 10 ' away . i made 8x10 prints showed them my fellow professional photographers . nobody could identify which lens took which . this real world scenario	1
this great camera those who need more than point shoot but not want carry bag full lenses . also , large sd card ( 1 4 gb ) this camera replace your video camera . one thing note , when you take pictures while recording video , it stops recording second or two while it processes your picture . this very obvious when watching your video	1
i'm still learning use this camera all features . so far it amazing . i've taking pictures kids it looks like pro shots . i use auto mode lot it works great . zoom amazing . i love it tells me when i am focused . also it great battery life . i'm very happy this camera	1
this lens so many uses . anytime i position myself where my subject more than five feet away , this my lens choice . i kit 18-70mm came d70 50mm prime ( i 18-200 vr order , if nikon ever get around catching up demand , lens might surpass this one , due smaller weight - plus it lot cheaper ) . i took every lens i own d70 british museum london . shooting handheld available light ( i never used flash ) many egyptian greek artifacts over fifty feet away , i got outstanding results this lens . vr technology amazing . constant 2.8 aperture also major advantage . i'll grant you my arm felt like rubber hose after four hours site seeing , but it worth it ! i similar satisfaction using lens outdoors wildlife photography . i even used tc-20eii teleconverter lens , shoot hummingbirds great distance . i would no reservations recommending lens , until nikon announced 18-200 vr . this new lens much broader focal length low end , focuses much closer ( around foot , compared five feet 70-200 ) . 18-200 not provide constant 2.8 aperture across it focal length , so 70-200 would better long distances low light . but less than half price , i think less than half size , this new lens clearly premier spot my bag . it totally replace 70-200vr ? i'll update my review when i finally get try lens block . until then , 70-200mm vr champ	1
i nikon d50 , when attaching camera , tilting base tripod needs little compensation camera weight . hence , i haven't found any use libelle tripod . i look through wiev finder see if my set-up level or not . overall though , it not big problem , hey , price tripod , i'll live it	1
this tool transforms my drebel xt tiny little viewfinder into usable one . it 1.25 setting it shows clear picture 100% coverage what viewfinder shows . 2.5 , coverage much less but setting very handy very critical manual focussing jobs . remember set your camera diopter it default factory setting . otherwise , flipping angle finder 1.25 2.5 magnification requires re-adjustment finder diopter . big advantage this little device it gives you freedom try exciting angles ( hey , they don't call it angle finder nothing ) without breaking your neck . only minor downside initial learning curve getting adjusted image shown finder .	1
i tokina 12-24 f4 it great sharp lens . this canon focuses faster wider . if you're worried full frame future don't . just buy this lens enjoy ultra wide images . it light , fast sharp . " " quality pictures . build could better but i don't see any problems down road .	1
i got this lens because i didn't really own anything close this range except kit lens ( good but not great not f/ 2.8 ) . i own 15mm canon fisheye but it distort quite bit even 20d i don't like correct photoshop each time i wanted wide lens . i wanted something wider , could capture lots light ( i allot ambient low light photowork ) i wanted something versatile ( 20d this really 24mm 56mm --- great working range ) . pros : 1 ) 1.6 crop factor my 20d this really 24 56mm lens . this makes it quite bit less wide angle more midrange lens . consequently , it stays my camera all time covers most my daily needs . i bought this lens fully expecting it 24 56 i wanted it multi purpose 24mm its still pretty wide . 2 ) i try avoid flash much possible given type photography i f/ 2.8 i take some great ambient light pictures i would not able otherwise3 ) f/ 2.8 , i also blow backgrounds foregrounds out focus . out focus areas gorgeously buttery blokeh very nice given 7 blades shutter . 4 ) color saturation like nothing i've ever seen before except my 70-200mm canon " " . i literally floored some baby pictures i took where colors two words " mind blowing " . i knew color would great but " wow ! " photoshop cs2 i " fake " saturation but its just not quite same color came out this lens straight out box . zero photoshop touchup needed . 5 ) its sharp ! this lens takes some amazingly sharp pictures into what i would classify amazing . i've received numerous positive comments sharpness this lens . i've tried looking edges see if there any ca or less sharpness couldn't really find any . maybe full size sensor you tell more but i couldn't really 20d . i notice plane focus f/ 2.8 narrow ( which good ) i make sure everything i want focus . blokeh very buttery f/ 2.8 . i like it quite bit . 6 ) its built like tank . black metal shell . metal ef mount . smooth manual focusing . sturdy recessed switches . red stripe catches eye photographers who know .... easy strike up conversations learn . 7 ) it surprisingly smaller lighter than i thought it would . half size my 70-200mm canon " " . i expecting it bigger am much happier it wasn't . its my camera all time not chore carry around all . unless you're very petite person . 8 ) internal focusing . so lens size doesn't change size or turn when focusing . this very useful when you put filters or when you're focusing close . 9 ) usm motor . its whisper quiet it focuses super fast . faster than my 70-200mm .... something i'd expect but wow its fast silent . 10 ) it focuses pretty close 12 inches or so . you get close your subject . its not macro lens but you get some dramatic wide angle shots its close focusing . 11 ) its ttl2 so works very nice my 580ex flash . 12 ) ef mount grow you . if you upgrade your camera body full frame camera ef mount , this lens fit your new camera you continue enjoy your lens investment . cons : 1 ) 1.6 frame size , it doesn't get into " amazing " wide category but that not fault lens . i'm marking this down con but you take it several ways . if you want get ultra-wide small frame camera , you won't this lens ( although 24mm pretty darn wide ) your only canon options 15mm fisheye which i own think great specialty lens , 10-22mm efs canon , 14mm . 10-22 i hear very good but its efs ( won't fit full frame cameras - less upgradable i think ) its not lens although non-l 10-22 i hear exceptional . 14mm ef run you almost much this 16-35mm zoom . 15mm ef fisheye wonderful but it designed distort distortion visible 20d even more so full frame cameras you need photoshop fix . this 16-35mm , if you want f/ 2.8 ok something like 24-56 , then you won't find better small-sensor cameras . i'm very glad i got it , if you already full frame camera or upgrade some point , you enjoy 16mm " wow " wide . i only imagine coverage i'd get full frame camera . 2 ) hood massive ... wide but not very deep ... so its shallow hood ( it wide angle i guess ) . i never take it off -- it keeps stray light out secondary protection lens . i zero problems lens flare . 3 ) front lens element sink out inside tube ( exposed but lens case doesn't change size ) . there no protective filter protect front element . i bought uv/haze filter ($26 amazon ) i highly recommend you well protect your investment . uv/haze filter , lens very self contained . 4 ) oh cost .... my oh my . expensive heck . cost much my camera body --- worth every penny . if its any consolation , these lenses very hard make they keep their value . your camera body might drop value new technology arrives but this lens hold its value if you take care it . differences , notes , things i've heard : 1 ) i no experience non canon lenses so i can't compare but this 16-35 amazing . 2 ) compared other " " lenses , it holds up quality amazing when it comes color , performance , lens construction . 3 ) i hear there some chromatic aberation edges these wide lenses ( well more than 70-200mm ) but that expected when you're gathering light such wide angles focusing it .... that got hard . wide angles exhibit more ca than long telephotos . my 16-35mm it wasn't visible me . i imagine pro pro might notice care . anybody less stringent requirements than pro pro or extremely saavy person , couldn't even notice or care . besides , ca this lens orders magnitude less than almost any other lens . 4 ) i bought directly amazon . ordered monday got lens next day tuesday . amazing service . great store .	1
since there tons rave reviews features this camera , i won't bother you details . instead , i tell you one huge letdown this camera likes ( rebel , 20d ): 1.6 focal length factor . this means my dear 28-105 lens now sorry 45-170 . recoup loss i'd spend $700 17-40 4.0 lens . this consequence using small ccd . cameras like 1d full-size 35mm ccd sell over $ 4,000 . i cannot wait price go down . i also cannot help wonder whether focal reading speedlite flashes correct ( i own 540ez discovered dismay it doesn't work these cameras ) . i look my a2 ( still infatuated it ) i wonder if i right thing . i think i keep it around while , just case ..	1
i am not most experienced photographer , but this camera takes terrific pictures , my opinion . nice big lcd screen touch screen great feature	1
i gave this my wife her birthday , so far no complaints all . camera plenty functions you play , but it also work point shoot situations . good quality pictures , it looks feels top notch	1
if your camera spends any amount time connected your computer -- either copying pictures , or using remote capture program -- you should this ac adapter . it also obviously handy if you lot shooting fixed location -- instance : tripod . adaptor ingenious little contraption . there normal ac line runs power adapter , but instead running dc output dedicated jack camera body , connector shape normal battery pack . if you look closely your camera , you see little grove bottom battery compartment providing enough room wire exit . now surprise . i'm planning trip europe . i knew battery charger came camera , this ac adapter both support 100-240 volts ac , 50-60 hz input . which covers all worlds power supplies . but battery charger included camera only came us power cord . i've looking various european cords would fit charger so i could keep my batteries topped off overseas . what should i find when i open box this adaptor ? complete collection all worlds cords , which also happen fit charger . what win , now i run my camera ac , stay charged while i'm vacation	1
nikon d50 absolutely fantastic camera . if you moving point shoot , you jump completely new leage photography . pros : 1 . noise extremely low iso 800 , highly usable 1600.2 . camera control good , you get 2.5 frame per second , more than enough non-professionals . 3 . flash sync 1/500 sec , one best market . 4 . image quality ( iq ) excellent . cons : 1 . lcd screen small . 2 . top lcd no back light . 3 . no depth field review button . regards , csoura	1
i rated accessory kit 3 well . gave kit 3 3 star . i gave kit 2 my mom who just got sd550 . great camera what i tell . this kit however needs major improvements . going best kit 2 , worst it , we starting review battery pack . battery ... uhhh , not much say here . spare battery use hot spare out there if your running low after taking too many shots . mine kit 3 great i still use it this day . i swap active battery each time i charge . this what gave this product many stars i given it . final decision ( battery ): wonderfulneck strap ... ( taken kit 3 added improvements)if your moving around this thing way long or way short . it too short strap across you chest . it way long because if it hangs front you , your precious camera you just paid couple few hundred now freely bouncing around . not good . my mom really short this just too short her use well . not much bouncing issue me but still not useful enough her . her comment , " this strap either too short or too long . doesn't fit me all . " cracks me up because i never told her my personal opinion matter she came up same results . final decision ( neck strap ): use it jump drive you use often or anything else . just not your precious camera . case ... they screwed up kit 3 , this kit still screwed up ( managed even worse than kit 3 ) . velcro fine most usage so i can't knock . belt clip fine dandy . case pretty darn good keeping camera safe outside elements harm . hole center useless heck just like kit 3 ( mom came same conclusion ) . here where they really screwed up . stitching this case worse than kit 3 . kit 3 , you only worry stitching screwing up your screen back case . this case , you stiching back front . unlike kit 3 which magnetic clasp where stitching or any attachment case hidden behind soft cloth , this one velcro stitching inside front . belt clasp stiching other side . no escape this kit . i highly advise you get screen protector if using this case . poor design shame people who manufacture this case . final decision ( case ): " move people ... nothing see here . " seriously ... don't bother using this case without screen protector . complete decision : i wouldn't buy this kit again all . it great there extra battery but i don't think anything else worth penny more this kit . better off buying everything seprate . going lower my rating 2 stars	-1
i extremely impressed this camera ; i felt only not exceptional feature its nonwithstanding aptitude steady shots . other than , i felt it fantastic , exceeded all expectations	1
it looks good takes great pics ease use good film camer	1
filters just expected . high enough quality optics price , one better deals consumers looking enjoy range photo they give you . great value . just try find something comparable without spending ton more cash	1
i bought this camera ( canon a460 ) second camera looking pocket-sized , compact , digital camera zoom video capabilities , took aa batteries priced reasonably cheap [ ... ] canon powershot a460 all . it small enough fit into your palm fits into front pants pocket easily light enough camera not really noticeable after few minutes . it seems me canon designed it carried without camera case because there lens shield pulls into place cover lens whenever it powered off . ( lens retracts into camera body when it powered off , lens cover pulls into place automatically ) . body well rounded no sharp edges anywhere might catch parts clothing . lcd screen exposed but i pasted one those see-thru lcd screen plastic protectors ( sticky one side ) it protect it scratches . all camera openings well protected covers . only cover i thought little more play than it should battery cover . camera powers up extremely quickly . you focus either viewfinder or lcd screen . one thing surprised me when using viewfinder , there no information shown viewfinder other than green light indicate camera focus or blinking orange light indicate it not . lcd mode shows lot more info ( eg , iso speed , current resolution , etc ) . but , i guess it makes sense since this camera meant simple , what could simpler than knowing when something focus or not . that pretty much all info that needed . ( switching viewfinder conserve battery power ) . i bought 2gb kingston secure digital card $13 amazon this camera so there plenty space . card removed put into sd card reader comes most modern computers laptops . ( my laptop , toshiba tecra a5 it , it bought 2 years ago ) . computer recognize sd memory card extra drive , transfer rate extremely fast . if your computer not sd card reader , then usb connector used transfer images your computer instead . video mode , zoom works only when highest video resolution ( 640 480 ) . ( this surprise me too . my canon powershot s1 , zoom works all video resolutions ) . video little more choppy compared canon s1 . there no dedicated zoom lever . two buttons normally used menu navigation also serve zoom controls . ( canon s1 ( my other camera ) dedicated zoom lever , which nice ) . i guess , one reasons reusing buttons zooming more compact design -- no lever sticking out might catch your clothing ) . once i got used it , i not any problems using 2 buttons zooming . pictures taken usual canon quality . you pay attention make sure your hands not shaking when you press shutter since there no image stabilizer ( i've gotten spoilt canon powershot s1 which image stabilizer ) . [ ... ] buttons camera designed placed so you could operate camera only right hand if so desired . left hand used just stabilize steady camera . this camera uses focus beam light helps it focus quickly much lauded digic ii processor . both technological improvements over canon powershot s1 which not autofocus light only digic i processor . camera uses aa batteries ( either rechargable or normal type work ) . easily available power important feature me . i very pleased super macro capability this camera , which allows extreme close ups . access this mode , you set camera " " ( manual mode ) dial , then press func/set button . this open up menu where you set camera " super macro " . [ ... ] this camera ( canon a460 ) " scn " mode which you choose different scenes ( portrait , night , kids , pets , indoors , foliage , snow , beach ) . i've used " snow " scene setting my pictures came out great when i'm skiing taking pictures . ( access scene setting , turn dial " scn " then press func/set button , which bring up menu allows you choose settings ) . i'm really enjoying canon a460 it filled its role my camera arsenal admirably . i needed camera i could take me when i'm skiing or snowboarding light small cheap . it fits into my pants pocket pretty light it not interfere my balance , etc . ( canon s1 , though great camera , little too large fit into my pants pocket or fanny pack . however , it still my preferred camera when i'm able camera case or back pack me . ) update ( 4/11/2007)--i've this camera 2 months now accidentally dropped it twice 2 3 feet onto hard surface floor . also , dropped it into foot snow while skiing using video . camera still working flawlessly .	1
first off , let me make it clear i am satisfied this camera . i it 8 months now i put it through its paces its held up fine . but there few things you must know : camera no zoom . i mean , practically no zoom . 2.2 may look decent but its pointless any real-life situation . you find yourself moving lot your camera get better shot , not standing one place using zoom feature . you never get close wide shot - its just not possible this camera . this camera great average stills but that it . you click twice take picture or " press halfway then fully " according manual . this major pain . sometimes when battery weak , it may take lot time take picture ( lot frustration ) , so this not cam capture any special pictures or " kodak moments " . apart these cons , camera great value money offers video all kinds stuff . if you're looking mostly looking take landscape or portrait stills , this camera good job	1
video camera without light like still camera without flash -- if your sony camcorder doesn't come light built , you need this ! couple notes : this light much smaller than i'd expected -- it only 1 " across front 1.5 " high 1.5 " deep . it doesn't sound like much , but it puts out remarkable amount light , enough illuminate out your subject even , warm light , even nearly 10 ' away . reason i can't give it 5 stars : it puts out lot heat , it cut your battery life half ( i've got hdr-sr1 ) . both these issues would readily addressed sony providing led version this light , but until they , i don't think any other accessory could possibly give your videos bang-for-buck this one	1
excellent camera . i digital rebel xl wanted smaller high quality camera hiking , etc . i am very pleased . it not slick rebel smaller lens not match - but shots more than adequate . it few very sweet aspects - one wysiwyg aspect half shutter depression - very good questionable lighting situation which i tend find myself . slight advantage too , works well . overall i am pleased	1
compartments range open areas camera accessories . also netted areas extra cd , remote , etc . good look extra carrying straps , included	1
i purchased olympus 720 my daughter christmas time because we all scuba divers family there housing option well able go 10ft without housing . we recently went bonaire both camera housing worked well considering she not strobe . she able capture little squid night dive just camera housing . i highly recomend ease use quality constrction housing also took beating surf . great those us wish point click lot lighter smaller than my ikelite	1
camera works great . it easy use , takes wonderfull pictures . image quality very nice , range focal length great too . i two issues it . it not perform well low light situations(inside dark rooms ) it tough autofocus . also , it goes through batteries like crazy . i would recomend getting set rechargable batteries , it well worth it after 3 or 4 days using camera all day	1
this my first digital camera so i can't compare others . however , i'm not someone who needs top line model , i thought price could not beat . i found controls fairly easy learn " quickstart " guide came camera . downloading computer also simple . i not try software which came camera i not deem it necessary transfer photos my computer . if you use windows xp it automatically detect camera . ( other reviewers believe software not up par however ) . i took many photos highest megapixel setting ( average picture 1.4 mb ) so they could printed out ( no larger than 4x6 prints recommended ) . if larger prints important , higher mexapixel camera might order . viewing online-only , lowest setting looks very good . it compact size means it fits comfortably small bag weighs nothing . recommended you purchase camera case separately well nimh battery charger . also , purchased 1g memory card separately . flash take while recharge shots , but this not problem me	1
i am accustomed using larger point shoot zoom . this sleek pocket sized point shoot gives exceptionally sharp pictures . it focuses very swiftly i would suppose due leica lense . battery life good . i notice photos tend calibrate little blue range . i like little more zoom . overall , i like it very much	1
i recently purchased this product replace my li-10b battery my olympus camedia camera . it seems hold charge better than original battery ever works well camera . i've only using it several weeks so only time tell how well it lasts	1
i love vista frame so much , i've just ordered 3 more family gifts . all original problems listed reviews fixed manufacturer . if frame goes into sleep mode ( overnight when no motion sensed ) , it wakes up goes right back into slideshow mode without restart menu buttons . color great photos viewable all angles . i haven't experienced any flickering problems . my digital camera allows me upload photos my pc hardrive onto compact flash card so i able create cards different groups pictures different family members . this digital frame would make excellent gift	1
people love macro photography , this item must . great definition , detail sharp image result you gonna get this lens . able play dimension focusing part element or object background out focus , it super ! if you undecided , go it ! i guarantee professional results	1
lot people talking issues delay after you take pic . flash , but it really only bothers me if i'm big rush . so you might not wanna get this camera if your either realllly impatient or just always big rush ! people also mentioned pictures always blurry . i never get blurry pictures except when i'm not using flash . pictures usually come out great ! red-eye remover works pretty good this camera , but night visions stuff dont really work , but if its dark you just use flash . i love this camera ! i would deffinitley reccomend rechargable batteries because this camera eats them up pretty quickly but rechargable ones last long time ! hope this helped !	1
i purchased 3 these christmas presents 3 teenagers my home . cameras very well received . kids loved them recorded took photos everything under sun ! they b-l-a-s-t these ! however , before year up , door holds batteries camera broke every single one them ( i purchased 3 -- that over $300 down tubes ) , even " mild child " . too bad construction wasn't better :o	-1
items deilivered very fast ( 3 days instead 5 9 days stated	1
pros : 1 . great video quality good great light . colors " punchy " . 2 . doubles still camera . even though still quality not great , it could still come handy . 3 . down-conversion standard definition seems pretty good . easily record hi-def dvd using down-converted digital connection camera dvd recorder . 4 . handling seems good . size camera fairly small . it amazing what they pack into things this size . 5 . uses hdv format minidv tapes . cons : 1 . usb interface not usb 2.0 ! this 2007 ! downloading still photos takes much longer than it should . i don't intend buy proprietary memory card reader . 2 . uses sony proprietary memory . 3 . still camera functions mediocre . probably equivalent today $200 less digital still cameras . i canon 20d digital slr difference quite clear ! sony still photos noisier just not good looking . flash photos low light poor fair . 4 . don't like menu system . seems harder use than it should . neutrals : 1 . fair battery life included battery . 2 . video quality low-light could better , but it not poor . i'd say it fair . 3 . audio good but it picks up camera motor noise bit annoying . it mic jack though	1
this good solid camera if you use it well it provide you good pictures . it bit heavy compared other digital compact cameras but it solid functional . easy menu good lens	1
i just got this last week quality photos excellent ! videos really good well ! no complaints so far . this perfect point-and-shoot folks but then camera features whole lot more if you want get creative . just careful buying sd cards larger than 2gb , but just make sure sd card ' sdhc ' stamped it . i made mistake buying regular 4gb sd card it not work camera . good thing sd card worked my nikon d50 . live learn	1
no need convert anymore . you just hook up usb cable drag clips camcorder comoputer . save lots time	1
this easy thing use u print your pictures no problem easy replace ink paper	1
strengths : 1 . great price . 2 . very good picture quality . 3 . excellent low light capabilities . 4 . excellent auto-focus . 5 . excellent zoom range control . 6 . small light . 7 . small compact . weaknesses : 1 . ok , internal mic . low audio output . 2 . no true 16x9 mode . 16x9 squeeze mode reduces quality . summary : i used this camera three shoots so far it continues surprise impress me . money its excellent deal . image quality comparable its big brother ag-dvx100 . didn't think night modes would usefull but they produce some very artistic shots bw . my only disappointment no true 16x9 mode . 16x9 modes they reduces image quality noticably . i would definitely recommend external mic . i use rode video mic ... very sensitive but comparable more expensive shotguns . also , wide angle lens must . raynox hd-6600 excellent lens price it produces great soft focus effect long end zoom range . also libec zoom controller works great camera creative shots check out new manfrotto fig rig .	1
while i've used other peoples digital cameras before , i never one my own until now . i'm very happy i read most reviews e900 purchased it . i've owned used it since first year i haven't tested all features yet but i very happy it so far .	1
i olympus 770 sw ( not 720 sw ) , sure ... i like it . i five digital cameras before , this one terrific . considering it sub-compact pocket camera , image quality fine ( not equal digital slr , but i don't want carry around big box like dslr ) . shadow detail especially impressive . operation smooth intuitive . screen fine , even outdoors . shutter lag , big concern mine i like photograph my kids sports , minimal zero if you prefocus . number custom scene settings impressive . i bought it because waterproofing shockproofing , because prior good experience olympus over years , but i'm just happy pictures it takes under normal circumstances too . few gripes stop me giving camera 5 stars : 1 . battery cannot recharged when it camera . total $80 or so , you get external power source cable , together they let camera run long time without draining battery , but they don't charge battery . battery life fine day normal shooting , but if you use camera actively , every single night you pretty much unlock case , take out battery charge it , then remember put battery back next day . each charge takes 5 hours . i'm going take same $80 instead buy two extra batteries comfortable -- one camera , one reserve me , charging home . even so , it take some planning thinking keep batteries ready all time vacation . it would much nicer holster or charging socket case . 2 . case actually smaller than it needs . it could significantly bigger still fit my shirt pocket , which my standard size requirement . it , advanced engineering impressive pack all features tiny box , but camera more expensive than need , lens smaller than it should ( depending zoom position , lens f/ 3.5 f/ 5.0 , which pretty weak ) , it harder hold camera than need , if case bigger , there would room nice little charging socket too . 3 . there indeed background , almost mechanical noise introduced when filming videos . it probably filtered out , it very constant very low pitched , but it mildly annoying . 4 . time shots too long -- it takes several seconds save each shot full resolution . 5 . you use internal memory only if there no memory card slot . given slow transfer speed card , it sure would nice able save dozen or so shots very quickly internal memory then transfer them memory when you time . all , though , i'm really looking forward using this camera forthcoming sea kayaking snorkeling trip this summer . one camera , i'll able take snapshots above below water , also modest videos underwater ( there special scene selection just )	1
great product , even better price !! i'm thrilled quality ease use . i love it ! great birding , recommend very highly !!	1

i bought these my boyfriend so he could use them watch everything shore birds stars , they perfect . this great product , you see anything these binoculars focusing very easy . take little getting used weight , but they great , much more flexible alternative telescope , so price	1
i get bandwagon here . this superb little camera , definately five stars ! i also tz1 , which showed promise , but limitations . my review tz1 , i noted it lots " noise " pictures shouldn't printed much beyond 4x6 inches if they sharp . i also wanted more manual controls . tz3 fixes improves almost everything tz1 adds some new , very useful features . noise drastically reduced , lens better , sensor bigger , processor not only faster , but produces better pictures . tz3 adds very handy " function " button - or i should say function capability - number buttons same - which gives immediate access five or so " most used " settings without go into menues - which there several . tz3 keeps mega optical image stabilization adds intelligent iso , increases sensitivity without adding noise , ( i not tried 3200 setting yet . ) , increases size viewing screen , etc ., etc . tz3 " well-rounded , " very capable camera . there simply no comparison tz1 tz3 far quality pictures . tz3 wins hands down . my opinion it also beats some big name , higher priced digicams - couple which i own - rather handily . course , big selling point tz3 still 10x lens - now wide angle capability - pocket-sized point shoot camera . this lens sharp , combined larger sensor new processor yields some excellent results . while there no manual controls , per se , camera seems very well without them . pictures sharp , exposures seem nicely ( haven't tried it night yet , but low light forrest shots excellent ) , colors accurate , appropriately saturated , vivid ( ok . i like vivid setting . ) , good contrast , etc . there variety af settings , settable focal points , focus modes . there also exposure compensation , exposure bracketing available - they work well ! live histogram welcome bonus . tz3 focuses down 2 inches macro mode - again excellent , sharp results . tz3 very well speced out . one nice thing gone lens cap tz1 . it really not inconvenient , but seemed always swinging wind add yet source camera shake . tz3 lens includes built lens cover . very welcome . i currently own five top flight digicams ( including this one ) , owned many others , i am most impressed this one - combined convenience results . it quantum step forward . i also couple quite nice , fairly complete dslr kits . they wonderful , class themselves , but when i want very nice pictures convenience pocketable point shoot 10x , wide angle lens , or back up dslrs , tz3 now my camera choice .	1

i won't comment camcorder itself . it great , it fulfills all needs i . only problem came when i upgraded my computer ( i forced , not voluntary move ) vista . not single item bundled software compatible vista , starting usb driver . april 24th , panasonic doesn't even provide eta delivery upgraded drivers . just remember it before you purchase it . piece hardware over $1000 , you expect full functionality your environment	1
same battery came w/ my canon sd550 . works great , never problem	1
perfect fit my sd500 cheapest one i found internet .	1
this camcorder bought september 2005 still working well . i talking film class didn't want hassle borrowing my school $1000+ camcorder . knowing full well canon sony , especially sony , would best camcorder people wanting their shots look professional , i looked amazon circuit city see reviews . i went into stereo advantage well , walked out jvc due fact it little less expensive then some other camcorders . so , advantages disadvantages : advantages : 1 ) it pretty decent low light . it light it this help . 2 ) i never noticed motor noise mostly because when i film stuff edit it my powerbook final cut , i usually add music . i read reviews motor noises but i guess if there complete silence room , you'll hear it . 3 ) firewire cable av cables easy find connect . 4 ) easy hold . disadvantages : 1 ) firewire not come camcorder . you'll buy this separate . best place find firewire cables online ( amazon , ebay ) . you'll play way too much stores . ** way , if you don't know what firewire here what it . mac computers almost always come firewire outlet , just like pcs come usb outlets . pcs , you buy firewire card insert it your pc . purpose firewire transfer video your camcorder onto your computer . usb plugs(which comes this camcorder ) just transfer photos . 2 ) taking pictures this camcorder not turn out good all . i would stick digital camera instead . 3 ) battery horrible . it lasts like 50 minutes fully charged . i plan buying one .	1
i bit concerned buying " aftermarket " equivalent but i very wrong . this battery performs 100% like canon brand . you won't dissappointed	1

this battery definitely good buy . it last long time ...	1
i see no difference all my original panasonic battery one lenmar . excellent price/value ratio	1
i think it great amazon carrying this product . price right this great solution hiding a/v components . i used it my wow ! cable box behind my wall , mounted eye just below my bose center channel speaker . i 42 " panasonic plasma display , mounting eye behind display not work recommended . it needs clear sight remote control when use . i also purchased terk leapfrog radio shack version leapfrog , they both horrible . i looking wireless solution this not way go . these products also worked , but range not advertised quite poor ( less than 5 feet away my remote control ) . i highly recommend microsmith do-it-yourselfer	1
my wife i went our first cruise i wanted camera would take video still pictures . after wearing out internet , i finally selected panasonic pv-gs150 . i amazed number passengers board same camera ! i couldn't happier results this camera . color reproduction fantastic ! i used it alot different applications such ; daylight , night shots , even sunsets . it great job ! still shots ok . more light you better picture . flash awesome ! so many digital cameras weak flash compared this camera . but keep mind your priorities . my first priority video , then still shots . i don't think you disappointed	1
we used fuji their menus so no intuitive all . i think kodak line best menus sony cameras best lcds . but overall picture quality go canon line . we sd400 there no complaints all . menus easy follow lcd little smaller than we wanted , but it still takes great picture . color swap feature cool advantage	1
great little camera . i also dmc-fz30 , this one almost many features much smaller , less expensive camera . hard beat	1
i tried digital . i really . but i could never get really gorgeous shots i got my old yashica slr which gave up ghost several years back . i also could not really " focus " what i shooting ... just pointed shot because there no film run out . result ? pointless pics weren't even good looking . digital just didn't feel " right . " so 8 months ago i decided go back film . what get ? after much research , i finally decided canon t2 . absolutely brilliant camera . my favorite feature ? i let camera handle focus , etc . or i go completely manual . may not seem like big deal , but it feels so good control what camera when you want . course , means letting your imagination go ... something sorely lacking digital . couldn't happier no more pointless pics . okay , maybe few , but they still look good . isn't point	1
i am very pleased this camera .... i yet use it 10 feet under water but maybe someday ... i love compact durability this camera . picture quailty excellent !!! very happy photographer	1
first one i got amazon wouldn't hold charge , but they sent replacement within couple days no hassle or grief ! yay amazon111the unit exactly what it supposed , so reasonable clarity . keep mind pictures relatively small , so closer you take picture better you able see it screen . make sure your focus money you not disappointed . great way show off children grandchildren	1
actually this not any perticular camera i want . i just bought it because average customer rating five star this only cool camera i could afford . i still like it , because this my very first own camera . i've even ask accsesories my birthday ! few scratches , but that only because i made them . when i put battery , everything fuctioned normally , even though i no film . least buy olympus camera	1
i've seen some bad digital frames- ones stretch out picture , making everyone look fat , or dim displays bad color . philips frame absolutely opposite : it delightfully easy use picture quality great . pictures automatically sized , cropped , even rotated when you turn frame . i didn't need software they included . i just dumped pile pictures cf card ( using my camera wired computer ) then plugged card into frame . menus frame navigated little joystick back . it not nicest menu system , but i got hang it pretty quickly . if you buying this grandma ( course ) here tip : buy two memory cards so you switch photo albums when you visit	1
we received closeup lens without problem . installs perfectly connector our sony camera . it everything we wanted , very simple effective , although one move camera bit focus function camera get perfect image	1
works great ; lets me recharge my casio camera without use dock which really important when i'm traveling . quick recharge time deep cycling battery . recommended .	1
this camera great . it small sleek , fits your pocket , looks nice too . it turns extremely quickly , snaps pictures faster then any other digital camera i've seen . if you're looking camera thats ready shoot moments notice , this one you . it variety preset modes various conditions , most them work fairly well . battery life decent , if you need more you purchase additional batteries only ten dollars amazon . it uses standard sd memory card which very low cost , comparison other typed memory cards . far cons go , only one occasionally pictures come out darker then you would like when using auto mode . this tends happen occasionally indoors , fixed choosing appropriate mode . however this occurrence rare , easily made up speed camera takes pictures . thing i found strange fact default , auto focus assist light constantly when taking video , leaving green light center video you shoot . however , this turned off options menu . overall , this my opinion best camera you get this price range	1
i bought three batteries , they all good state . i once bought rather cheap batteries ebay . they all made china , terrible . they didn't last five shots . but this time they original japan made works great .	1
i've purchased other bags but this one beats all it great price	1
very clear , bright day , strong magnification quality seems good . very well priced around $100.00 . i know more over passage time . my firstimpression good mj schra	1
i just received my camera 2 days ago immediately i began test it . it very nice it feels very nice hold . i like zoom stops when it reaches maximum optical zoom ( if you keep pressed 1 second it go digital zoom ) . battery last more than 200 shots which not bad all . it charges less than 2 hours . quality pics excellent . please read manual so you obtain professional photos	1
i've always kodak camera this one really nice . it takes crystal clear pictures i couldn't happier it . i haven't any problems using it am very pleased my purchase	1
lens adapter works fine . i think there should some link additional lenses ; it must purchase when you order optional lenses . i bought wide angle lens thinking it would fit camera , later discovering i should ordered adapter	1
this little camera great capturing wonderful moments my little boy growing up . i love i carry it my pocket or purse never miss anything . video quality awesome too ! i agree pp flash mess up some pictures subjects move after first flash , but it minor glitch . i'm so happy this camera . i've really enjoyed red-eye reduction mode camera . makes editing lot quicker	1
everything this camera amazing me . i originally read there problem this model camcorder screen blanking out after 1 or 2 years use . i haven't seen any signs happening so far . i love this . college kid it gets banged up occasion , but my sony seems held up challenge . buy this camcorder	1
this camera perfect people who record family events once or twice per year need things foolproof . this thing wonderful casual recording , though you'll definitely want multi-pack dvds , since limited time make changing discs constant event . you can't really edit these easily , but you could probably stitch bunch clips together make one long movie . only downside , other than basicness features , you occasionally hear dvd spinning . it kind wobbling sound , but it common lot dvd camcorders , i guess . so , if you're casual video jockey , teenage girl looking way make naughty videos her captain football team boyfriend , or lonely fat guy wanting make special show lady across street ... this camera you . if you want super video professional oliver stone movie director extraordinaire ? spend more money , you cheap goon	1
use this my bogen monopod . sofar so good . this i take vertical shot not limited just horizontal . very light easy use	1
i'm not sure any other reviewers gave this bad rating clue what they doing . 1 . li-on not memory , discharging them fully detrimental batteries life ! you should place them into charger before they discharge fully ! 2 . li-on light weight , not because cheap , but because they not contain heavy metals their construction . hey , if you need weight think it quality battery , buy nice lead acid lug around ! 3 . professionals waiting li-on make leap camcorders cameras ( but common form factor , like cr-v3 ) . li-on better than ni-mh , ni-mh better than ni-cad , ni-cad better than lead acid ... battery evolution . 4 . i'm not giving them 5 stars because i feel price they could better charge . 1200mah vs . 1500 or better . but i'm still getting much better performance over my old ni-mh , seemed lose it charge if left overnight camera . real bummer when trying complete shot limited light	1
i only used camera once date , but it simple use , small size great , large screen super , features great camera its price range , pictures good or better than i expected	1
i work professional photofinishing lab , i attest quality film inside this camera . kodak water sport camera provides excellent results both out water . it performs comparably kodak hq max versatility camera ; it produces high-quality image most situations . there no flash camera ( though using flash underwater produce unpredictable sometimes undesirable effects ) , so not plan using it low-light situations . film not like get wet , accidentally dropping your camera water could mean all pictures you just took lost forever . so even if you don't plan taking your camera physically underwater your family boating expedition , you might still want consider purchasing water sport camera insurance against " splash damage " . if you need flash , or if you plan take pictures depths greater than 50 feet , you'll need consider professional underwater camera or camera housing	1
i love size style this little camera bag . it only single compartment shoulder strap nice long . long enough use around waist fanny pack . bag itself isn't padded inside it rather stiff . tight fit my camera , but good protection i think . i just wanted keep my camera getting scratched up this trick nicely	1
adapter works easily , snapping off seconds . it large but very lightweight . my complaint this simply piece plastic which could not cost canon more than 10 cents . shame canon charging close $20 rather than including it camera free	1
there isn't too much you say this product because its just adapter . i ordered it my a520 it fits just fine i no problem attaching filters it .	1
i always slr photographer held off purchasing digital camera up until now because i not convinced resolution capabilities digital . i travel alot sometimes due space sometimes due desire inconspicuous i needed something smaller than my full size slrs . after lot research , looking every model i could find , i settled this panasonic lumix lx2 because i don't give up control over every aspect photo . this camera lets you control freak , or you leave it one several automatic modes . it store pictures raw mode , which important me ( canon g7 lost out because it didnt this ) but jpeg mode great . i blown up some prints this camera i am completely satisfied quality , i skeptical before , expecting underwhelmed . i originally bought this backup my slrs but i already see this my primary camera unless i am situation calls special lens , flash power , or super high resolution ( like 25 or 60 asa)my only suggestion panasonic would allow you charge battery while camera , like car charger , make some sort accomodation external flash . flash this camera weak spot - it really not bad size but if it could sync external flash would good	1
there 1000+ reviews this lens . i am going put my openions only : first , pros : 1 . versatile . 2 . effective vr . 3 . 11x zoom4 . sharp images . 5 . quick quit focus . cons : 1 . expensive . 2 . bit heavy . 3 . suffer some distortion . 4 . f/ 3.5 , i wish it 2.8 . overall , i am very happy this lens , if you like me , who carry only one lens everything , you not go wrong this lens	1
yeah , knobs may plastic , it may lightweight , but it works perfectly . it work well time lapse long you use shutter delay or remote(which you should anyway ) . it folds up very compact size you would more willing bring it you . i lost my shoe well , cant find replacement , so im buying new tripod . i paid good 40-50$ it 2 years ago local retailer , so 13$ what i hoping pay quick release shoe	1
if you looking cheap camera higher res . then here it . like i said , you get what you pay	1
this product what it says . i use camera adapter attach my canon eos-30d	1
this case works well camera , but elastic straps releasing flash significant design error . placing camera lens facing back case works much better . belt loop only measures 1.25 inches effectively , so it not work all belts . all all , case protect camera , which why i bought it	1
well this item amazing ... opinion every body should buy one them if you looking night vision monocular	1
i previously owned sd500 , looking better features such larger screen , wider zoon , higer iso speed , etc . found sd750 , i own it now . wow , it very nice design body , slimmer than sd500 . huge 3 " lcd screen , color display screen near original(not just my feel , also few other friends said so ) . use dial technology similiar ipod dial switch shoot modes , but you may take some time get used it . 3x optical 35-105mm zoom better than sd500 , but i wish it go wider 28mm like sd800 . sd750 digic iii processor . use sdhc card but i hear it may cause bottleneck , so i continue using 2gb highspeed hold over 600 pics highest setting . movie shooting great even inside restaurant night time . it also record your voice each picture . battary life not good sd500 . but it still takes 150 pictures full charge . recommend backup when you go traveling . no complaint 3 " lcd . oh , one good feature this camera it easy button review pictures , press shutter return shooting mode . this way better than sd500 . it one best so far . highly recommend if you looking compact , easy-use camera take quality pictures . good luck . added : this just my own preference , i silver version . i like this version better than black version , unless canon makes whole camera body black . feature i use this camera : i set folder created daily base , instead seeing picture property picture day , it groups all pictures took same day one folder	1
i recently ordered sony vct870rm tripod w/ remote my sony camcorder . it arrived few days i very pleased product . i'm glad i spent extra money variable zoom this model tripod plus it seems made little better then next lower model . i please purchase all around . nice job no complaints	1
camcorder very good quailty , but i find it some place cheaper bag , many other asserires . return very easy smooth , i thank you amazon.com maken ' happen ! i would order you again . a.m.h	1
i wanted good quality consumer grade digital camera take short trips , so i purchased this one . i think quality picures very good it most features i wanted . it few dollars more than i really wanted spend , but all all i am pleased . my main complaint battery life little short side , it takes while see photo you just took lcd screen . i really want something hold me two years , then these things twice good fraction cost . now it what i need it pretty well	1
i purchased kodak p20 zoom flash use my kodak p850 camera . money spent worth it i great results using this flash attachment ; , it easy use whether atuomatic or manual mode .	1
i came off canon powershot s40 , little 4-megapixel brick camera gave me 4 years excellent results . my first digital camera after closet-full film nikons . many buffs claim 4 megapixels all you need , i made number nice looking a3 prints . now i 7 megapixels work , i see i wrong : four not enough . seven wonderful . [ ... ] points out strongly above iso 200 noise real problem -- but you always wonder just how picky they . well not too picky this case . using higher than 200 setting ( i.e. , most indoor flash shots ) resulted lot noise , making camera almost unusable except simplest 4 6 snapshots . but i take almost entirely outdoor shots -- scenics candids . i set iso 100 get gorgeous results . it taken some getting used different color rendition tz3 my canon . canon seems more balanced while tz3 caused reddish orange really pop out . there something cool ( color temperature-wise , not " fashionable " ) color not entirely fixed photoshop . sometimes results marvelous , especially shots cloudy or rainy days . other times they not so grea t--t o desaturated my taste . so i playing around various settings --" natural " " vivid . " " vivid " closer what i want right out camera , but less easy spruce up . " natural " easier modify , so setting i am using now . i also set exposure compensation one stop under . i pleasantly surprised how small tz3 : it slips easily into pants pocket ( but not shirt pocket ) . zoom lens starting decent wide-angle ( 28mm ) utterly fantastic really makes camera stand out head shoulders pack . thus , i am delighted choice . however , answer my question " what more could i want ? " , here it : 1 . selection disk always moves when i pocket camera , so i always check , when i pull it out , reset it desired setting . its detents need strengthened . 2 . back-side controls too easy activate accidentally when shooting one-handed fleshy part thumb . headache because you then need press " select " get back operation . 3 . dpreview right when they moan venus iii sensor . it good but , otherwise sensational camera like this one , not good enough	1
i ordered battery charger friday night it monday or tuesday . charged little time . recorded video several times several pic . still haven't recharge yet	1
i bought this frame display pictures my newborn daughter my desk work . i didn't really high expectations it , because it so inexpensive . soon it turned i following problems : 1 ) five seconds after i turn it , it always says " usb connected ! " -- i don't usb cable inserted into it ! this also freezes device . i found way around this selecting memory card read within this initial 5 seconds or turning frame without any memory cards inserted . 2 ) i cannot copy files over it described pages 33-35 manual . my computer recognize usb device , but when i try copy files over frame , i get " path not found " error . 3 ) i thought i could live above 2 problems if it could just show my pictures . so i used card reader load . jpg files onto cf card 400x300 resolution . when , i plugged card into frame , these files show up " invalid " when i try view them . emailed coby 3 bullet points above , got response 30 hours later saying : " coby tech support me 5:25 am ( 3 hours ago ) hello , we received your inquiry . it appears your unit defective . return unit retailer exchange . " what inconvenience disappointment . i buying different product	-1
i mixed feelings this case . it pretty nice , but not exactly what i need or expected . it lot smaller than i envisioned . i just get my lumix fz50 it little charger , extra battery , cables , remote release . it 3 net pockets 1 zipper pocket , all tiny side . they big enough extra memory card or two , but not much more . i can't fit camera manual any them . it says " panasonic " front , not " lumix " like picture shows - not big deal . when i get couple conversion lenses ac adapter , i need something lot bigger . traveling light , this one handy , but it isn't complete transportation solution , any means	1
just took two week vacation , took my binoculars . binoculars very compact ( easy pack ) very clear view zoom feature stellar , saw mule deer using 8 power , 16 gave me closer view 24 gave me perfect rack view . all all , binoculars even better my purposes than i expected ) very satisfied !!!	1
after exhaustive research many lens , i finally decided plunk down $500+ ( time this written ) purchase this lens . it may not best market but it compliments my nikon 18-70mm dx lens nicely . i looking towards nikon 18-200mm dx lens , however ; price pushed me choose this one ( it nearly half price my two lens nearly cover all range one 18-200mm ) . quality/weight : build quality cheap yet sturdy ... plastic little chinky but cuts down weight . my nikon d200 no problem handling lens weight , however ; i heard ( unconfirmed ) reports this lens little heavy lighter cameras ( d80 , d70 , d40 , etc ) . ring connector metal rubber gasket outside so provide minor protection ( lens mount ) elements . you also keep this mind , when discussing weight , quality price ; bulk price this lens going into glass elements ( all 17 elements them ) . it gets expensive when you place many high-quality optics into tube . i'm really not surprised price , although $400 price-range would probably more suitable this lensfocusing/lens attributes : focusing quite fast ... times . you'll find , max 300mm focal range , lens pretty hard time auto-focusing subject . times it would focus pretty quick , 300mm range , while others it cannot focus all . you get around this quirk bringing subject into near focus ( manually ) then letting auto-focus take over ; it works every time . i find this focus problem disappointing especially given price this lens . quality bokeh ( out focus areas photograph ) very nice pleasing . images sharp , vignetting ( dark areas corner your photos ) hard find lens flare rarely problem . vibration stabilization : all i say it works ... it come handy . it not going stop image guaranteed you ; it only meant slow down rate which camera moves ( vibration holding ) . you notice difference ; it off you'll see image ( say 300mm ) really bouncing around ; then you flick vr . it takes sec or two but then image smooths out , it still wobbles around , but much more slowly . vr enabled , you usually go 2-3 ( sometimes 4 ) stops down , then what you'd normally able when hand holding . " shock " test : i haven't " shock tested " my lens yet ( ie dropped it ) but i heard ( again unconfirmed reports here ) it holds up pretty well drop ... although i would never recommend testing out . important note : 70-300mm range should noted : although lens states it 70-300mm zoom , this lens intended 35mm camera or full-frame ccd/cmos sensor digital camera . all ( or least majority ) nikon dslr ( d200 , d80 , etc ) not full-frame sensors . they approximately 1.5 factor full-frame sensor ( due smaller sensor size ) . what this all mean ? well it simple , since this 35mm lens not dx lens ( ie built account 1.5 factor most nikon digitals ) you apply 1.5 conversion . this means nikon 70-300mm nikon dslr give apparent zoom equivalent 105-450mm lens . i actually not mind this apparent zoom this should also cut down vignetting ; what lens projects onto sensor larger then area sensor itself . short : parts image spills over sensor , since this lens meant project onto full-frame sensor/35mm film . conclusion : pros : pleasing bokehfast auto-focus ( when working properly)vignetting minimalimage stabilization ( vr)flare minimal 1.5 factor ( 105-450mm ) makes nice zoomcolors very goodcons : plastic casingnear inability auto-focus 300mm rangeprice ( even though it cheaper then 18-200mm dx) 1.5 factor ( 105-450mm ) might make it more zoom then you needlens could faster ( f/4 would nice)i love this lens , even it quirks , however ; you may want wait till it drops price little more ( it falls almost bi-weekly ) . it may not fastest market , but it size , optics , image quality vr make this must lens serious nikon users !	1
this camera proved perform better than i expected . easy operate , yet so many bells whistles . there several tools capabilities come this camera , it very important read manual its entirety order maximize benefits . basics stuff it so good it might deceive you into thinking you got it all . its wide angle lens coupled high resolution excellent solution photographing my artwork further work my computer or reproductions/printing .	1
because its shirt-pocket size , this digital camcorder easy bring family outings such . i originally bought it because i plan attending my sister graduation didn't want bring plane both my very large semi-pro canon digital camcorder my digital still camera all its lenses . i took pure digital business trip plane just check it out it great fun . simple operate , results surprisingly sharp . only two drawbacks : 1 ) like any small device , could easy drop it , 2 ) it seemed like batteries getting kind low , boot-up time getting longer longer , after 40 or so minutes recording . i recorded 55 minutes , it still working . but , if you need quick capturing precious/important moments , might want carry spare set batterie	1
conversion lenses always poor reputation . typically generalizations like fuzzy , corner falloff so . panasonic dmw-lt55 tele conversion lens appears exception . mounted lumix fz50 , it produces images sharper than expected . not sharp those would produced nikkor or canon , but sharp detailed enough . there no noticeable falloff edges or corners . no vignetting either . contrast excellent . fz50 , lt55 used handheld camera optical image stabilization system activated . , frankly , astonishing . neat trick fz50 able reduce resolution image 10 megapixels down 3 megapixels ( just using center sensor ) effectively increasing power tele converter 1,137 mm lens . images aren't bad . converter lighweight easily attached fz50 . any filter lens must removed first . no adapter required . overall , fz50 nice knockaround travel camera . it light , incredible 12x leica design approved lens , 10 megapixel sensor just every feature you could want . adding lt55 your kit gives you extra-long telephoto you've always wanted carry without doing damage your back . neat product . jerry	1
if you'e looking replacement or extra battery your nikon digital camera , this one beats nikon original hands down . not only it significantly cheaper , but it greater capacity . nikon battery rated 650 mah . digital concepts battery rated 800 mah	1
this great camera - especially price . hp makes camera-computer interface software very user-friendly it takes great pictures well . it nice big lcd screen lithium-ion battery lasts long time me . i recommend this camera very highly	1
this bag lot bigger than i anticipated . it well constructed lot compartments put all your goodies . give you idea size , i am currently carrying :-d igital rebel xt slr-canon ae-1 program film slr-10 rolls film-extra battery charger-a few filters-lots various camera odds endsand i still tons room left ! i haven't even began max this bag out . i am very happy this buy extras come it .	1
i used canon powershot . i am happier color sony . it gives me true sunset color . it seems wider range color especially red zone . skin tone more real livelier	1
i purchased camera after my old one ( casio ex z-40 ) broken since i loved my old one very much i concerned if new one would good old one . it 10.000 times better ! automatic mode helps unexperienced photographers take great pictures . but using individual modes settings results even better . i tested camera any situation during 6000 mile roadtrip across american west it not disappoint me all . only thing bit annoying everytime you switch camera it automatically go snapshot mode you switch through different modes again adjust settings you need . but surely there way figure out how avoid , i'm probably just not patient enough find out how since all other models casio cameras i tested not show this problem . overall , i highly recommend camera all types photographers !	1
this remote works well , but new one needs manufactured , supports more functions e-300 e-500 cameras	1
this camera my eye roughly 3 years now now it finally my possession , i could not more pleased . previous owner canon optura 300 , i craving more professional camera very long time . my canon , while possibly one best 1-chip camera i ever used , far too small what i needed accomplish it . i craved more manual control , easier layout , more stable camera , full in-depth control over white balance focus . vx2100 fulfilled all these requirements spectacularly . i use this camera primarily filming skateboarding snowboarding videos short films it seemingly tailor made suit needs those who documents these sports . here short synopsis what makes each features this camera so fantastic . layout : this camera great layout . zoom focusing ring near front camera record button zoom rocker handle , dedicated audio white balance buttons back , everything easy find , well labeled , intuitive its placement . manual control : this camera some most indepth manual features nearly any prosumer camera market today . i stated before , this camera mostly button instead menu driven , it saves so much time when you're spot you only 5 minutes get shot , you just hit dedicated white balance button ! voila !, vibrant accurate color reproduction touch button . focus zoom both give right amount resistance when turning , making it easy get exact focus zoom you want . color shift feature also very useful , allowing you change camera settings so ccds pick up all colors perfectly ( vx2100 notorious colder , more bluish picture compared vx1000 ) . integrated neutral density filter quite useful those really bright days when glare overwhelmingly present distracting . overall , this camera incredibly depth sheer choices you make tweak picture just right . maneuverability : this camera just right size when it comes handheld filming . most weight camera towards front , but perfectly balanced top handle . camera also not too long , allowing you get closer subject when using fisheye allowing you manipulate camera tight quarters . overall , this prosumer camcorder winner sony should seriously considered anyone who either aspiring filmmaker , or looking buy top class camcorder . excellent buy !	1
this camera really delivers . i appraise real estate take 40 - 100 pix week . i want slr serious work , but this camera great appraisal work because it so handy . i clipboard one hand laser measuring device other camera my shirt pocket . i switch lmd camera needed . i afraid it would easy lose but so far so good i haven't dropped it nearly often my coolpix 4300 which i gave my assistan t.t he one annoying feature on/off switch . it difficult depress must held down momentarily operate . far better system lens cover which slides back lens turn close turn off . only improvement i would recommen	1
i havent gotten these before but they look like good pair binoculars . i suggest adding these your wish list if you like outdoors	1
i got camera via fedex within five working days after ordering . camera lens factory fresh us warranty . i'm still trying learn all features since this my first digital slr , but so far , it taken good pictures . i would order this company again	1
i bought this camcorder my husband christmas . he wanted something pop into his pocket impromptu events . we old panasonic vhs-c camcorder , but battery never lasts more than 30 minutes it getting harder find vcr play it . we wanted something would record directly sd memory card , this only one we could find . however , so far , it performed very well . 3x optical zoom works good outdoor videos perfect . fact , my husband filmed my granddaughter jumping trampoline , he able get freeze frame her mid air . it not blurry or anything . indoor videos not quite good , but he hadn't figured out how turn flash/led light low light situations yet . i figure turned , indoor videos very good . so far , we very pleased this camcorder . we bought 2gb sd card go it order enough memory what we want , i also bought extra battery . i would certainly buy it again	1
first one i ever owned . overall performance pretty good i am satisfied picture quality . battery life short downloading could made easier	1
i think canon makes some best cameras market today also pretty affordable . i am really impressed excellent quality photos taken this camera . it takes such vivid clear pictures excellent color reproduction . i rarely edit any pics i take unless it cropping or zooming . i am very happy this model . i'd say only minor " complaint " i would it bit heavy 4 aa batteries intalled i've dropped it couple times when i felt like i didn't " good " grasp it . swivel lcd doesn't close totally flat anymore but it still works produces excellent quality pics .	1
this great camera people like me who mainly just want point shoot not deal too many settings . i even able teach my mother-in-law how use one we got them ( she little technologically challenged ) . there bunch different " best shot " settings easy use , but honestly most my pictures turned out best using just " snapshot " or auto mode , regardless environment/time day , etc . it would nice if you could charge battery just plugging camera , but i guess you pay little more feature . photo software comes it not good , but there plenty other things you use out there free	1

this camera exelent camara . it plenty effects , plenty modes , plenty scenery options . image quality 3.2 megapixel , but its quite good . pictures you take without flash end up getting bit blury , where if you take it flash , it comes out exelent . sometimes it takes long time picture get taken out flash , sometimes it happens imediatly . but all these flaws only my version . but if you looking good camera great price , this your best option	1

when i looking camcorder , this seemed like best bet : it almost all features i wanted , although i concerned how it would deal low-light situations . still , i discouraged read all descriptions how camera worked windows ; would it work my mac ? i emailed panasonic find out , panasonic told me i'd need hook camera up via firewire . so my parents got me camera christmas , they let me open it early so i'd familiar it when christmas arrived . i glanced through manual , i noticed trepidation there more references windows . my husband gave me ilife ' 06 christmas set it up before i tried out camera . i relaxed bit i used camera ; it easy figure out how stills ( even while shooting video ) , switch widescreen fullscreen , record , play back , etc . sound seemed doing well , too . so i my sample video still shots -- would i able retrieve them easily os 10.4.8 ? importing video piece cake , i found . i plugged camera firewire we bought ( it not included , since windows users only use usb ) , imovie offered import video soon i launched it . i played movies , imovie even interpreted where breaks make separate clips . i exported first three segments quicktime file medium sound quality , my husband his friends still raving how fantastic quality . i pleased how camera dealt light indoor situation -- it produced significantly better video quality than my mom digital camera ( which , admittedly , primarily intended stills ) . usb cable still necessary transfer still photos computer . my first impression stills shot during video recording not high-quality stills shot separately . flash might help , too ; still shots give impression less light than movies . images aren't shockingly better than ones produced our hand-me-down ~ 2.1 mp still camera , but i'm sure they bit better . figuring out menus bit confusing if you don't initially realize different settings camera ( like motion vs . still ) different menu options . we look manual figure out how set time . most basic camera functions , though , very intuitive . bigger battery than included battery ( maybe twice capacity ? ) , i probably got least hour total operating time ; i used lcd screen most time . viewfinder electronic , so i can't think it really sucks up lot less energy than flip-out screen , but i haven't experimented their comparitive energy suckage . overall , i'm extremely pleased camera ; it just what i looking . now i just need disk space support it	1
i several digital cameras , including nikon 8700 , i feel digital still got way go , they wonderful , yet very tiring , printing gobs prints friends family tiring , tedious expensive . cameras unless using some exotic means still cannot focus well low light , also dont like taking pictures place whole world standing over my shoulder . soooo , happily back film n80 nikon 28-100 nikon i bought kit . its so great back film , now i get some control back . far 80 , it really beautiful highly intuitive use , well made , features wonderful , joy own use . i made right move , know now , shot few roles kodak color 200 , results so good , if i still want get lazy , photo processor put shots disc , havnt it yet , enjoying prints too much , think i , ll run out get some echtekchrome . photography important component me my life , n80 bringing it all back slick very competent manner i completely enjoy it	1
nikon always leader photography/ camera/ lenses . others nobly tried but nikon remains high bar others only hope reach . when shift film digital began , there some speculation if nikon could keep up competition . well , rest assure not only they kept up , they continue lead way . latest example this d200 . like d70/ d80 - this solid piece equipment . just feel it tells you you holding excellent piece technology . but proof always end results again , combination nikon know-how nikon lenses lead even beginner come up excellent pictures . gone " lag shots " . you fire up shoot multiple pictures seconds so action shots all yours . without even " tweaking " picture computer program , you print top line photos home . people cited cons : expensive . yes . camera come hefty price tag but it should kept mind this piece machinery intended serious photographers . if you " vacation holiday " picture taker , then you should elect buy cheaper camera . same true difficulty multitude small buttons , dials switches . there too many they overwhelming but only someone who " point shoot " school picture taking . anyone else relish options nikon provided us d200 . room improvement ? well , battery life nowhere near good d70 which i upgraded but weak complaint you still get hundreds shots one charge . also , it would boon if flash would automatically pop up when needed like former models . so if you serious photography always one ready , this one you	1
first off , let me make it clear i am satisfied this camera . i it 8 months now i put it through its paces its held up fine . but there few things you must know : camera no zoom . i mean , practically no zoom . 2.2 may look decent but its pointless any real-life situation . you find yourself moving lot your camera get better shot , not standing one place using zoom feature . you never get close wide shot - its just not possible this camera . this camera great average stills but that it . you click twice take picture or " press halfway then fully " according manual . this major pain . sometimes when battery weak , it may take lot time take picture ( lot frustration ) , so this not cam capture any special pictures or " kodak moments " . apart these cons , camera great value money offers video all kinds stuff . if you're looking mostly looking take landscape or portrait stills , this camera good job	1

i bought this lens my canon 30d after reading every professional review i could find . i knew going this lens wasn't perfect but , supposed better than 18-55 kit lens . i liked range it provided image stabilization . i shot pictures this lens extremely dissapointed . pictures not sharp all colors dull . i thought it might my new camera first because i couldn't imagine quality would this bad . i ruled this out after i used my canon 28-105 lens i my canon film slr results much better . digital focal length though , my old lens wouldn't suffice because 1.6 focal factor . later , i decided tamron 17-50/ 2.8 after reading reviews . salesperson professional camera store guessed my pictures very soft when i told him i this canon lens . he said , " let me guess , you'd like try tamron 17-50/ 2.8 . " he said this very best lens buy price range take it home try it . i could return it no questions asked if i wasn't satisfied . he also said he hadn't one person return it yet . my first images this lens great . they sharp way more vibrant color . there absolutely no comparison all . i hesitant buy third party lens but , my fears instantly eliminated after seeing results . this first review i ever posted amazon . i so dissapointed i wanted help others not make same mistake . after spending $$$ digital slr , it would waste not get great pictures it because lens . before taking chance buying canon , yourself big favor try canon tamron local store .	-1

i too , loved camera , despite small lcd screen size , until it got infamous white screen death this particular camera known , which usually occurs after warranty expires ( 1 year ) . photos outside great , poor low-light photos though , but i paid $100 it ( $20 coupon it $80 ) . small lcd screen means it takes less battery power , so rechargeable aa batteries lasted long time . white screen death temporary solution : turn camera off , quick rap your knuckles " cybershot " logo front camera . then turn it back . repeat if necessary . it'll probably happen again , but it beats buying brand new camera if you're vacation don't time bargain shop	1

hoods offer several benefits photographer . primarily hood shades lens stray light may result unwanted discoloration or hazing image , or appearance lens flare . shading your lens helps improve contrast image quality . hood not required eliminate these problems , any item used shade lens provide same protection stray light . hood convenient it built offer protection while ensuring it not inadvertently find its way into your image . photographers often state protective abilities hood reason one . this hood solid conical two inch long offers some protection keeping moisture wind blown debris off lens element . there nothing more irritating than reviewing your images find dust spots or other flaws . when place , hood protect lens impacting solid objects . replacing damaged hood usually cheaper than repairing or replacing lens . this hood manufactured canon 85 f/ 1.8 usm ef , 100 f/ 2.0 usm ef , 135 f/ 2.8 usm ef , 100-300 f/ 4.5 - 5.6 usm ef lenses normally not included lens when sold new . amazon often suggests purchasing one your lens , worth considering . since hood wider than lens ; it easily stored attached reverse position . this doesn't add length lens , but make it wider inch . inch may not seem like lot , but tightly packed camera bag , it huge . fortunately canon provides storage case lens used addition your camera bag . while protective benefits exist , they secondary limited . i find impact hood my image quality more convincing reason use hood . considering impact image quality low cost compared my other camera equipment ( except lens case ) , purchasing hood money well spent . pros : improves contrast image quality offers limited protection lens cons : takes up more space your camera bag store len	1

i've this camera three years . i bought it new , when it cutting edge very expensive . i put 128mb cf card it . first , i say i never slightest problem this camera or software . i've probably taken upwards 5000 pictures it , it all over country . software installed windows 95 , 98 , 2000 xp i haven't any problems it . camera solid , performs well , takes good pictures , battery lasts pretty long if you disable lcd viewfinder . if battery life big deal , one could purchase second battery rotate . all said , i am little disappointed quality pictures camera . they razor sharp , color balance perfect , focus great . when taking pictures people , however , it shows every flaw subject skin . scratches , oil , freckles magnified come out looking horrific . it requires extensive photoshopping fix flaws . other cameras taking pics same subjects turn out looking much better . i also say it takes very long moment camera its digital image processing time you press button when camera actually takes picture . time shot taken , something ( especially squirmy child or sports play ) invariably moved it not exact picture you wanted . i'm going buy real single-lens reflex ( slr ) take baby pictures , but i'll keep this travel camera	1

i viewed concert photos taken s2 number different photographers they absolutely took my breath away . saw output other cameras comparison they didn't even come close . i using canon a80 prior while i happy it , my first round photos s2 proved most impressive . while you use this point shoot , this camera you should spend some time learning so you get most it . although s3 latest version camera , i'm not sure you get much more money	1
this filter excellent cost efficient way protect your valuable lenses .	1
it simple , handy works well prevent shaking your camera . but i am still doubt if this simple accessory really deserves 50 bucks ... this wired release would choice only if you not digital rebel user who more reasonable price option additional shutter button .	1

well , i don't even know where start this camera . but year ago , when this camera first got launched digital camera market , it costed nearly twice much what you pay it now . price , this camera alot offer . i just love color tone fujifilm . you get very studio-like effect fujifilm ccd technology . this camera many manual controls features interest both professional amature photographers . 9 megapixel really helpful when it comes cropping . pictures taken this camera bright clear . camera picture noisy if you set iso above 400 . so , best result , just set iso level low possible ( lets say iso 80 ? ) . 10.7 zoom lens very convenient when you want get close subject you shooting . i used this camera every occasion it never failed me . i heard alot complaints poor battery life this camera , but just buy nimh battery 2500 mah above you should get 200-250 shots . make sure buy least 2 gb memory card because picture files pretty big , especially raw format . also , price , this camera feels very solid hand . it feels very professional sturdy ( made japan ) . buttons nicely placed very easy use . make sure buy external flash if you want some serious light photography . i recommnend sunpak 383 non-dedicatted flash go this camera . it works together really well . anyway , $407 , you cannot get better camera than this one . thank you amazon making this good deal possible . again , i highly recommend this camera .	1

i received one these christmas ... so i've it 6 months now . i've taken thousands shots it , both canon digital rebel xt ( 350d ) canon eos 20d . bottom line ... i really like lens . although you must learn optimize its use 200mm . specifics ... 1 ) 200mm ( max telephoto ) , you see some blur if you don't use high shutter speed hold it steady . this means just placing your camera green " point shoot " mode , or even " " mode may not give you fast enough shutter speed keep blur unless you bright daylight . so .... here my technique : 200mm you may want bump up your iso ( film ) speed 400 or 800 , then use tv mode ( canon settings i'm talking - manual shutter speed control ) get fast shutter speed . i also hold end lens ( petal filter ) my left hand lean against solid object or good foot stance - or use tripod . all this not any sort lens defect ; rather , it typical using long tele lens not image stabilization ( ) . you get canon , but ready lay down some $$$ carry multiple lenses ... more later . 2 ) noisy autofocus . yeah , true , it louder than other lenses , but so what . it not any louder than fake autowinder sound my rebel xt makes . i find its focus quick accurate - except low light . although , i say my 20d much better than my 350d this lens low light . but , honestly , i don't think low light autofocus any worse than canon 18-55 kit lens i initially ised . it hunted lot too low light , often would not lock - necessitating manual focus . perhaps it camera , not lens . regardless , manual focus sigma works great low light , or , keep autofocus , you use external flash ir focus assist it locks right up . other than tamron , you not find versatile lens this one , especially this price point . optical quality great my lens . you better - but two lenses . my solution this kind range if $$$ no object would canon ef-s 17-85mm f4- 5.6 usm canon ef 70-300mm f/ 4.5 - 5.6 usm ... this would add image stabilization 100mms more range , but much more cost , you would carry two lenses . i specifically bought this lens compact , one lens solution . if you read all reviews you find , general consensus sigma better than tamron 18-200 . plus , end barrel not rotate , so you use circular polarizer . show me lens better bang buck one lens solution , i'll buy it . until then , i love my sigma	1
set diffusion ' stun ' when you don't want your flash ' kill ' harsh , sharp , shadowy edges . yes , you need this if you sb-600 . why ? nikon doesn't make diffuser model . basically , it fits snugly tip flash , slides off easy , also protect your flashbulb acidental nicks , like macro shot benihana chefs . here what it : diffuses your flash without go all into your menu settings make adjustments . simple , sherlock . omni-bounce ( what imaginative name piece shaped plastic ) performs expected , no real cons , except shipping adds almost 50% price , so check your local camera shop see if they it stock before ordering	1
good product , probably best digital frame market . drawbacks user interface difficulty set-up wireless connection	1

this lens changed it all me . i happy my tamrons tokinas - i thought . then i bought this lens . colors contrast simply popped out pics . it amazing ! while there no red ring around it , it deserves one . difference shots incredible . it very well built , focuses ( like all canon usm lenses ) fast quiet provides photog truly beautiful bokeh . low light , it awesome . using extension tube macro , it great . portraits , it nearly unbeatable . so what downside ? sure there one : you'll sold canon lenses . since this one , i've bought five more , including two " " series . if that downside , so it ! just buy lens - you'll love it	1
quick , compact , light brilliant pictures but lacking veiw finder " anti-shake " syste	1
i love capacity these batteries . use them my handheld gps , digital cameras , 35mm cameras , flashes , everything else i . car power adaptor really nice road trips ! charger recharge 4 batteries time ( either aa or aaa ) , charge even 2100 mah batteries under 75 minutes ( under hour " typical " rechargeables 1600 or fewer mah ) . i not like leaving charger plugged , because i hear it clicking when there no batteries it ( but i hear lots things wouldn't bother normal person ) . also , price pretty high . i succesfully used other batteries charger ( it comes 8 2100 mah nimh batteries seem last longer than other brands rechargeable ) . ask it christmas ... hope discount ( which appears pretty rare monstercable products )	1
i really pleased my item ! amazon shipped phenomenal packaging ! thanks ...	1

canon ef 70-300mm f4- 5.6 usm telephoto zoom lens replaces first image stabilizer lens its kind , canon 75-300mm f4- 5.6 telephoto zoom lens . it offers now up three - opposed two - apertures image stabilizing mode , well slightly wider focal length . current june 2006 popular photography issue fine test report this lens , showing it capable excellent contrast resolution range 70mm 200mm ; 300mm , both contrast resolution decline slightly very good , but still excellent result zoom lens this class . it also fully compatible canon digital slr cameras ( 112-480mm equivalent ) , improved lens coatings optimised digital sensors . without question this excellent lens canon photographer interested excellent nature landscape photography , without resorting sturdy tripod hold both camera lens ; thus it also quite suitable handhold panning shots most outdoor sporting events held under good weather conditions	1
manufactured soft gray felt like material , tough leather bottom , draw string closure top , this lens pouch helps protect your lens dust elements . i store my lenses camera bag , these cases fit nicely around lens taking up little precious space . this case meant use canon 28 135mm 3.5 - 5.6 usm , 28 200mm 3.5 - 5.6 usm ef lenses . these lenses not normally come case when sold new . amazon often suggests purchasing one your lens , worth considering depending how you store your lenses . pros : protects your glass investment cons : i cannot think	1
it works fine , but canon s2 digital camera sometimes feels little heavy monopod .	1
good quality product which actually measured slightly larger than indicated providing room good sized zoom lens . usual amazon shopping beat all others pricing	1
first , i selection third-party lenses . nothing bad , just none spectacular . i somewhat disappointed shots i got . then i bought 85/ 1.8 saw contrast colors i expecting . since then , i've bought several canon lenses this one my latest . like title says , wow . my first shots house around it all apertures zoom lengths , shots simply incredible . just fantastic sharpness - no ps usm needed ! colors real vibrant contrast sharp clear . this ( my 24-105/4l ) what lenses should . well built , solid great glass . sure , you pay more . you could enhance your shots ps . but see results these lenses vs cheaper alternatives , you'll see what you spent all money for!i'm sold canon	1
i d200 while all hype around 18-200 others , this one awesome lens portraits other closer up type photos . i read few things i research thought i'd pass my experience : - how this d200 ? ( ans : great . fast auto-focus . no compatibility issues)- you really get crisp photos cool bokeh ? ( ans : absolutely)- 1.8 ok or you need 1.4 ? ( ans : i don't 1.4 but 1.8 so competent price i get crispness shallow dof i looking for)- shooting distance 85mm acceptable or you need 55mm so you closer subject ? ( ans : i really like shooting distance 85mm . i really would not less distance me subject)enjoy	1
this good teleconverter added 1.5 camera native zoom . it adds great degree stability camera taking those critical shots . course when digital zoom used it very sensitive shake movement . overall good addition especially birds nature shots	1
i bought this flash use my canon rebel xt . first thing i noticed without even reading instructions i able get much better results pictures taken indoors . able bounce flash off white ceilings provided much better color contrasts built flash . even when i set my camera shoot quick pictures succession flash not let me down . it not need anytime recharge all . i recently just came back vacation took lot outdoor evening shots . most pictures came back great results . only dissappointment i when taking shots further distance than i normally would , pictures came back darker than i would've liked . so , compensate this i adjusted flash exposure my camera although it improvement it hassle taking several test shots before getting it right . problem i flash battery cover . it flimsy i find it awkward open close times . i always feel like i'm gonna snap it off accident . overall i am happy . it good flash price you pay . battery life good . i still haven't even recharge batteries i've almost taken 200 shots it . my low light picture improved dramatically investing external flash . anyone decent camera should never use built flash . difference night day	1
it shipd fast verygood buy money look same more expensive canon one plus batterys good brand i think but it realy up you buyer ihave canon rebel it fit verrysnug	1
excellent camera kit . versatile . i lot learn camera , though , it no simple point-and-shoot . however , auto mode , it takes great point-and-shoot pictures . i look forward learning how use it fully . lenses came warranty cards , but camera itself not . i bought sb-600 flash well battery two 1 gb compact flash cards round out kit . camera lens attached large , which i underestimated . $80 camera bag too small it all . great camera , though . price best i could find anywhere	1
we far professional photographers , but most part i liked lens . we wanted something we could zoom bit more than what digital rebel came it great ! my only problem if i want take close up pic i switch back original lens . there probably reason this i am unaware . minor inconvienience great zoom capability .	1
i originally gave this camera 5 stars . when i windows 98 it wonderful but i got new computer last november xp usb software sooo ... not compatible xp i found however you just buy card reader solve this problem . new drivers cannon site not help all but try them if you want they made me use backup software . adobe software also wonderful 98 but it not let you print correctly xp so you forced create your document then either print it windows or export it application . but it takes gorgeous pictures 2.1 mp camera	1

i've looking digital slrs ever since canon came out its 10d . since then , there so many so many companies . i've always canon user . i 2 eos bodies-the elan iie 7e . also canon ix , its aps camera which i still ( its small viewfinder major disappointment ) . anyhow 30d came , its viewfinder small too . camera still too large me , i just wasn't sold . now nikon d80 . it narrower than canon 30d , what breathtaking panoramically big viewfinder . such delight use . 2.5 " lcd seems fit perfectly back : nothing bigger or smaller would righ t.t he pictures fabulous . i bought 2 gb sandisk ultra ii card , which i thought would fast . it takes half second picture come lcd , but i'm not complaining . 2 gb big card . it hold 500 photos using normal jpeg , large image . i'm sure 1 gb would faster . canons , onboard flashes never would use advanced metering external flashes provided , but nikon d80 , i see such perfectly illuminated photos onboard flash . 18-135 lens something i jumped . 28-200 35 mm size quite huge range , yet lens not massive . i thought hard image stablization you could get canon 18-85 lens , but naaah , 30d just not measure up so i dropped idea . there always such things called tripods !! entire camera , lens battery feel just right , not too heavy . lens excellent . kit fits nicely into relatively small lowepro bag . this truly camera worth waiting years . 12 or 14 mp models sure come couple years , but i doubt they make bodies any more compact ; file size large enough it 10 mega-pixel . d80 so perfect shape i doubt nikon much better . this one fantastic digital slr . raj	1
after searching internet i found amazon place where this item lowest price . fast delivery , great product . fits great my panasonic 6 megapixels camera . fine leather . could not any happier product	1
i can't help but give lens cap 5 stars , what i say , it fits , it covers lens keeps dust out . bad part purchasing this place paying much postage cap itself but it hard find elsewhere . i also could not it delivered here fort wainwright alaska because i'm only allowed po box so i it shipped my home new york then them send it me-go figger	1
i quite annoyed when i found my d70 come out box dust lens . place i bought it would only send it away nikon cleaning , but friend same camera advised me get dust blower showed me how i should able blow dust off myself . first blower i tried didn't enough power dust remained . i almost decided take camera get it cleaned when i read review suggested this one . i took chance , after 15 minutes trying , checking , trying again , i finally dust free sensor ! this most valuable piece equipment i purchased my camera , i recommend this anyone similar problem	1
i never take my uv filter off my lens unless i am going immediately put different filter . there basically two camps out there , those feel you should always use uv filter protect your lens dirt scratches those feel it waste time only degrades your image . well , i tried going without one awhile then dirt started build up front element my very expense lens . although you clean front element lens , i feel much , much safer wiping my comparatively cheap uv filter time time again rather than chancing any actual lens damage . i think nearly unquantifiable loss image quality you may suffer uv filter , it well worth extra piece mind it gives me	1
this gadget must-have gadget lovers ..... picture lovers . it compact , solid fits any small pocket or clutch bag . images crisp if you get it set appropriately . if you love attention get this product if you don't ..... not worry camera gets all it .	1
i purchased my sb-600 day before my granddaughter birthday party our local skating rink . very little time test unit prior party , i dove right . i amazed exposures very close shots , believe it or not , entire length skating rink . auto-zoom really cool feature changes match your lense setting wide telephoto . i made 150 shots first time out using nimh batteries no significant drain . this time , i found absolutely no negative points . i may even purchase couple more replace my portable photogenic studio lights	1
when digital cameras first came out , i , like many people swore i'd always loyal film . digital could never take place film . i'm not convinced it replaced film completely . there still something i love putting roll film camera , shooting away , sending film processed , seeing results . i also know it bit expensive . i know argument quality always paramount discussion , but digital cameras improving this regard , most manufacturers assuring users while technology always improving , we point where good investment made digital slr it not outdated soon buyer purchases camera . so i figured now time get digital slr . i loyal nikon user nearly ten years , owned nikon n60 , n70 , n80 . my first love , still n70 ( i've told person who sold me camera he thought i only person who loved n70 ) . i purchased n80 only after my n70 cost too much repair , but i've enjoyed way my various nikon cameras handled all sorts situations fact they simple use point shoot if i don't time use specific controls , but it also options more creative artistic purposes . my nikon cameras allowed me capture family moments ease majestic landscapes , wildlife shots all sorts other things i can't resist capture forever . i decided purchase d70 since it close what i've already experienced nikon . many ways it works similar way n70 80 , except it digital rather than film version . like film versions midrange nikon slr , it dial allows automatic setting , portrait , landscape , sports , close-up , nightscape , night portrait modes , ability select aperture , shutter speed or manual controls . camera auto manual focus abilities . photos easy or technical photographer desires . controls easy use , though it takes practice comfortable . personal level , camera passed halloween test , niece birthday test , fall foliage new england test favorite scenic spots test . only real difficulty i've camera trying capture stained glass windows dark setting . auto focus not worked all i'm not thrilled manual focus these shots , but this point i'm sure it photographer not camera . i one suggestion anyone who purchases this camera . manual very confusing . it uses all sorts symbols more distraction than anything else . i've luck " magic lantern guides " my other cameras , but not yet used it this camera . i purchase nikon d70 field guide ( david busch , wiley publishing ) which helpful . it quick reference anyone already familiar nikon photography general but it also provides introduction novice photography .	1
don't disappointed because this isn't lithium ion battery . this battery kicks butt !! it lasted me 3 days non stop shooting . i started think battery never going die ! course reality set eventually charge it , but it lasted forever !! only drawback it takes 2 hours charge :( other than , it lasts you all day night	1
nice quality , but overpriced . nice job protecting front lens , reducing glare some situations	1
pros : - reduces flare ghosting when shooting bright light . - helps protect your lens dirt scratches . - somewhat protects lens case fall . better break hood than front element . - makes you look more like you know what you doing helps keep others carelessly walking front you . cons : - increase lens movement windy situations , kind like sail boat . - takes up more room your bag , even when reversed they still add diameter lens . - people take more notice you , help blow your cover if you trying keep low profile	1
slightly smaller than charger comes s(40 , 45 , 50 ,... ) series cameras digital rebel series cameras . seems charge same time . feels bit more substantial , but that not saying much chargers come those cameras seem pretty flimsy . i can't give it 5 stars because it nothing more than chargers come cameras ( which i lost )	1
i bought this flash my canon 30d because numerous promises canon makes how it performs all 30d automatic manual functions ... they right ! spite it relatively small size , it most powerful flash i've used any brand . replaced non-canon brand flash supposed work 30d but didn't , i could not more delighted 580x . whether you're shooting av , tv , , or modes , you not disappointed its performance . it expensive ; but it worth price if you rely your flash perform your camera capabilities	1
this camera bag just i expected . what written description fits it perfectly . nice bag ! great response time delivery . thanks	1
power-2000 xp-333 charges batteries pairs , one led per pair , not described . xp-555 charges each battery independently slightly faster ( 3 vs 4 hours ) . xp-333 charger very lightweight , xp-555 slightly heavier . they work 110 or 220 includes plug adaptors round european type plugs . i used xp-333 usa overseas . power-2000 makes several other charger models well . xp-333 555 aas 2500 mah , there xp-33327 xp-55527 versions now available 2700 mah batteries . aaa batteries charge faster they hold less charge . aaas power-2000 currently come 850 1000 mah capacities . i believe these capacities aa aaa power-2000 other nimh makers twice great or maybe more than alkalines . i recall , some years ago duracell copper top aas 1100 mah . i not found recent figures web , but got old figure calling 800 number duracell packages . duracell ultras appear bit higher mah figure , but i not know . 1.2 nimh vs 1.5 alkalines seems make no practical difference i am told , i believe it correct , alkaline voltage drops rapidly under 1.5 after initial use while i understand nimh holds its 1.2 value some time .	1
i won kodak printer scrapbook convention then went hunt find refills reasonable price . purchasing 160 count made price per print lowest beat out anything i could find local stores . it great convenience able whip out 4x6 print instead download it store website , wait few days , go there pick it up , etc . great value	1
this camera really great . i knew i liked it before , but i immediately began appreciate this camera all more when i ended up rebel xt " loaner " while my 20d repair . not xt bad camera , it just doesn't really compare 20d . 20d nice feel it ; it fairly large , which great since i somewhat large hands . features great too . image quality awesome . i don't really need go into all details , most other reviewers excellent job . let me just say it great camera worth five stars . only complaint i camera it doesn't spot metering . ability your light metering off single point interest would great - they add it 30d .	1
first all it took me few months decide what lens buy because i so much research . my choices canon 70-200l 4 , 70-200l 2.8 70-200l 2.8 . after much investigation i opted not buy 4.0 because i knew i would shooting dim lights needed 2.8 . so save money i bought 2.8 non . lens great i travelled utah it . all great until i tried shoot deer full zoom . every one came out blurry could not use . apart it fantastic lens . result i decided fork out 2.8 lens it amaizing . it same optics non but handheld really works great . like some reviews it not make every shot focus but certainly most them picture quality amaizing . fast focus , great colours . fantastic . if you afford it buy it def worth it because lens heavy you shake bit , which noticeable full or close full zoom . hope this helps	1
i bought this camera gift my 16 yr old daughter who takes lots fun pictures her friends . her photos great quality . this dependable camera , takes abuse teenager gives it . i love it all those reasons besides great pics	1

if you would like list sites reviews email gumby ( ) dontquotemeonthat ( dot ) com pros : great sharpness even wide open ( wayyyyy better than 2.8 zooms 2.8 ) . nice weight size . shallow dof wide angle lens . cons : lateral ca glows purple green close distant bokeh . watch high contrast situations . my first copy doa . no weather seal . hood too tight . pros : fantastic ! this one excellent piece glass . incredible low light , vibrant clarity color . well balanced 20d/batter pack or 1d . cons : none what so ever . if your newbie here some info lens " fast " when it low f-stop ... ok so when you smaller number apature bigger which allows more light through , so this means you up shutter speed . still enough light reach sensor . ok so lets say you out door shot if you say f/4 lens shutter speed could 1/250 second you would get good exposer . now this lens only go f/4 but if you same outdoor setting , f/ 2.8 lens you could jump 1/500 second get same exposer . freeze action mmore effectivly , this i believe why it " fast " lens . ok fun get it	1

canon 1d mk iin bomb . i opted this camera over cheaper higher megapixel camera , 5d . it rare you need more than 8m pixels sharpness speed this camera nothing short amazing especially when comparing my other digital slr , canon 20d . this camera i enjoy many year	1
canon ef-s 10-22mm f/ 3.5 - 4.5 usm slr lens canon ef-s slrs ( like 20d 30d ) good all round lens though it soft 10mm . it only works ef-s compatable cameras which presently 1.6 multipliers so lens effectively 16mm 35mm . if you need shoot cramped spaces , or you shoot lots interiors you need wide angle , ef-s slr this lens required equipment	1
nice hood . it designed canon ef-s 17-85mm lens therefore what it supposed .	1
this first slr camera i ever owned . i bought it because i going trip around world , wanted nice camera , it recommended camera shop owner . it extremely easy use , so easy i could hand camera someone one countries i visited , point button they needed push i ended up great picture . i didn't need explain thing . i also didn't mind carrying it around all day , it very light its size . i owned camera four years now it still takes beautiful pictures . i taken all sorts pictures this camera , landscapes action shots they all turn out great . action shots never blurry ! only complaint i autofocus not work well low lighting , sometimes it slow sometimes it won't work all . these cases i just turn manual focus option . all options camera great , but honest i rarely use them . i've found it often easier use manual focus than adjust camera so it autofocus off center . if i know i'm going taking action shots or landscapes i set camera mode , but often i forget my pictures still look great . i think this excellent camera , especially someone used point shoot but wants extra quality slr camera give them . there also many choices when it comes additional lenses , so when photography bug gets you , this camera stay you	1
when digital cameras first came out , i , like many people swore i'd always loyal film . digital could never take place film . i'm not convinced it replaced film completely . there still something i love putting roll film camera , shooting away , sending film processed , seeing results . i also know it bit expensive . i know argument quality always paramount discussion , but digital cameras improving this regard , most manufacturers assuring users while technology always improving , we point where good investment made digital slr it not outdated soon buyer purchases camera . so i figured now time get digital slr . i loyal nikon user nearly ten years , owned nikon n60 , n70 , n80 . my first love , still n70 ( i've told person who sold me camera he thought i only person who loved n70 ) . i purchased n80 only after my n70 cost too much repair , but i've enjoyed way my various nikon cameras handled all sorts situations fact they simple use point shoot if i don't time use specific controls , but it also options more creative artistic purposes . my nikon cameras allowed me capture family moments ease majestic landscapes , wildlife shots all sorts other things i can't resist capture forever . i decided purchase d70 since it close what i've already experienced nikon . many ways it works similar way n70 80 , except it digital rather than film version . like film versions midrange nikon slr , it dial allows automatic setting , portrait , landscape , sports , close-up , nightscape , night portrait modes , ability select aperture , shutter speed or manual controls . camera auto manual focus abilities . photos easy or technical photographer desires . controls easy use , though it takes practice comfortable . personal level , camera passed halloween test , niece birthday test , fall foliage new england test favorite scenic spots test . only real difficulty i've camera trying capture stained glass windows dark setting . auto focus not worked all i'm not thrilled manual focus these shots , but this point i'm sure it photographer not camera . i one suggestion anyone who purchases this camera . manual very confusing . it uses all sorts symbols more distraction than anything else . i've luck " magic lantern guides " my other cameras , but not yet used it this camera . i purchase nikon d70 field guide ( david busch , wiley publishing ) which helpful . it quick reference anyone already familiar nikon photography general but it also provides introduction novice photography .	1
nikon coolpix cool digital camera . its one cheapest digital cameras available ( 120 $ time purchase ) . photos really good it lots settings like sunset , night , beach , fireworks , etc . video recording also possible . one best cost-effective digital cameras	1
i trying find way easily carry lot camera equipment quite some time . i tried backpacks , shoulder bags , duffel bags , but none them really worked all well . then i saw lowepro street field system completely customizable pouches , vests , belts , accessories . it works great , you only get pouches you need so there no waisted space you organize them however you want according how often they used ( put frequently used items easier access places . ) variety alone this system worth investment , but quality ease use also very high which big plus . you get case any lens , camera body , or accessory you . i even cases my cell phone water bottle . one word caution , sure measure your lens lens hood backwards if you use them make sure entire thing fit into pouch , because sometimes lens fit , but then lens lens hood not . i often carry 5-6 lenses , extension tubes , teleconverters , extra memory cards batteries , bunch cleaning supplies other gadgets , which weights ton . but when they evenly distributed this vest/belt lowepro system it actually very manageable . only down side everyone staring you because you thousands dollars camera equipment strapped your body . but if you overlook , this way go . i used this system many zoos without ever problems , fact just unzipping single lens switching seems safer me than opening entire bag equipment every time you want switch lenses . many cases also come built rain/snow cover so if weather changes all your equipment not destroyed . you also put just few pouches normal belt when you just going take photos back yard or don't need take all your equipment , which nice . i really can't say enough how much easier this makes traveling lot equipment , if you hopelessly searching better solution , consider this , you won't regret it .	1
i able use canon ef 1.4 ii extender some nature photography recently wyoming . i shot elk low light conditions so i shooting pretty much wide open . extender not compromise inherent sharpness lens all . you could see hairs animals heads . it fantastic	1
don't mislead , this ab-so-lu-te-ly great product regardless if you big or small hands . it fits new rebel xti ( 400d ) too !! my hands small , but before bg-e3 grip i no real use fifth fourth fingers ( except tucking them underneath xt small body . ) bg-e3 , hand grip firm whole hand grabs camera . this gives you extra feeling pleasing assurance , not unnecessary sensation . better still , front panel bg-e3 rubberized so bottom half your hand won't slip away ( canon should covered camera own grip material instead using average plastic makes body mould . ) little extra weight not problem , rather it always comes handy counterbalance you zoom lenses ( say 300mm range ) . short , this accessory gives rebel camera user welcome feeling overall control sensation more professional gear your hand . extra slot second battery , course plus . i'm selling my xt soon new xti available , it nice know investment i made not long ago this grip , prove useful when i switch . now , if only future 40d ( who knows ) same compatibility ...	1
i bought this lark , it just seemed like such fun though i bought it back dec , i finally really used it today wedding , i shocked ! it took great video inside church where my ( low end ) digital camera could not . i wasn't sure how video would actually turn out , but it great considering time things i paid $[ ... ] it . built software wonderful ( though i wish i could download it computer ) i made " movie mix " wedding camcorders software how fun ! shoot , $[ ... ] if all i got wedding video it worth it . i really couldn't believe how clear video this little " toy ! " i don't understand any negative reviews , it cheap , it fun it heck lot [ ... ] bucks . pure digital inc . $[ ... ] rebate their website . buy it , use it , fun !	1
just purchased couple weeks ago used couple times recording grandchild sports events . excellent quality video . i am still figuring out how take best photos but really got camera video purposes anyway . it so small compact - very easy carry my purse but i got small carry case so i won't scratch screen or lens . easy connect my computer download burning dvd . you should order extra battery handy although one included lasts quite long time	1
this point shoot , so don't expect it act like dslr or even ultra zoom , but what it , it fantastic camera . it starts up quickly focuses very , very quickly . af assist lamp helps this . flash strong image quality very good . lcd smaller than most competitors upper range price bracket , but screen sharp very clear . aa batteries great because they're cheap easy find . i hate it when i'm trip want shoot lot , but tethered wall socket charge battery . movie mode wonderful . true 640x480 resolution 30fps ( only pro duo card ) limit card . i like take my movies , edit them program burn them dvd . 480 lines resolution tv quality it looks good . only real downside this camera its bland styling . other companies making hot , slim , metal cameras look good difficult hold , but this camera plastic body sturdy easy carry one hand . it pleasant weight it , even if it little too wide fit shirt pocke t.t here several websites dedicated reviewing digital cameras depth they give you technical numbers compare other cameras . since i'm just guy occasionally takes photos , i only talk my experiences . i like photos this takes , i like way it holds functions i like clarity smoothness movie mode ... you really can't compare sony camera movies other companies ' movie clips ; sony wins , hands down . sony knows how cater their consumers this camera won't disappoint ! i highly recommend it	1
maps excellent , bought this my 10 year od daughter some wording inside bit beyond her this time but she grow into i	1
this camera wonderful . it fairly priced everything i need it . i d50 stolen am almost glad because i could replace it this one . continuous shooting capabilities make more easy live action stop-motion frame capture . if you want it everything you , it so very well . it also allows you full control camera . i cannot say enough weight . i decently sized hands , more large than small but still thin camera size doesn't feel small . i love this camera . i wish it guard screen , but you can't win them all . only drawback this camera i cannot use one my brother old lenses autofocus because body camera course doesn't autofocus engine . i rarely autofocus anyway , so i'm fine . plus it won't affect new lenses i buy	1
i bought my son ( future steven spielberg ) video recorder christmas got these tapes him too . i just hope technology doesn't leave all us " poor suckers " dust again . anyone want buy 8-track playerr ? tv antenna fot your roof ? pong video game ? beta format tape player ? but seriosly , picture sound quality you get these incredible -- far exceeds tedchnology we ( old people ) . these geed price . not mention i could avoid shopping during holiday season	1
nikon p4 one best point shoot cameras market . there very few no instances where p4 not perform hoped . many different scene modes , selectivities , vr , many other features give this camera broad range capability which pictures turn out great clarity . pixel size picture taken varied so one take very sharp picture fit around 250 1 gig card or around 600 smaller pixel images 1 gig card . this allows great selectivity pictures not force one invest 4 gig card just take day worth pictures . camera takes clearest pictures i seen point shoot digital camera , color quality amazing . overall this best digital camera i found , i would recommend it anyone market . if i find anything i not like , i update this review ! if you any questions or anything contact me , i glad try answer them !	1

i this more than month now . installed 256 mb sd card , currently loaded 800 photos , configured my albums based trips occasions . i set photo frame slide show mode daily auto off settings . 1 week ago , i bought product , pandigital ( 7 ) w/ 128 mb built memory . philips far better picture display where pandigital acceptable photo display . when you look closely or stare photos , you immediately see philips not any grainy reproduction . it also elegant slide show transitions ; pandigital needs work their transitions . you just patient when transferring files your pc photo frame , i find myself hitting reset button more than i really would prefer . i find this no harm my pictures . this resolved just your pictures displayed straight or transferred your card . i just chose pc method because easier management what i needed transferred .	1
i found this product worth money , if you go ne where else you pay more . instant focus works good never problem any part binoculars falling apart , it great starter item someone ..	1

i not purchased this item ; however , i wanted inform westwindtalker2 how use these binoculars ( or any other normal pair binoculars ) . first step , take off your eyeglasses . second step , look through binoculars stationary distant object , close your right eye adjust focus until object focus your left eye . third step , while continuing look same object , open your right eye , close your left eye adjust diopter correction until object focus your right eye . fourth step , open both eyes , adjust distance eyepieces so image seen single object adjust central focus knob .

i using this frame display 2000+ my digital images desk my office . here my comments : pluses : 1 . excellent brightness , contrast , color saturation , viewing angle . mustek frame uses lcd tv type panel much better brightness , contrast , color , compared computer monitor type lcd panels . trade off lower resolution . mustek frame resolution only 480x240 vs . least 640x48 most computer monitor type panels . but my experience actually seeing images this frame while mustek made right trade-off use tv type panels . i compared mustek frame frame apparently uses computer display type lcd panel . other frame much better image details when viewed book reading distance . but viewing distance 3 feet , images mustek frame much better . images other frame dark . color not nearly vivid . viewing angle also much limited compared mustek frame . 2 . excellent transition images . transition fast smooth compared other frame . negatives : 1 . strange display mode . mustek frame native display format 16:8 but displays only 4:3 images . you two choices display 4:3 images . one use only center part lcd panel display 4:3 images leave two sides wide screen blank , much same viewing normal tv images wide screen tv set . other choice images stretched out horizontally fill width screen , distorting images significantly . making subjects pictures short fat . much better choice would crop top bottom 4:3 images make undistorted 16:9 images . it strange mustek frame not offer this choice . so you either full screen display distorted images or partial screen display . neither looked good . solve this problem , one pre-distort 4:3 images 1:1 images stretching pictures height wise then cropped top bottom stretched images make them 4:3 . musteck frame display these pre-stretched images undistorted 16:9 images . this fair amount trouble take each time you want display any new images . there some free software tools excellent job batch processing images stretch crop them mustek frame display . two i found best faststone batch resizer batch resizing stretching images , bimplite batch cropping stretched images . i used three- step process . first step , all images resized 1024x768 using faststone tool preserving aspect ratio . this makes all images , regardless original size aspect ratio , 4:3 images . second step , images first step batch resized 640x640 forcing aspect ratio , this using bimplite since faststone tool could not aspect ratio change . third step , 640x640 pre-stretched images cropped down 640x480 using faststone tool . i found 640x480 images slight better quality than 480x320 images mustek frame . i don't know why . overall i am happy display quality mustek frame . i wish mustek would provide firmware update , if , provide display mode cropping 4:3 images 16:9 instead stretching .	1
this camera execellent beautiful crystal picture sperverb stereo/surrand sound makes this camera one best .	1
i bought this so we could get better look birds our backyard . we keep it kitchen window , find ourselves using it least once week peek feathered friend who visiting . nice clear lens , pretty easy find objects through them . certainly job we need it . don't buy this if you your birding out field - these not particularly portable nor leightweight not meant ; buy binocular specifically made purpose . only complaint , it minor , i find lens caps flimsy little hard use . we generally just keep them off	1
i bought this use kodak easyshare digital camera . it works great ; however , i noticed batteries put ' strain ' battery compartment camera . batteries must bit too long compartment . eventually , compartment closure break . knowing this , i don't know if i would buy this battery again . other camera battery compartment might little longer therefore , not this problem	1
i just doing cr review digital cameras decided add my comments amazon ( i always check amazon reviews items i'm thinking purchasing ... thanks amazon ! ) . i purchased my dsc-w5 little over year ago very pleased it . main reasons i decided purchase this camera its small size fact you could get underwater housing it . i've other underwater cameras but i found this one great above below water . housing so small you use it beach/pool or big waterfest , songkran , thailand without worrying getting it wet . other things i've really liked since i purchased it manual setting ( good underwater sun sets ) ability use standard aa batteries ( this saved me many times when my rechargeable gone dead ) . i also purchased zoom lens ... it helps 3x zoom . when using zoom you sometimes get black hole effect edges , but you just work around it or crop it later . i've thought underwater filters but sony very proud them ( ie . expensive ) . i just use photoshop action elements called underwater i got adobe share site color correct pix . video good also . i've used it underwater high quality setting gives you pretty good video even my 50 " hd tv . it eat up lot space 1g chip , but what you want ... ( may need order bigger one if they're now available)friends mine liked my camera so much they've purchased w7 . thing i'm hoping sony continue line so you purchase accessories future ( underwater housing , i olympus/5050 underwater housing , but after year or so you could not find replacement accessories so i buy new camera ( ie . w5 ) . only con camera red eyes flash so close lens . but then i use elements fix jiffy . other features would make it even better ( sony you listening ): more manual settings . i would like it infrared capability other sony . feature would great don't understand why companies not added it would ... time-laps photography using video or still capability .	1
i recently purchased this scope amazon . i read many reviews suggestions decided go firstscope 114 because it seemed most scope i could get least price . i considered some cheaper models same features , but i'm glad i chose this one because differences quality would ruined my experience . it took 2 weeks receive my scope amazon , but you can't beat free shipping ! scope well packaged , only casualty during shipping wingnut tripod broken wing . i contacted celestron , they immediately sent me wingnut . great customer service ! setup easy , just follow instructions . i scope together looking jupiter next night ( there clouds first night ) . i live city lights combined humidity make it hard see any stars naked eye summer , however images crisp clear through 10 20mm eyepieces i could see 4 jupiter moons distinguish bands crossing its surface . first i little disappointed german equatorial mount . it seemed very shaky i hard time following objects sky . however , i quickly realized i not good job balancing scope mount . it properly balanced , scope movements smooth it very stable even high magnification . i purchased 5mm celestron ultima lens well i pleased images i seen so far . i would definitely recommend this scope anyone looking get into astronomy . i forsee many more hours years enjoyment my firstscope	1

i bought these bird watching yard . focus them little stiff but i see well them any other binoculars i used . overall they seem good product money	1
basically , 70-300 ed perfect complement 18-70 kit lens nikon series . it worth because 1.5 mag factor which means it actually 105-450mm , which gives you plenty reach . add teleconverter you get 900mm (!) . general consensus it also better than 70-300 lens , although if you're budget or don't plan using telephoto much , extra $250 might better spent elsewhere ( like 50mm 1.8 prime and/or flash ) . this mid-level nikon lens ed glass decent build quality -- not cheap , but not tank-like either . lens extends way out 300 mm , you twist manual focus ring ( which bit stiff ) get it fully retract . plastic lens hood big cheap feel ( not lined velvet like tokina ) , but reverses carrying around . still , it nice sharp good bokeh reasonable value -- if you want better bokeh , go long prime . no macro capability like cheaper sigma apo variant but sometimes lenses better if you don't ask them too much . optical quality pretty consistent through entire zoom range , which good thing ; definitely nice piece glass , although not head-turner . it not quick lens 4- 5.6 , but what you expect $400 ? 2.8 ? yeah right . steady grip , it usable handheld out 200mm ; beyond shake noticeable . rubber grip ring balances nicely objects without worrying scratching finish braced shots . if you plan using it handheld fully extended , consider vr version , although you'll still want tripod longer exposures . 70mm bit tight wide end , but passable portraits . non-macro , it lets you get reasonably close shallow depth field . no noticable lens creep . not super lightweight , but not too heavy either . doesn't take up much more room bag then 18-70 . middle-of-the road most categories , except optical performance , which above average . good nature or wildlife w/tripod , or law-enforcement/private detectives , handheld " stakeout " surveillance shots ( which don't require perfect clarity ) . if you plan using it sports or action low light , good luck -- use speedlight tripod/monopod , set up spot , lock focus , wait subject come into view . wouldn't recommend it tracking quick-moving objects beyond 200mm . 70-300 ed super-sharp stopped down 5.6 -8 , beyond performance didn't really improve ; images just got bit more resonant . bottom line , you get some nice long shots this lens , which should good enough casual enthusiasts prosumers . it not pro lens , but then again , it doesn't cost what pro lens . you might able find it used fraction price , but it might worth it get warranty	1
why ? because i never recieved item i ordered . i recieved " globe trotter " charger . it charges okay but runs hot	-1
very easy operate . this camera takes beautiful pictures outside . lighting right inside	1
i really love this camera , yet , there few drawbacks , i would liked know prior purchasing : 1 ) it take time initialize finalize discs ( must plugged not moved so ) which isn't horrible , but somewhat annoying . 2 ) drawback battery life which pretty short ... although it lasts long 30 min . discs . 3 ) side camera just says dvd r/rw , but you must buy -r -rw discs +r +rw don't work ( learned after buying 5 discs wal-mart [ ... ] . ) i assumed either would work since camera doesn't specify either side . 4 ) thing odd camera says it 4.0 megapixels , all reviews manufacturers descriptions says it 4.3 mp ??? i'm sure it doesn't make much difference , but it bit misleading . 5 ) i also total 4 dvd players my house , only one play these little discs ... after i burned it regular size dvd , only one played , but it different dvd player , so go figure ??? all all , though , i really like this camera . i love still pics it takes i love sound quality which stereo !!! it sounds so good surround sound ! there lots neat features this camera software ... i made little halloween video added titles fades such made it look " old " . if you'd like see it here link ... it fairly short , but i got lots compliments it , i'm no camera expert !!! [ ... ] just copy paste link if you'd like see what you this package	1

there one imporant detail this camera , every time there scene transition image freezes half second , when your watching satellite image broadcasat gets momentarily interrupted . this not shown if you replay camera , but it after you transfer your video your pc or burn dvd . this mentioned manual normal , i even contacted sony customer support , they told me same thing . i believe you not like it . i returned mine , i dissapointed	1

this lens one nikon " best bang your buck " products . it very good telephoto zoom , unbeatable price , most amateur photographers find it quite satisfactory their needs . would i like $5000 telephoto ? would i like vr ? sure , but this best way there get very nice piece long nikkor glass tight budget . d40 owners , forget it , this not af-s lens	1
this camera lot going it , quality great low light sensitivity which important me indoor shooting . i get used cradle thing i don't normally stream live pc so not big concern me . camera compatible xp sp2 , just because driver doesn't microsoft " blessing " it still works perfectly . still imaging capability little less than i expecting , flash very close lens which forces you remove any kind additional lenses when using flash . i didn't find small zoom range very limiting but all my camcorders , wide angle lens must if you don't want force yourself up against wall trying get everyone video when shooting indoors . time lapse feature great ! also very good speed contol zoom lever , it very smooth . i wouldn't mind " couple " quick access buttons unit itself rather than use touchscreen menu each time , but able customize quick menu helps make most commonly used features more accessible . battery supplied gives me little more than hour constant use , certainly need one ! no memory card supplied unit either , that consistant though other sony products . overall i'm very happy this camera , it replacing previous model sony which quit working just over 1 year warranty so i didn't think twice before buying 4 year extended warranty	1
i really love my first digital camera ! i searched i searched i finally found what i wanted . pictures crystal clear , movie playback exceptional - you only hear what you're supposed , no loud background noise or static , no muffled noise . pictures come out so clear after you take picture you zoom 5x count pores your face ! i love it ! i don't think i could ask better camera . i hope this camera last me atleast 4 years or more or until i graduate college . if one market afford it , get this camera ! there cheaper cameras but if you want get camera , get good one , doesn't mean it expensive , but my opinion you get what you pay . thanks reading . happy buying	1
my sony dcr-dvd 105 fits exactly this bag . not big but just right	1
it alright first . i looking relatively cheap camera occasional picture taking . outside pictures okay , but indoor pictures horrid . however , after while , battery life drains too fast . honestly , invest better camera even if you want cheap one . this one doesn't last more than month	1
this cheap shotgun mic , also known boom mic . compared camcorder built-in mic this mic uni-directional , so it less susceptible ambient noise . naysayers here don't like it because they don't know what expect or how use it properly . you need read manual follow instructions , silly . sure use it one listed compatible sony camcorders ( although i also got it work hitachi model ) . sound quality same sony camcorder built-in mic -- that why i said this cheap -- but you imemediately notice improvement . trick point mic front end sound source . if i more money i'd bought sennheiser , but 45 bucks , this not bad all	1
i got digital keychain my wife , so she could carry pictures our 3 grandchildren . i download mac software tao website load photos , but everything then went pretty smoothly . my wife really likes resul t.t he hardware gets 5 stars - it works advertised , photos look pretty good very small screen . software gets 3 1/2 stars . it crashed once , but since then it stable . it good job letting me crop pictures ( which important , since only closeups useful small lcd screen ) . it took some trial error find out best way use software : 1 . select each desired photo , edit it add " collection " . 2 . transfer collection keycain . 3 . save collection file . 4 . when you later want add more photos , not open old collection . just start aother collection add new photos . then transfer additional photos keychain . if you add photos original collection , then transfer , you wll end up two copies your original photos keychain	1
bag pretty good , but it bit tight digital camera i bought . not flaw case , but not best ultra zoom type digital cameras	1

i just received this camera gift . i love idiot-proof menu . instruction guide actually readable . it feels like film slr , size perfect smaller hands ( my boyfriend finds buttons controls bit too cramped ) . image quality great , though i've not used it wide variety settings ( yet ) . feature which i love this camera flip screen . this appears most " advanced " digital camera this feature . artist model , i shoot myself alot . flexible flip-screen allows me get odd angles self portraits . my only complaint auto-release maximum 10 seconds ( making complex self-portaits difficult ) . i got remote shutter accessory , so hopefully this won't pose too much challenge my self-portraiture	1
only previous paper i used kodak paper ( some years ago ) , now no longer readily available . this paper not seem corner durability handling i used recall other paper i used	1
first i could not believe 3 hour time limit true because smaller batteries didn't even last 45 minutes using eye viewer . my surprise , this battery lasted over 3 hour limit i used tv viewer film . i sports videography i need something wouldn't run charge every hour becaue tournament action every game back back . this beyond what i wanted i ordered two when i really only needed one ! i must say this new battery i am not sure how long it takes charge start degenerate , etc . this good buy good price	1
i love this camera . color great , so fun makes me feel unique . screen great size , it takes great pictures . good red eye issue . menu great too , when you scroll thru things , it tells you what it so you don't memorize it all . takes fast pictures , but not one after , like i hoping . but it open fast . don't fooled big memory , you still need larger card . depending size pic you want , you take 30 50 pics memory alone . but all all i love this camera it great buy	1
gives camera whole new selection images all tele settings . excellent macro addition well . it looks cool too	1
i say , some things other reviewers written some truth them , but this battery much better alternative than using 2 aa batteries , regular or rechargeable . it retains charge longer than nimh type if put constant use . it great value compared just running through standard batteries . charger seem lightweight , but i don't see how matters when it charges battery efficiently , which it . nutshell , it worth money spent	1
i heartily agree first reviewer detailed accurate review -- but i'd like add i indeed buy red dsc-100 , it beautiful colorful masterpiece ! plus , it'll easier find , amongst all my black equipment !! thank you sony !	1
anyone wanting explore field photography , this camera ! i past experience olympus equipment , but this first digital side . i am impressed ! money not issue , but i still purchased factory refurbished camera . word street says refurbed products given 500% q.c. , therefore more reliable item . course , factory warranty only 90 days instead usual 1 year , but most reputable dealers give their sale additional year ( ask ! ) . , purchase extended warranty ; you never know . i 500+ shots so far , all i say wow ! olympus stood up tall proud this camera , you too if this camera you choose !! any accessories you decide , make them olympus well	1
i actively looking new digital camera since middle december 2006 . i am real nut when it comes gadgets , domonths worht research , comparing different products , before i buy anything . i simply want best , if it involves spending $40-50 then it . after months researching , reading every single review there , looking pbase , e.t.c. i two finalists : sd900 f31fdcriteria : 1 . camera small ... fit into jeans or shorts pocket2 . camera pretty fast3 . camera great battery life4 . most importantly , image quality superb compared other cameras its class . sd800 looks great paper , 7.1 , 3.8 wide , , fd , nice lcd , small ... it also felt pretty good when i played it store ... extremely fast . however , when i went pbase looked images people posted ( lot !!! ) i couldn ; find one single shot i liked . everything blurry unsharp , so even , i started getting headache looking screen . i truly dissapointed , especialy since rave online reviews ... but i understood reviews relative ... perhaps ( casio cameras :o )i looked all other cameras ( all them ) . panasonic nice ... but it too bulky , very plain . sd 900 felt great , super fast , awesome lcd , great looking camera , fd , 10 megapixels , fairly good photos , nice colors . however i spent exactly whole week comparing sd900 f31fd ... f31fd just beat it completely terms picture quality . if you go pbase look yourself , fuji always better . much sharper , high iso kill sd900 , tomy eye , colors more natural . battery life more than twice better fuji , it slightly shorter ( slightly ) . also , it cost less than canon . finally , i mde my move , bought f31fd . i received my camera today , i must say it super product . pros : 1 . exhudes quality when you hold it your hands , very non-flashy quality looking camera2 . pretty fast all functions . very responsive zoom , almost instantaneous , better than sd900 . 3 . i thought menu pretty well put together . 4 . i took almost 100 photos , quality unbeliavable , all pictures very sharp accurate colors , white balance works awesome . 5 . fd works perfectly well , just expected . cons1 . there small plastic door covers output input conncetions . it made out this plastic rubbery material , you sort stratch it out way plug usb cord . i definatley feel person who designed this door drunk when he , because camera tht great , fuji should either left ports open , or design somethig much better . i really feel this plastic door might break . i try update this review i go . but i must say all time i spent doing research paid off very well . i not regret buying this camera , this best camera you but its size-class .	1
my order received within few days -- price ok	1
i really like this camera , first time camcorder buyer it works great ! i issues low light capabilites also hd quality , but other than if you pick one up used or $450 it well worth it . it fun camera cary your pocket point shoot small clips . love you plug it via usb drag . mov files	1
this camera what it says it : it takes 16:9 pictures video 10.2 mp pictures ok resolutions video . it takes decent video , if you put it tripod . built-in stabilization worthless video mode you'll get palsy type shaking no matter what you . other words , this not replace your camcorder . picture mode , it good job most outdoors/indoors settings if you're not too picky lens distortions around corners highest resolution . this especially obvious if you take pictures where vertical objects appear near left or right edges frame ( like stop signs , light posts , building edge lines etc . ) all all , decent buy home use . not something look into if you'll frequently printing your pictures posterity or use professional publications	1
usual orion nice optics price . would work much better xt 4.5 " mount base . i've experimented this scope taking mirror cell out installing altitude bearings xt 4.5 . then installing xt 4.5 base mount . balance not issue such short focal length . high power views now easy track plus height liile better . if you love your starblast order xt 4.5 " mount base orion . probably under 100 bucks . my xt8 base 110 shipped . only thing you'll dig up used altitude bearings somebody . well worth work . i not suggest attempting this unless your absolutely sure what you make it work , drilling holes bearings , alighning bearings evenly side side , etc . but results grea	1
after purchasing based previous reviews , i bit underwhelmed after recieving this tripod , but what else you get $13 . if you plan using this video or time-lapse work , i would recommend finding thicker , sturdier model . i very small dv camcorder ( canon elura 100 ) am unable pan or tilt without jerking picture . also , if you raise telescopic part more than few inches , it becomes very shaky . all knobs locking parts totally plastic , so it wouldn't good use cold or rough use	1
i bought this camera last december houston . didn't enough time test it while there , but recently went trip island near coast salvador ( i'm brazil ! ) . i never saw such crisp , live , powerful pics before ! decided test its features found myself stunned quality power this little camera . i'm not professional photographer but my pics turned out best-sellers among my friends . i took 500 pics three days not even one came out bad shape . great cost-effective deal : not too expensive . amazing picture quality ( 10x optical zoom 7.1 megapixels ) . works wide range batteries ( aa , lithium dual pack , rechargeable )	1
i bought this rangefinder golf , but thought it might also work hunting . it small enough i keep it my pocket pull it out when needed . i tried it heavy brush , but find mixed results close range . you get good results objects beyond 50 yards utilizing " ignore close objects " function . i pulled it out rifle range today during snow shower pleasantly surprised get reading 101 yards my target bench 1 yard back firing line . snow not affect results rangefinder all ... probably more effect bullet path	1
this product fine - wish it smaller cord , but it detach charger make easier storage	1

i just got this camera last week my parents early graduation gift ( i'm fourteen ) i cannot put it down . i used nikon this camera kills it . there so many options this camera i love color accent color swap . i took picture my dog then turned her blue . pictures all come out really clear time shots quick , there setting change time shots camera ! but my favorite part , far , 3 " lcd . it makes all pictures sharper clear . i looking canon sd630 but i know somebody who it i personally think this one better due fact this one new model it less bulky . i'm very happy my camera i hope this helps you when looking camera	1
this digital picture frame great value . frame itself quality look it operation aspect it easy use . picture quality good well . only reason i give it 4 stars speaker quality ... not great but adequate , which not really issue me since i wanted frame primarily displaying pictures wedding . overall , great value quality product	1
i bought this camera trip down under couple month ago i really impressed image quality . it takes great low light pictures steady shot technology works really well longer shutter times . camera very small but feels solid hand due excellent construction unlike some casio ultra-compacts . well worth extra cost	1
i found sony i-link most suitable sony hdv camcorder . i use fx1 1080i recorded signals , others could not match sony high data transfer rate	1
i think this optical instrument should mandatory all golf courses . just ipods obviated cds , this device completely obviate need yardages sprinkler heads like . here my normal round without bushnell pinseeker : i drive out fairway -- hopefully -- then find sprinkler head . there i pace it off my ball . i get yardage , but that center green . my home course i go pin sheet which crude outline green four numbers green -- back left , back right , front left , front center . now , assuming we're playing back left number , i some speculative math determine how far back left pin , add yardage ... you get picture . what waste time !! bushnell zeroes flag gives me exac t-t o-the-pin yardage every time . not get cheaper versions optics not good it almost impossible lock flag -- you terribly disappointed if you get under $200 one . one factors slope not usga legal . i just finished round famous riviera c.c. i caddy . he calculating yardages both me my partner he amazingly accurate , but time he wasted pacing off yardages sprinkler heads ... whenever someone hit it right or left eucalyptuses he relied heavily my bushnell yardages . he not spot-on his distances . this far best new thing i put my bag . it little pricey but then no one thinks spending $400 new driver nothing improve their swing . one thing bushnell really refine my iron distances . i'm single digit handicap this beautiful little instrument just fantastic addition . i don't work company i think their cheaper products garbage . but this little guy beaut	1
canon xl2 showing up alot complaining reviews , complaints realted it less than perfect imagery . what ive seen , fact dvx100b hard heck find says alot which one better . i find it very odd great number these cameras sold numerous retailers brooklyn who go names like express , photosweep , camera city .... seems like one dealer using multiple names varied prices . if you need dvx100b , its best buy established dealer . but no one beat 24p quality this camerta . better deal than new hd cameras which don't even 24p adjustment	1
olympus 740 great camera . it easy use auto mode also gives opportunity set camera specific shots if one chooses . only drawback it very difficult see screen bright sunlight . i am enjoying 740 wonderful results	1
we not big users technology . this bundle very inexpensive allows us produce printed photos nearly no effort . camera straight-forward use , though not sleek some we've seen	1
good backup battery available . used it after other battery ran out power when away recharger	1
if you looking good small camera , no intentions ansel adams , this good camera choice . i travel alot , this camera perfect because it fit my pockets or small purse . it also takes pretty good pictures	1
this camera takes awesome pictures , even long distances infinity mode . just got some pics moose 1/2 mile away . only complaint i battery usage . i've camera powered probably 20 minutes total , it shut off due ' low battery ' . testing batteries indicated ~ 80% power left , so i don't know if there flaw camera power sensor or what .	1
i took my first pictures ever using this film it came out looking all right . i suppose it wasn't crystal clear , but probably my fault . i also think it problems low light . my fault ? probably . who knows , it nice get it developed target , though	1
i love this camera . it lots features doesn't go through batteries real fast . pictures clear not fuzzy . you panorama stick them together . wonderful feature . my only regret i could not afford one more zoom	1
very easy use , customers should informed when purchasing lenses adapted required .	1
highly recommended . very nice job without taking big dent your wallet . i bought this one after reviewing others ' comments am very satisfied . even batteries last well :	1
million words written this thing , this not attempt comprehensive review , so look above or dpreview-com complete info . i looked canon , nikon , pentax sony dslrs . sony makes sense if you already bag full minolta lenses , which i don't . canon nikon put their image stabilization lens , which makes their ' good ' lenses significantly more expensive . canon eos not backward-compatible their old fd lenses , which i -do- bagful . pentax backward-compatible all k-mount lenses made since 1970s , even take 645 6x7 lenses , adapters . sooo , i set out ease into dslr ownership k100d , then started reading reviews , it bunch little things made me want k10d . viewfinder actual prism , not mirror cage like cheaper cameras , displays backlit , low-res mode ( 1800 1200px ) exactly what i want certain applications . 10 mpx , i point shoot if i , crop ( somewhat ) more later . controls more ' classic ' camera-like than ' scene modes ' beginner cameras . not say this would worth price difference everyone , but i bought k10d , pentax 12-24mm / 4.0 lens , am very happy both . digital cameras use less image projected lens , so your lenses ' longer ' than they would film camera . downside : ' journalist lens ' , buy 12-24mm , which equivalent 18-36mm film camera . upside : my old 50mm / 1.4 now equivalent top-of-the-line portrait lens i never felt i could afford . pentax plans introduce 2007 16-50mm / 2.8 50-135mm / 2.8 , which sound fantastic - but let see what they cost before we get too excited . meanwhile , sigma , tokina , tamron offer some very adequate alternatives . camera lens together pretty heavy , just like older slr , led screen cannot used live viewfinder - no image gets sensor while mirror down - so you hoist camera your eye compose shot . no problem , i'm used it , it common all dslrs . (( my personal feeling slr platform just . it hard see need mirror box digital camera , which use actual sensor compose shot through lens display it back . future top-end digital cams probably lot flatter , like old rangefinder cameras . look olympus e330 or panasonic dmc-l1 see what direction i think we should headed . )) said , i am very happy pentax k10d , it behaves it supposed , affordable ( barely ) 12-24mm rectilinear lens unthinkable just few years ago . this camera ton half features capabilities , i am still sorting them out . there definitely learning curve if you get most out camera , but there also two full program modes , including ' green zone ' , so you start shooting right away good results . pictuers come out great . colors , brightness , contrast need almost no adjustment or photoshop-ing , which not true any other digi-cam i ever owned . happy this , until next big thing comes	1
i sony hi-8 camcorder ten years now , genereally pleased it . however , i wanted go digital . i didn't want spend too much money , certainly not my first digital venture . i lot online reading , got impression hdd cameras didn't perform too well , mini dvd limits your time , so went minidv . i camera just over week time writing . pros : good clear image . audio quality . nightshot plus . ilink . small size . ease use . 40x optical zoom . cons : sony accessories , particularly batteries far too expensive . i shall looking 3rd party sources . no headphone jack . no accessory shoe . cannot control playback except via touch screen lcd . no firewire cable supplied . cannot charge batteries off camera without purchasing seperate charger . comments . it comes some basic editing software cd , but i cannot comment this , i adobe premiere 1.5 , i am using this no problem all . if you want transfer your video into your computer , you need firewire cable . usually pc you need 4 pin 6 pin one . you buy them amazon much cheaper than local stores , so i recommend ordering one if you decide buy camcorder . all all , i am pleased it so far terms video audio quality . one annoyance . if you buy battery , you also need buy charger , power supply you get camera only charge batteries whilst they camera . this isn't much use if , example , you want charge battery home , while you use fresh one outdoors . extra chargers around $40 , well cost battery course . time you buy extra battery , off-cam charger , case , couple filters , firewire cable , you almost double cost cam itself !	1
my husband got this me present i love it . easy use .	1

this camera fierce competition canon xl1s . it features you need , sony name , flawless transfer . warning ! : this not amateur home videoer . parameters begging tweaked - just fun . settle handycam if you're just filming billy soccer game . this one right here made used . good media students , career filmers/editors , anyone who wants really some interesting fun ... sony doesn't disappoint this one	1
this tiny camera fits pockets , purses center consoles easily . such , you more likely this you than , say , your digital hasselblad ten lenses . if aliens land street front you , you get shot your s3 , not big camera home . small camera also discreet . people tend react when you point big impressive looking camera them , but hardly notice small s3 rectangle . it not attract too much attention itself or me good thing . there two ways use this camera : one simply keep it automatic , shoot lots shots well-lit scenes delete bad ones . this very effective technique used even many professionals . automation hard beat . or , one actually read understand manual practice all functions again again until it all becomes second nature . there lots modes like portrait landscape , even exotic ones fireworks such . each mode specific automatic settings optimize results . full automatic just fine most subjects , but if you want something special , shot could really something , then it worth time get into proper mode . how i using s3 results fine . some reviewers complain blurry shots . no modern camera blurs anything still well-lit . blur results slow shutter speeds relative camera shake or subject movement . s3 little lens requires slower shutter speed compensate , allow all light needed sensors capture image . handheld shots slow shutter speeds blurry any camera . we used seeing big serious cameras tripods little carefree cameras used handheld . actually , it more likely little camera should one tripod . addition their small lenses , their light weight small size make them harder hold still . note , too , flash freezes movement eliminates blur . however , tiny cameras small flashes not much range so not work prevent blur longer ranges . my first twilight photos s3 attempted me holding it against trees , pressed car roofs , etc . only good results came when i used tripod fired it off using self timer so human hands not all involved . usual daylight shots people , scenes things not problemmost my prints 4x6 really very sharp well exposed either automatic or manual modes . i avoid shots not well lit or too far away flash . prints generally much better than what i used get 35mm . it reasonably fast little lag time or waiting images loaded . camera itself metal very solid precise . s3 comes little dock ac plug charge it usb cable downloads your computer . some people not like idea you take dock you recharge download road . me this not problem dock very small anyway it better all those connections dock rather than tiny camera . i perfect luck so far nikon photographic products tend trust brand , so i bought s3 over some other very compelling models . nikon also very good job programming exposure , focus , white balance , etc . i thought maybe 4 stars because little light camera use vibration reduction all modes , but really effective full time vr would likely cost more i not missed it anyway . if you need what this camera lacks , then you step up bigger much more expensive dslr . you spend more , carry more get more . it works way film it digital well . i would like dslr also , but s3 excellent camera lot options make great photos it would get lot use , even if i elusive digital hasselblad , just because it would always me	1
i bought pink case my mom , i bought her new hp digital camera christmas . it so cute , camera fits it perfectly	1
i took long shot buying this thing because little or no online information it . hopefully this gives you good idea what bag like so you don't aimlessly search internet its product features - like i . i wanted bag genuine ( canon ) held all my stuff so i wouldn't separate bags each individual item . cpb-100 case plenty room all my digital camera accessories : camera ( powershot s70 ) , printer ( cp-220 ) , cards ( 3 compact flash cards ) , battery charger ( cb-2lt ) , all 6 my manuals , printer cleaner , printer charge chords . all items fit into slot some sort - they aren't randomly tossed into bag . there 4 compartments : very large , extra padded , zip compartment ( large , padded 2 slots ) your printer some other large accessory ( i put my printer chords here ); large , zip compartment 3 sleeves ( i put battery charger printer cleaner first , camera second , 3 memory cards third ); medium , front , zip compartment books or flat accessories ( i put my 4x6 printer card holder 4 product manuals ) . there also small , velcro compartment back which i put 2 more small 3x5 manuals into . i still extra room ( though not much ) place more accessories . quality very durable water-repellent canvas front straps appear faux leather - front straps clip shut magnet clips . shoulder strap padded shoulder rest extend plenty your height . bottom 4 plastic plates keep it upright , keep it getting dirty , when placed ground . i fit bag perfectly my accessories . i'd recommend bag if you close or equal amount items i - unless , course , you want haul around extra bags some reason : ) . good luck shopping !	1
dock makes transferring photos charging camera battery snap . if you don't dock you don't know what you're missing , but it great addition . i've owned many kodak products satisfied each every one so far . this dock accessories no exception	1
since i really only few small gripes , i'll list them first ! indoor quality isn't great -- even ' fix ' listed below -- colors mostly washed out so picture looks nearly black white , depending how much light available when you adjust white balance , it almost take sepia tone appearance . also , low-light situations , camera seems ' search ' something focus , causing subject blur out over over . other than , i've very happy my purchase . i lot online searching thru models here amazon , read tons reviews many different cameras , this one seemed most positive feedback . pros : excellent outdoor daytime ( well lit ) indoor shooting . amazingly smooth zoom ! even 32x detail amazing ! very easy use out box , easy understand menu ! excellent design , great attention detail ! very small light ! love 20 gigabyte hdd memory ! very easy pc interface , quick transfer files . power producer works easily windows movie maker . packed features i haven't even discovered yet ! needless say , i really am not disappointed my purchase . anyone who thinks they should able get feature-film quality small , compact camcorder less than $500 disillusioned naive !	1
i just needed case my camera ( s90 ) , i wasn't going pay 40-60 dollars some leather case . inside case feels like blanket , except it happens paddded . it won't stop stampede , but any common bumps ( inside car/bag ) should cause no problems . front pocket netted sleeve , kind like ones behind car seats keep magazines , etc . it good because it keeps your batteries memory moving around too much . my camera pretty sturdy itself , but i getting tired it flying around my car unprotected . no worries now , i get carry extra pair batteries me convenient place . i give it 4 stars simply because it its job , it case , it protects my camera . if it some ridiculous padding would allow me throw camera around not worry , then i would give it 5 stars . if you don't need case diamonds it , this fine buy	1
i normally prefer purchasing canon or sony when i shop around cameras . i bought this casio primarily gifting relative ( novice photographer ) , so i not worry reviews barrel distortion i came across many forums . price i paid , i am happy product . form factor excellent 3x optical zoom decent . barrel distortion plainly visible many photos , which reason i believe this camera phased out more expensive z7x series . other than barrel distortion , i am quite happy product itself	1
this very cool camera it really good design . it 7.2 megapixels it anti shake . very good kids adults who new photography , or good anyone who just wants nice sleek design very good photo quality	1
this lens sharp primary lens . it only draw back need side flash	1
wow ... this such great case . fits my d40x tightly , but still room extra memory card , etc . material very good , well . great deal , great case	1
just described panasonic digital camera . excellant constuction , good fit , handy all battery chip storage	1
when you buy product designed meant fulfill certain needs , just expect best performance out those features . pc55 camera everyday home shooter , easy use made best sony quality one smallest mini dv camera ever created . if you thinking buying this camera don't hesitate one minute , this camcorder one kind , it gives you pretty much flexibility video quality regular camcorder but amazing bring-it-in-the-pocket size all coolness attention it brings ( let it your best ice breaker , believe me it works like heaven ! ) . i work camera store let me tell you : we haven't received one return this model during time i've worked there ( 8 months ) , which proves high quality sony built into this model . i using mine few months now all i say " product great ... period ! " . let get real , 500 bucks you paying it not film quality kind movie you get picture ( you need spend least couple thousand dollars ) but portability worriless no need big luggage camcorder used past " ( some times people don't realize motorcycle couldn't compared truck or vise versa ) . picture shooting option , well let see ! camcorder videos digital camera photos , if you want them both one package , brings excellent quality , you'd spend lot more money than if you bought them separately , let me explain you few words , average photo quality mini dv camcorder 1.3 mp or lower ( same quality you get out your cell phone camera ) honest you , manufacturers add this option just give it extra feature same time take more money out your pocket , tape less digital cameras it happens same way , video sound quality very poor ; so why bother paying more camera both functions excellent ( there quite few out market now , starting around $1200 models similar size ) instead buy two little cameras , one each use , half price . if you looking cool , high quality durability mini dv camcorder smallest size available its kind , sony dcr-pc55 your best option . finish , i just want wish you all enjoy , more than product , unmemorable moments you live your loved ones because this little fellow	1
got my hands one these babies this weekend no-budget short film . loved it . so easy use , picture great . it true , finished look not " cinematic " , which fair criticism , but price it great if you're looking upgrade high-def digital picture . watched playback 16:9 widescreen tv before editing it beautiful . however , you can't rely auto-functions . tried using auto-focus auto-iris start , but ended up doing both manually most part . small complaint considering real filmmaker shouldn't using them anyway . otherwise , great camera	1
just got camera what i've seen so far it wonderful piece equipment . my only complaint amazon misrepresented battery type saying it , " powered en-el3a or en-el3 " which not true disappointing anyone who upgrading camera use those batteries ( ie d70 ) d200 uses en-el3e which doesn't same fit en-el3a or en-el3 . aware this if you upgrading	1
panasonic sdr-s150 wonderful camera . i am extremely happy it - recommend it everyone . popular mechanics magazine named it best its class - i completely agree . i bought mine end september 2006 usingit every day last 3 months . sales person jr store recommended it me , based customers feedback - i am grateful him good advice . camera makes very decent videos . excellent optics , 3-ccd , true image stabilization their job . videos bright , sound excellent . but most important me how easy it work cameraand video clips once you made them . one use cable software provided camera , but i like things simple . i take sd card out , insert it into a$10 usb card reader - copy files onto my computer mouse . then i rename clips - i change extension mod into mpg . these clips true mpeg-2 format , which same format regular dvds . so many dvd players natively play thoseclips without any editing or converting . also most computersyou simply double-click clip make it play . if not - youcan dowload one many free or low-cost software players . i like vlc player ( just google vlc player ) - it isavailable both window mac it free . i made our grandmothers very happy . i burn collection video clips our baby regular cd ( yes , cd , not dvd ) - mail them . they play those video clips computer or dvd player ( portable phillips good choice ) . camera very easy operate . built-in battery lasts ~ 70 min ( use spare one or use included power supply if you need more ) . camera also makes decent still photos . i many more expensive cameras home ( photo video ) , but i found once i bought this camera i use it almost exclusively . partly becase ease convenience . this camera i don't need huge disks , powefull cpus , lotsof ram , or hours video editing . it makes your video productionvery easy fun . camera comes its own editing software . i prefer use adobe premier elements ($99 ) . there also some good software macs . so i easily make videos titles menus , ormake mp4 or flash videos ipod or web . cons : 1 . no input external microphone . but built-in stereo microphone very good - i tested it making recording concert violin - then extracting audio analyzing it using adobe audition software . recording very clean , because there no motors camera . 2 . compression artefacts visible when you making fast movements camera . this rare , though . camera mounted standard tripod . it very light small . overall - i really enjoy it .	1
this camera exelent camara . it plenty effects , plenty modes , plenty scenery options . image quality 3.2 megapixel , but its quite good . pictures you take without flash end up getting bit blury , where if you take it flash , it comes out exelent . sometimes it takes long time picture get taken out flash , sometimes it happens imediatly . but all these flaws only my version . but if you looking good camera great price , this your best option	1
love camera though still trying work details using color various settings . ease basic use wonderful . pictures excellent but what i like best compact stylist package . paid only $180 circuit city made investment bearable .	1
camera all features you could want : - shoots great video- excepts 4gb sd cards- record d1 resolution @ 30fps ( i confirmed it my video editing software)- usb recharge ( or ac adapter ) all included ! - tv output- led lights ( yes , they actually useful ) . - digital photos actually good . - 3x optical zoom videos really nice , but keep mind , these not meant replace professional more expensive camcorders . videos sunlight very good . low light shots not good , but not worst when you compare it other offerings . just sure you least 60 watts light . compare video other camcorder hybrids under $200 , you can't beat this one . there no indication how much space or minutes you left shoot . its annoying , but if you buy 2gb sd card , camera run out batteries before you run out space . led lights fact useful . don't except them light up room . its not because light not bright enough , its because lights create small patch light . hey , its better then nothing . sound nice clear , not muffled like other model , is-dv2 model . but here comes biggest issue ... loud noisy focusing . i'm not talking zooming feature ( 3x optics ) , i'm talking when you move camera new subject . camera constantly consistently auto-focuses when anything changes view lens , but it makes such loud noise mic picks it up . it ruins video . unless if your rock concert , your going hearing scratching noises throughout your video . yes , it loud distracting . it makes scratching like noise . camera takes few seconds focus , but every time you move it slightly , or your subjects move , camera tries focus again , it makes scratching sound . i believe its because mic so sensitive , it picks up vibrating mechanical focusing unit lens . there no option " lock " focus . they , would least remedy issue somewhat . aiptek should resolved this issue even before manufacturing it . if i ceo/president company , i would very embarrassed . i understand these " cheap " cameras , but $200 their not exactly cheap price . they should least fixed loud focus issue before selling it . i really liked mz-dv features , i thought i could live focusing noise . but every single video i shot annoying noise , so i ended up returning it . i would avoid this model until aiptek releases better model , or replaces noisy mechanical focus . other model , which same mz-dv , except it lower megapixel rating , aiptek zoom dv , same focus noise issue . so i would avoid model also .	1

300mm this lens very soft , it hard get shot looks like it focus . so , you need shoot f/11 , then since there little light available , you usually bump iso 800 or 1600 just get acceptable shutter speed . course , high iso then introduces other artifacts . focus also dead slow often doesn't lock . this lens i constantly fought . don't upgrade new 70-300 either , it only marginally better . buy 70-200 f/4l . it far superior lens	-1
i bought this lens based super telephoto ability low cost . you truly get what you pay , this thing isn't worth plug nickel . i took few shots tripod could not believe how terrible this lens @ 300mm ( 480mm digital rebel xt ) . incredibly soft . even stopped down , i would never want make enlargement it . stay away . don't believe fools who novices , you disappointed this lens . you're much better off buy older used 100-300mm 5.6 ( version costs more too ) but both so much better than this junker . you're even more crazy if you think you take decent photo this lens handheld . switched nikon when switching digital , i almost judged canon this one lens , which i'm glad i didn't . don't waste your money or learn hard way like i . this lens also terrible purple fringing , almost bad kit 18-55mm . after extensive research testing i now own am happy following canon lenses : canon 10-22mmcanon 28-105mm ( 3.5 version)canon 100-300mm ( 5.6 non-l version ) i sell version when i afford it . kit 18-55mm makes usable shots , but when i could afford it , i sold it too . you get better results buying rebel xt older 100-300mm than you would brand new xti this terrible 75-300mm lens .	-1
i bought this lens pretty excited it , but i've disappointed . previous this i bought 50mm 1.8 $70 lens completely puts this one shame . i need wider angle lens went this one , but all too often found myself quite disappointed results . edges subjects all messy just looked terrible , even higher stops . i shoot 20d . usm awesome though sure option whatever lens i choose buy place this one . focal range 28-105 also very nice , but me picture quality not so good	-1
great idea poorly executed . construction cheap . screen marginal best . but worst all , it refuses recognize any 3 digital cameras i hand or usb card reader . piece junk i am now returnin	-1
i agree . arse 2star rating . i disappointed this camera beginning . not user friendly one pictures turn out very grainy bad color quality unless you optimum light . i'm interested 7 mp camera canon offers . i've read it much better shutter speed . recommended ??	-1
i am fascinated this machine . it incredible detail although it lacks little lattitude details lost soon there some shadows . battery so far usually lasts me whole day when i go touring . if i take care shut display down soon i dont need it anymore i find when i am cruise ship or visiting country i take all movies i usually want - - recharge when i get back my room night . only problem playback tv or pc . bundled software made ulead not user friendly , whereas previous xacti i played back images video clips order i taken , this one separates them plays back either clips or images . before i played back through my panasonic hard disk dvd recorder recorded dvd directly . now i go into my pc whole lot editing so far " movie factory " program keeps crashing . i imagine somebody eventually suggest better software program , or i learn use ulead , but time pictures clips ihave taken very good detail , machine operated flawlessly .	-1
very slow storage even fast card .... small but too thick comfortable handling . i ended up selling it ebay buying canon sd600 which great camera , thin enough fit your shirt pocket , fast storage images battery lasts very long time . i've charged it once taken many many holiday pictures . don't buy nikon without first checking out canon sd600 .	-1
this awesome little camera . except you can't use it night ! there horrible white spots nighttime photos when flash used . apparently these appear because flash so close lens this camera , so dust reflects badly . it known problem [ ... ] also , it totally annoying sony uses all their proprietary technology . result , cable connecting this camera computer unwieldly ( uhh , you heard usb ??!! ) , you buy sony memory stick , which probably won't work anything else you . flipside , you take movies aren't limited 30 seconds this guy - i think might result memory stick technology . but other than , design operation this little guy seems pretty slick . lens not one those pops out , so not sure if affects image quality all , but far i could tell , quality good . end , what good camera can't take usable pictures its flash ??	-1
i purchase this instrument twice . first time there black specks lense , so it returned . second time worst , i.e. same black specs but thing didn't work all . i also checked this manufacturer other models out most come disturbing black specks lense . this isn't quality optical product	-1
i bought this camera my 13-year old son take him soccer trip bermuda . it ok . felt sort cheap , but seemed like it would what it supposed . big drawback .... there no lens cover slips into place when picture isn't shot , so danger scratching lens immense . my son so afraid scratching lens , he barely used it . some few pictures he take ok , but others not best quality . i think this camera bit too costly what you get , i'm surprised , because i usually love samsung products	-1
ordered two frames third party source . neither them worked all . it nightmare trying return them refund	-1
this s80 used only wide angle compact point shoot digital camera market . it now discontinued i'm told . but , we're luck ! there three other digital point shoot cameras real 28mm wide angle lens ! these : 1 ) panasonic dmc-fx01 $250 , 2 ) canon powershot sd800 $400 . , 3 ) kodak easyshare v570 $350 . so , you ask , " who needs 28mm lens ? " you ! most people concern themselves how long their telephoto lens . but , most people who " know " know it wide angle lens most important --- most " best shots " made wide angle lens . example , you're europe you trying " get shot " cathedral notre dame over there . you need wide angle lens . you california poppy fields you want get expanse golden-yellow poppy flowers huge blue sky filled white clouds above --- you need wide angle lens . you sitting thanksgiving dinner you want take photo foot table everyone sitting left right --- you need wide angle lens . you garden california mission you want take photo entire garden surrounded mission walls --- you need wide angle lens . it christmas day you want photo entire group visitors front christmas tree --- you need wide angle lens . this where 28mm lens this camera comes ! so , you need this camera ! otherwise you'll cutting off heads leaving aunt sylvia out " christmas group photo " this year --- she'll disinherit you result not wide angle lens you'll live life poverty misery everafter ! :o ) if you agree or disagree or know any other digital point shoot camera wide angle lens please write , email : boland7214 @aol . here one more wide angle candidate : kodak easyshare v705 7.1 mp digital camera 5x ultra-wide-angle dual-lens optical zoom	-1
normally i wouldnt write review , but i numerous experiences this camera i thought i would share . my sister first bought camera , i amazed how user friendly it i thought pictures turned out pretty well . shortly afterward , her screen blacked out , without any great impact or weather damage . naturally , i assumed it mustve gotten bumped wrong way , tough luck . i then proceeded buy one myself , couple months after i it , my screen also inexplicably failed work . then christmas , my sister received replacement camera her broken one , yet again , shortly after purchase , screen broken . i accept some responsibility damage , i imagine if it purse bookbag , perhaps it got rattled around bit . but three times ? i dont find this coincidence , i not reccomend you risk your money , because you too may replace it after 3 months	-1
is-dv only records videos ' asf ' format , not mpeg-4 . i bought one ' egghead.com ' . after 30 days , i contacted aiptek tell them problem , they acknowledged is-dv only records videos ' asf ' format . they said there nothing they it . not buy this product . aiptek advertises is-dv records video mpeg-4 format , but it doesn't . ' egghead.com ' won't deal me because they say i should deal manufacture after 30 days purchase date	-1
this product didn't appear add any appreciable sound benefit ; sound ecm-hgz1 appears same recorded native audio camera itself . i wish i not bought it	-1
noise problem this camera horrendous . not buy it ! if you take close-up picture eye you not able see eyelashes clearly ... never . no matter how hard you try . my 3-year old 5mpx sony much better than this panasonic camera . i am sorry i bought it . i would return this product if i could buy good camera instead . lumix dmc-lx2 camera cannot focus one bit , many pictures out focus made worse noise problem . even motion smother function turned many pictures come out blurred . noise very noticeable graininess appearing very readily . you tweak quality enhancing features sharpness , noise reduction , contrast saturation all you want but these worthless reduce noice sharpness problem . amazon website says you use standard sd memory which untrue(perhaps this corrected now ) . camera only accepts more expensive sdhc ( high capacity ) cards . these sdhc cards cannot read standard memory stick readers so i use usb port which takes forever download even handful pictures my computer .	-1
i am far expert however even amatuer this lens horrible . i took 400 shots my digital rebel xt got so frustrated witht poor quality auto focus i immediately returned it / got refund . all but brightest lighting conditions this lens extremely slow autofocus . many cases lens could not focus continually hunted through it entire range . since most my photography animals i simply could not wait autofocus work missed many shots . i tested autofocus against my canon 18-55 ef-s ( packaged rebel xt ) canon 75-300 ef . every instance where tamron could not focus canon lenses no problem ! when tamron would focus i found pictures not sharp my canon lenses . again i'm far expert however i only printing 4x6 photos . i replaced tamron quantaray(sigma ) 55-200 dc which proven very good autofocus great optical quality(for amatuers .. ) bottom line .. it hard part tamron because i really enthused zoom range however i would much prefer use 2 lenses focus than 1 doesn't . i read many reviews same problem noted . tamron needs get thier act together	-1
this kit conveniently contains 20 sheets photo paper . unfortunately , kodak doesn't contain ink cartridge them . fine , i thought , i'll buy separate cartridge . guess what ? you can't! kodak only sells cartridges bundled paper so you forced use their paper . why they sell paper separately but not ink cartridges ? seems pretty dirty	-1
this camera easy use it light decent quality picture audio , however , i unable make copies back-up or share family members . i took it back bought mini-dv camcorder i told it easier make copies . this yet tested	-1
hp selling this bag $30 bucks , so when i found it here $10 less i couldn't let this " deal " pass me ... however when i received bag , i wished i ... color less vibrant , it cheap , poor quality , plus hp isn't embroidered bag ... walk away this bag get blue black hp bag instead , it costs little bit more but it well worth it !!	-1
we purchased this camera overall it good camera . it took excellent outside video not great performer low light conditions but not atypical today reasonably priced minidv camcorders . however after six months lcd screen suddenly stopped working . it not mishandled otherwise camera works great . we sent it last november panasonic authorized service center . they returned it three months later unrepaired because part not available . we out $100 labor fees plus we still broken camera less than year old . i only share this warning potential buyers . panasonic not honor our warranty	-1
i received this gift first i thought it great , but then i realized it would only display 142 images . i worked technical support several months ( they not speediest or most helpful ) . i resized , renamed , restructured photos , tried them different media finally they admitted it bug . i rma'd unit my shipping expense course , only recieve same problem . i wouldn't recommend this purchase	-1
i own many sony products , including sony cybershot dsc-f717 , which i love . however , i am very disappointed this camera , sony cybershot dsc-t5 . i bought t5 my mother father present . it small , lightweight , portable ; easy use ; stylish . it take nice photos brightly lit environments , especially outside . however , after several months use , few problems become consistently evident : ( 1 ) there horrible red-eye ( white-eye ) artifact many pictures . so-called " red-eye reduction " setting nothing . ( 2 ) dim-light photography very grainy , lots noise . nigh t-t ime photography impossible . these problems not unique our camera ... you find many corroborating reviews above . overall , i am very disappointed this camera , wish i could exchange it something else . not buy this camera . other reviewers suggest t7 or t9 take much better pictures ( they still small pocket-size cameras ) .	-1
this worst camera i've ever owned . i'm not exaggerating . i'm so upset wasting money it . only pictures turn out , outside bright daylight . it takes horrible pictures low light , there high level noise photos . video mode moves out its own , ruining video . i sometimes get colored lines down right side videos . my friend $88 dollar digital camera takes way better pictures than this thing . it just plain sucks .	-1
i haven't got this item because it too expensive what it gives . i fujifilm e550 camera which cost usd 250.00 this date . this lens cost usd 95.00 it need special adapter ring cost extra usd 20.00 . means you pay usd 365.00 8x zoom camera . price or less you get +10x slr like camera like fujifilm s5100 or s5200 .	-1
straight out box disappointment extremely poor quality . plug into wall not work . after trying numerous different outlets/wiggles cord , it finally powered . after putting card , pics ok , passable . mp3 popped moaned popped some more , i only playing very quiet jazz . this not worth money even though it cheap . pay little more get one better quality	-1
there currently known issue many sony camcorders . this called " black screen death " . what happens camera works great 1-2 years then ccd goes out like light . camera not take video again . sony evasive if not downright deceitful this issue when you call tech support . fact sony not stand behind their product . if this happens you , sony not own defect you out hundreds dollars . there lengthy thread cnet this issue . search sony black screen . wishing you luck purchase your ( not sony ) video camera , scot	-1
i olympus fe 100 camera battery not fit ! my niece olympus fe 140 camera battery not fit hers either ! company not accept returns batteries opened so i just out luck	-1
this great camera . plenty resolution . excellent shot speed . sturdy frame . kit lense doesn't camera justice . buy body separate add better lense . bad side , i small glitch camera firmware soon after purchase return it fix . it two months before camera returned . sorry , canon ... you lose star	-1
this first lens i've owned . i trouble justifying extra expense but am now quite pleased i took step up . keep mind tis ef not ef-s lens . this makes its effective focal length 45-215mm my digital rebel . i love zoom range ( great shooting action shots kids without getting their faces ) ability easily control depth field my nature shots . just uploaded some my recent shots this lens under " share your own customer images " . pete leclair http://www.agentz.com/digitalimagesbyjpl	1
i bought this camera same reason many you considering it , or already bought it--it size . it amazingly small , it hard believe all packed into this camera . i take it me everywhere , literally , it so small i am able keep it my pocket , i don't fear it get ruined my pocket because it so durable . there also small covering lens , so you need not worry lens get scratched . picture quality surprised me , when i first saw this camera i saw how small it instantly assumed picture quality would not good -- but i wrong ! picture quality this camera outstanding ( taking its ' size price into consideration ) . however , i few things complain ... first off , battery . this camera uses lithium battery , i find lithium batteries highly inconvenient ; because what if you vacation , where nearest place buy batteries just gas station -- there no way you going find lithium batteries there . not only it inconvenient , but also battery life span short . longest i've it work 1 hour 45 minutes . this isn't uncommon cameras , though , just long you bring your charger spare batteries , you should fine . problem i this camera zoom function . such small zoom length you would think zoom would silent since it hardly zooms ... wrong ! very wrong . zoom function this camera so loud sometimes you unable use it if you find yourself situation where you must quiet . even just turning camera move lens little , resulting noisy start-up . flash very weak . really dissapointing . if you inside , you can't any farther away then 10 feet lit room . last problem i found this camera macro function . auto-focus camera seems trouble focusing subject . make matters work , there no manual override overcome this problem . focus great , though , if you not taking macro sho t.t hese all flaws i found camera , it not my first choice cameras , i come across many other beginner cameras i prefer over this camera , but thing you keep mind this camera size . if you just looking something keep you all times , then this great camera choice .	-1
first all i not consider myself anything more than very beginning photographer !!! so i not go into anything technical . i leave people who know more than i . but what i am international traveler . i simply got tired coming home fantastic trips " snapshots " . i wanted someting much better , boy i get it this camera . i looked d70s since i very small hands , i could never feel comfortable holding it . this camera smaller without small . i only taken photos locally , but this time year leaves changing it makes good start . built editing features ( filters etc . ) wonderful work . i would highly recommend this camera anyone who wants something more than " point shoot " snap shots	1
wonderful camara , excellent characteristics , ample selection accessories available protected one you lead manufacture camaras lenses	1
i am thrilled this lens capabilities pictures it . i test shot corner window determine if it would good my insect shots i like so well . well , it great it came but i found i wanted 1/1 capability so i bought add-on converter am thrilled added both these necessary items my set-up . i like nature photography best like use my off summer days hiking finding photographs take perhaps well-known places but finding unique angles subjects what i like specialize . this lens greatly enhance your experience ' little world ' we commonly trod over or weed-ate away . i built diffuser using ping-pong ball over flash so lighting would work better . ( works great , btw ) . usual , it great canon glass trick	1
i spent alot time evaluating this product . finally after reading reviews i dug deep spent extra dollars get this lense . it wounderful addition my canon reble . it very high quality product easy use delivers beautiful shot every time .	1
i bought this lens little over year ago macro shooting . i quickly found out , however , shoot macr o-o nly this lens crime . it very versitile lens . its fast f/ 2.8 aperture makes good shooting low light . i pretty much use this outdoors 100mm 1.6 crop factor my rebel xt eliminates most indoor oppurtunities . i frequently use this lens family portraits , resultant photo so crisp clear bokeh really helps add snap primary subject . others stated , this heavy lens . it doesn't image stabilization ( ) so tripod or monopod great accessory get best images . i use beefy monopod my best shots , although i lot handheld gems ... if you tight cash , this isn't " one lens " it all . if you looking versitile lens outstanding macros portraits , this lens .	1
this lens pouch very durable good quality . it compacts down not unneccesary bulk . might seem alittle pricey but worth it long haul .	1
every picture mine included larger portions sky would these stubborn spores it . pretty infuriating , especially when you got shot just like you wanted it . yes , you always remove those photoshop ( or cheaper yet , gimp ); but isn't it cool when you look picture say : " it , nothing it ! " ?? it wasn't just sky . any off-white but light plain colored background would suffer visibly acursed specks . this blower , greatly priced ( pity adorama doesn't free shipping though ) , i put my camera tripod , pointed it down , squirted three or four times - gone specs !!! great buy dslr owners	1
never ending race larger larger megapixel counts , d70s fallen behind pack . ( however , if that only measure which you're judging digital camera - you really should consider further research before plunking down several hundred dollars . ) nevertheless , it quite good camera . what i like it most : - it looks feels solid . some reviewers pan this camera feeling flimsy plasticky apparently still stuck realm pro cameras cost several thousand dollars . it not bulletproof titanium box you back hummer over , but it certainly seems outdo dslrs it category . - very good battery life . - backwards compatibility decade worth nikon slr lenses . my gripes : - latch keeps pop-up flash place broke less than week . - inability meter through older manual focus lenses . - lack full functionality flashes other than sb-600 sb-800 . - nikon raw software control software aren't included camera , imho overpriced . ( ... top , nikon split what used one overpriced software package into two overpriced software packages ... ) what would improve this camera most : - iso 100 iso 3200+ - ability store multiple custom white balance presets , then pull them up fly . - replacing " idiot modes " ( i.e. " portrait " , " landscape " , etc . ) modes you could customize	-1
i bought this lens whim see what it would like shoot prime lens . $80 it certainly worth risk unlike many other canon lenses which cost thousands dollars . quality pictures this lens only thing making me move away zoom lenses	-1
i've my d2h 9 months now . i've heard magenta skin tones issue but never seen it .. skin tones my unit great . it seems this issue plagued minority users . camera very fast , exposes well delivers results . it primarily designed sports photojournalism camera -- situations where speed counts . it 4 megapixel wonder -- it true it only 4 megapixels , but they 4 great megapixels . images upsize wonderfully . i love my unit , am debating whether buy second one backup , or wait d2x . price d2x making decision bit easier i'm leaning toward d2h .	-1
i not find anything negative say this camera . i wanted small pocket sized camera tried brands such casio exislim . even though this camera not small casio , it far superior camera . size why , it still small enough fit pocket but also big enough so it isn't awkward or difficult use . pictures this camera turn out spectacular , 10x zoom far best feauture this camera . lcd screen also very clear , unlike casio other camera similar this one . you can't go wrong this camera . highly recommended	1
nice compact . tripod doesn't really work i expected . i am using my own tripod . overall nice little unit money	-1
my knowlege , there simply isn't better equipped camera professional investigator . it ir-sensitive mode ( nightshot ) bw ( rather than cheeseygreen ) , far superior quality-wise anything sony got , it only 3ccd i know low-light mode . image stabilization exceptional image quality production grade . time/date stamps " burned " so they xfer via firewire - again , only camera i'm aware this feature . audio turned off which we know must . best yet , you disable sleepmode so it won't turn off eliminating missed money shots waiting camera cycle back . it built like tank feels substantial hand , but it still lightweight thanks alloy frame . finally , it totally silent even tape transport full swing . only downside so far i tell it size - it big camera compared handicams i've , wouldn't well suited close-proximity work . however , black casing dosn't print/siloutte terribly , 16x optical lets you set back quite bit . highly recommended !	1
if you take lots photos , rechargeable batteries way go . carry other charged batteries you case you need swap them out	1
this case vital protect lightweight s1 which could easily damaged drop . case not detract convenience s1 , it adds virtualy no bulk camera so it still slips pocket or purse easily .	1
i just purchased my second m407 camera , yes that right i said second one . i purchased first year ago used it wilds idaho taking pictures all kinds weather every elevation imaginable . all pictures turned out great . i recently reason take more pictures indoors , new grand daughter . again pictures fantastic , several blown 11x17 matting framing , great quality . i would make several suggestion folks , buy digital camera batteries , every camera i owned eats batteries , this hp no different . if you spend money get good quality batteries they last ! second recommendation get sd memory card , if you like me you not happy interanl memory want take lots pictures . so , this photographer says you can't beat price , quality service you get hp . i forgot mention i camera didn't work , hp replaced within 2 days new one , no questions asked . good service goes long way my book . buy one you won't sorry !	-1
great product , great price , great company , quick delivery . we love small size	1
i bought this year ago taken many great pictures it . it light , many features used automatic when all you want point click . i can't recommend it enough .	1
i owned kodak awhile pleased pictures however , my husband accidently fell while ice skating broke my camera . my family , knowing i love take pictures , decided replace my camera , but this time sony cybershot . i never more unhappy camera . needless say , i finally decided purchase this kodak z650 am so pleased results pictures . i am not professional photographer , just someone who likes take photos my kids , pets , flowers , vacation spots , etc . my sony horrible action shots if you any movement what so ever , photo appeared blurry . kids , isn't option . i gave camera my daughter whatever she wanted it . kodak , however wonderful job action shots well clear , crisp concise pictures . i absolutely love this camera ! i never go back brand only good things say kodak their products	1
i many traditional film slrs including original pentax k1000 ( fully manual ) , canon rebel xos canon elph . when considering digital slr cameras canon digital rebel point-and-shoot canon digital elph top my list . but $150 less than canon digital elph , casio exilim ex-s series better buy same features ( some cases better execution same features ) . if you're looking fun point-and-click camera record audio , avi movie files digital pictures this it . it takes 15 miuntes read manual you're off taking pictures . pay attention when reading manual everything else seem very intuitive . all cameras i i use this one most often . other users complained proprietary lithium ion battery but 3rd party equivalents available right here amazon site , you just look . my back-up battery only [ ... ] bucks . san disk 1gb memory cards cheap too , [ ... ] online , [ ... ] retail . last , i agree many users lock switch needs developed so you keep camera accidentally turning when it your pocket -- but remember many cameras this problem/lack/this feature . i solved my own issues buying [ ... ] case belt loop	1
i bought this rangefinder golf . it small enough i could keep it my pocket . it really helps me approach shots greens . it takes bit experience able focus flag . i usually use person green my target . after i got approximate read , i use scan mode find exact distance flag . careful tiny battery cover . it came loose i lost it golf course . fortunately , i recovered it amongst green grass . cover also green . i now put tape over it secure cover .	-1

flash works very well , i wedding photogrphy so i need good flash . it works great . i am very happy this product	1
yes it very fine lens . 105 mm long end also appealing but after buying this i decided sell it favour my ef 24-70 2.8 after 2 weeks usage . f4 makes clearly autofocus slower fuzzier . bokeh also worse than other one . viewfinder gets darker 1.6 crop bodies . 105 mm make very little difference image size . plus macro option weaker this one . if you don't care weight go ef 24-70 2.8 imho .	-1
well i too recieved " grey market " version product , international warranty only . this mentioned before , apparently rectified amazon , i hope i'll recieve same treatment . but this still troubles me . amazon continuing sell off cheaper merchandise , only addressing issue individual basis when people complain ? what grey market means product originally intended sale outside us , but imported because version product cheaper than version intended us sale . while it legitimate enough process , they should telling us if they it , because warranty invalidated sold outside boundaries system canon put place . i'm not even touching hardware until i find out what going it , so i can't rate its quality .. but i no doubt it quality piece hardware , i've never heard anyone anything bad say it , except its price , gripe i totally agree . let face it folks , if it wasn't proprietary accessory high priced camera system , it should really cost $20 . it just simple programmable timer no more sophisticated than most wristwatches	-1
i already digital rebel able sell it co-worker use proceeds my new rebel xt . faster , lighter , better . simple review . it took everything great my digital rebel made it better . some complain it feels " too light " ... ok ... it that your thing . me , it still solid pictures speak themselves . now , addition 10 mp rebel xt , i'll bet original xt purchased even better price . no downsides i think ..	1
pros : superb retention color , bokeh ( background blur ) , sharpness . fast silent accurate autofocus . great build quality . cons : size , weight price . not your everyday walkaround lens . expensive .	-1
this replacement identical battery pack i lost . works great , long life , no problems	1
this bag very spacious stylish . it holds my rebel xt my three lenses very well . i even hold 70-200mm f/4 there , although it bit snug . best part this bag it completely customizable . i set it up such way i get any one my lenses just slinging bag around unzipping only top compartment . this very useful when you don't want constantly set your bag floor access your equipment . i one complaint . when wearing this bag sling , it sit your right shoulder . i am more used bags sitting my left shoulder , so take some getting used . when i carry this " non-sling " mode ( i.e. not over my head ) , it comfortably sit my left shoulder . however , best most unique feature this bag ability it sling around access camera without taking bag off , which only possible if i wear it sling bag my right shoulder . it would nice if portion bag customizable well	-1
my kids competitive tae kwon . i now used camera my wife gave me one year ago several tournaments . it able stop action take great shots even low lighting . now , we tried it when we went skiing it also worked great glare conditions snow . i bought monopod worked real well stabalize i use software called photofinale crop share photos . one year into usage i am still looking forward each chance i get play this " toy " . next options : battery grip , flash diffuser , extra remote flash ..	1
lost your old slr lens cap ? this what you looking .	-1
if you're looking high-quality telephoto zoom lens fast enough use indoors , you may found what you're looking . 70-200/ 2.8 lens produces beautiful results overall par 135/2 prime lens ( although not quite sharp ) . main downside this lens it big heavy . i don't mind carrying it around my neck camera so much , but when you go use if you put extra effort into keeping lens shaking your hands due weight . it not exactly sort lens i would want toss into my backpack , just due immense size . if you don't mind spending extra $500 , consider also 70-200/ 2.8 ( image stabilization ) version this lens . it weighs even more , but built unit should help compensate shaky hands whilst using lens	-1
this great tool those shots where you want get down low . macro work landscape/waterscape shots near ground so much easier angle finder than without . i also used it when doing portrait work get more flattering angle without kneel or stoop over whole time . now negative . it fogs up much easier than normal eyepiece , which makes seeing anything challenge under some conditions . big one me , especially macro work , you loose some light when using angle finder . so if you already working low-light situation , this only makes matters worse . but well-lit conditions where fogging not issue you want shoot low , this amazing accessory , thus 4 out 5 stars	-1
after reading number on-line reviews , i bought this lens few weeks ago straightly its low-light photography capability . what i gotten little more than i bargained . pictures it produces made casual hobbyist like myself look like pro , least admiring eyes unsuspecting acquaintances . now only if i heart mumble-jumble few far-fetched jargons , i might new packing order firmly place . when paired my rebel xti , 80mm effective focal length wide apertures make it ideal portrait lens . it also compact , light-weigh solidly built , fast acurate auto-focus , most importantly , superb optical qualities . best part i gotten these without breaking bank nor it break my neck hauling it around . however , despite its low-light capability , very attributes make this lens outstanding portraits , i.e. , narrow angle view shallow depth field wide apertures , make it odd choice in-door group photos . also if you taking action shots , 80mm focal length may not long enough provide safe distance avoid mishaps . instead distal observer , i found myself unwilling participant middle action ducking camera ever-curious tongues my golden retriever her playmates . no wonder zoom lenses so popular . what else there not like this lens ? not much unless you proud owner one mammoth expensive prime lens . well , it come free hood wonderful soft leather pouch , doesn't it	1
i using this lens 2.5 years it exceptional piece equipment , especially price ! i very rarely feel need get closer image than i achieve this lens . it very solidly built i am sure it continue primary piece my kit years come	1
kodak ph160 media cartridge kit best bargain around ! you get 4 cartridges plus paper each pack . i used more paper than ink ! thank you kodak such money saving kit	1
i just finished first set pics this machine surprised amazing sharpness accuracy autofocus , not mention deapth field when compared our older canon digital camera . don't fooled low price , however . 16mb card joke , batteries not rechargable . it best get 1gb memory card battery charger pack right away . price still very reasonable such high quality machine	1
i both canon version grip this version . they identical . i two rebel xts they work great . i like them feel it gives holding camera . camera small my hands this makes it perfect . if you thinking buying accessories rebel xt , this should one them . grip holds two batteries , which gives you way more shooting time . i highly recommend this	1
i say excellent purchase . i'm fan my p880 camera . wide angle len , feature included , allows take great panoramic views , no efforts . manual optical zoom great , gives you control picture i never comercial digital camera . one my favorites features zoom reviewing picture , 10x zoom you check detailed picture lcd screen your pc . 8 megapixels , allows you see great precision minimal details usually you don't see . great experience , when you take picture , return home , picture better than your memory . i'm still learning other features , but rigth now i think great performance-value relation , most important , allow my photos professional touch ,. south worldcarolina	1
i am very happy item i ordered . shipment fast price cheaper than retai	1
i use it my s70 .. it works over 10meters ( thats right ! ) back too , so i am very happy it .. i bought it today so maybe it improved now ..	1
works advertised . i use it extensively environmental work where i want remain short distance my camera . it great portraits where i am near concentrating my subject shoot remotely without losing contact model . remote also came handy several self-promotions where i seated seating myself office atmosphere .	1
i mainly use this when taking landscape shots where i want either make clouds pop or liven sky up some ( remember it works best 90 degrees sun . ) i also put it when shooting highly reflective vegetation or waterscapes would otherwise cause blown-out highlights . one other little secrete use this when shooting waterfalls since it allow you shoot slower shutter speeds thus increasing wispy waterfall look .	-1
this my third digital camera , but it few years since second it definitely obsolete . i tempted go top line , because i've two excellent slrs ( nikon minolta ) all trimmings , but prices made unfeasible right now . i'm very satisfied features canon g6 however ; i've taken 400 shots so far , plus one movie , tried out all software stitching panoramas together , etc . i still mainly use photoshop , but canon software quite good . photo quality excellent , including color opticalzoom wideangle range good most purposes . macro setting also nice job . controls easy use most part anyone all familiar full featured slrs , better than most . i've made very few mistakes field result control confusion . what i'm less thrilled ( nitpicking ): like most electronics these days , even if you've got very small hands like me , it hard keep getting finger wrong place , just every square inch covered control . i would liked insert ( like nikon supplies ) cover flash hotshoe contacts . every time i remove battery or memory card , i watch out grab camera few areas don't control them . also , cable input typical tiny plastic door would all too easy break off , neck strap attachment too close memory card door , tends interfere it opening all way . also , preview mode it tells you how many shots you taken but not how many left , shooting mode , vice versa . it annoying switch shooting mode see how many left , especially if you using lens cover , because then lens deploys out , you remember take lens cover off first ( deploying lens cover no-no . ) i also got camera case designed g6 . again like all too many " cases " it tight fit , only single inside pocket you only get extra card still get camera too . case would not really good dust protection it zips up sides but top opening just covered flap . because tight awkward fit , it easy accidentally turn camera , deploying lens , while putting camera into case . case comes belt loop , but you supply your own belt , it no other strap or handle except tiny loop located top end side zipper , where it just gets way . not good design . i also checked out some accessories available , like additional lens flash , but they're very expensive , like macro lights more than camera ! so i don't know if i'll get any add-ons later . but overall , g6 already my next favorite camera my nikon slr , powerful yet easy use , even fun ! definitely 5 stars camera , 1 star case	1
i hear lot grumbling camera not " perfect . " but guess what ... this size form factor one should not expecting slr-like performance . i just purchased this camera last week busy testing it out variety situations . " full auto " mode pretty decent job figuring out right settings most situations . if you want you take total control set most controls manually . there even bunch pre-programmed setting different lighting situations couple i tested worked great . all all , great camera size . i like fact i put this my shirt pocket forget it then when i suddenly need take picture i always camera handy . i normal speed sd memory card writing out images card painfully slow . this especially true when trying take number quick shots rapid succession . wait camera become ready take next shot annoying . i would highly recommend you purchase one high speed sd cards ( often advertised " ultra ii " or " 32x " or " high speed . " all all great camera if you realistic your expectations you very happy . good luck	1
i some dust spots my lenses , mirrors inside . i afraid use brush or cloth kits , since they could easily scratch . one my photography books suggested i use this exact air blower , so i thought i'd give it try . it simple tool , but it emits strong amount air i able clean everything off . even works well keyboards or other dusty spots	1
top line . works advertised . ttl , e-ttl . 4 double aa batteries . tilt , rotate head , soft lens built . control slave flash	1
i looking medium range zoom my d-70s reasonably fast sharp throughout zoom range . this lens first class winner all areas . it my first vr lens ( vibration resistance ) alone makes it worth cost . no more tripods ! it smooth operation feels very solid ( if not little heavy ) use . f/ 2.8 speed coupled 8 aperture leaves gives velvety smooth bokeh ( desirable soft blurred background ) makes your subject snap right out shot . len razor sharp 70mm 200mm . if there any distortion , i haven't seen it . lens this long , ghosting might show up if you shoot almost directly into sun . huge hb-29 lens hood helps lot . again , i not seen any ghosting yet . this definately pro/pro-sumer len its price tag alone re-enforces fact . if you afford it , remember golden rule ... it lens makes picture not camera . all pixels world can't make up poor lens . if you ready play big boys , then this belongs your bag	1
this handy little tool must not just nikon owners , but all camera owners . genius design function , i would whole-heartedly urge every person camera buy one , or many , asap	1
wicked 8.5 frames per second , this sports/action/photojournalists dream camera . if you need speed this one . aimed squarely sports shooters photojournalists , canon it . if you looking more portrait/art/wedding camera get canon 5d	1
i am professional photographer , i owned this camera nearly two years . i also d70 backup . batteries go forever , it very quick respond , images beautiful , it typical nikon durability reliability . if you already nikon user , controls fall easily hand . said , computer software this camera joke . best image quality shoot raw files , color balance grey card , render images software like capture one le . uselessness included software only reason this camera gets four instead five stars . come , nikon , real !!! shortly after i got my first d70 , i shot model small photo side bar catalog . i got ugly feeling my gut when i told designer taken shot 3/4 figure , cropped head shoulders , enlarged image cover 8.5 11 catalog . time i found out , it already printer . it turned out , i pleasantly surprised : cover shot looked great . after incident , i trusted this camera always pleased results . this camera better than 35 mm every way except response shutter button . resolution color reproduction it more comparable medium format film camera . it imperative shoot raw process files properly get most out this camera . i can't wait try d80	-1
i am 67 years old started out photography kid contact printer box camera . i all types cameras over years , mostly 35mm film canon slr . i too bought all sorts these 5-7 mp point shoot digital cameras before returning my true love , slr . i my digital canon rebel xt month now i can't keep my hands off it . it lacks nothing . although kit lense good , i bought 28-135 canon zoom lense image stabilizion produced stunning photo it . i love way you use 7 points focus , i mainly use only center point focus lock never get out focus picture . i guess nicest thing me i now don't urge buy every point shoot camera paraded out qvc or hsn " wonderful " new feature like " low light or non-shake . " this canon every good feature known universe you can't outgrow it . its camera let you good you , it won't hold you back . battery life great , built flash good but i bought 430ex that even better . i never figure i'm wasting money buying accessories this camera it my main squeeze many years come . i always missed my 35mm canon slr now feel i old friend back again , only much much better . believe me , you can't go wrong getting this camea , its beyond description ...	1
black color adapter hood nice match gunmetal finish s3 . fit good they what they supposed . i noticed hood tends " lock " adapter if you accidently squeeze it when unscrewing it -- probably because plastic bends little . use lighter touch it unscrews right off . one off-putting thing me price these two inexpensive pieces plastic . i know they may precision-engineered plastic nice finish , but please , over 15 dollars each two pieces ? they're plastic ! i know corporations supposedly owe it stockholders maximize profits , but perhaps these could included s2/s3 standard equipment . or sold price more line construction material	-1
my mom i each one these cameras . neither , one us any problems until recently . i dropped mine while taking pictures timer . drop my tile floor smashed telescoping lens out alignment wouldn't close gave e8 error screen . i contacted canon us website then , i sent it into canon repair center il . it cost $87 it repaired shipped back . it took week half it returned me . only thing i would improve this camera speed , i trouble taking pictures my son merry go round(but it could i need change settings ) . it many features it accessories add . since , i am learning more digital photography this great little starter camera many features canon known . also recently i've looking some newer canon models , their casing/ bodies look/feel really cheap me . it may make them lighter but it makes me really afraid i would break them	-1
i purchased this lens back march 2005 shoot static " warhammer models " my 10d . i found longer lenses such sigma 105mm , canon ef 100mm , tamron sp autofocus 90mm all " too long " 10d 1.6 focal crop would result requiring me use lot more physical space what i room get sho t.t he canon ef 50mm f/ 2.5 nearly perfect match 10d this purpose . its small , its compact , its short focal length not require i standing three feet away model i'm shooting . far shooting non-static objects , such insects , lens slow focus loud , both noise vibration , which results " startled " subjects missed shots . same also applies non-macro shots well . its slow focus makes it poor choice action photography , its loud enough draw attention you when you attempting other shots well	-1
this great camera takes place earlier canon digital elph i lost several years ago . 7.1 megapixels ensures great quality 3x zoom provides crisp clear pictures . fact digital zoom also works great - just make sure camera steady ( i purchased nice compact monopod results awesome ) . although image stabilization feature newer models would great , you can't beat price overall quality this camera pictures it takes . canon sd500 great little camera	1
pros : - reduces flare ghosting when shooting bright light . - helps protect your lens dirt scratches . - somewhat protects lens case fall . better break hood than front element . - makes you look more like you know what you doing helps keep others carelessly walking front you . cons : - increase lens movement windy situations , kind like sail boat . - takes up more room your bag , even when reversed they still add diameter lens . - people take more notice you , help blow your cover if you trying keep low profile .	-1
i can't believe how advanced things become . quality pictures printed kodak easy share media cartridge .	1
i love this product , because i love camera printing dock . i using them 2 years . my daughter-in -law son got theirs little earlier because arrival their first child . i saw it one these marvelous things i could myself home . i think she discovered your site you sold product . we both purchased you few times . thanks reasonable film prices allowed me take more pictures copy my friends relatives	1
i am really glad i bought this lens . it comes hood which reversed when not use so it very useful . leather pouch , front cap , back cap included . focusing super fast usm .	1
it bit heavy but superb lens . interior construction quite bit plastic however which bit concern . i've dropped one onto hard packed dirt/soccer field w/no damage ... so it pretty sturdy :) if you live 1 stop less light consider newly released 70-200 f/4 . this new 70-200 f/4 canon save you some weight if concern	1
i bought this camera owning 2 more digital cameras . one kodak canon ( a70 ) . amazing product ... pro ... almost everything .. cons ... no audio videoi definetly recommend product price	-1
my husband bought me this camera early christmas gift . first i wasn't love it . i disappointed because i wanted camera image stablization . this camera instead boasted its iso sensitivity settings fast shutter speed . ( they claimed it similar image stablization ) when i first tried it out i very low light setting experiencing some blur my images which exactly what i trying avoid new camera ! i almost traded this one something different ( cheaper priced olympus ) but thankfully i gave camera chance first decided play around all manual settings . there lot them menus so you fine tune it like you wouldn't believe . this ability change its setup what made me stick sony . however , i wouldn't say this camera ideal very low light situations . two preset choices shooting low-light scene without flash won't give you crystal clear pictures especially if you experience tiny bit camera shake . but again , it goes back adjustments menus , you make manual adjustments get pretty decent pictures minumal ( or no ) blur . but you take time find set right iso light settings . i highly suggest using histogram you pop-up onto screen help . unless you willing spend $200 more camera , you won't find one perform great very low light anyway . like my husband said ... " really ... how often you taking shots dark honey ? " hey , there halloween trick-or-treating fouth july fireworks other night time events i retorted , but he right . there really isn't lot real low-light pictures you take where you aren't using flash . i know lots people ( me included ) like try figure out all menu options settings their own before reading manual ... but this one , if you really want super amazing shots , reading manual give you lot insight how powerful camera it really . people always read manual this probably big " duuuh " ! but if you like me like try rush through figure it out , you missing out ton nice options . some great features : camera doubles video camera it only limited recording up amt space available your memory stick . other cameras only let you record pre-set maximum number minutes . i also like burst modes which allow you take shots fast succession . great action shots . but take note , when using burst mode you cannot use flash . ( again , watch out low light ! )i 3 year old daughter fast shutter speed ( burst ) works great well lit situation . just other day i caught shots her running around jumping up down came out crystal clear . no blur all . every flying bouncing hair her head came out perfectly frozen time . quite neat ! i gave this camera 4 stars because camera performs wonderfully every situation except very low light . but price , you can't much better anyway . its great buy i think just anyone would pleased receive it gift .	-1
i don't personally subscribe notion big brand manufacturers always make best lenses out there , but this one instance where they really , honestly . this thing lightning fast , sharp tack , bokeh much better than sigma equivalent , you'll hard time finding use your raw processor chromatic aberration correcting sliders when coupled digital body ( you still get some purple fringing around backlit subjects , but genuine ca bad enough show up print so far proven non-existent me any focal length or aperture ) . weight serious downside , but it one i live . if you're nature photographer who really problem holding still or if you plan using extension tubes , version might worth extra $700 you , but if you're doing event photography where subjects ones jumping around like rabbits , save your money your battery power ; ain't thing wrong this lesser model	1
although people problems first generation this grip , i've completely satisfied mine . recently , i've shooting 300 2.8 , it would much more difficult without extra length grip ads body . similarly , second set buttons vertical shooting makes big difference , too . ( one note : when shooting vertical , it hard actuate thumb wheel impossible use joy stick -- which i frequently change focus points -- without moving my right hand . ) holding two batteries , grip also keeps me worrying running out juice during high volume shooting sessions . grip still little flex it , but i've never any power problems i've read here elsewhere	-1
optika mp100 pro photo monopod surprisingly sturdy , functional well-made . it supplied reasonably decent quality zippered nylon case carrying strap . no , it not " professional grade " , but it something every amateur photographer use weekend shooting . i've used it both digital still camcorder , where it offers respectable improvement long-distance shots ( versus trying hold camera still , or propping it up roof car , not-nearby-enough fence post , so . ) certainly lot handier than old tripod ! i bought two , keeping them ready-for-action trunk my cars . highly recommended	1

photography afficionados long two choices when it comes buying digital camera : tiny everything-automatic portable camera takes decent pictures or brick-sized everything-manual professional camera takes fantastic pictures . almost decade after introduction consumer digital camera , sony finally taken swing combining best qualities both worlds into one package , dsc-w100 solid first effort . sony tiny part down some time - dimensionally , w100 par other recent cybershot models competitor brands ' offerings , features now-common 2.5 " bright lcd display minimum buttons back . aside attractive mini-diamondplate face chrome trim , visually there little set this camera apart among others your local electronics counter . initial toying camera doesn't dispel any first impressions . all prerequisite automatic features there , buttons smartly arranged so all most common functions right hand , it obviously point-and-shoot camera . but it when you begin delve into features you realize w100 something entirely differen t.t he usual mode knob there back auto mode scenes modes , but now there program manual modes - something standard issue professional cameras but radically new point-and-shoot . this means you use any combination auto or manual settings all functions get shot . example , shooting dimly lit room , you use slow shutter flash even out lightning , or turn off flash slower shutter richer colors , or raise iso so you get steady shot higher shutter speed , or just put it auto shoot , etc . all different possibilities previously reserved just professional cameras now your disposal . camera simple or involved you want , it still fits your pocket . i've owned several other digital cameras , both portable pro , they've all somewhat manual features , but w100 takes it new level . mounting w100 tripod , i attempted get long exposure shot night sky , something all other digital cameras adequately . manually setting shutter speed , camera displayed overall exposure value i adjusted - camera telling me before even touching shutter button if resulting picture would dark , bright , or even . i set shutter slow it could go using two-second timer , fired away . picture amazing ; though only few stars visible eye , w100 caught light well over hundred . i noticed bit radial blur stars around border image , only realize later camera pointed north - shutter speed so slow i actually * capturing rotation earth * . now that manual . also special note w100 digital " smart zoom " . general rule digital cameras , you should disable digital zoom feature , zooming beyond optical range produces cropped therefore lower-quality image . but here again sony trick up it sleeve , cropping 8.1 megapixel capture regardless where you image size set . if you shoot 5 megapixel-size picture utilizes digital zoom , image actually captured full 8.1 mps then your 5mp picture cropped . result optically-zoomed clear picture . this also means lowest image size , you get full 15x zoom ( equivalent 500+ mm telephoto - pocket camera ! ) . it absolutely brilliant technique you'll probably see all future digital cameras . sony still bit more work pocket slr idea . included your purchase accessories catalog featuring array lenses filters , none which compatible w100 . it typical sony bizarre distribution features any given product lineup , but it would seem obvious most slr-like camera should slr-like accessories . w100 owners should disable auto focus illumination light when shooting people ; blazing red light great focusing inanimate subjects , but could probably used tactical light blind assailants pinch . overall , w100 remarkable newcomer truly raises bar what you expect point shoot pocket camera . novices accommodated full automation , learn gradually trying out individual manual functions while other settings remain automatic . experienced photogs right home manual mode wide range settings . five stars what hopefully sony work progress	1

this fit my olympus e500 great . i recently took overseas trip this bag great traveling go trips . weatherproof cover really came handy few time when it started rain unexpectly . only thing bit odd strap you wear around your body . it comes up chest odd angle , my husband didn't problem it but i . so maybe thats just girl thing .... :) most times i didn't use extra strap , just threw it over one shoulder went . bag held 2 lenses , extra battery , charger , i room keys , wallet few little personal odds ends . my friend so impressed it , he buying one today . some one asked if they attach tripod bag . there aren't really any extra loops outside bag . stadard tripod won't fit insidde . you would rig something up outside yourself . imo i don't it would work very well but you try .	1
incredible quality zoom ! low power consumption . buy 1gb sandisk compact flash card . it gives you plenty room 2-3 week vacation	1

i this camera week now . i bought ef 28-105mm lens seperatly . i don't know why , but auto focus not work right away . it took some fiddling around before i able use feature . i get gorgeous pictures this camera . my one complaint it feels small right hand . after 1/2 hour shooting pictures my hand got cramp . i small hands it still felt small me . if you considering this camera i'd go store see how it feels . i can't imaging able use it long time if you big hands . i'm still learning how use it . but so far its meeting all my expectations .	-1
bottom line : i needed replace lens my canon rebel xt d-slr . ef-s first glance seemed like perfect replacement since canon produced ef-s series specifically compressed sensor d-slr line . after weighing pros cons two , i chose this ef lens largely basis price . it right choice , i haven't found any loss features or quality . multiplying range 1.6 35mm equivalence ( if you rebel xt , 20d or 30d ) , this model really just slightly wide angle stronger telephoto zoom . ( 45mm-170mm if it 35mm film camera ) if this range suits you , then this lens excellent value over ef-s wide-angle/telephoto zoom . you'll keep all features , save money faster lens . ef series meshes well current line canon digital slrs . addition , unlike ef-s series , they compatible all canon eos products including higher-end cameras like mark ii . specific observations weeks use : my first concern before purchasing this lens minimum focus distance 0.5 meters , or approximately 18 inches . i lot macro work transferring images into digital , so i tad worried . however , after getting lens zooming , i realized focusing distance wasn't really issue after all . most cases , i could manage stand six or so inches further away still get highly magnified shot . so you see macro function works well , i've uploaded image small hamster photographed 102mm . ( aperature pretty big -- after all , hamster moving target)my second concern lens quality sharpness , particularly wide-angle setting near edges photo . this lens exceeded my expectations . so you see quality this lens , i've uploaded uncropped picture sf bay bridge taken 28mm wide-angle setting . you'll see photo sharp all way through edges frame . ( it web-sized jpeg , so you should take into consideration use it mainly see sharpness photo , particularly near outside edges)i get unexpected bonus this lens . manual focus ring front . i love it . disabling auto-focus snap , position feel manual focus perfect sports or social activities where subject often not closest object . ring itself ridged made rubber , making handling breeze . while i hadn't expected replace my stock lens so soon , i think it ended up best . this lens actually superior one came xt . i lost some wide-angle function but gained much more telephoto . price excellent quality lens high .	1
this remote handy tool . it very basic use shutter release . it best use shutter release when your camera tripod low light situations . using shutter release this way helps limit camera shake which improves your images . other programmable features include self timer , interval timer , long exposure , exposure count . you permitted use any combination all or none these settings making possibilities virtually limitless . i used self timer so i could both take picture , it . self timer set just shy 100 hours if you wanted . time lapse , combination interval timer which set just shy 100 hours exposure count which set up 99 shots should set . self timer used delay first shot if desired . long exposure also set up just shy 100 hours . settings entered any time without worry inadvertent alterations . pressing light button until hold indicator displayed deactivate all but light button or prevents stop/start button deactivated once operation started . tc-80n3 operated one cr2032 battery . i've my remote over 2 years battery still going strong . i'm not sure how long battery supposed last , but there indicator display panel let me know when battery starts get low . if battery fine , i don't see indicator all . there storage place back your cameras rc socket cover if you one . i use this canon 20d so it no use me . plug connects camera simply pressing plug into socket . disconnect , pinch plug side pull out . me , this item must . i enjoy low light photography i get plenty use just this reason . it great option available other photographic opportunities . it clear me this well thought out , quality product canon . pros : acts simple shutter releaseprogrammable options include self timer , interval timer , long exposure , exposure countcons : cable only 34 inche	1
i olympus 5mp point-n-shoot camedia camera i pretty happy portraits . i annoyed w/ fixed lens prevented me taking good photos wildlife . i hummingbird feeders my backyard unless you've opportunity work hummingbird families years , sweet , tiny animals skittish don't often pose you when you get too close . when my point-n-shoot stopped focusing , i took advantage this situation rationalizing this bigger purchase . what joy it use this camera . 6.3 mp significant improvement over 5 ability take photos manual mode cannot understated . fixed point-n-shoot , camera refused shoot if it didn't " feel " it focus ... so it impossible shoot sunsets , lightning or other natural beauties " infinity " range focal length . rebel makes use compact flash - oldest , yet still best technology taking fast , high-quality photos digital cameras . my less than perfect rating due small memory buffer . you take up 3fps very easily , but if you click-click-click shutter , it doesn't matter if bigfoot , loch ness monster elvis start doing little soft-shoe right front you , time rebel finishes writing recent 3 quick shots cf card , shot century already slithered back into swamp time camera ready used again . if you're taking portraits , not problem . click here there you'll never notice lack memory buffer ... but if you're shooting ball game or other quick moving objects , you're going get frustrated very quickly . flash decent , but you really need good flash like 580 hot-shoe if you want better even spread avoidance red-eye . lot folks shrug red-eye since most affordable or free programs like iphoto or photoshop elements built-in correction red-eye - but red-eye correction one click only available humans . if you're shooting wildlife , forget any software one-click ( or million clicks ! ) solution blue-eye dogs , yellow-eye cats , flaming-demon eye bunnies or variety odd reflections you get bouncing off retinas various species . best way circumvent this problem avoid bouncing flash directly into retinas your subjects get-go . no more glare or odd reflections when you use better flash . ability upgrade better lenses crux slr ownership . sky limit . get good wide-angle good , fast telephoto you've got yourself set some great shots . this camera isn't going take advantage cf cards faster than 40x , so you save money buying slightly slower cf cards , but i invested 80x cards so i use them when i upgrade cameras . this rebel gotten me back into photography after decade-long hiatus . camera automatically detects vertical shots turns them 90 degrees you lcd window . it quick easy adjust iso " push " film ( so speak ) take advantage low-light situations , but you get same grainy effects you when you push real film . iso 100 using 512mb cf card , you 157 photos your disposal - if you push it all way 1600 , 104 shots same card . 400 , your shots already compromized regarding print quality ... but if sasquatch comes-a-knockin ' wee hours , you'll still get decent proof if you shoot 1600 . background film photography spanning 2 decades , i didn't even consult manual this camera use it fresh out box . it handles many ways like professional film slr , unlike point-n-shoots , there aren't cryptic settings no film parallel . sunny days outdoor shots , this camera sheer joy use	-1
i got this lens my 300d ( digital rebel ) kit enjoyed it ever since . solid , durable , reliable , good most light situations . lots success wide-angle landscape photos . i'm typically using this 18mm end it produced beautiful images , especially sunset indoors flash . also very light small , i just toss it my bag i'm set . pretty decent close-up stuff well like flowers , etc . overall it good starter lens if you're getting it kit , but you could probably grab it used $60 i would guess if you're just looking good all-around lens	1

great company - delivered product time . tested out lens mexico , brazil , canada . when automatic settings camera ( canon 10d ) selected pictures taken outdoors lot daylight , background overexposed . this results things like clouds not included picture . manual settings adjustments within camera remedy problem . however , there expectation lens canon should take quality pictures automatic setting . otherwise lens works great	-1
very happy quality pics but most it ... it size .. it really really small one ... but really powerful it size ... overall performance pretty good .. it week . everything looks good till now .. except sd card provided it .. it practically useless . you take only 8-9 pics full resolution . would definately suggest everyone buy atleast 512 mb card but overall i satisfied purchase amazon service usual " " rate	1

i'm looking closeup lens my canon eos rebel xt . but before buying i wish i see some pictures taken using this lens	-1
controls little complicated get used , especially all-manual settings -- which should definition easy use -- but overall this camera very rugged very capable . after i bought it , i took d10 budapest , hungary . i great view danube set my camera up night shots . it brilliant job . how this : take digital night shot ( use largest image size possible ) , use 300mm lense blow results up 24x30 through shutterfly.com . image remained amazingly sharp . colors fantastic . camera made it easy look like pro . only gripe i this camera i wish it black white setting like other less expensive canon digitals , but this overcome software so it not huge issue . price great , it magnesium body ( vs . rebel plastic body ) . you get lot d1/d20/d30 , without cost	1
i bought this lens i walking out africa month half safari . i didn't own true wide angle lens i just spent most my budget 70-200mm usm " " lens 1.4 extension . i wanted get widest lens i could get but i didn't big bucks get 16-35l or 14mm so i got this lens figuring i could correct photoshop cs2 later . this what i found : 1 ) i 20d it doesn't barrel distort anywhere near bad i thought it would .... i imagine it distorts quite bit more 5d or other full frame sensor but 20d , 10d , 30d , or rebel it not bad . 2 ) it distort enough even 20d its noticable every single inside shot many panoramic shots .... experienced professional , you'd notice it even panoramas . 3 ) computer person : i find it very easy correct barrel distortion photoshop cs2 very easily .... i use plugin ( there several web)4 ) i tend like barrel distortion look some my pictures . pros1 ) image quality superb . not lens , this lens some amazing color , sharpness , saturation . they spared very little grinding this lens . some my best african pictures , daytime nightime taken this lens they fabulous . 2 ) build pretty well , metal mount , metal integrated hood ... but not up standards any means .... its credit , it survived 14 days vibration ridden truck treking across kalahari desert all its dust , mokoro canoeing okavango delta over week , hiking , elephant riding , five diamond resort victoria falls ( last one easy fisheye ) ... 3 ) it fisheye lens if used properly , it create some amazing pictures views ... example botswana okavango , i knelt down next gigantic baobab tree pointed it up towards sky , fisheye captured not only rex guide standing next tree but entire massive trunk baobab all canopy tree way above . everything ! i know few lenses would let me . it amazing shot only possible fisheye . 4 ) it focuses 12inches . 5 ) f/ 2.8 makes it very good low light situation . 6 ) integrated hood comes complete nice metal cover . cons1 ) its not built like : ) no usm motor so you hear whir it tries focus ) no moisture seals etc ) it metal mount2 ) it fisheye lens -- i found out after month half what this meant .... it doesn't stay my camera much . i take it out when i need certain effect or when i plan retouch photoshop . it distorts visibly 20d i imagine quite bit more full frame . 3 ) integrated hood ... can't put screw filters ... but it gel filter holder . 4 ) no bag . my veredict : 1 ) i've purchased 16-35mm canon " " lens stays camera most time when i want wide-angle but when i need special look or i really want capture everything , i bring out my 15mm fisheye . i won't sell it , i don't regret buying it . i learned what specialty fisheye lens its staying my arsenal those special shots . 2 ) i can't compare against non-canon lenses but i say canon quality here extraordinary . i would knock them construction but lens built well enough " glass " itself spectacular so 5 stars . 3 ) i ordered amazon 3 days before my trip --- it arrived next day . great service . thx amazon .	1
this filter must photographers care their gear . it remains cost effective tool protecting camera lens while serving great every day filter .	1
coolpix l4 great camara . love night modes , portrait . takes great pictures , took it our honeymoon , all pictures came out great . it also takes very good movies , i thought it wouldn't why i didn't go one speaker , but seeing cuality both pictures video , i should gone one mic , that l3	-1
amatuer photographer this gives me what i need price i afford . it many features i am still learning how use . difference pictures d50 takes dslr compared cheap digital camera like night day . i am really happy this camera lens combination i purchased . i anything macro spider zoom-in squirrel sitting tree . battery good life span i rarely change it my spare while shooting . remember puchase seperately your memory card it not part purchase . i'd recommend least 2gb card , which also purchased amazon . i able catch squirrel jumping trees because number frames you take each second . it also so easy take photos indoors without using flash obtrusive during event you photographing . i also recommend purchasing 52mm lens filters , keep your nikkor lenses free fingerprints , etc .	1
i just finished semester brisbane , australia . i must say , retrospect , best thing i took me this trip this camera . she champ , definitely adventurous camera . thing cute hell yet solid like rock . i cannot remember amount times i dropped it sand , no negative consequences whatsoever . i even dipped it ocean mistake once ( not encouraged ) thing still works like charm . it also features like sepia weird flash makes lights something funny , making pictures wicked cool . outer covering shown wear , but it only helps acknowledge this camera take rough handling . people even comment this positive light , it become part my travelling gear . it also great scenic shots , panorama option . retrospect , it amazing buy , so affordable ( i'm backpackers ' budget) ! only because i seen amazing skies breathtaking scenery would i consider upgrading camera better pixelage . but if you staying hole-in-the-wall hostels or sleeping beach , you don't want expensive camera you . this thing great . battery life also great ( sake topping off cake )	1
life this battery so much longer than my stock battery my camcorder ( canon zr70 ) , i no longer worry keeping it charged . i also use my viewscreen more often instead doing everything through eyepiece . my camcorder experience improved because it i focus video not worry if my battery starts run out .	1
i think point lot people not mentioning d200 quite obvious . let me first say main reason i bought d200 over d80 increase my credibility prestige amateur photographer , make other photographers jealous my kit , brag obscene amount money i spend camera equipment while my co-workers can't even pay their rent . i bought grip because i thought it looked really cool , it increased size visibility my camera other people . question really sold me d200 : strangers i might want photograph more likely say yes standing other side d80 or d200 ? people less doubts me holding this thing opposed smaller model ? which one looks cooler ? if i completely loaded would i buy d2xs ? without second thought . course i talked lot camera people making minimum wage hoping they would some technical insight purchasing nikon or other camera . course they let me down said lot bogus things me most saying something like : " d200 way much camera me . " none them knew how change exposure settings , they contented wheel " child mode , " top d80 recited this me several times if i looked like soccer mom . usual i offended human experience buying real world , especially atrocious mark up several hundred dollars , i refused help pay those employees wages . breaking point i think time associate instructed me buy one camera over other because , " when she dropped this camera it broke other one didn't . " so i turned internet where i only say hi ups man he leaves . i studied studied all things technical , sometimes just staring pictures cameras long periods time without blinking . i poured over thousands photographs taken all kinds cameras amassed photographic library while i decided . basically i went way overboard let decision buying camera engulf my life until i dreaming it . so one night i just bought d200 after fence over d80 or d200 . after two days it arrived i impressed it . thing literally cold hard photographic machine . after broken d50 i firstly impressed size , then secondly all dials switches change things i used dig through menu get . thirdly i liked blazing fast 2 frame rate . when i go out night i snap 50mm f/ 1.8 onto it crank iso up . lot people forms complaining noise high iso d200 but i thought it fine . i feel most people camp want perfect clarity all way up into highest isos but i think artistically limiting . i read one scathing review written veteran film user saying basically high iso digital lot less graininess than film basically saying d200 step up but some people still want complain . far d200 goes versus d50 iso 1600 it leaps bounds better my opinion . noise way reduced without nr there isn't pixel chunkiness i found d50 high isos . thing stands out d200 enhanced colors . reality ultra vivid setting d200 makes lot things look sort fake , but it make people who don't sun tan look like they one which plus my opinion . it make your dull green lawn look like lush paradise , skies ultra blue , reds spectacular . i remember when i used d50 i would steer away photographing violets red roses because it would blow them out , not so d200 . some reason coming point shoot it always used annoy my d50 didn't bw or sepia . d200 bw but no sepia . nerds forums would just say , " use cs2 , or photo editor , " but i say no because i should able everything camera . viewfinder so awesome . i literally hated electronic viewfinders d50 viewfinder so small it hindered my framing times . d200 big bright viewfinder huge lcd sucks down batteries like nothing . far my evolution goes photography sometimes i feel like i literally climb into viewfinder because its so big compared what i used . like i said grip awesome i really like it . i kind like many accessories possible kind steered me away d2xs into d200 . watching percentage marks count down batteries drain always fun . best thing d200 little things like because they make me feel like i greater control over my pictures because i know exactly how many i take . conclusion buy d200 over d80 i am really happy it i am not happy anything . if you're trouble considering what you want photographically try pull yourself away forums outside sources really consider what got you into photography first place where you intend go it , i think important part . advertising gear collecting never made anyone better artist	1
i got this filter kit today . first impression not very promising when i saw " made usa " printed package . i said , well it would nice if these filters made japan but i decided give it chance . second impression even worse , since these filters dirty some fingerprints it , clearly indicating product not brand new . apart i didn't like quality metal rings . it just didn't fit well my dmc-fz50 . i cannot speak functionality because i didn't actually try use it but judging overall quality i don't expect much	-1
i love my new camera . it takes great pictures it easy opperate	1
i've owned this charger over year now it flawless . batteries seem last longer when charged this charger than other 1hour charger i own . very fast charging batteries never hot after charging ( hot sign they stressed = shorter lifespan ) . original lenmar 2000mah batteries still going strong holding their charge well when they new . because charger ' smart ' i often throw batteries ' top up ' even when they only half used so i full charge when i'm out ( often 15 minutes ) . never any signs memory effects . i also love fact it charges each battery independantly ( useful devices like frs radios take 3 aa batteries ) . brilliant system . sorry hear other reviewers doa , maybe quality control slipping	1
you need add some weight casing keep it so buoyant- we put some shot large pill bottle tied it shoe string . controls easy use , it gives nice , clear picture . good buy filming any water-related activites	-1

we bought this camera film our new baby . it perfect , easy use great price . i researched lot before i decided this one i am very glad i . picture quality great .	1
i am just getting around reviewing this camera after purchasing it 2 years ago . i love it ; it good first or second digital camera , it functional but without too many features beginner . i use it both personal my job newsletter editor -- 4mp more than enough get quality images resolution required publishing	-1
i only got this a430 few days ago so i haven't used it extensively ye t.t onight i compared flash photos my book case 1 metre using my pentax ist ds 6megapixel slr a430 . i took number pictures difference pretty well zero using my 17inch monitor . i say i impressed i expecting more difference favour my slr . autofocus a430 excellent very reliable . i tried few shots complete darkness ir beam made short work focussing firing flash giving perfect image . i am also very impressed video images picture very sharp clear good sound . it lack manual featurs slr there no information actual viewfinder . it hard criticise this camera . it doesn't even look or feel cheap even though it only cost $159aud . it feels lovely hand camera you proud own . batteries lasting well too even though i snapping away it several days . i am using 512m sd card my slr camera moment 16m supplied one pretty inadequate . all all great camera great price	1
this very best pocket camera i've able find , including brand new nikon p5000 which i just bought found inferior . i'm not saying i love it -- fact i'd actually prefer pain bringing dslr over limitations this camera whenever possible -- but it avoids flaws damage competitors . first all , it fits comfortably your pocket . it big but lens retracts nice way . unlike 10 mg lumix pocket camera which lens protrusion issue . far quality , here scoop . 1 ) pictures low iso highest quality indoor pics i've able get pocket camera . i've tried them all . higher iso it starts suck but so all competition it seems . 2 ) movies * extraordinary . * absolutely rock solid video sound great too ( very very rare ) . 3 ) it take wide angle converter , telephoto converter , hotshoe flash feature . note following drawbacks , but these common all pocket cams it seems . 1 ) useless viewfinder2 ) small aperture , completely useless putting background out focus . ( however , there just enough change focus emphasis you get tad 3d effect , but it very subtle ) . again , i able find no pocket camera fast ( large ) aperture . g6 one but otherwise -- i assure you -- inferior this camera .	1
this battery all it says it . i'm ex-pro just used battery trip haiti where i got pro again week . i used this battery its previous version , charging one while shooting other . they both charged pretty quickly , newer one charging bit faster . my 4 megapixel camera i able get half-day worth photos out both	1
i really like this camera . i especially enjoy video capture sound feature . took it kings island very pleased it functionality . picture quality amazing it very user friendly . very large lcd screen . i wish it optional view finder but i knew when i purchased it . i would like find alternate power cord it capable using . should included purchase	1
camera arrived very quickly . software installation took 2 minutes seems much simplified compared software earlier nikon camera . i am still finding how apply some features various ' picture taking ' situations . external power source correct media card it even take 25-minute movie sound	1
i use depend this my slr camera now my flat bed scanner . i need both clean . this works great . i'll order it again !	1
first . let me get something off my chest . it picture frame ! no one would buy picture frame horsepower render 10mb photos . i imagine device like would several hundred dollars . my wife complained performance wanted me send it back . i ready it until i realized what this thing really . i decided play device prove myself it worked " advertised " . i collected bunch her favorite photos mp3 file don henley " get over it " put frame slideshow mode 1 second display . conversation over we kept frame , although now i am responsible maintenance . reality this device everything advertised . it disgustingly easy use . it boasts wonderfully clear display brilliant colors . it provide hours photo viewing enjoyment . i figure 100 sheets quality photo paper two printer ink refills covers cost frame . i've read elsewhere , i too take frame apart clean glass . it easy enough , but careful because frame delicate . i put scratch it my fingernail ... down wood . if digital spectrum reading this ... fix your assembly process . performance : make this product work " advertised " photos got made small ... i mean really small . i found optimal size image should under 200k . means you simply can't take media out your camera expect photo frame render series 4mb files 10 seconds or less . while frame eventually display photos don't expect it so quickly , it just doesn't capacity it . so what all this mean you ? well , it means you've got some work . you're going learn some file management techniques . you need keep originals safe while you resize copies under 200k . but hey ... disk space cheap these days ... right ? once you get photos reasonable size , copy them off your memory device choice plug it frame enjoy . if you can't deal extra hassles you can't call yourself early adopter .	-1
not bad case , but not worth money . your pocket works just well	-1
this camera packs surprising punch little package . " pause " zoom doesn't bother me all . however , i video quality bit better . then again , if i want take lot videos , maybe i should go buy video camera ..	-1
i can't speak all advanced , fancy manual options some highly advanced photography professionals seem use rate cameras . i say what most important me choosing this camera : 1 . good flash range indoor shots beyond 10 feet . 2 . quick focus reset so it i take one or more pictures quickly without wait camera reset . 3 . realtively small size excellent viewfinder . 4 . high quality pictures without huge complexity . this camera excellent these areas . i would hightly recommend this someone who wants great pictures realatively small camera without spending ton advanced features most people never use ( although these features may available this camera - don't know don't care )	1
this camera wonderful . novice i am , it perfect . basic mode very user friendly . lcd menus great . i purchased this model primarily due 12x optical zoom not disappointed . this model advanced modes i hope master my digital knowledge grows . if you're looking camera easy use excellent features , i highly recommend dmc-fz8	1
first time video camera owner i found this camera simple use intuitive . i turned it out box just started use it without needing read any instructions . simple	1
pros : great price compact . it powers up quickly ready catch quick shot . touch screen menu works great ( see cons)cons : not come mem card(but who would expect ) . touch screen works gets dirty since it also your lcd i found i clean it often . i shot mainly outdoors video great , indoors there added noise , but what you expect ... its $350 camera .	1
this camera takes great looking pictures right out box . it very easy setup shoot . you go using presets built into camera , or go totally manual . what sold me camera fact i could use lenses my minolta camera . i would highly recommend this camera anyone considering buying dslr first time , or not .	1
bit tricky set up , but nothing special standards today technology . excellent feature	1
this camera awsome cause you store music it take pictures too , one only stupid things ... it doesn't work tripod so , i suggest you don't buy tripod if you buy this camera	-1
flash works wonders . my wife i bought it my son 17th b-day passing his driving test one take . he enjoys flash it creates nice picture his new olympus camera he got x-mas	1
i bought this so we could get better look birds our backyard . we keep it kitchen window , find ourselves using it least once week peek feathered friend who visiting . nice clear lens , pretty easy find objects through them . certainly job we need it . don't buy this if you your birding out field - these not particularly portable nor leightweight not meant ; buy binocular specifically made purpose . only complaint , it minor , i find lens caps flimsy little hard use . we generally just keep them off	-1
i bought camera picture printer my 9-year old grandson . he quickly mastered it taking beautiful pictures minimal supervision . only problem paper ink kits expensive	-1
this charger very compact sturdy . prongs connect electric outlet fold into case which very nice feature	1
i've used several digital cameras past this one my favorite . it fewest number confusing buttons ( especially no awkward , symbol-laden dial around on/off button ) most menus pretty self explanatory . its highly compact very durable -- i took mine cross-country trip through middle desert . , course , it best picture quality all cameras i've used . admittedly , it hard get pictures low light ( shutter remain open while capture enough photons , resulting blurry picture if you hold it your hands ) , but this camera hole bottom screw-in tripod stabilization . plus , its one cheaper brands out there . best bet my money .	1
best thing lcd displays all information you need know charging batteries - how much longer it go ? i've used this product more than six months it works stable it . great product ! little con misleading web page , others mentioned , it charge only one battery time . since it not product fault , i still rate it 5 stars product	1
product genuine canon battery fit my sd550 promised . i've bought cheap one off ebay before after losing my oem one , highly disappointed it 5 minute battery life . this battery legit they come lasted just long my original battery , great deal price . deifnitely must buy if you're looking similar battery	1
i'm not entirely sure what there like or not like this product ... one end fits into camera hole , other into usb port , all well	1
this 58mm adaptor arrived very quickly brand-new condition , works precisely expected specified . i purchased 58mm filters locally , no problems . i am pleased transaction	1

just took two week vacation , took my binoculars . binoculars very compact ( easy pack ) very clear view zoom feature stellar , saw mule deer using 8 power , 16 gave me closer view 24 gave me perfect rack view . all all , binoculars even better my purposes than i expected ) very satisfied !!!	1
this unit records video straight mini-dvd disks . you plug unit into tv play back , you play back lcd , you finalize disk put it into standard dvd player , or computer dvd drive . unit comes software install your pc you then use edit video clips , then re-burn new dvd if you dvd burner your pc . zoom function this unit it so powerful it absurd . it standard 40x optical zoom more than enough . top it digital zoom you program 80x or totally insane 2000x . i zoom single letter word , small print book , 50ft away , then letter disappears turns pixels . it " widescreen " setting video options , manual not say this model records widescreen , but it ! it also really cool nightshot feature uses infrared radiation so you film total darkness . sound quality this unit what most impressed me . very clear , it dolby 5.1 surround converter . it weighs less than 1 pound , battery lasts 90 recording minutes full charge .	1
i mine over year , i * love * this camera ! it so easy use , takes great pictures , very easy use program etc ... i love everything this camera . ps : unlike other poster , i not any battery problems all	1
i purchased two these cameras same time intentions making anaglyph ( red/blue 3d ) movies . while i agree picture quality leaves bit desired , these cameras just too much fun . ease use great , dual-camera rig 3d movies $200 grea t.t he picture quality akin 3mp , so don't let advertisement fool you . even still , i've printed off few these pictures photo paper i found results more than satisfactory . audio quality subpar my ears . however , this wasn't factor me , since i'm using my audio studio capture all my audio tracks . i later combine audio video through editing software . if you're serious your film projects , you're probably going want get something higher quality , this product quality like digital version vhs ( ie it pixelated little bit blurry fast movements ) . however , if you're looking fun video camera making your own home video or amateur project , this thing fine . plugged straight camera tv , semi-stationary video turn out just fine . i would recommend getting good tripod most applications . quality picture directly affected how much camera moves , so good , smooth tripod eliminate lot	-1
lense everything it advertised reasonable price	-1
i've this camera now few months love it . picture quality great , 16:9 view works great . i haven't taken too much low light movies yet so i'll wait see how picture quality scenario . only difficulty i've getting still images off card . i firewire cable i've used capture video but image software came camera doesn't seem recognize camera when it attached firewire cable . i'll get usb cable see if resolves issue	-1
i'm not pro any means , but this camera fantastic . zoom really impressive clarity great ( again ... i'm not pro , just someone who loves take pictures ) . folks who complained detachable lens cap ... it really not big deal . there small strap packaged camera , which very simple attach , connect lens cap camera . same strap also attaches wrist strap camera	1
bought this my husband birthday , he carry it around his shirt pocket . it great not carry batteries , it recharges it own cradle . batteries seem last fair amount time . it takes pictures quickly also . my son i received different models casio cameras christmas we both very happy	1
this my first digital camera . basics easy learn simple master . however , coolpix so many capabilities , it may months before i get most them . i try get it download wirelessly initially , but unable master , but included wire , it very easy download . perhaps after using it awhile , re-reading manual , i'll figure it out . i bought extra battery when shooting many pictures event , but i yet need it . battery lasts long time , even when shooting all pix flash . it take couple seconds recover flash , but it seems good/acceptable me . i never yet needed second battery even when taking 50+ pictues . one suggestion , though would way see level battery charge . you definitely need memory card . camera only good dozen pictures or so without one . overall , i'm very satisfied look forward learning much my new coolpi	1
this great little frame money . it easy use . this one replace trutech one i purchased locally returned . trutech difficult operate poor quality screen . matsunichi very easy use , much less expensive , showed clearer pictures . i'm sure there some out there much better resolution , however , money , this one great . i am very pleased	1

i very pleased get this battery which i am using alternate my p850 digital camera . battery lasts very long time , so long fact it easy forget just how long you using it since last charge . power meter camera doesn't show gradual decrease , but rather shows rapid loss last dozen shots . result i keep one camera one fully charged camera case . when one goes down i swap then charge other when i get back where i . charge cycle full charge seems long , 4 hours . but way i am using it ( swapping ) way charged battery lasts camera there no problem . no regrets	1
got this my dad christmas . my brother then went europe 1 week later took it him . he no trouble all . i don't know if we find it easy because we both own analog hi-8 version camera this just easy transition us or if it just easy use . it not play old tapes our analog recorders which we knew buying it so don't say nobody told you when you get yours can't play back tapes ! no problems video or audio either . overall it great camera price .	-1

while i am nowhere close pro , i am not stranger photography or digitals . recently i wanted something better than what i upcoming trip italy i bought lumix dmc-lx2 amazon after reading reviews , etc . it no slr , but it far more than " back-up " camera . it small enough handy without burden . ( friend we travelling digital slr 135mm zoom . she it her bag most time because it so big heavy . ) lens quality very good . absence traditional view finder very nice . tv screen back works all lighting conditions ( its adjustable ) . you little or lot technical data screen you want . it even couple nice composition templates i found useful times . i bought one after market batteries couple 2 gig cards i far more capacity than i needed 2 week trip , but second card necessary if you shoot max pixels i whole time . max jpg 2 gig card holds 350 shots . one battery all i needed so long i watched charger carefully night . sometimes current converter one use italy would shut down mid-charge . so my advice second battery switch them ou t.t his camera very versatile . it lot if one takes time study manual . ( manual not best , however ) slr beat out its zoom , but not much problem casual shooting because one crop tar out 10.1 mg shots still great photo . flash works fine . one fill flash it . i bought small slave unit works great but i never needed it . i found handy , cheap , case rei . they padded cell phone case hooks up belt or back pack . this camera fits rei case perfectly . it even side mesh pockets batteries chips . i forget price but i think it less than 20 bucks .	1
i purchased this $100 less than best buy . i am very happy kodak easy share . it easy set up printer works like magi	1
i owned this lens over year now it never ceases amaze me when i see photos it produces . over this last year i come learn thing or two how use this lens . 1 ) if you going shoot indoors , or low light , long focal length ( like 200mm ) use tripod or plenty ambient light . this lens doesn't built image stabilizer so you going steady lens tripod or use real fast shutter speed minimize your hand jitter . 2 ) use smaller aperture . i found my best photos come aperture 8.0 thru 16 . these apertures aren't great bokeh ( background blur ) but they sure allow you take razor sharp pictures . praise . focal range . one lens you able take nice wide-angle shots ( 18mm ) twist zoom ring you nice telephoto lens ( 200mm ) definitely good walk around lens day botanical gardens , museum or amusement park . build quality . this lens gives you nice solid feel your hands . give it shake it doesn't make sound . zoom focus rings move smoothly without sloppy . lens this well built you would expect it heavy . not so this lens , it quite light ( which something you really appreciate after long day carrying it around . ) minimal chromatic aberrations . lens ' three hybrid aspherical elements two low dispersion glass elements correct almost all lateral on-axis aberrations making most your images optically clear . size . it lowest focal length ( 18mm ) lens small enough fit into mid size top loading camera bag while still attached camera body . complaint ? well yes , i one minor complaint lens . auto focus slow . how slow ? well let just say you won't want try photograph two year old move . i found i keep fast moving objects better focus switching manual	1

compact so it fits you pocket , high tech enough dance it bigger counterparts . this little camera it all . i comparison shopped several weeks comparing contrasting multiple cameras cannon , kodak , hp , sony , panasonic , olympus , none features like this , small size , this price range . upgrades form old 710 5x optical zoom 5.6 digital zoom ( 28x total ) up close , excellent photos , dual image stabilization . 7.1 megapixels , dual image stabilization ( both digital optical stabilization shake free pictures new 750 760 models ) , 2.5 inch lcd viewing screen , low price what you get . oh , i mention excellent pictures . i played this several days now editing photos , paling on-board computer imaging package , i see nothing wrong this camera everyday average user like me . it weather resistence , nice clumsy average user like me . also battery life very adequate , 120 photos or more , slide shows , editing ect ... this well worth investment , saving your families memories fit proper manner . olympus master software you computer very easy use , panoramic feature , 3d , extra art features unlocked olympus brand-olympus stamped type hd , this camera becomes even more pleasure own . you edit photos computer , or right palm your hand . both ways , this camera make you feel like pro no time .	1

you know feeling ... one you get after taking bunch indoor shots you think turned out great , but look really crappy your computer then you waste tons time trying photshop pics , well that feeling i every compact digital camera i've owned . this especially disappointing when you important events like birthdays , weddings , etc . indoor pics turn out bad . trust me check out this camera . you shocked how noise free indoor pics ( even iso 800 w/o flash ) . i don't know non-slr camera takes indoor pics this well . build quality superb ( all metal construction ) . only things i don't like : no separate battery charger included ( you must charge camera ) , no viewfinder , xd card format . those minor quibbles i would trade them any day fantastic indoor pics . i am photography enthusiast canon fan ( over $3k bodies lenses ) my main camera rebel xti . however , i've got give fuji lot credit focusing pic quality rather than getting into megapixel war . don't fooled megapixel myths . this camera may lower mp but it very large ccd sensor compact camera . gods sake don't buy camera based looks !!! you really care what camera looks like or you care pictures ??? also , optical image stabilization ( ois ) seems latest rage . who cares if camera ois , but takes crappy indoor pics ? this reason i passed canon sd800 .	1
i purchased this item mainly bird watching . i own two canon lenses technology i really appreciate value brings . i tried other binoculars same range found canon 10x30 outperforms all them . image clarity excellent . works great reduces eye strain great extend . compact design light weight help you carry binocular your other photography gears field guides . only drawback i could find not lens cover object lens . aware , this binocular water resistant , not water proof . overall great investment . i would recommend this anyone looking good binocular bird watching sports .	-1
great choice first time buyers . this camera easy learn it advanced features you learn you go ... when you master these you realize you shooting like pro . vast array nikon lenses accessories big selling point me ability control nikon speedlights remotely via camera some really great shooting setups . d200 my dream come true . it provides all professional features amateur would want price affordable . d200 incorporates most latest enhancements available digital imaging including 10 megapixel censor , matrix ii metering , detailed battery indicator , large buffer continuous shoots much much more . buy this nikon	1
great pictures , fast response time . good resolution little ultra compact . why pay sony t10 , when this so much less , takes standard sd memory like my old camera . memory stick change major reason why i wont change over sony . nikon shines this one	1
this great little unit , if you get it under $50 . more than it limitations drive you nuts . battery life : grea t.t ransfering photos : drag drop card reader sd card ... great . i not tried using easy-share software transfer . viewing : great , but .... previous reviewer said , you can't organize photos into folders . see photo , you need scroll through entire card . this really makes it useful only few photos . i love it able carry few photos around show friends , but remember , that few due navigation limitations . kodak , please release firmware fix address this , this thing goes 5 stars plus !!	-1
i love my tripod . it sturdy easy use . my only problem i lost one my quick release shoes . i'm looking more . i'm not sure they sell them seperately . would shame . however , tripod itself great . enjoy .	1
this lens great - very sharp well worth money . especially since nikon version twice much - this lens wider ( 10mm vs . nikon 12mm ) ... some complained " distortion " 10mm , true , there some , but that what i like it . what fun wide angle if no one tell it wide angle ? if you fence , buy it . you won't regret it	1
took mine trip caicos island where it promptly dropped , mauled possibly even slightly neglected ( i never soaked it after bringing it out saltwater ) . worked without flaw . just easy use without case . if you've got kids , pete sake buy one these . while making it not only virtually trash proof , it enables you take it places you would probably never take your digital camera otherwise ... beach , pool . forget it ! got mine scuba.com $150	1
hello , i'm glad this product , i haven't try it yet outside my house but really dark condition it works pretty well , i need turn ir button clearly i read even sign bottle total darkness . this thing really work	1
this my second digital camera ; i've using most recently nikon 35mm though it probably isn't fair make comparisons , i find this little digital every bit responsive easy use 35mm . i haven't noticed any lack speed shooting , etc . maybe that because this camera used mostly pleasure rather than business , so i take more relaxed attitude . i think price all options it offer , l6 fine choice i would not hesitate recommend it . i'm merely hobbyist when it comes photography , again , maybe that why my attitude more relaxed . i don't demand anything much other than good final product , my new l6 delivers	1
this charger pretty amazing ! it smallest most compact one market , plus it comes car charger . charges 90 minutes or so . if you looking compact , this it , it good looks too !!	1
this may not most expensive filter but it works great my digital camera . it well worth money low cost encourage you replace it when it eventually get scratched	1
this awesome little camera . except you can't use it night ! there horrible white spots nighttime photos when flash used . apparently these appear because flash so close lens this camera , so dust reflects badly . it known problem [ ... ] also , it totally annoying sony uses all their proprietary technology . result , cable connecting this camera computer unwieldly ( uhh , you heard usb ??!! ) , you buy sony memory stick , which probably won't work anything else you . flipside , you take movies aren't limited 30 seconds this guy - i think might result memory stick technology . but other than , design operation this little guy seems pretty slick . lens not one those pops out , so not sure if affects image quality all , but far i could tell , quality good . end , what good camera can't take usable pictures its flash ??	-1
guide number correct , but ... it so small ; -	-1
this my second rangefinder bushnell . first one scout , which excellent product but could not get pin beyond 200 yards . this version gets pin out 400 or so , depending conditions . it little bulkier than scout , but you get 7x magnification much better optics looking green . you range any object course , like lip bunker , far side pond , tree , etc . know exactly how far you need carry ball . this flexibility makes laser much better than any gps , you don't pay subscription or participating course use laser , it works anywhere . laser rangefinder improve your game first allowing you learn what distance you hit every club bag , there no guessing , you get instant feedback . second if you play strange courses often it allows you see hole plan strategy tee . it also amazing how many courses yardage markers incorrect .	1
very speedy delivery . gift my daughter . she loves it . i thought we receive free photo card but not . not really necessary . not know . still playing it blast . i like it weather resistant	1
this case worked very well , without adding lot weight or bulk camera . i took it snorkeling ( watertight 12 feet ) , white water rafting snow skiing , it worked well . all controls accessible , it doesn't fog up if you follow acclimatization tips it keeps valuable camera dry . only thing watch you keep wrist strap out way when putting camera into case , so you don't crimp seals	-1
this one those line item purchases flies face conventional . this tripod combo meets need no extravagant bells whistles . it well designed engineered weight materials quite acceptable fit finish price . i actually smile incessantly using this combo	-1
i used battery past few months past few months together two canon batteries . i not went out my way compare their battery life , but not discern notable difference among them	1
this very good point shoot digital camera ! i tested cameras all major manufacturers decided this one my wife one simple reason - shutter lag time almost non-existant . it almost like using film camera . picture quality decent , movie quality . if you want fast reacting point shoot digital camera , this it .	-1
light , easy use adjust , classy looking .... its sony ! i am very pleased vctr640 would highly recommend it . it very stable pans ease . you spend more .... but you not find better product !	1
this film really good one - i used 3 rolls these films very happy . i also used ilford xp2 super - but , i prefer kodak film . i taken several portraits just home decoration light-stand desk lamp - film exposed correctly because higher asa . also , i like convinience printing local shop . development cost same color printing - it best way get bw print cheap	-1
it good fit e-900 . it doesn't center hole flap lanyard . it leather flap , rest nylon	-1
it works perfectly ! sure it bit pain adapter attach lens camera but it so simple use . it attaches very smoothly easily both lens camera . mount very secure stable . yes there bit " tunnel " effect until you use w/t function camera but overall it works great	1
pros : video quality gl2 excellent good lighting still good low light but noticeable noise . image stabilizer works great even if you don't steady hand , even full telephoto won't make you nauseous . analog digital feature nice able convert just anything digital . full manual controls great anyone who wants control how their video comes out . automatic modes pretty good but that not why you would buy this camera . even automatic focus aperture work good but kind slow . this work your advantage if someone walks front camera or you pan past window , but if it loses focus or changes aperture it doesn't bounce right back . cons : this camera notorious faulty tape decks . if it doesn't give eject tape message it still requires constant cleaning head cleaning tape , every 5 hours horizontal lines appear lcd . photo feature kind pointless , only 1.7 megapixels , anyone who could afford this camera would already camera would take better pictures . it can't used while recording , requires seperate shooting mode . summary : all around great camera but gets dirty easily . video quality manual controls top notch .	-1
i photography hobby over 20 years . i love pentax cameras because lightness lens compatibility this best slr i ever . i still need test some its features . but i am very happy quality pictures . i upgraded istds i got two years back . shake reduction come very useful when i take pictures my 2 year old son who not stay one place . i used get many blurred images ist ds low shutter speeds this camera handles very well . colors very natural i like fact i save images both raw jpeg same time . i usually use raw store my images jpeg web email . image processor may not good what u may find nikon or canon but raw images very impressive . i think i finally got right camera really replace my older film based pentax slr still i use all those expensive lenses i without spend more money . if u owner pentax slr many lenses wants go digital , there no better choice than k10d unless u lot money invest camera new lenses	1
this my first digital camera , i lot search finaly i decide dsc-w55 black , what i looking , small enough it my purse , lot functions , very easy import pictures my computer , you only connect camera usb cable you don't need install software came camera , i windows vista i didn't any problems transfering pictures , best camera price great , you choose super saver shipping save more . you love this camera too , small , very pretty , lots options , take great pictures . some one wrote review this camera feels like plastic , that not true , looks very durable me i think good product worth every single dollar you spend . easy shoot pictures auto adjustment mode , start taking pictures sooner you charge battery , because this camera internal memory you buy memory card later . well hope you lots fun taking pictures , good luck ..!	1
if you ignore one star rviews some people actually giving reviewers(in which they correct doing so , but incorrect reviewing battery it ) then you would see average go up . i buy these all time my d550z . i alot research not only this best battery solution d550 , it pretty good one . d550z your common camera takes great pictures . these batteries last long time , we young baby we both photographers taken over 3,000 pictures last sixteen months , number not exagerated . these batteries generally last two or three months . sometimes flash , sometimes screen . short , these batteries great your basic common camera eaten up power hungry cameras like e10 20 . they last way longer than alkalines nimh . i personally don't like rechargable solution because you spend lot time charging batteries die quickly . every time you load these batteries you going change nimh 3 times charge total 5 hours . charging much time expensive itself . $15 every two three months , amount we shoot , bargain , bargain over time spent . these should last regular point shooter much longer	1
i got en-el3a free replacement recalled en-el3 battery . ( check nikonusa dot com see if your en-el3 recalled . ) it perfect my d70 -- reviewer pointed out , it gives you slightly more power juice -- 7% more . if you looking buy official nikon battery this good value . btw you find generic brands ( also here amazon.com ) $20 . i'm not saying whether you should buy nikon or generic oem one . after all , nikon screwed up en-el3 so i can't vouch their safety . like original en-el3 this likely made china	1
i've this camcorder week now i think it works great .. except touch screen feature . takes little getting used .. especially when accessing special features ( such fader effects ) while filming . digital still quality poor when recording directly memory stick .. but same images taken still prerecorded tape much clearer . all all it good product .. just takes some getting used	-1
this amazing compact camera , all wanted features . i looking camera compact good optical zoom well takes gr8 pictures . i stunned how much this little thing deliver . it just too amazing ... i would definitely recommend it . ps : there lots better camera available similar or better features , but they come large price .	1
i ended up buying this camera ( even though i heard bad things kodak ) because i liked feel it my hand . i don't like small thin cameras . it somewhere point shoot slr . since i can't afford slr i went this . i say i love camera . i already shot enough pics printed them my printer they came out great . i love all features . it reminds me my 35mm slr i still own use time time . i don't find any lag taking pictures . however , if you auto shoot , it needs focus first before you take shot . but my 35mm slr same thing . i thinkg shutter just fine . i would reccommend this camera someone who needs upgrade point shoot . after reading reviews , i am seriously thinking getting extended warranty it . escpecially since my last camera crapped out me 1 1/2 years later . only thing i seem problem my fingers like hit control buttons right side camera while i am trying take picture . it could i am lefty all controls right side . but price , you can't go wrong .	-1
this battery awsome charges 2 hours or less actualy good 150 pics or more promised . you get one knockoff batteries sell here amazon $6.88 far i tell works just good . i one each but only few days now each through full charge drain i noticed no difference them	1

picture taking my life !! i would almost board family functions without camra my hands . i got my vivitar camra pawn shop $10 it amazing . i took it my papa house over summer i got some beutiful pictures . this easy camra work i love way it takes vidio even if it soundless . 4th july i took some videos fireworks it so much fun look even without sound . this not my first camra what so ever . i many other camras camras cost well over 500 dollors , but this camra just fine me . only thing i don't like it zoom . when you zoom like 4x it makes picture really blurry . but if you expirenced photo taking it shouldn't problem . i recommend this camra i thinkj it good find .	1
when i bought this camera i no idea potential this little powerhouse would bring . i took this italy trip my dad proceeded take 800 pictures . my two weeks journey through rome , venice , florence , southern italy , i slowly learned many features settings this camera offer . people amazed clarity , how professional each picture looks . this camera ! stephen john becciaauthor treelanders -- journey giants	1
this isn't professional camera but snapshots , its dream ! its very easy use if you handle camera like any 10 year old would . ( just start hitting buttons , till you've figured out how it works . ) my only issue taking pictures trees flowers . there setting this scene , but no matter what i , shots come out almost unreal looking . pictures people come out great ! :) software useless unless you windows 98 , but camera itself works without software any higher programs like xp . i hoping make larger prints this camera , but i'm beginning think its not going produce anything larger than 8 1/2 11 . i think its partly fault digital printers thoough	-1
i noticed over all performance upgrade my canon a630 since purchasing these batteries . they last long time camera operates faster all together . lag time reduced photos trememndously	1

good camera $129 i paid . everything pretty well , your picture modes pretty customizable . only qualm it takes second or two longer than i wish when camera saves/loads pictures memory card . might problem when trying shoot consecutive pictures -- but probably wouldn't doing it this type camera anyways .	-1
great simple case your compact camera ... slick design combing hard soft case .. extra pouch great spare battery or card	1
this my fifth digital camera , i like it best far . it also cheapest . it my first wide-angle my first silver-not-black : someone else said , i don't see how i would ever go back non-wide-angle after this ; but i wish mine black . i noticed colors faded fluorescent light , but macro it excellent -- much better than more expensive camera i already bought macro purposes ( canon . ) i also love battery , which seems last forever . i bought replacement lenmar battery which also great , cheap , but it got some bad reviews because it described wrong model camera , not fx-01 . ( if you read customer reviews , you figure out which one right one you . ) i problems understanding display , which shows options don't correspond any place camera you select options . ( i guess i should look manual . ) also , i don't like software decided not download it all . i bought this because i wanted camera made computer company much camera company , , i wanted it work . also , someone sent me email history leica , how they saved lot jews concentration camps . other nice thing this camera i use it lot more because i carry it me every day : it tiny battery always works , so why not ? graininess , my desktop pics look fine , i would not raving this camera if it not very easy take good pics -- but i admit i haven't used it printed pics so far	1

i waiting affordable nikon digital slr which i could use my older nikon lenses ( ai , series , etc . ) . i know , i could spent thousands d2 , but would overkill me . suffice say , d200 joy use . it fast , solid , intuitive . those owners nikon film slrs who considering d200 , me it " feels " just like nikon film slr . i previously owned several high-end digital point shoot cameras , d200 blows them away terms its capabilities , degree control it offers , resulting quality pictures you take it . it all features advanced amateur photographer could possibly want . i'll probably never even scratch surface all its features , but its nice know they're there if i want or need them . i highly recommend d200 anyone who , like me , waiting right digital slr come	1
i received product promptly it works perfectly my battery . i little worried my battery would not fit . however it perfect match . i'd buy again amazon	1
i now two pairs these binocs ( 1st set stolen my car ) . prior i canon 10x30 binocs , pair swarovski 8x32 years ago some leica 10x40 trinovids . my main use them birdwatching , though i use them other purposes . i disagree prior reviewer who would not recommend these birdwatching ... if you handle weight . works brilliantly . my experience view through these blows away view one get any non-is binocs ( leicas , nikon , etc ) . 10x42 much larger heavier than 10x30 binocs , however you gain ( 1 ) significantly brighter , more contrasty view , ( 2 ) much wider field view , ( 3 ) great ruggedness waterproofness . downsides minor : ( 1 ) i mention they heavy ? ( canon provides thick neoprene strap - you might consider one those behind-the-back shoulder straps , ( 2 ) anodizing unarmormed part body wears off way too quickly , making them look more used than they ( both pairs i've owned ) , ( 3 ) glass objectives barely rececessed making it too easy get fingerprints glass . however , first time you get some beautiful bird binocs , color knock your socks off detail you see amaze you . now , if they could just lighter cheaper ...	1
