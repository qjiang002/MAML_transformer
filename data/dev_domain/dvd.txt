i worked out denise austin several years because i think she gives good workout but i cannot stand her way-too-perky personality . i very disappointed this dance workout . setting fun colorful music great , but far workout ... this dvd really stinks . i found some steps somewhat confusing ( but i am not very coordinated ) . this workout more " indoor walk " style workout ( like walk away pounds w/ leslie sansone , etc . ) . if you looking fun way get up move , this may you . but , this not anyone looking cardio intense workout	-1
whoever made this film obviously trying impress upon viewer idea artists deep complex people . but all i see film low life drug addict losers who sit around ( few them seem jobs ) party all day . main character ( sid ) pseudointellectual who claims she majored critical theory college ( ultra liberal nonsense which goal undermining western culture pave pathway marxism ) . film appeals naive youth	-1
okay , i gave pretty bad review this dvd originally because it didn't play right . but after viewing it without technical problems , i would like say it pretty good program given rarity subject matter , good addition any collection . ancient muscle conditioning ? not many dvd out there subject . i've edited my original review it won't allow me give it more stars , but i'd give it 4 . sorry , mr. keen , if i cost you sales this . i commend you putting this out	-1
i couldn't watch this till end . bad production values , gimmicky , desperate make point violence voyeurism evil wanting make it evah so clevah while my neurons slowly commit suicide �nnui . if you wanna go all deep thoughts violence still get shaken - both intelectually viscerally - try something like miike " ichi killer " . makes this movie look so , so needless . leading man looked geeky occasionally cute . 2 stars eye candy	-1

they just don't movies like this anymore . this not movie makes charlie sheen or tom berenger appeal young audiences who like flashy stars sceen . this amovie show you reality war experiences happened people past . charlie sheen stars man who volutarily goes war . this seems odd he figures out why everyone looking him so weird when he telling them this later movie . he finds out alright . keith david plays his friend who tries keep his spirits up this definitely his best role . he cheers him up great scene where they get extremely baked . supporting cast this movie unbelievable no flat performances here . overall this my favorite movie all time . it stood test time never fails when i want see good movie . i just old special edition , not 20th anniversary but extras very nice . it commentary direcotor seperate one military advisor who worked film . there also lengthy doumentary making when i saw this i mroe than glad i got special edition . you would nto believe what actors went through ! it great making .	1

philip noyce very smart filmmaker . once more he confirms it through this intense intriguing psychological picture around notable expert forensic ( denzel washington ) sadly bedridden quadriplegic who joins forces witty female agent ( angelina jollie ) intend all their means get mysterious serial killer around low belly nyc . smart clues , notable shots , first rate direction , kinetic script make this movie one five most solid thrillers nineties according tradition silence lambs well underneath homage " rear window " , if you carefully establish visible connections , due if james stewart visible peeping tom those times , denzel washington scrutinizing cyber eye . paradigm remains , just form changes . highly recommended .	1
" sentinel " isn't movie i entirely expected like , although i've wanted see it since it theatres . even though plot different , it kept bringing mind movie released this year called " firewall . " even while watching this movie , i thought it similar " firewall " many ways ... but i also found myself entertained it . now presidential assassination movies almost cliche now ; but few good ones come around . my favorite movie this kind " line fire . " it entertaining , well acted , made sense , great film . sentinel good performances , it entertaining , but it doesn't always make sense . it never really explained why people this film want kill president . even if they just want it it , they could've told us . inside man told us bankrobbers just wanted it beginning . anyway , oscar winner michael douglas ( best actor , ' wall street ' ) plays pete garrison , secret service agent who once took bullet ronald reagan . years later , pete affair first lady ( kim basinger ) odds his former best friend david breckinridge ( marvelous kiefer sutherland ) , also secret service agent . see david under impression pete affair his wife . anyway , through rat , pete discovers there mole secret service who helping terrorists plot kill president . same time , pete getting anonymously blackmailed his affair first lady , result , evidence piling up fact pete maybe mole . now entire secret service after him , including david his new partner jill ( eva longoria , who got some good acting chops away wisteria lane ) . this movie its share cliches . there few times where i watching this movie thinking myself " sounds/looks familiar . " i saw end coming mile away . but , ending quickly redeems itself ( my point-of-view anyway ) relationship pete first lady not going direction you'd think . lot people won't like this film reasons i've mentioned more ... but if you want some semi-mindless entertainment ( although this movie its smart characteristics blending its flaws ) , then sentinel actually pretty good way pass time . due its flaws , only fact i enjoyed it support my case , i should give it 4 stars ... but i think it worthy enough 5 . entertainment goes long way . grade :	1
well , finally we've reached end " yellow brick road " ourselves great dvd release this awesome concert out oz , nov 1993 . i love how this band still gives fans what they want ( check : need lol ) release great great great dvd their live shows ! i mean , i am prince fan also ( not much i i 14)and guy barely let out any his spectacular concert shows ! ( " syracuse ' 85 " , " sign o ' times " , " rave 2000 " , now " alladin live " --- that it ?? ) out vhs or dvd . " alladin " " rave " only dvd releases , well officially anyways . u2 could would put out live anthology boxed set - 1979-2006 if they wanted it would not culled any their already released live dvd/vhs releases(ie " zoomerang sydney " , " popmart mexico city " etc)i mean mind boggles possibilities ! but what come out quality quantity ! i mean they put out fabulous " chicago 2005 " show last year ( same year it recorded -in may ! ) there talk " vertigo tour " dvd ( forgot what show -i wanna say mexico city ) this year too ! i mean we u2 fans it too damn good ! i know forthcoming " popmart " dvd release due probably next year . like this dvd they put out great transfer fun bonus material really capture " era " it represented . " zoo tv " " popmart " both my two favorite tours , even though i never got myself u2 concert until november 2001 transcendent experience ! same " vertigo nov 2005 " , but show not high standard left big stadium tours . these guys still deliver . wait patient " red rocks 1983 " too it come out soon i think ! when it , expect same love care given out men u2 !!!	1
beatles accomplished so much - good music , good recording capturing their magic , good transferring their personalities appeal onto film . help ! meant fun it some slapstick elements mostly due ringo abilities straight man . he always most honest one he holds film together . if anyone feels he didn't much others , then this film evidence contrary . beatles ' humour style incorporates elements goons peter sellers , who friend theirs . enjoy this silly film marvel best songs it .	-1
i grabbed this flick shelf very wet miserable day my local target .... craving summer sun needing island vacation .... cover appealled me these reasons i admit i not all disappointed movie . scenery indeed spectacular . underwater diving/snorkling scenes clear , crisp , just what doctor ordered . even sharks rays made it all quite beautiful . ok , enough shallow stuff .... movie indeed much like 70 flick " deep " which i enjoyed back then well . characters jared sam pretty believable - poor , honest , happy folks ( most us would love really this happy - let face it ! ) introduction bryce ( played scott caan ) really created interesting balance characters how each reacted many dangers , twists , etc . overall , bikinis buff guys added adventure many us would love our generally boring lives . would i want deal tiger sharks ? no , but little excitement would beat heck out my boring 9-5 job every day .	-1

i just kid when this show ... i loved every episode it . back then , it looked sleek , chic , exciting , everything you could ask tv show ... just like charlie angels ... or vega$ ... i remember them all ... almost 30 years later , it looks so dated ... so different today fast paced , violent , end-twisting , loud , in-your-face tv . still we love it . stories so simple ... wagner powers so much charm ... so much style . let me add today i guess i still secretly dream 1978 mercedes-benz yellow wagon big telephone ( laughs ) . it used so super cool !!! wathing those episodes made me feel again like 6 year-old kid just introduced late 70 television - jokes , kitchens , hairdos , telephones , vcrs , big cars , disco ... oh , i loved mark snow theme . i recognized it instantly ... max introduction mr. mrs. ... whose hobby murder !!! you want know what dreams middle class ' during late 70 ? watch hart hart . everything great . everything ideal ! what great show ! thanks memory . ps ... someday , someone write history american society through 20th century tv shows ' point view . i'm sure hart hart , charlie angels , moonlighting , magnum pi ( many many others)will all lot say . classic !!!!!	1
nick devlin ( lee marvin ) , enforcer chicago mob , sent kansas city collect debt rancher meat packer named mary ann ( gene hackman ) . mary ann sent mob run things down there now claims fiefdom his own . previous enforcers dealt way appropriate mary ann chosen industry . nick takes his trusted driver three mob goons him collect money . upon their arrival , they find mary ann presiding over livestock auction , but livestock this auction meat packer second source income , prostitution . nick rescues poppy ( sissy spacek ) , drugged out young woman , they leave . neither nick or mary ann give other , leaving only one conclusion . " prime cut " directed michael ritchie , made 1972 , new film me . recently , ebert roeper featured number lee marvin films new dvd . i never fan marvin , but films looked intriguing so i gave few try also revisited " professionals " , one my favorite films starring burt lancaster lee marvin . it important remember film made 1972 because it strikes viewer dated . shortly after nick rescues poppy , he buys her dress ( she naked livestock auction ) they go dinner fancy restaurant his hotel . poppy new dress little hide her breasts , but she seems blissfully unaware older men women restaurant stare her . all time , nick poppy ignore them , trying conversation . everything this scene screams early 70s me , their conversation `subtle ' look class . later film , nick his goons arrange meet mary ann local county fair collect money . this sequence introduced series close ups man walking stilts , children laughing , etc ., all meant disorient viewer before letting them become familiar new setting . again , very 70s . there many sequences film which strange , unusual interesting , ultimately making film worth watching . opening sequence ; mary ann demented brother , weenie ( gregory walcott ) gets rid one mob enforcers ( perhaps most memorable scene ) , harvesting machine chasing nick poppy through corn field , ritchie seems paying homage hitchcock it works . action scenes interesting hold your attention . even scene set corn field , which close enough called rip off famous chase hitchcock " north northwest " ; ritchie adds little touch end make it memorable interesting . you won't able stop watching it . when story turns more sedate matters everything relies actors , film less successful . marvin seems most comfortable portraying mobsters , generals cowboys throughout his career . his demeanor well-suited these types roles . he merely stare most men they surrender . this persona works well this character . but when nick supposed human , it doesn't work . when nick takes poppy dinner , it isn't clear if nick trying romance poppy or become her supportive " uncle " . she clearly seems flirting him but nick doesn't seem return favor . thankfully . this point marvin 47 ( wow , he looks older . but i guess he always . ) spacek 22 . not very age appropriate . this scene works if poppy flirting nick ; he just saved her life prostitution her life pretty screwed up point . but it would creepy watch marvin nick putting moves younger actress . gene hackman always interesting watch . villain name mary ann going fairly menacing . hackman follows occasional outbursts quick smile or joke , trying hide his true menace . this performance reminded me exactly lex luthor makes this character seem all more like dry run villain he would play " superman " films beginning 1978 . sissy spacek good , her first starring role , but part very traditional take female sidekick so prevalent action films . great performance , check out her later work " bedroom " . " prime cut " memorable exercise action filmmaking . two sequences film stay me long time . you figure out which ones ?	-1
how you twist turn most obnoxious individual completely disgusting job into hero ? black magic . after some time you begin wish him well feel tempted light up . this lovely satire political correctness , lobbyism , corruption draws you into unbearable lightness smooth talking . if you argue correctly , you not wrong , right ? eckhart perfect main part ; there many nice smaller parts , but my favorite little boy playing hero son . boy deserves nomination best supporting actor . actually he looks like scarlet little brother sometimes . they related	1
i read book then re-read book . i saw movie not once but twice . it somewhat different book . i like pollock lot , his movies so interesting me i could'nt wait movie come out . acting well only one flaw . casting tom cruise this otherwise well developed movie . everyone else great job acting here . me though , tom miscasted . he seems out place . his thinking good his intentions what character suppose but he just did'nt click what sidney wanted character . sorry cruise fans he wasted far i am concerned . gene hackman , well ed harris they well . great movie but could better without cruise here	-1
i read book before i saw movie . i am committed , devout catholic christian also , but i never read book or saw movie anything more than exciting fiction ... i think all bashing alarmismfrom religious right " overblown media many christian community who gladly mined book movie themselves profits ...

i am diehard aitf fan since it first aired so i don't care extras or digital remasterings . what shown dvd includes footage hasn't aired thirty years because it trimmed out so they could show more commercials syndicated reruns . this series seminal piece television history . current political climate hypersensitivity political correctness series like this could never produced it sad commentary how low american culture declined . i don't know what holding up dvd releases but i would snap up entire series plus abp boxed set second i wish how they would just release this series	-1

" brother brother " packs lot ambition into its compact running time . director rodney evans interwoven modern-day story perry , young gay african-american artist ( anthony mackie ) living new york , struggling find love sense identity , nothing less than brief film history birth harlem renaissance literary movement , its seminal figures langston hughes , wallace thurman , zora neale hurston bruce nugent shown black-and-white flashbacks . aged , destitute but still witty unbowed nugent ( roger robinson ) befriends perry present becomes his touchstone . " brother brother " perhaps its best flashbacks , which vividly capture excitement sense limitless possibility briefly existed nugent his compatriots they founded radical literary journal " fire ! " they make one want know more these people . present-day narrative its virtues well , shedding light special problems gay african-americans well struggle maintain one artistic identity integrity . frankness which male/male sex treated , without prurience or heavy guilt , most welcome . curiously , reviewer mentioned , however , couplings shown almost exclusively involve black white men , which undercuts film contention black gay men should celebrate their uniqueness . moreover , evans ' protagonist too many issues contend -- homophobic parents classmates , trying make living painter , boyfriend troubles -- everything fit comfortably within short allotted time . finally , it must said actor greater emotional range than mackie may able bring out more facets perry , who too often seems merely handsome , glum cipher . still , despite its flaws , " brother brother " succeeds illuminating corners human experience long neglected mainstream filmmaking , this certainly merits praise	-1

this interesting informative dvd gain broader view how media operates , especially during runup iraq war . however , it so jam-packed information it occasionally seems gloss over important points or scenarios . there some segments i would liked schechter elaborated few which could presented more clearly . member younger generation this dvd great because it provides informed picture just how much media bed government . me , it tied lot loose ends together my head gave me broader view how mass media functions . i disagree reviewer schechter movie too much . he narrating his own point view he stayed out way when it appropriate .	-1

i love jeff goldblum , but he didn't carry this film . film ruined me second julane moore ( yuck ! ) ridiculous , lame token black daughter goldblum showed up no doubt satisfy nauseating political correctness hollywood all expense this bust film . it obviously too much ask white protagonist actually white daughter . what concept . it just added disbelief characters ( stay goldblum ) , storyline , ultimate letdown this much anticipated sequel . jurassic park iii wasn't much better	-1
movie aside , this dvd set great . there two versions this film choose this dvd ; original , directors cut . i loved new version added scenes ( even though they aren't significant plot it nice able watch them ) . additional bonus features extensive , rodriguez cooking class also quite fun . movie ... it sheer genius . i don't always love rodriguez work but when he gets it right it doesn't get much better . this movie my favorite film 2005 . fact frank miller co-director shines through results . this movie follows original graphic novels ( which i would also highly recommend ) scene scene . it like graphic novel came life . use black white , mixed flashes color makes this one most visually innovative films i ever seen . fact it not even mentioned academy ( technical merit if nothing else ) inexcusable . major strength this film like other successful adaptations ( i.e. lord rings ) source material first rate . when basis film good frank miller graphic novels it makes it hard go wrong - when miller himself helps direct it makes it almost sure thing . not gush , but i think no major flaws this film - acting , directing , cinematography , script , plot ... everything perfect . if you haven't seen this film , or read original graphic novels , yourself favor check this out .	1

just any movie featuring howard keel likely among very best late mgm musicals , this version oft-adapted broadway classic shows you why . he plays gaylord ravenal , " tennessee ravenals , " river gambler dandy who loses his steamboat ticket game wanders down riverside try con his way aboard cap'n andy hawks ( joe . brown ) showboat " cotton blossom . " there he meets , instantly falls , captain daughter magnolia ( usually known nolie ) , romantic aspiring actress played kathryn grayson , frequent face 1950 mgm films .

" besides gorgeous music -- which itself reason enough own rewatch this movie ( i always sing my two favorite pieces , " ol ' man river " " you love , " even though i keep adjusting my pitch ! ) -- lavish production values make it superior example last glory days greatest musical studio ever grace hills hollywood ; opening sequence , when " cotton blossom " pulls one many river towns draws stampeding crowd men , women , children , old young , black white , even delightedly watched two " shady ladies " lacy wrought-iron balcony , one best scenes it .

my new year resolution see bunch movies i'd always intended see but continually seemed miss . somewhat belatedly i'm fulfilling my resolution , which why i finally saw westworld . although it somewhat dated , i surprised how much i enjoyed this . film concerns delos , resort future allows guests visit either three theme parks where behavior frowned upon modern world engaged without repercussion . guests engage orgiastic sex , feasting heavy drinking , killing opponents just sheer fun it . one choose doing this roman world , medieval world , or westworld . film focuses primarily two visitors westworld , played richard benjamin james brolin . this one last sci-fi films made before onset personal computer , yet one first actually utilize computers making it . according one book i recently read , cgi representing vision field gunslinger robot first use computers generate images film history . so , this way it could considered cutting edge . other hand , when things start going wrong number robots , head technology delos describes ailment " disease . " today we'd obviously describe this virus their software . " westworld " clearly stock warner brothers western set used approximately same time blazing saddles . this works well film it gives viewer image seems weirdly familiar ( though understandably familiar , since it used dozens movies hundreds television episodes ) . so visitors park get pretty much western experience prior media would conditioned them expect . even bad guys seem familiar . yul bryner , instance , wears exactly same outfit he wore when he starred magnificent seven . visitors quickly fall into routine , james brolin doing obvious imitation clint eastwood richard benjamin quickly breaking out mold somewhat nerdy lawyer . they visit local brothel , kill robot played yul bryner couple times , get arrested break out jail shoot sheriff , get drunk middle huge brawl . then things go wrong major scale , robots going killing spree . highpoint film long chase richard benjamin yul bryner . remake westworld currently development . i am normally opposed remakes . most part remakes pale imitations originals , even case most sci-fi films . remakes invasion body snatchers inferior original , while original planet apes vastly superior remake . but this one instance where , if correctly , remake could improve upon original . film well , but it made well before computers came dominate cultural life . result , computerized control room looks absurdly primitive . instance , there no keyboards , but only consoles buttons switches knobs . danger , course , going overboard special effects . temptation all too often go overboard cgi spectacular effects ; such cases story sacrificed spectacle . my hope they keep this under control keep enhancements minimum . all all , this very enjoyable different sci-fi film . it directed written michael crichton i couldn't help but think throughout it how similar overall premise crichton creation : jurassaic park . both deal things going wrong technologically advanced theme parks . substitute dinosaurs robots or vice versa you essentially same movie .	-1
this wonderfully creepy movie . one my favorites .	1
i watched this movie no particular bias wal-mart . i understand this movie made same way political ads , where they try really hard skew facts make viewer emotional reaction half story provided . i think most people it highly effective , but it didn't work me . i think this excellent movie show example skew , perspective , propaganda . when they talk sweatshops china honduras i found myself -- though i dont envy workers -- laughing movie . i used live china i many factories conditions they make seem exclusive universal over there . it film makers then ex-employees ( they assuming viewers ) who putting their cultural assumptions how sad it they work so hard get paid so little , but other countries fact life nothing wal-mart . cultural governmental problem within countries where factories exist , not only problem wal-mar t.t he movie also discuss how wal-mart employees burden government because fact wal-mart pays very little then suggests it employess go public assitance , but truth same fast-food companies everywhere else pays minimum wage offers little benefits . i believe wal-mart should morally proivide their employees more wages provide more full-time positions , but business culture expands well past wal-mart . i am teacher who cannot work more than 17 hours week so they not give me benefits , but i don't see anyone trying make movies ban schools .	-1
first episode near end ( good ep ! ) freezes up becomes pixelated , second episode not even begin . i just watched third episode it played fine , but i exchange this . i buy this preowned shop but i don't think problem ( discs spotless ) . i seen this variety freezing up it almost certainly due double sided discs . i say out two eps . i seen i am sad murphy gone . i like anti-chemistry them but i see also how one season enough it . we all knew there no way remington not going get girl anyway . i truly like doris roberts lot this show she seems perfect fit , plus she very good actress . watch part episode 3 when she telling rem she let him down wants quit ; if those aren't geniune tears ... i'm remington steele :) might i add ; there really really really needs soundtrack released this series . first episode acapulco amazing soundtrack themes stuff legend . anyone listening out there record land ?	-1

... which more than i say modern couple . if you expect see gwyneth paltrow take her clothes off , don't bother this movie . she plays frigid arrogant scholar , which not too much stretch her . my opinion , she not romantic damsel-in-distress material . she much more interesting when she plays cold cynical characters . jennifer ehle , other hand , shows quite bit skin . clandestine love scene two poets still stands before my eyes . i read book , so i could tell movie left too many loose ends untied . instance , it not clear movie why gwyneth paltrow character crying .	-1
this way comedy should done- warm , funny , hear t-t ouching , little craziness thrown . hector elizondo raquel welch perfect- he understated , she over top ... just like movie . story never bogs down , but zips right nicely . sisters bicker , their father worries , hortensia ( welch ) her best snag him , we laugh . great fun ! note rating parents like me who wonder pg13 rating ( one never tell these days ! ) : there one woman shown skimpy underclothing , one sex scene sexual references jokes , so this would not suitable kids	1
there few movies which warrant 5 star rating me . if i could give trainspotting 10 stars i would . me , movie stay you long after credits roll . it make you think feel . it subject you roller coaster ride emotions . trainspotting delivers goods . so many described movie what it , i am not going . suffice it say movie make you cry , piss-your-pants laugh , think , cheer wildly discuss it your friends years after you first saw it . i remember nagging feeling i needed take shower after seeing it . , my friends , sign great movie . great feature trainspotting soundtrack . it features many my favorites , iggy pop , lou reed , etc . soundtrack perfect this movie . everytime i hear lust life iggy pop now , i automatically think trainspotting . sign great movie . if only it would get criterion release ...	1
bob roberts relevant today it some fourteen years ago . converting ideological outsiders not seem its primary goal . it echo chamber entertainment meant only already committed leftist . needless point out , this not exactly surprising . tim robbins , after all , who starred , directed , even sang film one hollywood best know radical personalities . blunt , he less talented oliver stone . script turns conservatives into cartoon characters . there no attempt whatsoever try understanding their world view . they simplistically portrayed fascists seeking any excuse justify taking over country . bob roberts ( tim robbins ) republican u.s. senatorial candidate hoping defeat incumbent pennsylvanian democrat brickley paiste ( gore vidal ) . he vile not above using dirty tricks achieve his aims . story unfolds , roberts well behind polls . leftist journalist portrayed giancarlo esposito tries further derail roberts ' campaign revealing his drug running other criminal activities . he successful ? journalist representing small left-wing publication take down rich powerful ? you not glued your seat due suspense , but story line isn't complete bore . if nothing else , you see countless well known motion picture stars come go throughout story . you ever wonder why far-left became unglued over iraqi liberation 2003 ? well , bob roberts should help enlighten you . it makes numerous references desert storm , our first invasion iraq 1991 . conflict allegedly conspiracy concocted devious right-wing " national security council . " this group really runs country , not our elected leaders . republican administration george bush 41 only wanted dominate region . our greedy military-industrial complex satisfied , would not take no answer . saddam hussein not adolph hitler --- but minor league dictator . senator brickley paiste dismisses him merely member " villain month club .

this wonderful film which gets 10 my rating scale . one marks enduring film me characters continue life -- they still live -- after film ended . i like many movies , but very few created such way impart self-contained life people within movie . pelle conquerer such movie . films john cassavetes also create characters which continue live -- gena rowland character " woman under influence " or man trying revive his lover who taken overdose " faces " . these characters aging father played marvelously max von sydow his son , pelle , live !! i felt i absolutely there after my visitation -- they all continuing their lives	1
when this came out i really not know what it so i ignored it watched other movies . one day i rental store i looking around i seen it shelf so i took chance got it finally after all these years . this movie suprised me because i not think it would good because young writers matt damon ben affleck new not any experience all . story good it worked some how . i recommend people who not seen take look it those who seen good you . i bought movie after i rented it but i recommend people rent then make decision	1
roger ebert called this film one most powerful movies he'd ever seen . yeah , i guess it . this movie , directed hughes brothers(from hell , dead presidents ) portrays life hood no other movie before . it powerful , unapologetic , presents us characters we should no sympathy whatsoever . oddly enough though , we . movie begins caine ( tyrin turner ) o-dog ( larenz tate ) walking into liquor store buy some beer . store owned korean who follow them around mysteriously . caine o-dog go their business until they're walk out o-dog shoots kills both korean takes tape them doing it . scene shows us violence unflinchingly . we then see caine back story . his father ( samuel . jackson ) died drug deal his mother died heroin overdose . he lived his religious grandparents since then , most part , raised pernell ( glenn plummer ) who now serving life prison . caine , meanwhile , helps take care pernell girlfriend ronnie ( jada pinkett ) his young son anthony , who reminds caine himself young age . rest movie events happen lives caine his homieso-dog , doc , wax , sharif , stacy , lew-loc , chauncy . drug deals , drive-by , rim stealing , car jacking , cold blooded murder , you name it . none it off limits . through all this , however , you like characters . o-dog , no matter how violent sadistic he gets still great sympathetic character . tate performance so good , i'm surprised he didn't get best supporting actor oscar nomination . tyrin turner , who i've never seen movie , amazing caine ; playing both violent street thug sensitive guy perfectly . pre-will smith , jada pinkett also great ronnieand should gotten oscar nomination best supporting actress . this important movie needs seen lot people , since it confronts lot social issues simalar way movies like american history , boyz hood , even scarface before . hughes brothers crafted masterwork , powerfully entertaining movie . grade : a+	1
this film bit over analyzed . when i first saw film , i really didn't care analytical makeup film , but more intrigued story very troubled teenager : donnie ( jake gyllenhaal ) . very original script , great acting , film bit difficult label genre . so i won't label it . donnie living his own reality this film , although i not seen director cut , nor i wish , original very good it . when donnie begins seeing six-foo t-t all rabbit , you know there problem . help his psychiatrist , medications , family trying help him , donnie still out reach . donnie fascination time-travel also very good concept film ; because viewer , you're not sure if this his reality , or if his reality manipulated . me , i saw donnie young boy who troubled . much film leaves you wondering , i like films sometimes . not all time , but it works this film . this very good film . highly recommended viewers . look number reviews however , it appears quite few people liked film . [ well some who not ] . i don't claim expert knowing all hidden meanings film , [ nor one needed ] however , one who like good films , recognize very good film , this film definetly classic one . part patrick swayze particular , so-called self-help guru , very good . donnie even his state mind able recognize charlton manipulator . film comes you different directions , everyone see something different film , however , me , one part stands out very much six-foot-rabbit . i believe if i saw six-foot rabbit looked like donnie , i'd run like hell .	1
this one my all-time favorite movies . read book if you want backstory since screenplay starts half point . it entertaining that why we see movies first place , right ? matt damon just so darn likeable , you get drawn into his narration right off bat . screenplay very well . it coppola film , after all ... he work some talented people . it very nice see theresa wright this film , well .	1
this great film preceded onset " jlo . " " out sight " great showcase jennifer lopez talent actress . it shame she hasn't presented more great roles , like karen sisco , this film . karen d.a , who carries rifle jaded attitude . she chance encounter charming , compulsive bank robber jack foley ( george clooney ) . their encounter made especially intriguing because it takes place following his would-be kidnapping sisco her own car . it no surprise sparks fly ..... however , this doesn't downplay complexities their star-crossed encounter . some greatest strong points this film include juxtaposition flashbacks , incorporating trick camera work voice overs . what more , this film shot very bare bones style . we don't get sense romance , so much feeling stark reality . colors dark , dialogue characters honest , real simply wonderful . this film potential mass appeal , due fact , though it get gritty violent , doesn't downplay its intelligence or originality . violence counterbalanced genuinely funny scenes , well more introspective glimpses how characters turned out they . this definitely great date film !!	1
how he come up this crazy stuff . he tells one bizarre story after end they all tie up together . it makes no seinfeld all right . this great dvd -- enjoy	1
sixth sense unbreakable so much better than signs , i'm sorry say whatever . night shyamalan originally , he lost . when sixth sense came out , he tipped next big thing , but i'm sorry say , it no longer there . my mind , he cannot match any films up success sheer uniqueness sixth sense . signs just fails miserably . concept good idea , but execution terrible . it reminded me very much blair witch project , what little action there happens off screen , torches well . it also definitely not mel gibson best film . even actors appear struggle dialogue-heavy script , not really much happens . apart one brief glimpse alien . oooh . fascinating . problem i think signs , it already following many other , far superior , alien movies . aliens attacking earth , lots more memorable than this . there also overly religious theme , which film probably would better either toning down , or scrapping altogether . it really just thrown try justify what happening film . scenes gibson his kids his brother way too sentimental really cringeworthy . finale doesn't really make film better . discovery naked aliens find water like acid their skin atrocious ! why come earth , surface mostly covered water , atmosphere full water droplets vapour ?! then they travel millions light years far advanced technology - then can't break into wooden house ?! you kidding me ? but most ridiculous thing not only characters not pay attention dogs , who sensed something not right ( time get myself dog ) , but fact all sophisticated radar equipment cannot detect aliens entering our atmosphere - but baby monitor ?! huh ?! film stay well away . thankfully , i didn't spend my hard earned ( ha ! ) money it , but borrowed it friend . i shall approach . night shyamalan films trepidation now . oh , when director decides give himself speaking role his own film , make it short one	-1

there little say this movie , since i assume people interested buying this item already seen it already . but amount quality extras this dvd just breathtaking . say least , disc 2 imax version film , which time this writing not documented here amazon . imax version , well :) , shorter version film ( 1h55 ' versus 2h20 ' regular ) aspect ratio 1:66 . so if you unsure buy widescreen or fullscreen versions , i suggest buying wide , since you get ( sort ) full screen version imax one present disc 2 . then there this documentary " conquest space " which rather dull , " astronauts story " very short but interesting clip , excellent " making " juicy commentary jim lovell , pinpointing hits misses film compared real thing . $9.90 , how you not buy this jewel	1

live stage , trevor nunn production extroardinary , one best theatre performances i ever seen . video doesn't totally capture power ; it may wise , television director , de-emphasize stage set ( black magic circle outlined wood floor , surrounded wooden crates ) , such brilliant theatrical images invading thanes , surrounding macbeth circle , he slumps crate throne his ramshackle bunker ; but those features part what made stage version unforgettable . however , video preserve wonderful performances . i must dissent some reviews below : dench superb lady macbeth late bob peck understated macduff works beautifully ; both deliver their big scenes well any production you ever see . mckellen , this signature role his career . video also conveys low-key intensity furious pace this macbeth ; it rare opportunity see one great shakespearean productions century , preserved	-1

i saw john carpenter " fog " ( 1980 ) years ago kind bored it . catching it again recently , however , i impressed quite few things : -- film mood . carpenter successfully captured fitting spooky atmosphere his ghost story . ( plot involves horrific ghosts ship lepers returning enact revenge coastal community 100 years after people village guided them rocky death order swipe their chest gold ) . spooky mood nicely captured very first scene wherein john houseman shares ghost story hushed tones group kids campfire coast . -- spectacular locations . picture filmed beautiful point reyers/bodega bay region north san francisco . -- fabulous score . especially main piano piece runs during end credits . it actually blows away more popular main score carpenter " halloween . " -- good cast , which includes adrienne barbeau , jamie lee curtis , hal holbrook , nancy kyes janet leigh . unpredictable finish . i know this horror flick people supposed die , but it nice see people not die change . it refreshing ! bottom line : if you're looking fast-paced slasher gore-fest , you not like this film . if , however , you're mood something spooky , atmospheric aesthetically pleasing , " fog " likely trip your trigger	-1
alias : season 4 . wow . characters through heck first three seasons , much it caused man named arvin sloane , afterwards group called covenant . stroke genius , now best both sd-6 cia combined into apo , headed up ( guess who ? ) arvin sloane , guy everybody loves hate . usual cast jennifer garner , michael vartan , victor garber , ron rifkin , etc . accompanied absolutely adorable mia maestro , who plays sydney half-sister nadia santos . throw some nice guest stars like angela bassett , some derevko sisters ( yes , plural ) person or two who you probably thought dead , you've got great season , culminating ultimate family team-up take down terrible rambaldi device could trigger next apocalypse ! course ... chosen one must battle passenger . only one ... survive . unless you want either one next season , which case , they might live . but i'm not sayin ' if they both survive or not , ' cause that'd spoiler . big shocker very end season , wow . let just say not everyone who they claim . now i don't know what happens season 5 , except somebody gets clip or two unloaded ' em there probably double or clone or two somewhere there . ( i saw few moments series finale ... not knowing how great show it time . ) whatever case , while i admit there creepy episode or two there , season 4 comes strong well-deserved place amongst other three seasons , all which i enjoyed . trust me , you won't let down season 4 if you enjoyed other three . i highly recommend it	1

quite astounding when it first came out , your values may changed bit since you first saw this film way back when . definitely benchmark cinema , regardless your revisionist take fellini " values " . i couple technical issues dvd ( i bought it 2001 ): 1 ) lip-synch error pervades entire disc - dialog lags actors mouths consistent noticeable fraction second . 2 ) pivotal scene film , death hermaphrodite white hot desert canyon , intentionally over-exposed film appear almost completely washed out screen . dvd production house " corrected " this exposure , which now looks muddy lacks its original magic meaning . amazon replaced my first copy - same deal . too bad either fellini wasn't well enough oversee these types technical details , or else people designated this him couldn't bothered their job . or maybe it fixed now . caveat emptor	-1

2 fast 2 furious one those sequels comes around every so often doesn't require you seen original . i saw this movie first time not too long after it came out , never seen original , i thought i would lost wouldn't enjoy myself much other people , but contrary - i left experience much happier than when i came . this film full quick one-liners deserve laugh . special effects car races leave your mouth gaping open . i heard read people didn't appreciate this film much because it seemed focus more plot than first film rather than focus more races , but overall , i think balance works well . even thinking plot we left , i really can't see time when race would even appropriate . people saying this film worse than original , i would disagree ... why ? frankly , i always firm believer than vin diesel entirely overrated actor . ( i mean , c'mon - you seen pacifier ? ) he nothing more than meat head who , while able pretty good fight scenes , should leave dialogue someone else . yes , this film younger crowd , there numerous occasions when unbelievable events take place ( take boat jumping example ) , but there no saying older person wouldn't enjoy it well ... only thing i say you really shouldn't go into this film expecting oscar worthy performance , or else you disappointed . if you sit back take this fun romp it , however , you thoroughly enjoy yourself	1

if playwright tennessee williams southern gothic writing style makes his works feel more ornately melodramatic than those o'neill or his closest contemporary arthur miller , they provide resonant showcases actors inhabiting his characters . this clearly evidenced this six-film , eight-disc collection epitomizes some most powerful acting come out hollywood 1950 early 1960 , all directed true filmmaking masters . probably because they least censored studio system least form presented now , best set elia kazan " streetcar named desire " john huston " night iguana " . others kazan " baby doll " , richard brooks ' " cat hot tin roof " , jose quintero " roman spring mrs. stone " brooks ' " sweet bird youth " . feral , smoldering marlon brando justifiably made his reputation brutish stanley kowalski 1951 " streetcar named desire " , his animalistic charisma still leaps off screen . intriguingly , one extras included two-disc set movie footage 1947 screen test brando when he 23 , his stardom seems assured even then . plot movie amounts inevitable clash kowalski his visiting sister-in-law , blanche dubois , fading southern belle verge mental breakdown . proven her ability convincing southerner " gone wind " , vivien leigh expertly handles all florid dialogue her particular blend defiance vulnerability . strong supporting work comes kim hunter blanche naive sister stella karl malden blanche seemingly respectful suitor mitch . now over ninety , malden hand provide his own eloquent recollections production alternate track , film historians rudy behlmer jeff young provide more objective commentary track . film critic richard schickel 1995 feature-length look kazan centerpiece second disk , there also more interesting five-part documentary film original broadway show , best portion focusing censorship several minutes reinserted dvd version film . 1964 " night iguana " deals similarly dysfunctional group people , but this time setting dilapidated mexican beach resort where reverend shannon , newly defrocked , taken group spinsters women college . huston made his reputation his strong literary adaptations , his affinity shows fulsome characterizations , striking visuals dark humor . richard burton peak form shannon , there also sterling work deborah kerr spinsterish hannah especially ava gardner slatternly resort owner , maxine faulk . dvd contains recent making-of featurette vintage video , both fascinating .

i saw theatrical version vhs many years ago , it didn't really make sense . i thought maybe it because it david lynch film , it wasn't supposed ... then i remembered it based frank herbert incredibly complex sci-fi classic , decided 2 hour film couldn't coherent . then i taped tv 4 hour version ; editing commercials , it came 3 hours . there narration someone english accent ; i couldn't understand word . then , 20 years later , dvd , lynch extended version directed alan smithee ( ed wood anonymity ) . i watched extended version other day , it entertaining . one thing new dvd : side one lynch version , side 2 ( extended ) completely unlabeled . certainly , some action scenes intriguing . sets ( background artwork ) certainly visionary , wide 2.35 : 1 lbx very well presented . also , narration different person than tv version i'd taped those years ago . i understood every word . why mr. lynch took his name off film escapes me . i actually enjoyed lot film . there especially fine performances jose ferrer , max von sydow , sting , francesca annis , dean stockwell brad dourif . kyle maclachlan used his customary stiff acting approach good advantage , carrying lead role quite well . handsome guy ... aficianados pull this film apart without mercy , herbert fans probably same , but i watch films entertained i . it not great , not always coherent , but it great put during rainy saturday afternoon . purists , stay away ; film fans sci-fi freaks , enjoy !	-1

what amazing this production even though many story elements changed , strength each story preserved it essence . i read most this series over time come love character rebus . he truly ' real ' person , all foibles warts each us . he terrible interpersonal relationships , his best when he doing everything his power , not show emotion . though he not write screenplays , ian rankin very much involved making these teleplays ( see secion making rebus his comments ) , you see his deft touch minor changes made . siobhan clark supposed attractive , her late twenties , scots/english accent ; actress who plays her none these . brian holmes nowhere found , neither dr patience aikens . but actors who plays big ger cafferty ' weasel ' spot . hannah rebus able show great understanding character , who grey tough his home city . my only complaint he little young aging rebus who should his late forties . minor complaint . plethora scots accents ; it hard enough trying guess what some words mean , without trying figure out what people saying . but , i guess they wanted authenticity since it made scottish tv , didn't care what us yanks understood . ya think i get version subtitles	1

let me start saying first movie series absolutely fantastic . regardless fact it didn't stick few key plotlines book , everyone still great job adapting original jurassic park . then came this piece trash ... whereas first movie least attempted loosely base itself book , this one just takes brilliant writing michael chrichton throws it directly out window . first off , john hammond supposed dead . he dies end first novel . secondly ian malcome supposedly dead , or least mia end first book , we join him costarican hospital opening 2nd . there no bratty daughter , entire premise much more it . most importantly ... entire ending san diego t-rex ... which possibly worst conceived plot line history movies ... not exist book ! i went into this movie expecting tightly woven plot , huge concentration conspiracy such island exist , anticipation some good dino-scenes top it off . what i ended up getting writing equivalent monkey typewriter drooling page . not only ... but because lack plot , dino scenes complete over-kill . when you see so much it , you lose awe wonder first film . when you see brachiosaur first 20 mins original film , wonderment difficult rival . there no such moments this film . if you're looking quick fix decent looking dino fx , go nuts . however , if you're looking something more substantial actual plotline , flick off dvd player pick up book . oh one more thing ... don't go near 3rd movie . they didn't even book untrue . i can't imagine how much more long-winded rambling my review would one	-1

sorry give you bad news this dvd set , but ... i love kids hall , but found complete season one dissapointing . i remember some wonderful very humorus skits season one not included this set ... such crushing head man his friend misha who interupts play he putting . actors his play his fingers . he goes crush her head , she sticks her thumb front one eye says " there no body home " , so it appears her thumb covering his head ... but this skit isn't here . why ? lover head crusher , only head crushing episodes season one when he crushes business men heads runs into little boy suit asks him " what you want when you grow up ? " little boy responds " business man ! " -- he consquently gets his head crushed . funny , but not best or most memorable head crusher . i also disspointed buddy cole this dvd set . there some wonderful buddy cole segments first season not this set ( how one when he jail his tin cup shaped like champagne glass ? ) , same chicken lady ( blind date , attending wedding bearded lady , or phone sex line ) cabbage head ( i loved it when he invited himself join bunch women who trying dinner , he sits lawn chair sex book asks questions ) . i also loved skit where woman ( played one kids drag ) sits outdoor cafe , annoyed terrible waiter suffers further aggravation " dirty man standing behind fence " who trying bum cigarettes " his kids " her . or , how guy stubbed his toe doesn't want go doctor because he found colors his infected toe " interesting ! " not one these hillarious skits or episodes included season one dvd collection ... why ? god only knows who compiled collection sometimes boring comedy skits season one dvd collection , but i tell you one thing . there no way this complete collection entire season one episodes . it incomplete , say least . i just gave you many examples my favorites missing . it would great see them again them enjoy posterity . it kind humor endeared us all kids hall so much . skits included this collection probably not most popular or funny episodes . i would not recommend it . take it me ... save yourself twenty or thirty bucks . i not seen other dvd collections other kids hall seasons dvd yet . one only hope they more entertaining than season one ( or should i say , wasn't ) ... p.s. i would not even rated this dvd set one star , but it lowest rating you give item .	-1

problem this film i read book . i disappointed simply because `be cool ' obvious showcase musical talent . overly long dance sequence john travolta uma thurman prime example . somewhere bulk story lost -- there some very -- very good characters appearing film would've more intersing if somebody would've said , " hey , don't forget book ! " but true original source not hollywood strong suit . " cool " provides some popular music , some known faces , but without john travolta , movie would never made . few laughs provided . couple ironic scenes show up , but there too little sustain full-length feature . basically , project disservice everyone involved . some characters so thin -- face it -- poor christina milian linda moon , reduced voice sways when she sings -- clich� . rock best he but again , `he gay bodyguard;' he brunt insulting jokes offered up raji , his boss [ vince vaughn ] , who , book , far more sinister -- but film he idiot . course chili chili . travolta very nice job , chili obviously smartest guy room . uma thruman performance , well , not funny -- not serious , not intense -- not much -- best , she made me shrug . i like what harvey keitel nick carr , but there just not enough , all negatives reflect completely director . enough said there . my advice , watch `get shorty'again , or read `be cool . '	-1
4.5 stars this release , i am sorry they didn't actual orginal ending it seems say it packaging , bod form dvd producers . but i am not one those rabid duckie fanatics seem think even though andie duckie no chemistry they belonged together . obviously she loved him brother not potential love interest 180 least this film just wouldn't work ! if you want ending go see some kind wonderful ending two leads obvious chemistry story supports change ! people people people , entire film supposed fact labels folks put you wrong no matter what side tracks you live you still good person . but all i hear complaints how duckie didn't get girl . well folks i've never twenty years i adored this film thought he should am glad they not lucas changed film reflect . i would like seen scene however why this dvd gets 4.5 stars instead 5	-1

after i wrote this review , i read other reviews thought some much better than mine , much more expressive . specially mr. censored review , you sould read it . it posted december 2004 . important thing you read 3 or 4 reviews see nobody kidding you . this concert fantastic . ok now my unedited review : this greatest incubus dvd i've seen , greatest incubus thing i ever experienced . i've known incubus some time now i tell you its great concert , you really tell how professional band members . throughout concert you see extended versions songs , solos mike einziger jos pasillas . you experience incubus it , full energy power . you tell these guys good ' cause live versions identical recorded versions , but they special " live " feel . or should i say " alive " ? this must anyone who admires or likes incubus	1
i cannot believe how wonderful this collection . there six movies this set . all which i already my collection . however , quality 3 6 moview far surpasses anything i able find previously . " true confession " , " love before breakfast " " man world " all excellent picture sound . it my understanding there no surviving master prints " true confession " . so i congragulate person who found this high quality copy sitting somewhere back some studio vaul t.t he other three titles , " we're not dressing " , " hands across table " " princess comes across " dark prints comparison previous versions issued video cassette 1995 mca/universal , but otherwise highly watchable . sound quality these movies also excellent . this collection while you , price it steal . it well worth $100 or more	1
it hard know where begin this one . movie immaculately filmed one greatest directors all time , given just most perfect presentation i've ever seen dvd . i guess i'll start print : it magnificent , beautiful , golden colors , sharp focus , barely speck dust film . one would expect kurosawa film , composition feast eyes , beautiful formal balances coming most mundane elements shot . ( george lucas very influenced kurosawa many ways , but this sort beautiful , balanced composition one thing he never mastered . ) then there score . most people might not immediately think score when discussing kurosawa film , but i struck here how powerful distinctive it , while same time it never gets way film . then there sets : simple , yet used maximum effect . this not big budget film hollywood standards ( though it most expensive japanese film up time ) , but it feels far more epic than any recent , very expensive star wars " prequels , " which just goes show it takes more make epic than just money . kurosawa reportedly only used something like 200 horsemen , yet you'll think you're seeing far more . then there cast . tatsuya nakadai , lord ichimonji , manages perfectly portray man going man who both frightening his stubbornness sympathetic his pathos same time . not easy job , especially under ton makeup made him look far older than he . three sons , played akira terao , jinpachi nezu especially daisuke ryu ( insightful loyal saburo ) distinctive well-developed . androgynous peter ( first name billed only ) kyoami memorable his flamboyant , almost drag-queen gyrations taunting aging , increasingly senile warlord insights into his predicament . yet standout performance , one i always remember , stunning mieko harada lady kaede . while ran supposedly loose retelling king lear , kaede more lady macbeth than anything else . she two very memorable scenes both involve severed heads . while screenplay riffs lear , it also makes some notable changes . three daughters replaced three sons . this " lear " goes mad not because daughter love but because , apparently , weight wars fought past . young lord very odds image we see beginning film , man wishing make peace his demons . we discover through backstory he killed , kidnapped waged much violence bring together his kingdom , yet now he just wants peace goodwill . i thinking adage what goes around comes around , wondered if hidetora himself ever came this realization . it what he thinking he emerged burning castle after tremendous battle , dazed , wordless ? scene , shot without ambient sound but haunting score ( composed toru takemitsu ) , must go down one greatest moments film , example how cinema used way no other art form . bonus features both bountiful meaningful . first there full-length commentary film scholar stephen prince , though i confess i've not yet listened it . director sidney lumet gives brief appreciation kurosawa ran . he likens film late beethoven quartets or seventh symphony . such comparisons often come off glib or meaningless , but this actually struck chord me . i indeed think comparison ran energies seventh apt , introspection reminds me late quartets , particularly op . 132 . second disc , we a.k. , 75 minute documentary kurosawa life . ( case you've seen recent pbs documentary kurosawa , this one different . ) then comes half hour film making ran , which shows what grueling shoot it must , going every day base mount fuji often working there even night . finally there 35-minute video piece exploring costumes ran , well new video interview tatsuya nakadai ( lord hidetora ) . there also color booklet interviews kurosawa composer takemitsu . short , there enough supplementary materials here keep any fan movie or director happy weeks . many criterion releases defined what dvds , but this title just takes cake . what more could one ask , short summoning kurosawa beyond talk film ? even if you own ran one its other video versions , they all vastly inferior this release . if you've never seen film , or any work akira kurosawa , this probably best place you could start . highly highly recommended	1
this great story which wrapped entertaining sub-story well acted all . this julia best work my opinion . albert finney always favorite his role here absolutely charming . i would highly recommend this film	-1
" i'm just country lawyer " begins james steward he tries fend off very young george scott new da they try unlikeable ben gazarra murder . so why james steward , old da , take case like this ? that question i'm stuck . way , i love how otto preminger directs movie . love how he changes point-of-view how he engages us courtroom battle . brilliant staging , great performances ... all typical preminger . i believe guy raped lee remick ? yes i . i believe lee remick likes lead men hungers attention men ? absolutely ! i believe ben gazarra his " right mind " when he murdered guy ? i don't know ... anyone their " right mind " when they committ murder ? but i love this movie . ps where widescreen version	1
it indeed very nice able watch this fantastic series best quality format . however , i must agree other reviewers here who commented fact first season badly hacked . some you who may read this , but not understand what we mean , here poop . september 16 , 1970 nbc unveiled new series called " four one . " it comprised four mini-series : 1 . mccloud 2 . san francisco international airport 3 . night gallery 4 . psychiatrist each mini-series ran period six consecutive weeks . then they rerun rotation basis . they aired wednesday nights 10:00 - 11:00 . " mccloud " went " mystery movie " series , " san francisco international airport " left air " four one " series " psychiatrist . " " night gallery " spun off into it own series . disc one , " four one " episodes appear 90 minute form , combining two 60 minute episodes . what bummer ! it would really great see original " four one " opening . i seem remember square black background , they something square , moving it around or it morph into other things or something , it really hard remember because it so long ago i all 7 years old time . but , i seem remember it stopped 4 box , making it look my young mind like child block . same " mystery movie " opening . remember guy ( looked like mccloud me ) walking slowly toward camera flashlight , shining it side side shots each element series would flash up ? all while really neat whistling theme played . tv still some pretty neat things time . still , i'm glad this set . but , it would really nice original openings more importantly , first season its unaltered form .	-1
singles came out early 90 , time me , all grunge scene . i high school then so this norm us all . but i got older , i never outgrew singles . fact , i think i began relate it even more i gained more life experience . anyway , here wonderful comedy offers us all glimmer hope this overpopulated world . we meet group friends who various tennants same apartment building seattle . singles centers around cliff ( dillon ) struggling musician , his girlfriend janet ( fonda ) who put cliff needs before her own last time , linda ( sedgwick ) who thinks she found " one " until she discovers him bar girl when he told her he going back spain , steve ( scott ) who spent his dating career playing field , debbie ( kelley ) who searches mr. right via video dating service ( oh-so hilarious ) . main story linda steve meeting relationship blossoms it . if you big fan grunge when it popular you'll fall love singles ( bands like soundgarden , mother love bone , even alice chains featured ) . many funny moments abound ( this shouldn't spoil anything you should you 1 person left wyoming or something who hasn't seen this movie ) including run-in pessimistic mime ( played eric stoltz ) , debbie dating video steve story learning sex child , but that all i say without giving it all away . price this low , singles steal it something you watch again again again .	1

so long , i avoided working out because some really negative feelings i've attached process . i still vivid pictures my mind getting dressed dowdy gym clothes , fighting traffic , waiting use machines i wasn't really sure how use first place ! there times when i take two hours out my day just exercise less than half time . i think my gym experience might better i hired personal trainer , but let face it -- not all us money this , especially broke students like me . i little more luck treadmill some tae-bo , but found intense cardio didn't particularly agree my joints or my downstairs neighbors . ;) then , sometime few years later , i found bar method . i initially very skeptical low-impact workout because i always thought more dog-tired hyperventilated i felt after workout , better it me . ultimately , i really just setting myself up failure because every workout turned out most stressful part my day ! not so bar method . yes , exercises very , very tough killer muscles , but you aren't huffing puffing feeling sick way i always more " traditional " cardio workouts . best part i know i'm working just hard i ever burning just much fat . bar method exactly what it promises : consistent , 3-times-a-week schedule , even lazy girls like me slim their hips , flatten their abdominals , tighten their arms , define their legs . greatest surprises i just how well exercises worked my hips ( very problem area me ) my arms ( which became tight , but not all bulky . ) i designer sculpting more than fat free , but i find both workouts well-paced enjoyable . burr leonard her assistants rather likeable provide very specific directions each exercise ( good thing beginner-level students ) . so why four stars , not five ? i find music dvds little dull side . i try remedy problem listening my ipod , but found i just didn't get much workouts without burr explanations encouragements . also , i find abdominals sections both dvds leaves something little lacking me . yes , my abs get flatter , but i still didn't feel like i really " worked " them -- fact , they barely felt sore next day , unlike rest me , which positively killed . these days , i find myself doing abs section shape magazine " bikini body all year long " morning , then doing bar method sections arms , seat , thighs later day . this useful me , but might very disruptive someone who likes their workout one full chunk . i'm using other dvds now , too , but somebody who needs little bit kickstart get back into working out , bar method great way fun get fit	-1

this stirring film . robert de niro christopher walken both outstanding - this movie would not half entertaining without them . beginning , you get sense lives these young men . they free fun-loving - yet everything change them . they proud serve their country , but they exposed side life no one should ever see . scenes set vietnam during war truly intense shocking . after horrors these men witness , you not surprised see them become disenchanted distant . how you return functioning society after immersed war death most horrific kind ? it seems , tragically , most simpy can't readjust ... who hell blame them ? this movie doesn't tackle war whole . instead , it shows you very concentrated story involving only few men . you see their experiences vietnam eventual playing out their individual fates . it very disturbing see nick ( walken ) alive after all time when michael ( de niro ) returns saigon finally finds him . he shell his former self , lifeless eyes empty soul - thanks solely war . again , without christopher walken robert de niro , this movie wouldn't half good . their performances excellent	-1

" medium " instantly became my favorite show television 2005 . i usually am fascinated shows elements paranormal , which tuned me . however , it realism family relationship most fascinating . patricia arquette who " ed wood " johnny depp plays alison dubois . her emmy win best actress drama attests her standing within industry , but on-screen chemistry jake weber who " meet joe black " plays her husband joe riveting . they fight , spat , try mask conflict front their kids , juggle impossible number real-life tasks , layers humor romance make this seem like real family loves each other deals unusual circumstances alison psychic ability . i found after watching initial show when reruns would show , i still wanted watch them over episodes csi miami i not seen . when i bought dvd , i hoping there might episode i'd missed , but i'd seen them all nbc lifetime reruns several times . i'm impressed how entrancing each episode quality writing . alison dreams like clues she struggles fit together . what impresses me alison she sincerely struggles right thing . world violence , it often hard clear which way moral compass points . episode " sickness adultery " her tip places her witness stand unethical hostile prosecutor seeks embarrass her . she comes back he cheated pass his law exams cheating his wife , she finds her best defense truth . two older daughters also jewels . maria lark bridget often my entire family stitches her offbeat humor like shouting her mom who wakes screaming bad dream , " mom , please stop doing ! " sofia vassilieva older aerial keeps arguments breakfast table bouncing . david cubitt who plays reoccurring role detective lee scanlon also achieves amazing chemistry arquette . miguel sandoval district attorney manuel duvalos such focused calmness he centers crime portion show . ( perhaps we sometime see more his family . ) while it hard pick my favorite first season episode , complex plot " priest , doctor medium walk into execution chamber " jewel , police chasing ghost who apparently just committed murder . dvd commentaries introduction real-life alison dubois really give excellent background fans show . this one show reaches level art me . its excellence make it memorable long time this dvd collection valuable addition entertainment collection . bravo	1

many ways , ridley scott films remind me brian de palma's: many people consider him filmmaking icon , notable director among many many other ones making good or bad films . sure de palma his scarface his untouchables but don't forget he also forgettable snake eyes mission mars . ridley scott meanwhile alien gladiator(overrated personally ) but he white squall 1692 but chalk blade runner up his more memorable films its probably one better made sci-fi films 80 . it 2017 mankind developed replicants , humanoids who look very similar humans used degrading work . after they decide revolt , humans start making specialists - blade runners - " retire " replicants , other words , kill . they bring deckard , retired blade runner , track down replicants who recently escaped all while falling love one . lot futuristic films seem very ambitious where technology reaches point where anything possible . interstellar travel , flying cars , sophisticated id systems holographs very present these kind films but oddly , blade runner doesn't much . while it some scenes involving flying cars going over neon-lit cities woman face building , when we're ground level technology isn't apparent . it helps film feel real plausible without looking too ambitious its own good . it interesting note although film considered sci-fi film , it kind light action scenes . it not big deal but when you look main cover art , deckard gun hand , but people thinking this going slam-bang action film ridley scott might disappointed . i surely expecting it but seeing film , good it , i like " wow , not lot fast parts " . then again , alien deliberate pacing so i guess it expected . those you wondering , this isn't super deluxe edition where we different versions film(that 2007 ) , so this one we only get remastered version film better transfer . so if you want replace your crappy original director cut version horrible main menu crappy transfer , go ahead but if you want more bang your 30 40$ whatever it come up , wait till 2007	1
if you relatively good or even average shape looking really tone up sculpt your body , this isn't workout you . it didn't get my heart rate up i didn't break sweat . instructor spent too much time exercises explain what next , too much down time . i actually got bored . sculpting stick not needed , ' fanny lifer ' used just sit much time when exercises could modified standing or kneeling . i am extremely disappointed . i wasn't sore or challenged . this might good workout someone who extremely overweight needs go slower pace , but anyone looking drop 5-20 lbs or firm up this isn't you !	-1
i like this new mature van damme . first hell now wake death they're best films his career he actually starting show some genuine acting talent . i hope this trend continues . wife/family murdered son kidnapped van damme ( or v.d. i like call him ) out revenge . he shoots up bunch stuff , runs drill through guy kneecaps , wrecks some cars , cries few times , drives motorcycle through mall , hugs some people , electrocutes cop shoots triad who tied up point blank face shotgun . honestly i liked this movie quite bit , ending little anti-climatic , but cinematography cool . i'd watch it again which more than i could say double team .	-1

clueless thoroughly delightful film , this edition improves it excellent bonus features - all good , but fashion 101 not missed . despite its glossy veneer - world populated attractive , narcissistic , privileged kids - clueless smart , droll , endearing look inside youth culture . because it touches universal themes , fully operational when jane austen wrote emma , film withstands test time despite language ( if ) fashion trends ( droopy drawers skaters ) , fads , average life span drosophila . many viewers approach clueless certain amount hostility . cher , protagonist , played perfection alicia silverstone , impossibly beautiful . worse still , her father , gruff but charmingly protective dan hedaya , beyond rich . even worse , cher seems live entirely surface things , expressing her creativity through social meddling wardrobe . ( outfits worn cher , her friend dionne , others their inner circle reason enough watch film . ) how could we ever like such wretched , spoiled kids ? because , clueless beautifully executed , gentle satire , not broad farce or biting indictment . writer/director amy heckerling , ( who also fast times ridgemont high - lesser endeavor ) , understands loves her characters , they not stereotypes . we like these kids because they joke , they know they're hothouse orchids . blatant examples include murray , played donald faison ( now scrubs ) black uber-yuppie who learns his street patois mtv , jeremy sisto elton who apparently hobbled his identity together rat pack press photos . stage beautifully set , comedy manners begins , cher manipulates people order serve her idea greater social good learns few lessons way . no one shot . no helicopters appear . inept driving featured , but there no car chases . wonder wonders , especially teen movie , there no gratuitous sex . amy heckerling saluted creating film relies story , dialogue , detail , character , acting work . her success complete . clueless uses socal youth culture its milieu , not its point . really pleasure worth owning	1
awesome movies , but way too expensive product itself . first , i bought it reduced priced , since it left sitting shelve collecting dust few years store . they dropped price initial $200 ( around $150 u . . ) , $149 ( around $110 u . . ) , cheapest price i could find it my city far . few stores told me their cost around $149 , so it able buy it around cost . considering , it bargain , so i got lucky start . now movies , they awesome , after watching them all two days , i felt sad , sad hollywood current level movie making , after tasting piece history , movies deep , funny , either deals issues ( seven samurai hidden fortress ) or don't ( yojimbo sanjuro ) , they all movie gems . but we also realistic here , seven samurai my opinion real champion this set , it everything , it epic , yet personal , it deep , yet sometime funny , but always powerful superb . now quality disk , where it hard tell , these old movies . but something struck me odd , seven samurai ( 7s ) , around 10 yrs before yojimbo sanjuro but looks sound better , obviously , they cleaned it out little before putting it dvd , but then , if yojimbo sanjuro where made 10 yrs later , someone should expect least equal quality , if not better then 7s , but it not case , especially yojimbo painful watch , sound track loud background hiss least half movie , scratches big straw last full min multiple times , contrast brightness out wack half scenes , it painful experience , you tell yourself how great movie , but it ever ugly watch . so far i would give it 4 stars , why then i give it 2 ? it down price vs quality extras . no extras what so ever beside theater trailer each movie , commentary track 7s , then nothing . so criterion my mind two choice , drop price 1/3 1/2 what it now , or pick better original copy bring dvd , clean it , add extras , selling it same price it now , but they neither . they used yojimbo , terribly copy , add nothing , charge full criterion price , bad !!! so end , one fell like robbed ronins . my case , i wanted see those movies , own 7s this box set only way go doing this , end , i praise movie , acting , story , camera work , everything , except criterion dvd who brought those movies it north america , they dropped ball this one . so 0 stars criterion there dvd product ( this case ) 4 stars movie themselves so my end review 2 stars	-1
my daughters ( 14 10 time this review ) i make habit " gilmore-ing " ( ) regular basis . we buy snacks , watch most season day , talk show all way through . we relate characters personal level , yet without charm stars hollow nestle into end day unfortunately . thing , gilmore girls smart show . it throws out references so fast watching it feels energizing rather than draining . fashion year or two ahead usually , which fun . plus ,. this age clearchannel radio , it great hear lesser-known bands featured regular basis . we definitely huge fans gilmore girls , but would i enjoy it much if i not daughters ? i'm not sure . i enjoy show doesn't wrap things up neatly most time , show doesn't develop around characters who fit into " acceptable role model " slot . these characters good people who screw up they living their daily lives . they keep going , keep connecting world around them , keep loving each other . it one those shows certain parents wouldn't trust their kids able interpret . watching show single mother who makes something herself spite teenage pregnancy isn't going say " this good idea . " what it says life messy , thing keep moving ahead much grace vision possible .	1
this one those movies they felt dressed up bit order dumb movie audience give it chance . or so this how they film studios see it anyway . this certainly message movie , its not so sutble message anti-thatcherism hits you head like brick ! americans ignorant britain today might hard time following it . however , if one disregards rather dated politics here , theme movie seen universal one long-time workers now frequently victims changing economics . more than anything else this movie music brass bands . opening march . . hall " death or glory " says it all ! players this band their fight mine death or glory proposition . incidently hall little known new england composer marches , its interesting his music should make it back acorss pond english brass bands . my personal tastes runs military bands which instrumentation richer more varied . brass bands don't any woodwinds ! softer tone they produce more mellow sound , compared richer , stirring military band . its nice see working class mines england produced these high quality bands . no comparison fond here states mine workers . you would sooner find most us blue collar workers topless bars after their shift rather than going band practice ! so these bands part england cultural scene , popular band music they played often bridge common man classical concert hall out-door band concert . their loss would certainly sad . band portrayed here film actual famous brass band , it would interesting know if it really disbanded because yorkshire mine closings . actors fine job . pete postlewaite wonderful . anything he seems golden . tara fitsgerald very appealing seductive . shes also wonderful see almost anything . plot its usual twists turns keeps interest . human dramas behind music what most compelling this film . movie should made many fine regimental bands disbanded british army recent years . like civilian band portrayed here , many these bands histories went back centuries , their loss regiments which them keen . many fine musicians them also forced into redundancy or seek non-musical employment army . certainly what blair here every bit bad what thatcher mines . destruction these many fine military bands loss communities well morale their regiments . loss any band cultural loss , whether civilian or military . young listeners today increasingly no exposure music other than dreadful pop , loss such bands truly dire situation . these musical entities their free open air concerts vital link people hear different kinds music . i can't imagine what music tastes people future . sure it won't good . this deffinitely fine movie , good plot , strong acting , some wonderful brass music . if viewers become inspired listen this kind music result this film then all should not vain . strongly recommeded despite silly box cover	1

this review contains spoilers . i wasn't aware this movie when it released heard it only recently because i got know like work actress lindsay crouse " buffy vampire slayer " " hack . " movie got high marks imdb crowd amazon.com, but i've burned way many times so expected disappointed " house games , " too . i pleasantly surprised find movie far above average . i'd put it top 10 percent all movies i've seen . i'm so glad david mamet decided make this movie his wife lead his friend joe montegna playing mike . both actors perfectly cas t.t hat said , i three minor quibbles movie . ( spoilers coming . ) first , it seemed obvious me lindsay character conned when briefcase containing $ 80,000 went missing lindsay offered reimburse con men . concomitantly , it didn't make sense lindsay character wouldn't catch point she conned . later movie , lindsay visits bar where con men hang out . she enters late night through back door , which all too conveniently unlocked . lastly , when lindsay joe their final confrontation they baggage handling area large airport . no one else around . not even close enough , apparently , hear six gunshots . but these small complaints compared overall quality movie . " house games " gem	-1
wondefull !!!!!!!!!!!! if you love tap dancing , love stories , past present tap dancers this movie you . although dancing takes place , this not " musical " or something " broadway " . this movie storyline highly recommended !	1
yes . wild things what i recommend our jaded eyes . aren't we sick all crowd pleasing pg-13 shows which neither sexy or action packed - most all hardly plot ? wild things sex sex sex but witty capital humor twisted story . recent eye candy shows could learn thing or two this film . candy remain sweet sickening but great script good cast ( oscar nominee matt dillon , kevin bacon etc ) turn candy into cuisine	-1
well i must say i really enjoyed this movie , i saw it awhile back tv i said next time it hit dvd i buy it . i like all roles women played . each person character or situation i relate little . we all tried give man ours chance or try there him , but it turns out they not appreciate us all . they took our niceness weakness but sooner or later its time pay back .. lol not abuse or burning down house but get them back away they not even see it coming . this movies funny , sad , joyful . i reccommend everyone see this dv	1
plot : there string unsolved murders harrison penitentiary . detective louis burke ( jean-claude van damme ) sent undercover inmate investigate . help his assigned " wife " ( charatcer amanda beckett , played cynthia gibb ) , he manages uncover few dirty secrets place . once he truly gets into heat situation , he discovers guards prison officials themselves might even involved . whole scheme starting make sense , doesn't stay good thing long . his presence prison becoming too much danger conspirors , he becomes next hitlist . but burke isn't going down easy . least that what we think , until old enemy -- christian " sandman " naylor ( patrick kilpatrick ) -- transferred prison finish him off good . fight solve murder mystery over , yet fight burkes life only beginning . death warrant action flick . period . although story interesting follow , true reason anyone would watch this would down'n'dirty mayhem van damme his usual kick-butt mode . prison conspiracy not huge government cover up , but rather small ring corruption hidden higher officials . so instead thriller bunch different suspicious characters involved , we've got van damme stuck all alone deadly prison without prayer ! that where action comes . this isn't kind " blow stuff up " or " shoot em down " popcorn movie , this hand-to-hand combat girtty intensity . best example would grand finale : final fight sandman burke ( definitely my favorite part ) . that where anything goes , barbaric brawling death only way out . note , i particularly fond patrick kilpatrick sandman . he often seen villain-type roles , but this just hits nail head . only slight complaint i ( reason it only hits four stars ) sandman doesn't enough screen time . i don't want spoil storyline , but you assume because his late arrival film , he not mystery murderer . he more like executioner sent burke . parts he get last half film -- well first scene which we see encounter naylor burke when naylor free man -- satisfying , but let face it , he one hell villain he needed more show . regardless , death warrant just what you need if you like simple yet engaging fight flick . although only special feature theatrical trailer , only reason you need purchase this dvd film itself . it quite impressive , leaves you some fond memories both van damme kilpatrick . pick it up !	-1

this rare tv concert great collector piece . video quality good best , although " advertising hype " insists it beautiful . it film transfer cleaned beautifully [ de-speckled ] , but expense crispness . i find some additional " bonus " material boring . still it definite " keeper . " extra footage deleted section [ mein herr ] treat watch apparently not " cleaned , " maybe purpose , so we see what original aging film looked like before restoration , which i heard took on-and-off ... six years complete . ae segment puts me sleep , glaad awards stuff so-so , but liza john kander chatting piece interesting . cd , " liza , " accompanies dvd this edition . i not listened it yet but when i ... it nice hear it without all those ticks pops [ my vinyl record 30 years ago ]	-1

" fort apache " , henry fonda , new commander , fort apache , arrogant indian hating , irish-catholic disliking , wasp who seeks glory himself , no matter what cost maybe ! great perfomances fonda , wayne , george o'brien , ward bond , anna lee , irene rich , victor mclaglen , dick foran(who sings very well too ) , grant withers(as corrupt suttler ) , guy kibbe , pedro armendariz , very sympathetic " cochise " miguel inclan ! shirley temple john agar provide love interest . great movie ! great western !! america greatest director !!	1
if you considering buying this film , may i recommend you save tons money buying it bible collection box set , which contains 6 these bible movies , abraham , jacob , joseph , moses , samson delilah , david ! production values very high all six films , you pay half off cost buying each one separately ! david one best dvds this series bible movies , made mid 1990s . it covers most big scenes his life , it very well cast acted all . first hour shows young david anointed , then persecuted years under jealous king saul . second hour covers david his peak , king israel . third hour shows david sin punishment over his adultery bathsheba , god punishment using his rebellious son absalom . this all very gripping enjoyable drama , especially any bible students who enjoy seeing so many bible scenes not often portrayed other films . they cover lot scripture , without unlimited budget , so sometimes they alter some details stories . instance , famous david versus goliath battle not take place front philistine israeli armies , scripture , but rather isolation . it budgetary rewrite , but dramatic impact tension still present . filmmakers ' intentions honorable , though their budget may not ambitious enough portray some larger , more expensive scenes out scripture . if they cut some corners due budget , they more than make up it quantity quality scriptural scenes they show . one best sections dvd david adulterous relationship bathsheba , then his scheming against uriah , her husband . scenes absalom trying overthrow his father very well made , very scriptural , well . actor playing adult david brilliant performance , portraying many decades life david . leonard nimoy ( mr. spock star trek fame ) good samuel , ( though richard gere film king david definitive , ultimate onscreen chemistry samuel king saul ) . actors king saul bathsheba both very good this dvd version david . you also find three other great movies this series movies . look bible series box set featuring esther , jeremiah solomon , too . these also your best buy box set , rather than separately ! these 9 bible movies , three 90 minutes long , jacob . esther , jeremiah . other 6 around 3 hours long . i think longer ones originally aired tv mini series , over multiple nights . all these films , my one criticism might they bit weak showing some supernatural events scripture . this seems due expense special effectts , perhaps , my guess . but most part , all 9 dvds great very good actors portraying tension drama these classic bible stories , they consistently good faithful gist spirit bible stories they tell . i think these 9 dvds best series bible dvds available anywhere ! there better , single movies dvd , but group , whole , there not bigger , better dvd set available anywhere , i know . these box sets perfect basis any personal or church library bible movies . they virtually all so close scripture you forced compare films actual bible hand , verify whether or not scene accurate scripture or not . very good bible learning exercise , it shows high value quality owning these dvds . all 9 these bible dvds worth buying owning any christian personal dvd library , most frugally purchased via two different box sets ! highly recommended	1

original batman animated series remains best representation caped crusader film . viewers familiar current ' batman ' series - pale imitation - who not aware earlier better effort missing one great entertainment experiences - not only kids , but adults like myself , who grew up comic book . it shame word warner bros . thinking cancelling their other stellar achievement , justice league unlimited series , they taken such long time produce box set its earlier manifestaion , glorious justice league . one hopes if enough dedicated viewers make noise , something might this . providing hours intelligent fun , watching these shows my children irreplacable bonding experience	1

fuss over forrest gump still amazes me . this movie basically rips off better movies almost every scene . still somehow it managed win best picture over pulp fiction shawshank redemption 1994 . out all movies released 1n 94 this one wouldnt even make my top 20 . nobodys fool , quiz show , lion king , list goes . only reason i would give it props for(at time ) special effects , which now dated . after gump zemekis directed episode tales crypt where he used same technology easiest worst episode year . i used huge zemekis fan . used cars , romancing stone , back furture movies death becomes her i thought strong movies . but arounf back future 2 i thought zemekis started rely much special effects it shows this film . objective viewer re-watch this film think every scene try remember where you seen scene before . i guarantee you after you you see this movie totally different light	-1

not following recent broadway scene very much , i wasn't really aware what sensation " rent " several years ago when it debuted . i became more aware it when it satirized southpark picture " team america " after my church intergenerational choir sang show " theme " song " seasons love " . then one kids i worked local musical said rent one his favorites , so i first-weekend attendee theatre . story important it depicts gays , lesbians , drag queens drug addicts real people struggling life , love ( aids ) just like so-called " normal " people . rock style , songs aren't necessarily " toe-tappers " you end up whistling way out theatre ( though " seasons love " comes close , particularly if you've sang it least two dozen times , " la vie boheme " showstopper -- plot supposedly based opera name ) , but overall music very exciting integral story . cast moved almost en masse broadway hollywood -- wilson heredia , tony winner drag queen angel , should contended oscar supporting actor . i've read there some concern mainstream hollywood director chris columbus ( home alone , harry potter i ii ) getting job , but i don't see picture suffered it -- maybe some unconvincing special effects worst it . rock opera , it takes some time get used almost all dialogue sung rather than spoken . overall solid four star film ---- definitely recommended fans modern musicals , those marginalized communities , those art their soul s.p.s. afterwards i got hooked soundtrack cd few weeks ( months ? ) but that review	-1

" shaun " supposed comedic ' spoof ' ' homage ' " zombie movie " . it accomplished more . while comedy wryly british , it still funny - social comment universal civilized society ( cased you missed it - we're all zombies already ) . just fun movie , start finish - warned there gratuitous ' gore ' scenes necessary it zombie film , but they few , fast over . there lot ' quick-wit ' humor - newscaster comments end , " i never thought i'd say ... " example . strip away humor homage , there actually much tighter plot than many movies . there not many loose threads - " how zombie get ? " - go back three scenes oh , ed habitually leaves front door open ... impressed attention those kind details . it billed " romantic comedy zombies " - it delivers .	-1

everyone thinks this movie anthony hopkins living out some demented " gorillas mist " nightmare . simply catalyst teaching us something how we relate world around us . everything this movie control , desire control those who not like us , desire guards control population , desire gooding character contol hopkins . but , what hopkins teach us we not control , but we simply hold onto our illusions control . when our illusions threatened we become angry frightened because we afraid reality . ever wonder why we so disturbed home invasion ? it because someone came , or because we built up illusion we safe , now illusion gone ? this movie look past gorillas corny guards predictable plot , look deeper into what characters reveal ourselves . truly , then this very frightening movie	1
house perfect marriage great character brilliant actor -i can't imagine anyone else role but hugh laurie , he nothing short spectacular . he not only play comedy , but drama , while speaking accent that vastly different his own , while reciting complex medical terminology , while walking limp , cane . they should just hand him best actor emmy every year , because no one else even come close what this man brings every episode . i late party , not finding house until middle season two , but i more than made up it . i never bought any television series dvd before this . i both seasons dvd watched episodes over over again . i watch least one episode every day or i start withdrawal symptoms . great storylines superb cast make this must see show . all i say hugh da man	1

i seen almost all anime offer , but this best . yoko kano , music directer , one , if not , best world . plot gets very depth . you get know all charecters such kiba , toboe , tsume , hige , blue , cheza , all great depth . no matter how many times i see it , it doesn't get old . but after you see end series you never look charecters same way . series takes place apacaliptic age , all world turmoil . only wolves find paradise , rakuen . wolves create illusion human figure protect their identity , but some people see through disguise such nobles . thats where it all starts . actual animation best , detail background folds cloths , it well drawn boot . this anime anyone , men , women , teenagers , pets , anyone over thirteen . this my utmost recamendation all anime . i recomend seeing it japanese	1

ok ... 200 reviews this movie . yeah .. tarantino good ; elmore leonard great . but jackie brown stolen . it belongs grier forrestor . i no doubt tarantino excellent job directing . but this not his film it not follow up pulp fiction ! grier jackie brown her thing ... tarantino nor s.l. jackson steal her fire . jackie like screen burn . this her movie ... then surprisingly , out nowhere comes forrestor max cherry , hard-boiled but bald spot no hipster quality whatsover . this contrasts well s.l. jackson almost freaky soul brutha halloween costume . max tough , dealing bail jumpers . but he looks like regular shmo , quality enforced immediately when he meets jackie , who , you see , not looking her best . jackie stands out one most dynamic characters i've seen movie , it shame she got no props it . she switches polite tough , desperate determined , white-polite jive-alive , serious seductive ; all this bat eyelash . she cool cool -- booyah ! -- sexy sexy . halle berry go swing monkey bars . most us youngsters not seen this actress . no this not remind me foxie brown . it reminds me more reaction rita hayworth gets shawshank redemption when she appears flips up her hair . everyone cheers . music -- i think tarantino deserves cred here -- adds quite bit emotion characters . this movie , you get course soul 101 but also how music create mood let actor play off it . good summary this chemical reaction how it hits max while driving back work . he pops tape delphonics , somewhat obscure philly soul band . his excitement mirrors ours . earlier , he watched jackie light smoke play lp same band after stint prison . she sways relief , not overtly seductive , but enthusiasm seems missing cherry many our lives . i hate call this film underrated because then it puts it competition tarantino movies i suppose leonard adaptations . we should look it through different lens . which leads me spoiler ....... below ----- i want give respect tarantino or pam forrestor or whoever last scene which max jackie kiss . normally -- thank you hollywood -- black woman kissing white man intimately would awkward . passionate , crazy ok . but intimate no . gotta go out date end movie . kissing scene end completely natural says something . what it say ? i suppose , me part interracial couple , it shows we aren't used seeing this screen . or else director , actor , actress damn good ? i dunno ! gabriel elias	1
first i wondered this particular pairing bert i . gordon classics but when i realized both movies involve giant menaces eliminated same way it became clear . first we earth vs . spider ( often listed tv spider ) . here small town witnesses battles giant spider lives nearby cave . it take while town realize what going first witnesses kids . but soon hunt town mobilizes eliminate giant arachnid . no explanation ever given during movie creature great size . i often wonder if there tentative plans sequel . whatever case , this wonder film giant menaces . unlike similar films , there no delay seeing monster it gets plenty screen time . war colossal beast second feature sequel amazing colossal man . colossal man though perished when he fell huge dam end first movie . but here we quickly discover he alive if not well preying upon food trucks sustenance . he eventually captured folks first film try communicate him bring him back sanity . but giant disfigured man beyond hope or he redeemed scientists or love his sister ? only watching film answer questions . there one odd bit where film suddenly goes black white color right near end . while i would liked double feature two colossal man films two selected this disk go well together . disk lack anything ib way special features but separate menus each film . both films one side disk so there no need flip it over . if you like classic giant menace movies then this definitely one watch	-1
here we what one most mind bogglingly boring movies ever made ! i couldn't believe what i watching ! moreover , i am aghast this film garnered some acclaim some reviewers these pages even saw fit award this dreck unbelievable four five star rating . what going ? it me or them totally lost plot what movies supposed all ? am i naive think movies should first foremost entertain ? where oh where entertainment this lame effort film its unsteady shaky comera work , hamfisted confusing screenplay cloying performance modern cinema most tedious overratedsleep inducing actor ralph fiennes ? how i long good old days when we great movies great actors great writers great directors which achieved what they set out - entertain . sadly emergence such travesty " constant gardener " it appears we unfortunate " real " film lovers dismal viewing future .	-1

i'm glad i didn't let any negative review sway me getting this disc . while ae biography " feel good " story this legend , this disc much more honest it portrayal johhny . they don't hide fact he two sides , w.c. holland , brother tommy cash recall great detail what fully human man black really . narrator fine , re-enactments minimal , needed tell types true stories these wild boys went through . it doesn't take anything away story . disc doesn't focus his music so much ( there no full songs presented ) , man he . that ok ; i enough john music compensate . i love guy even more now then before . no sugar coating ; just like johnny would've wanted it .	1
great movie , great actors such sad part u.s. history ! it great see this movie some men who really existed ( especially " stonewall " jackson ) . we don't know if personalities showed into movie really like this or if it pure fiction , but end day it not very important , because historical interest preserved	1
wands ready ! daniel radcliffe takes up role mysterious boy wizard harry potter j.k. rowling epic seven part fantasy series . fans all ages going crazy ever since they heard rowling popular series going transfigured , so speak , into film showed movie screens around world . yet what makes this movie so unique it not derived modern video game or television series , younger generation seems enjoy , but ancient form entertainment . book ! just what magic held within those pages , seemed hooked readers into its compelling storyline around world ? harry potter sorcerer stone filled plenty excitement . screenplay wonderfully interpreted rowling complex storyline introduces harry potter realm ; actors actresses portray believable , memorable characters , every scene filled spectacular special effects . i find it only fair this movie truly piece magic itself . harry potter sorcerer stone first compelling seven-story adventure where one night living his aunt uncle somewhat abused life , eleven-year-old harry potter ( daniel radcliffe ) learns he wizard gets shipped off hogwarts school witchcraft wizardry learn art magic . his arrival he befriends ron weasley ( rupert grint ) insufferable know it all hermione granger ( emma watson ) , course there deadly enemy main character always makes , draco malfoy ( tom felton ) . harry potter brought many trials cloisters learning art magic his many teachers like professor mcgonagall ( maggie smith ) " greasy git " professor snape ( alan rickman ) , all while praised highly greatest wizard world , albus dumbledore ( richard harris ) taken under large wing half-giant gamekeeper rubeus hagrid ( robbie coltrane ) . what makes this story more compelling harry potter himself hero , hero defeating dark wizard name lord voldemort ( craftily computer generation ) . now lord voldemort after precious stone make him immortal , harry his friends only ones who stop him . harry potter sorcerers stone , filled action packed scenes digitally enhanced wonders technology three-headed dog miniature dragon . some best scenes include quidditch scene where harry partakes his first quidditch match , devil snare scene where harry , ron hermione find themselves choked plant , finally troll scene where harry ron save hermione ghastly looking , mold covered troll . these digital enhancements polish gems movie perfectly make them shine outstanding brightness , they really give movie magical aspect . setting also strong point found within movie . most places match ones described book perfectly . they create such vivid image mind , it almost makes you think it what you seeing real . hogwarts castle depicted almost perfectly it towering roofs warmly lit windows . corridors lit torches floating candles while potions classroom looks dark grimy . grounds beautiful , flourishing spring magic . every aspect craftily make movie real book possible . movie also some shortcomings well . it two half hours long , you figure they'd put important parts . however , this not case . most time , important parts lead next event cut out rearranged make story better movie audience . other aspects film , harry portrayed unrealistically boy wizard who defeated dark lord age six months now greatest wizard all time ? moment harry enters hogwarts he becomes hero even though he didn't anything . most harry life he didn't even know his great feat against dark lord , within days hogwarts he flaunting his unique lightning bolt scar like he knew one day he would become hero . he then takes responsibility saving entire school dark powers without question . i'd expect eleven-year-old boy would scared just like every other young kid who threatened death . harry potter , all glory it received , some competition . i firmly believe harry potter sorcerers stone fell directly fans tolkien lord rings c.s. lewis ' chronicles narnia , both which came out their own movie . firm christians sought out narnia , while hardcore fantasy fans fled lord rings , leaving harry potter middle . however there some hardcore harry potter fans well , but when rowling epic story ends , this brilliant story just fade or fall into shadows films become classics . even though movie both very strong points it shortcomings , it still overall great film . first epic seven part series , this movie ends happy ending , but lot questions unanswered . there both good bad side this . many fans can't stand waiting next film produced year or so , but if you get them hooked enough , you guarantee they'll back next one . harry potter sorcerer stone movie made family viewing . it depicts life wizard how he copes new world . it also firmly implies important lessons courage loyalty those you care . now , there total six books four harry potter movies , all which hit record amounts . fans j.k. rowling masterpiece anxiously awaiting closure her series final book . i suggest until happens , fans occupy themselves watching magic harry potter films majestic moral themes they present . this reveiw katelynn mallonrabbid harry potter fangir	1

this definitely b-movie , so don't expect great acting or special effects , but boy , it hunky guys showing off their glistening bodies much possible . imagine movie starring bunch abercrombie fitch models ... imagine acting caliber said models . only thing really bothered me ridiculous annoying " special effect " used whenever leeches attacked someone . but , now it available really low price , it even more worth it if you like campy , brainless fun . this one those flix you would rate " 1 star " if your reference point normal hollywood blockbuster , but genre it , this definitely great addition	-1
i'm average shape frequently exercise home . i used minna fat eliminator workout while enjoyed her style , so i decided give " emergency " workout shot . i just got it this week entire video twice . 30-minute toning portion great . she combines arms legs so you work up sweat . she very thorough , covering all arm muscles fatiguing legs well . i wish she spent little more time abs , but that my only complaint . 30-minute cardio routine fun , but it take few times get moves down , including mambos , cha chas , hip shakes , other salsa-type moves . it requires some concentration which fine me , because it makes workout go quicker . i haven't sweated much i fat eliminator workout , but i attest fact i'm still getting used moves . once i become more familiar routine , i'm hoping increase my own intensity work up better sweat . overall , this fun cardio toning program . i highly recommend anyone who looking " dancey " workout .	-1

i saw " annie get your gun " again this weekend live stage . i forgotten just how many great songs irving berlin wrote this masterpiece ! --" you can't get man gun " , " girl i marry " , " doin ' what comes naturally , " " anything you i better , " " they say falling love wonderful , " " i got sun morning moon night , " classic anthem " there no business like show business . " if you haven't seen or heard this musical , please yourself favor get this film tape or dvd . afterthoughts : i just read several negative reviews betty hutton portrayal annie oakley . not believe them . not even read them ! some people " glass half empty " type people negativity contagious ! betty hutton portrayal , course , probably directed director film . so it " director portrayal " ; director responsible what betty hutton screen . , this not meant " realistic " portrayal " real " person anyway --- no one alive remembers what annie oakley really like . so portrayal betty hutton ( directed her director ) good " shot it " any other --- including judy garland portrayal . so , i suggest you just accept betty huttons portrayal " one among many possible " enjoy what portrayal --- alot comedic verve vivacity ! yes , " glass half full " .. even more than half .... this case . then there some reviewers who criticize show because annie pretends poorer shot than frank near end " get her man " letting him win thus showing his " shooting prowess " some respect make him feel better . i suppose some people it " politically incorrect " " play male ego game " . but , isn't " playing male ego game " what it takes sometimes " get man you want ? " so , wasn't annie play just " realistic " ? isn't criticizing this aspect play " nit-picking " . ask yourself , could you even come close writing " masterpiece " like musical , " annie get your gun " ? if you couldn't it , then what gives you right " nit pic " show ? indian issue . some people feel indians disrespected show . but , show i saw chief sitting bull portrayed giving good advice annie intelligent person . my opinion , whichever way indians portrayed movie doesn't change anything all positive aspects show . my suggestion forget all nit-picking enjoy show ! there alot enjoy ! :o ) email boland7214 @aol .	1

i saw this recently lark just see what all brigitte bardot fuss -- wasn't expecting much since sex comedy farces ( particularly french ones ) aren't high my film watch lists -- but surprised how good ( good-natured ) it . besides vivacious charms ms. bardot , this film solid script good acting dialogs . ( one my favorite lines bardot replying query why family won't sell its puny shipyard effect they want least still * own * something not feel poor . ) story not highbrow , but far lowbrow tawdry exploitative some newcomers ( like me ) might perceive its notorious reputation . bardot plays juliette , " town tramp " st. tropez who pursued rich , elderly playboy while carrying torch antonio , impecunious shipwright who treats her just convenient one-night-stand . comes antonio younger brother , michele , who truly loves her offers marry her save her sent back orphanage . juliette marries michele comes love him despite herself , while fighting against her reckless , impetuous nature antonio comes back into scene presents constant temptation . love or lust wins out ? call me old-fashioned , but i liked how movie ends , i agree amazon reviewer analysis ( robert cartland ) , which hits it square head . ( btw , video transfer this criterion dvd edition excellent , eliminating all old flaws while preserving warm , vibrant colors st. tropez location great effect . )	-1

i thought i taking risk buying this dvd because there not much info it . after watching full dvd , i'm glad i took risk . this dvd pleasant surprise ! well worth money i spent . dvd split into 3 main sections : tools techniques , then artistic principles , last one complete animation example start finish . first 2 sections 1 1/2 hours each while last one hour . watching tools techniques section , i little worried because dvd uses animation master i use maya . i thought it would hard follow , but i glad know tools animation master pretty much same maya . they similar bones , ik , fk , dope sheet , graph editor . way he teaches tools more like how use tools , not which button push menu . example he showed how use dope sheet graph editor correctly structured way so your animations easy change if need . after watching this , i liked he taught it this way instead " click here here " , because you really get sense how why certain things animation . there lots small examples spread out through first part . now this where i found dvd most helpful . i read lots books animation , but never really ' got it ' just reading . seeing examples full motion really helps out lot . second section all animation art . he talked principles like squash stretch , weight , staging , keyframing , secondary action . too many list right now . each little chapter lots examples showing you how animate principle correctly . i loved fact he showed lots common mistakes then how fix them . this section really where you learn how make your animations look good it pretty entertaining . oh yeah , entertainment factor also big plus . i watched through this 4 hr dvd one sitting , which no small feat ! they used lots different footage their examples , which i thought keeps it fresh active . i've seen other 3d training videos just computer screen guy talking , that all you see . if you think sounds boring , well it . this dvd different they teacher basically talking audience then they would cut animation examples or computer screen further illustrate what teacher saying . music cool too . one thing bug me little sound . background hiss pretty high , which annoying , but you could still easily hear everything clearly . it just wasn't dvd quality audio though . last section dvd full animation example concept finally rendering . i enjoyed this part lot , because i got see how professional animator animates . he not only tells you what he doing , but also his mental critiques animation also what he planning next . when mistakes happens , he told you how fix them . if everything before this section theory , then this section practical . all all , great dvd learn . i know i re-watching this one few times	1
mamoru oshii outstanding ghost shell ( 1995 ) , director/writer gave himself little time , less than 90 minutes , explore many questions he raised script . his long-awaited sequel , ghost shell 2 : innocence , he succeeds answering many these questions whilst same time giving us many more ponder , film , though flawed , deserves 5 star rating . rather like disney animation , film viewed more than one level more than one audience . surface it sumptuously-animated film which fairly conventional who-done-it plot unfolds ; robots murdering humans , crime specialist brought solve case . period . we already seen equivalent plots films such blade runner or i , robot this film nothing new add basic idea . however oshii world far more disturbing complex below surface . he subverts ending film which , could taken triumph good over evil . however , when distinctions robot human become blurred central notions good evil film fall down . he pulls other tricks undermine our assumptions humanity ; one point main cop character puts coat over robot hide its nakedness ; time robotic character philosophises over meaning existence , whilst chain-smoking . it director treatment paradox what it means human film value lies , not superficial plot . characterisation little scimpy ( notable exception depiction oshii own basset hound , which drawn clear devotion ) but visually film stunning . oshii one few directors able practice delicate art inactivity screen . he not scared abandon plot minutes end luxuriate , example , extended arial shot city , or dwell completely motionless face whilst we register its owner emotional state , or allow his main characters , motionless screen what seems like ages , quote western philosophical religious texts . none these scenes moves plot forwards yet film would immeasurably poorer without them . too many sequels outstanding films try provide glib answers issues raised original most fail this approach ; examples such 2010 matrix reloaded spring mind . this film oshii avoided this pitfall given us rare sequal , takes theme original finds something fresh say . summary , film deserves 5 star rating , but i think it falls short greatness .	1

glory truly extraordinary motion picture all sorts ways . proud southerner , i say no other film ever me cheering union regiment taking company confederate soldiers . i little worried this film would demonize south , but it proved most even-handed treatment all parties . demonstrating racism northerners - soldiers civilians alike - it paints most nuanced portrait african-american men who seized opportunity don blue uniforms fight country many them must unable truly call their own . only makes their heroism bravery all more poignant . war states never understood simple black white terms any level , many union soldier clearly wasn't fighting emancipate slaves ( just many rebel soldier wasn't fighting slavery ) . even when they actually used teach actual history schools , story 54th massachusetts regiment subject never really came up - what gives glory such extraordinary amount historical importance . i wouldn't go so far say heroism sacrifice this first african-american regiment union army turned tide war , but it lead acceptance actual black fighting soldiers union ranks - 210,000 such recruits certainly proved important fighting force basically won through strength numbers ( more blues than grays died war ) . movie itself , though , really men who led made up 54th massachusetts regiment - there sterling performances all over place . i said many times past , morgan freeman best actor living today , his character , sgt . major john rawlins , really heart soul whole film . older , runaway slave , he gained measure wisdom restraint private trip ( denzel washington ) never even imagined . trip wears scars his back proudly , he not stand down before any man . washington earned best supporting actor award his role , rightly so . educated freemen represented thomas searles ( andre braugher ) , who seems ill-suited harsh realities war but shoulders burden pride determination . head these men rides colonel robert gould shaw ( matthew broderick ) , young officer who secured position more family influence than merit , perhaps , but he more than rises challenge fight both his men . despite his lifelong friendship thomas , he almost no connection men 54th must learn know them earn their respect . union army doesn't even want supply his men necessities such decent shoes uniform , nor it really any intention actually sending them into combat . thanks colonel , though , fighting men 54th eventually get their chance prove themselves leading what basically suicidal charge against fort wagner south carolina . aside multi-layered story itself , one must impressed realism action . war ugly business , fact brought home very first scenes showing colonel shaw charge during battle antietam . while there should small rivers blood covering battlefield , watching soldier head basically explode makes vivid stamp realism . while i would question tactics employed assault fort wayne end , movie certainly capture nature fog war viciousness hand-to-hand fighting heroes both sides . course , this movie , so there numerous historical inaccuracies main characters ( none whom , other than col . shaw , based actual soldiers ) battles , yet glory certainly succeed telling story 54th regiment most compelling ways	1
one man life full ups downs pictured film , " throne blood " , directed akira kurosawa . this film japanese re-make version famous shakespearean play , macbeth . because this film japanese film , many details differ macbeth , although basic plot story same . all plot changes , character setting differences effective choices this film because it adds different taste original form story . most plot changes film due cultural differences make plot this film natural flowing , little twist end . some detailed plot adaptations director make included washizu ( playing role macbeth ) taking over cob-web castle , miki ( playing role lady macbeth ) pregnant washizu killed his own men towards end story . medieval japan , man taking over castle not necessarily mean he emperor japan , unlike macbeth aiming king start . therefore , washizu not kill emperor , but he kill others competing castle . however , conflicts washizu other competent similar macbeth because goal they both mind achieve power . this film , miki pregnancy not seem dramatical change plot story , but thought necessary this japanese film . reason this because couple wanted their own child inherit his throne after his death . this inheriting system similar one macbeth , but this director decided add this detail reveal great desires washizu . after all killing struggles take over castle , washizu not want any other person but his child who shares his blood inherit throne . climax this film comes when hundreds soldiers washizu side points their arrows him one one hits him . this plot adaptations made this film because soldiers wanted show sign surrender . giving washizu head represented surrender . this change made film more violent thus added twist unexpected ending . making changes , it very important plot flows it natural . this sort change needed because there no fun film or story completely same original form . main character , washizu very different characteristic macbeth . washizu brave , confident , demanding more selfish than shakespearean macbeth . shogun ( similar position thane when referring macbeth ) strong , determined brave take over castle . unlike macbeth , he demanding his wife tone his speech overall strong . director probably wanted express image brave man going through one straight road towards his goal , but ending tragic death . this maybe typical image shogun during medieval japan . one thing not expressed because this characterization washizu , gradual change washizu beginning end story . this important change express because macbeth , he growing become more aggressive greedy he overcomes obstacles become king . similarly , miki characterization different form lady macbeth too . lady macbeth pretty strong woman , telling her husband what . however , miki not like her because she under circumstance where she cannot , since washizu demanding person . but overall , two characters played japanese actors very well suited this version macbeth . " throne blood " set medieval japan , when shoguns each castle fought prove strongest castle warlords . this setting very suited fit story like macbeth into . both setting lords , emperor/king , warriors . this made it possible details expressed film . example one detail one three apparitions old lady , gave washizu . when old lady told him he victorious unless wood nears neighbor comes down washizu castle . since medieval castle japan constructed top fort used forests woods one protection security methods , this apparition realistic . director chose japan setting this film , probably because many things matched original setting . technically , it completely different setting but it good enough reproduce similar story which very impressive . if people who never seen or heard macbeth happens see " throne blood " not think this film reproductive shakespearean play . this how almost perfectly macbeth throne blood matches . changes made rather improve film . washizu macbeth , both who lived fast tragic life possess lifestyle people today still learn achieve . power films stories . " throne blood " always classical perfect example successful reproductive film .	1

this movie quiet , subtle . funny heartbreaking . moving frightening . many ways it surpasses " sixth sense " me shyamalan truly " great " film , simply because i grew love this family , identify them . it shame next two films shyamalan released so incredibly frustratingly sub-par . but here , he shines , telling modern day story not-so-little green men coming earth , not friendly way . he very easily could failed here , this could turned into cheesy , b-movie , but he makes you believe . hopefully he again one day	1
keeping my usual habit discovering thinks backwards i managed view second eye film before first , but i'm reassured excellent ' making ' extra director danny pang set out make film completely disconnected first . other than theme it through our eyes we meet dead , course . joey ( qi shu ) young woman who , face failed romance , falls apart emotionally . attempt suicide unexpected side effect allowing her see ghostly figures spirits world around her . when joey discovers she pregnant lover who abandoned her , second piece puzzle falls into place , these spirits dead , waiting enter bodies infants they born . joey terrified , defensive her own unborn child . even efforts buddhist priest fail convince her this anything but hideous , unexpected curse . she keeps searching answers , but finds no comfort her discoveries . she confronted ironic twist fate come very near destroying her completely . pang brothers manage avoid various clichs ghost stories , making various spirit appearances blend right into steadily rising tension film . qi shu manages stay just this side over acting , general atmosphere film naturalistic . this lack theatricality adds unexpected reality qi shu performance , enhances anguish confusion supporting cast members like jesdaporn pholdee . altogether enjoyable effort almost level tale two sisters	-1

rather than give general review others kindly , my review focuses one aspect film , indeed one character , martha . martha dunstock known throughout film martha dumptruck . even film credits include nickname `dumptruck ' besides character surname ( evidently feeling need labour point ) . portrayed unattractive pathetically grateful any attention she given , she unwittingly provides slater character information enabling him murder student . later , when cult status `suicides ' ( , murdered students ) becomes apparent , martha attempts her own suicide walking into path traffic . but her attempt shown failure . end film martha bruised now disabled , electric wheelchair . ryder character , finished her voyage self-realisation , rejects school prom night instead invites martha stay video popcorn . martha gratefully accepts closing scenes show ryder walking corridor while martha encircles her like planet around sun . image martha her wheelchair , object pity ryder audience , signifies us fears different , not beautiful , not loved respected . martha person we all frightened becoming . she given no means solving her predicament film maker . though some us audience may fat , or disabled , or both , we may yet still fear martha , invited consider ryder protagonist journey self discovery our own , even physical social reality , we more like martha . this reason , `heathers ' fails exploration `hell ' high school ( description often used buffy/angel/ firefly joss whedon ) . those audience not thin complying western standards `beauty ' protagonists ( probably majority us ) ultimately may find so-called subversion cruel hierarchy this film just little too shallow , leaving bitter after-taste . way `fat ' people portrayed films such these unfortunately often reflect predictable , transparent absurd fixations film makers . sadly this happening even today - some ways it gotten even worse since western world decided wage ' war fat ' ( quote paul campos ) - even best it lazy film-making .	-1

there little say this movie , since i assume people interested buying this item already seen it already . but amount quality extras this dvd just breathtaking . say least , disc 2 imax version film , which time this writing not documented here amazon . imax version , well :) , shorter version film ( 1h55 ' versus 2h20 ' regular ) aspect ratio 1:66 . so if you unsure buy widescreen or fullscreen versions , i suggest buying wide , since you get ( sort ) full screen version imax one present disc 2 . then there this documentary " conquest space " which rather dull , " astronauts story " very short but interesting clip , excellent " making " juicy commentary jim lovell , pinpointing hits misses film compared real thing . $9.90 , how you not buy this jewel	1

i am huge fan wes anderson debut effort , " rushmore . " it one most original , well-written , soulful comedies teenage life ( our inability grow beyond it ) i'd ever seen . " rushmore " also great cast , led perhaps my favorite actor all time , bill murray . but then came follow-up , " royal tennenbaums , " bill murray there once again . it not coincidence " tennenbaums " not same class " rushmore " either comedy or film , it also put murray off one side , barely using him . one left speculate possibilities anderson murray teaming up where murray got spotlight 100% time . those speculations brought fruition " life aquatic steve zissou , " things generally what you would expect this team . " life aquatic " looks sounds just like movie one would expect max fisher , hero " rushmore . " it low-budget , slap-dash affair ( watch hilariously-amateurish gunfight scenes ) whimsical special effects ludicrous stabs tragedy . but blasting thing got heart , its heart melancholy , bemused visage bill murray . murray plays titular steve zissou , minor-league jacques cousteau whose best years both behind him not all great . murray captures zissou man looking into abyss his own mortality his own futility elan only he could muster . murray says more sidelong glance than many actors evoke soliloquy , fans this long-time great , " life aquatic " offers many sterling moments . but rest movie , all its heart imagination , not exceed sum its parts . it funny traditional wes anderson way , populated people who no idea how pathetic they really . there lines brilliant comedy insight . but just like aaron sorkin dialogue " few good men " " american president " " west wing " sounds exactly same regardless who speaking lines , wes anderson motif starting wear bit thin . particularly tiresome owen wilson kentucky air pilot , whose southern-ness seems play no role except wilson fulfill some outmoded stereotypes . willem dafoe , god bless him , shoots moon his german side-kick , but he brings rage intensity movie where rest cast seems so mellow you believe they more than little " baked , " so he often seems coming different movie altogether . if you love bill murray , or wes anderson , you love " life aquatic . " much big fan i am murray , i still can't rave movie . but it definitely worth your time , if only see magical wonder jaguar shark . see draw unparalled pleasure seeing jeff goldblum get shot	-1

disney remake " mighty joe young " excellent film , but nothing beats charm original film . said , i think both versions worth owning . there common thread runs through both original this remake , both share somewhat similar climatic ending . but there enough differences make two films unique quite interesting side-by-side comparisons . course disney version you state-of-the art cgi . joe looks so real , it blow your mind ! sweet tearjerker whole family enjoy . remake mjy filmed color widescreen . original " mighty joe young " you don't get state-of-the-art special effects remake , but what you get much better story which tugs all your emotions . climax film very exciting , so touching it brings tears eyes . i won't give it away not spoil it . original mjy filmed black white full screen . great news , this film finally released november 2005 original " king kong " " son kong " special collection . it most likely available single dvd well . it should winner !	1

i quite liked this movie . it isn't ever going absolute favourite mine , but it very entertaining because it good mix it comedy , drama , revenge , passion good old fun . kimberly elise ok this ( i think it would suited either angela bassat or vivica fox better ) her deliciously evil husband ( steve harris - practice heist ) excellent . he so mean you knew he'd get what coming him he sure . he just lucky his soon-to-be-ex wife so kind him inspite what he'd previously her . kimberly character make right choice end ( very predictable ) it very officer gentleman end . take cake tyler perry . he so funny - even i white chick get his humour his delivery . i especially love scene new girlfriends closet . hilarious . this really good movie should wide appeal because it got everything it . there big lesson learn it it also entertain you again again . i highly recommend it	-1
i like gangster movies am philly so i gave this movie chance . what mistake . creators painstakingly tried rip off sopranos but wound up very weak imitation . it starts horrible theme song . it obviously trying sound similar a3 song serves sopranos theme , but chock full horrible lyrics sounds like someone threw casio keyboard down stairs recorded i t.t he cast filled mediocre actors , trying vain save stupid script . one funny thing everyone film different accent , exception one guy , no one south philly accent . sal mazzotta trying real hard james gandolfini tony soprano , but i'm sorry ... he may nice guy real life , but guy couldn't act scared graveyard midnight . come ; this guy gangster ? maybe lurch adams family . this movie also plauged choppy editing poor camera work . i mean few scenes camera actually going out focus while people talking . don't they teach film school ? usually when two people talking their heads turned one angle wide two person shot , completely different angles close ups , like maybe close up stuff much later . save your money . wish i could get mine back . it long time since i saw movie so bad i felt angry ripped off seen it .	-1

overall -- all extras -- fine piece . new documentary good , if little self-serving . sound quality narration weak needs closed captioning . extra interviews photo albums excellent . shots currently flying b-17s good but should longer . if you into b-17s or wwii , you should get this one . you won't disappointed	-1
this wishy washy attempt truth . facts there parts pieces , but it not really put together well . some choices material questionable truly valuable topic . this dvd agenda not unbiased , i think it failed it overall agenda . there more than enough information pre-9/11 post-9/11 put together something more worthy accurate than this dvd attempted . if this best contrasting evidence bush administration produced after all happened white house beyond , we truly trouble . truth out there , i think this dvd tripped over them kept walking without looking down gathering all facts together . there plenty important facts things said worth listening this dvd , but this dvd maybe worth glance , but not long hard look .	-1
tamilee webb 2 dvd set best ! she you working hard without steep learning curve . if you read my other reviews , then you know i hate videos complicated steps or poor instructions . tamilee knows her stuff she shares knowlege you . you learn how each move right way every time . weight loss dvd my favorite , but you should note it requires step . first few times i tried it , my legs felt like jelly afterwards . when i able get through whole workout , there tremendous feeling accomplishment . lower body workout strenuous without exhausting . when i've complete video , i feel energized rather than depleted . tamilee cueing efficient her timing excellent . there only few minor negative points ; music little bland two women who exercising tamilee too perfect seem real . i really appreciate it when workout videos show normal looking people . said , these videos two my favorites . i never seem tire them .	-1

jurassic park : lost world isn't quite bad lot reviewers say , although they certainly entitled their opinions---isn't what this site all ? any rate , while sequel loses some its originality awe-inspiring moments , it well action film , rexs attacking trailer nail-biting sequence . there lot predictability scientists vs . hunters formula , but film like this , one accept predictablility if it handled professionally . effects camera work par excellence . first film , jeff goldblum underplays his role , perhaps bit too much this time --- he almost seems bored ? julianne moore who go more " acting " roles okay heroine , little more exciting than laura dern . i too agree decision go politically correct give goldblum african-american daughter , especially since there no background add this relationship . pete postelthwaite arliss howard villains appropriately cast . while not big hit its prequel , lost world entertained me	-1

so what y'all smoking ? sure , jessica simpson sing ( especially her beginnings 1999 lukewarm smash sweet kisses ) , but not particularly this dvd . she some serious vocal affections hinder her natural sound distort her pop croonings ( she comes off britney wannabe ) . interestingly her more tepid boring tunes this skin sound best ( including " my way home " ) . her rendition " take my breath away " decent , touching " you don't let go " ( her " i love because you love ... me " nothing less than beautiful ) , but her awful performance " angels " falls extremely short expectations ( she sounded much better vh1 divas live ) . end , her reality tour 2004 decent but much less stellar concert given girl who talent . throw out britney-trademarked growl , jessica , odd vocal quirk makes it sound though she choking back song rather than singing it you soar . decent , but not great .	-1
i read one negative review this film i would like clarify statements made it . i am russian so , obviously , i like this film . it typical russian humor , it farce , so not look higher meanings jokes , it makes fun social standards soviet regime well people who served it so well . it features some best russian actors we love seeing acting ; they sing movie it lovely well . if you tough judge movies , then please make sure you know soviet history bit understand humor differs what you see american movies before you call it crap . i not see why there should problem characters not talking first ten minutes movie . fact , it just few minutes during which you shown premise movie . cyrillic letters not making sense : this russian movie you bound see everything written our gibberish alphabet . besides , movie begins cruise foreign country ( it shot baku , azerbajan but supposed turkey ) . language spoken locals well signs buildings gibberish - it made up specially movie . said , i want say few words plot . semen semenovich diligent russian economist goes cruise , where he gets acquainted mafia mob right hand , kozodoev , whose assignment pick up diamonds supplier deliver it back moscow via cast his arm . during one last stops , semen semenovich gets mistaken kozodoev ends up cast jewels inside it . he returns moscow , semen contacts police . now , he pose bait escape traps elaborately planted mafia . i already said , movie fantastic . just remember it farce . no , there not slapstick humour . open-minded enjoy ! oh , way , all jewelry you see screen authentic . it mentioned beginning film crew would like thank all soviet individuals who lend their gems filming .	1
this great cyber thriller sandra bullock excellent job portraying female computer geek . directing , casting , sets , music first class . those us computer industry those who not both enjoy it . i'm senior engineer worked computers twenty plus years i saw it when it first released . when i first saw this movie , only one thing amused me , wolfenstein game , it movies only shortcoming . time movie released game old news they carry how game state art . it didn't ring true those us bleeding edge gaming community . they should not put game or came up something looked high tech since game dates it . perhaps snobbery , but true nonetheless . i said before it only shortcoming . this movie excellent mood like hitchcockian or grisham thriller . well paced it keeps you guessing what next . threat identity theft large computer companies failing because faulty software today only shows how respect movie ahead it time . i never tire watching it . dvd quality good , but unfortunately it not include any extras . still well worth buying copy	-1

grudge american remake japanese horror film . what different grudge it non-linear story line . first you think it three separate stories , then just two , finally you realize your seeing interspersed storylines past present they meet end film -- filling you curse what happening . ( think momento identity)the scariest part story , it pretty creepy , because curse born first murder kills indescriminately anyone who enters house . not immediately . not same way . no matter what you , you can't outwit it . if you house , it got your number . scariest thing most people involved innocent -- they nothing original killing , when seeing ghost while shocked , they tried help . yet , still they died . there might way avoid curse but unfortunately , it didn't get carried ou t.t here no cgi/fx -- everything low key creepy . i'd almost say this more psychological horror than monster coming get you horror but never they less -- you'll probably end up sleeping lights wondering if you should evere go into house you don't know anything again	-1
plenty reviews described this amazing movie . i'd just like add note meaning title . most people ignored it - one reviewer thought it reference frequency shooting up . ( ex ) brit , who grew up scotland , when i saw it , some time ago , i just automatically assumed something quite different . first - trainspotting actual hobby britain . remember this small country dense active rail network . lots people really , really interested trains , but trainspotting kind very lowest-grade interest . trainspotters stand around stations , or major rail junctions , or marshalling yards , just collect train facts - usually engine numbers , sometimes appearances some particular kind rolling stock . all they - make lists ! ( or sometimes trade number lists other spotters , or exult size their list ) . so image trainspotter low-energy person , very conventional outlook , probably standing hours rain shabby raincoat ... one who pretty much given up ever doing anything exciting who absolutely needs get life ! collecting train numbers basically pure , time-consuming obsession . collecting stamps or beer mats or matchbooks , or any thousand other odd things people collect , sometimes dimension - artistic interest , investment , etc - train numbers lead nowhere . so me title " trainspotting " sardonic reminder monotonous , meaningless " normal " life guys rebelling against trying escape - unwisely , but desperately - their drug usage . it background against which vivid certainly scary picture painted . hope this helpful . would interesting hear anyone associated movie if that right - i say , it just natural ., automatic interpretation me . ps - after reading many , many reviews - why it so many otherwise literate people just cannot spell words definite definitely ? many keep thinking there there somewhere ... one even wrote " defiantly " which gave interesting unintended twist , course passed spell-check ... oh well	1

we all knew form previews this movie tom cruse hit man jamie foxx cab driver . , tom commandeers jamie his cab night killing . problem , me when mild-mannered , soft-spoken cab driver turns into macho operative then super hero . max ( jamie foxx ) cab driver twelve years . although he dreams aspirations ; that all they . after twelve years he still cab drive . yet , when he picks up sophisticated lady lawyer , he charms her his quick wit knowledge ; point she gives him her phone without him even asking it . i not buy minute . his next fare vincent ( tom cruse ) . vincent wants hire max cab night willing pay well beyond max usual nigh t-t ime take . yet max resist . ( why ? i don't understand this . ) reluctantly max agrees vincent request but only after vincent really pushes issue . then , everything changes when max -- accident -- finds out vincent killer . , vincent plans killing more people max his wheel man . remember , max mild-mannered , passive type person . so he not only fears his life but he scared out his wits . so , he allows vincent intimidate him into going killing spree . course all not go planned . without giving away plot ( if you call it ) max forced vincent confront some very bad people -- his own . yet , while scared out his wits surrounded gun wheeling henchmen ; max able bluff very bad man putting macho act . i not buy second . after more killings , max still scared but decides vincent must stopped . so , without regard his own life ( anymore ) , max makes all out effort stop vincent . , course , not work . vincent leaves max precarious situation continues go after his next victim . so max , his now obsession stop vincent , overpowers police officer who arresting him , takes police officer gun , goes after vincent stop him . i not buy millisecond . i am glad i not buy this movie .	-1
i saw this movie years ago , but didn't remember much it , except some songs , basic story . i also saw " nights cabiria " , which story taken . i love musicals , i think shirley maclaine very talented . she very sweet charity hope valentine , one can't help wanting happy ending her . so why i think this movie awful ? first all , some dialogue so repetitious it became irritating -- how many times you listen charity say " fickle finger fate " over over without wanting hit mute button ? also , some scenes went -- especially elevator scene . -- intermission totally unnecessary . but worst disappointment me musical numbers . i didn't like any them --- they so far over top silly . bob fosse must thrown everything into them he could --- instead letting dancers songs carry numbers , he so much busyness all them -- too many people , costumes didn't fit story , silly moves -- they all went past point enjoyment . i fast forwarded thrua couple them just get them over . i never before any movie . this could so much better -- story good , charactors good -- but whole thing should toned down . movie could 30 minutes shorter if there some trimming . it entirely too long . also --- all stop action -- what all ? i know , i know -- it show progress story , but it distraction . i didn't like movie glad when it over .	-1
i wholeheartedly agree all glowing reviews this site , this movie probably one most magical i ever seen ( i'm 41 ) . however , pg rating because some coarse language which amazon not mention specifically . i watched it my daughter when she 8 , since i seen movie when it first came out , i couldn't recall exactly what it . well .... it word i believe also g-d , so if you prefer your kids not hear kind language movie you chosen then you might want hold off this one few more years ( although they may hearing those words worse their school bus anyway ) . there also scene where girlfriend comes spend night her shirt gets unbuttoned you see her bra .... so just know depending your child level knowledge sex , etc you may get questions you aren't ready !! anyway my daughter four years older now i would feel much more comfortable watching this her now she " pre-teen " . other than this it terrific movie definitely one most creative tom hanks ' career .	1

there many movies sports , some very good , some really bad this one falls into very good category . " goal ! " typical sports movie exceptionally talented young amateur who given chance shine among professionals win heart girl he loves . however , " goal ! " works this premise makes it fresh entertaining . director danny cannon complete support fifa newcastle united it shows , he created some most realist remarkable football scenes film . kuno becker very good santiago , although times he overshadowed other members cast . it seems if he lacked some presence screen . however , he still young , certainly improve years . alessandro nivola steals movie his performance gavin , notorious football star whose convoluted public life begins take its toll his performance field . cannon approach story may seem clich�d , but movie never boring nor tiresome . sure , he follows every rule " sport movies handbook " but he it care , good eye love sport . just like sport movies should . movie flows smoothly remarkable football scenes santiago struggle his own personal demons . while times it seems both cannon becker more comfortable sports scenes , movie dose drama well handled completes enjoyable experience . even though it frankly predictable most time , it transmits passion , emotions love game few movies . that why " goal ! " considered successful important film . it first film football soccer transmits emotions made sport most popular sport world . that got worth something . it may not perfect sports film ; however , " goal ! " beginning adventure , hopefully , new way make football movies . this initial film what called " goal ! trilogy " delivers high energy entertainment fans non-fans sport .	-1
this dvd surpassed my highest expectations . when i ordered dvd , i not aware these performances all taken european tv shows . i thought these performances actually recorded live festival , expecting grainy pictures poor audio quality . imagine my surprise seeing buddy guy introduce big mama thornton she walks out onto indoor stage set , not unlike " saturday night live " . despite black white picture , i felt like i really there studio while she sang ! audio quality really good . any context , any stage , these performers all presence spare . considering source ( euro tv ) age film ( some over 40 years old ) , i completely blown away . there no disappointment anywhere this dvd , what great variety classic blues ! electric guitars , acoustic guitars , slide guitar work , male vocalists , female vocalists , chicago style , delta style , slow tunes , upbeat tunes , this dvd it all , absolute best business ! i would strongly recommend this dvd anyone . whether you new blues , diehard fan like myself , or just want see direct ancestors your favorite rock bands , check out this dvd .	1

there countless reviews here , so i make this one short . first , i am always amazed when i meet people who say they figured " usual suspects " out middle movie . i one totally floored . i not see it coming , very surprised [ no spoilers ] . film analyzed , dissected , discussed , over 500 reviews , written quite extensively . however , one things i don't understand why someone would give film one or two stars . there many ' good ' films really never appealed me , however , i see although i might not like film , it good film . therefore , i would not think giving such low marks film this reason ; but would give my analysis what i thought weak film : yet , i would still give film its earned accolades . this film great however . film , " usual suspects " very good very twisted complicated plot . this only makes film better watch . i like these types mysteries . especially ones you can't figure out . specifically when they not spell it out viewer what happening ; but suddenly you find yourself saying , " wow , i never expected ! " these types films twists turns appeal me . if they appeal you , then this film you . i would highly recommend you not only rent film , but purchase it , it belongs your dvd collection . this smart , intelligently written , wonderfully acted suspense thriller take you roller coaster mystery , which keep you riveted your seat . highly recommended .	1

this dvd valuable piece broadway history , it documents process involved recording one landmark cast albums all time , " company " . it interesting see mechanics involved , naturally , but what sticks you determination these tired actors ( they recorded sunday after opening night , their day off ) get permanent record this brilliant , groundbreaking musical . it fun watch them subtly interact if stage . it also touching see these actors they looked thirty-four years ago -- barbara barrie before her harrowing cancer battle , beth howland charles kimbrough before sitcom fame , elaine stritch before england , marriage , widowhood , beating alcoholism . intriguing backstage story lead actor dean jones ' impending departure show still moving ; his misery over crumbling marriage back california led deal director harold prince bring show into new york -- then leave role larry kert . certainly there some wonderful performances captured here ( dean jones , teri ralston silvery vocals , beth howland hysterical patter song , pamela myer run through what may greatest song written new york , " hundred people " ) . but centerpiece indeed elaine stritch struggle get good track down what she called her " three-act play " , " ladies who lunch " . memorable first night , her fatigue gets better her nuance gives way angry shouting . her eyes , wide wild exhaustion , tell volumes . her quiet , dignified exit get rest while orchestra records backing track pure theatre . her triumphant return studio nail perfect take ( indeed , film documents take actually made album ) thrills . she must known this would " one " , she made sure her hair her makeup perfect ( down full false eyelashes) -- she looks beautiful sounds spectacular . stritch present-day commentary protests she matinee later day , hence full stage face . whatever reason , her tough-as-nails beauty shines . dvd extras add fun commentary ( pennebaker , hal prince typically feisty stritch ) photos original production -- i wish they added more ! this very much worth it if you student theatre history or theatre music	1

i wondering what watch this morning saw criterion edition dvd kihachi okamoto " sword doom " my shelf , i thought watching it after silent short wladyslaw starewicz sort light entertainment . not expecting much , i put it my dvd player prepared relax coming two hours . i seen copy this dvd my local library week ago , i never heard anything director i remembered , back cover spoke lots violence blood , made me expect exploitation film vein seijun suzuki only samurais full color . so i surprised bit disappointed when film began black white . but i soon disabused . films black white photography stunning example use light i seen some 60s japanese films ( e.g. seijun suzuki branded kill ) . shot stark contrast , film always seems bit overexposed , creating atmosphere witch viewer may already feel some pain characters , harshness period depicted , through his own constant effort eyes while watching . characters strain stress , atmosphere tautness matched films style . widescreen format used its fullest cinematographer hiroshi murai , almost every frame prime example staging camera , achieving awe-inspiring compositions which mirror characters emotions obsessions , always bringing directors intentions light most original way . editing meticulous , always right spot , its best not only enhancing films atmosphere flow , but deepening our understanding characters psychological profiles . this combination camerawork editing makes film formal level one finest i've ever seen . but complementing this emotional richness speaks directors own experience , life he witnessed during his time army second world war . assistant director amongst others mikio naruse right after war , we witness okamoto " sword doom " already possession not only full-fledged independent perspective life itself , but also cinematic skill , only few directors able achieve put use history cinema . essay accompanying dvd-edition , film-scholar geoffrey o'brien compares okamoto contemporaries like seijun suzuki akira kurosawa , but places him under both , calling him only very competent genre-director , he fails reach under films surface find sense films undertaking besides its obvious merits , when fact okamoto this film alone must ranked humanist director par names like kurosawa , ozu mizoguchi . his clear moral standpoint he still miles ahead formal brilliance playful nihilistic stance seijun suzuki 60s films or other genre directors this time . whatever suzukis merits ( those his colleagues ) their own may , their filmic rebellion one against established way filmmaking , rebellion against restrictions made studios wanted traditional clear-cut products would make maximum profit . but kihachi okamoto , least " sword doom " , isn't just rebelling against industry , but against society could bring such industry existence . film subversive nature goes so far , it reverses assumed creative restrictions , way comparable " dogme " -filmmaking 90s .

when fantasia came out 1938 , it bombed . many years later , movie received acclaim it deserved . fantasia enchanted me since i child , i eagerly awaited fantasia 2000 . possibilities ! i sure disney would come up something rival original . what i saw humorless , boring mish-mash only few bright spots . opening segment whales flying through space embarrassingly bad . silly flamingos also fell flat . donald duck noah terrific . gershwin piece ok , but not fantasia . what should crowning achievement , forest nymph battling save her beloved forest , predictable stale . this film almost complete waste my time money . i heartily , heartily , endorse orginal fantasia timeless classic all ages	-1
i say , it took me while getting around seeing this . i thought " silence lambs " good - it featured great performance anthony hopkins , rest it .... good . but it , far i concerned . it just didn't really click me , it wasn't anything near great movie i'd hoping , so when its sequel released i didn't feel any great need rush out get it soon it released . bit surprisingly though , i thought " hannibal " really great once i finally see it . everyone said it more geared toward horror than " silence ... " ( which fine me ) it may , marginally . but much more than , it just better horror movie than its predecessor , it also better thriller better drama movie , my opinion . hopkins just good , if not better , than he dr. hannibal lecter first time around , while i usually don't like recasting roles movie ( unless actor or actress playing creature or monster or something where you don't see their real face or hear their real voice , even there they sometimes end up getting mannerisms wrong ) julianne moore great job stepping into clarice starling role originally played jodie foster . movie centers around hunt find lecter only victim his original , pre-incarceration , carnage survive - thoroughly despicable pedophile who avoided ever charged his crimes cutting deal prosecutors give evidence against lecter . it seems like " hannibal " changed tract " silence " implying most if not all lecter victims may horrendous individuals who some way brought his wrath down upon themselves . whether that truth or whether it just this one victim who so reprehensible , effect create foil hannibal who even more evil than he . hannibal lecter himself , well , he not ' good guy ' this movie ; he , though , presented very cryptic shades grey . his behaviors contradict one but so way feels real , he much more interesting character this time around . clarice also ; she comes across here character who somehow traumatized , perhaps even mentally unbalanced , deep down but supresses it so well it took genius like lecter ever see it , that what so intrigued him first place . one possible interpretation things overall ( this just one many potential takes it ; movie briefly subtly hints so many different things you could take away just anything it - making it great source conversation movie-lovers ) hannibal lecter person who had/has potential great goodness within himself but chose evil , while clarice starling potential great darkness hannibal-level violence her , but chose good , chose fact make her career opposing those who give same darkness . lot food thought this one ( no pun intended ) . great performances all around ; notable addition hopkins moore brilliant gary oldman plays lecter nemesis chronically overlooked under-rated ray liotta plays unlikable , rather creepy fbi agent who constantly odds starling . very , very engaging wel-made movie	-1

this movie funniest sight gags movies i've seen past . this movies plot isn't confusing people may think , because jim abrahams ( director ) always made sense all his movies . movie starts off anthony ( i forgot his last name , narrorator movie ) how mafia hussled people their money casinos around las vegas . it shows games casino people played where " you possibly couldn't win " , that how they became rich . then you go back time sicily 1901 shows how vincenzo , anthony father , grew up how he became part mafia . after vincenzo found out package he delivering , containing cocaine , supposed given gangster his father worked , he chased became wanted person . he separated his mother after friends his family hid im butt donkey during escape gangsters chasing after him . he swam across ocean arrived new york . that how movie became what it . this movie basically sight comedy , fart jokes get old , but this movie leave you laughing till end . i suprised this movie didn't leslie nielsen . i look this movie think myself " if this movie this hilarious without leslie nielsen , thin how much funnier it would've him .

this movie still rocks after all these years since it first came out . excellent energetic movie start . plot cutesy . it serves vehicle wonderful selection songs dance sequences . however , i think this version movie missing few scenes ? i would rate this movie version 5 stars it unedited me . if memory serves me , didn't alex receive letter her friend , hannah , when alex discovered hannah passed away ? isn't there reconnection end mickey alex ( girl)friend whom latter dating ? wasn't there more story build-up alex her boss ? if this version cut anyway , i prefer getting complete unedited version . i find this version incomplete somehow . but jennifer beals looks terrific one wonders why she didn't star more movies her generation	-1

while average movie watcher may not recognize name betsy russell ( private school , cheerleader camp ) , those us males who grew up 1980s , weaned hours dedicated cable viewing , know her something akin goddess world dumb , teen comedies basically two reasons ... she one fine babe , she didn't seem mind showing some skinage , evident film tomboy ( 1985 ) , among others . originally released crown international pictures , film directed herb freed ( graduation day , survival game ) stars , i mentioned , ms. russell . also appearing gerard christopher ( " superboy " ) , kristi somers ( hardbodies ) , richard erdman ( blue gardenia ) , late eric douglas ( flamingo kid ) , youngest son actor kirk douglas . russell plays tomasina `tommy ' boyd , tomboy through through who spends her days working cars , shooting hoops boys , riding her motorcycle . after fairly schmaltzy pointless opening sequence showing tommy girl , playing baseball boys , scoring run , ultimately hugging her father ( who apparently astronaut air force ) , all slow motion montage form , we're now present tommy rises bed proceeds shower ... some skin but no goodies ... yet ... man , you wouldn't think you could jealous sponge ... anyway , tommy works mechanic chester garage , dumpy filling station where she often visited her girly girl friend seville ( somers ) , aspiring broadway dancer who seems little problem sleazing her way up ladder success , evident later film . after witnessing dance audition seville her troupe , one performed some potential financial backers ( surprisingly enough they declined investing seville her rotten routine ) , we're back garage big time stock car driver/professional pretty boy randy starr ( christopher ) , who tommy got serious crush ... seems randy hired local rich infinitely sleazy dink named ernie leeds , jr. race him , randy offers tommy invitation come leeds ' house check out his boss stock car . after this we see seville auditioning donut commercial , whoring it up good , followed tommy seville heading leeds ' house where tommy randy race around motocross bikes ( one point tommy crashes swampy morass , resulting her revealing her tommy `guns , if only get out her wet clothes ... hootchie mama ! ) . following this there party sequence leeds ' house ( parachute pants far eye see ) , tommy randy hook up , evident overly long montage sequence featuring pair engaging all sorts outdoor activities , but eventually they falling out tommy shows randy up race track while important sponsor attendance , result pair deciding race each other settle once all who best driver ... while tomboy pure 1980s teenage hokum through through , it fairs better than its counterparts based solely presence betsy russell her generous `assets ' , her willingness put them display . movie itself actually played like one , long series mentos commercials . one example this early tommy riding her motorcycle work she stops off engage game basketball some local chumps . through bit creative editing russell makes all her shots , but then here kicker ... she leaving , she climbs aboard her motorcycle one dudes tosses her ball . she catches it one hand , puts it up , swoosh ! it goes ... she drives off yahoos begin high fivin ' each other , apparently overjoyed fact they've just emasculated losing girl their own sport . i learn lot things this film , including following ... 1 . i'd give my left gonasticle betsy russell loofa . 2 . pretentious , forgettable pop songs 1980s , often featured films like this , generally included meaningless lyrics like `you got magic , i got fire ' . 3 . nothing gets women hotter than chasing them around town your muscle car , throwing constant barrage catcalls their direction . 4 . when sign warns `severe tire damage ' , they ain't kidding . 5 . untalented bimbos could manage find success given their willingness whore it up . 6 . someone other than jimmy `j . . ' walker actually used phrase `dy-no-mite!' 1980s . 7 . when doing television commercial donuts performers actually get paid donuts . 8 . goofy , slow motion montages great way pad out film . 9 . when waiting woman meet you date it probably not good idea let her walk you while you're watching porn she'll think you're some kind skeevy perv . 10 . apparently , world stock car racing , slapping jet engine onto your vehicle isn't considered illegal modification . performances passable movie like this ( although idea betsy russell tomboy seemed bit farfetched ) , but writing pretty lousy ( this one predictable they come ) . i seriously doubt anyone sitting edge their seat end this one , wondering if plucky tommy would beat arrogant randy race , thus validating tommy belief woman anything well man . i love these kinds films , though , they take superficial mask female empowerment while passing copious amounts nekkid female flesh ( russell character only female came off remotely decent here ) . i gag little some schmaltz-laden montages but overall , i'd say this entertaining , three star ( out five ) feature , extra star thrown ms. russell . picture quality this bci dvd release , presented widescreen ( 1.85 : 1 ) , looks pretty decent , dolby digital stereo audio comes through well enough . there aren't any extras , except few trailers some other bci dvd releases their crown international classics ( i wouldn't necessarily refer some many them `classics ' ) series including hunk ( 1987 ) , beach girls ( 1982 ) , jocks ( 1987 ) , my chauffer ( 1986 ) . cookieman108	-1

i am continually impressed movies mexico . these movies spun around very simple close-to-life stories , but superlative acting , cinematography , background score direction makes them extremely interesting , intriguing , thought-provoking entertaining . story starts grandpa rodrigo birthday reluctant gathering family members . his daughter , two sons two diagonally opposite cousins ( roco rodrigo ) . tense volatile atmosphere dinner table quickly erupts into heated dialog ( over grandpa rodrigo son marriage young demure girl ) . predictably , grandpa rodrigo massive heart-attack he passes away . without much delay , his read inheritance distributed . amidst all materialistic distribution , nobody seems pay much attention grandpa wish his ashes submerged sea acapulco . days , his ashes lay golden urn . flustered everyone nonchalant behavior , roco grabs urn starts heading towards acapulco vintage mercedes . vintage , however , inheritance gift rodrigo jr.

you know , criterion collection long leader providing classic films best possible condition , first laserdisc later dvd . when it comes film restoration , they're certainly among best companies out there . yet , it my feeling company largely unknown outside relatively small but dedicated group film enthusiasts , whose passion art cinema equals criterion . well , , plus fact company largely focused their attention foreign films mainstream moviegoing public never heard . sure , there exceptions , such their first-class hitchock releases ( notorious , spellbound , rebecca few others ); bona-fide classics like spartacus , stones ' gimme shelter ; few oddball modern choices : royal tennenbaums , armageddon (?) , rock (??) . which why i so happy find couple cult sci-fi films their catalog few years back . both original version blob ( 1958 ) , sorely underrated fiend without face filled me hope maybe , just maybe , these folks capable something more . fact , trailers all four films this collection included bonus materials fiend . now , films themselves : haunted strangler corridors blood vehicles boris karloff , who his sixties when they made . he many times before ( would continue ) , karloff plays mad doctor-type . corridors better two , young christopher lee supporting role ruthless killer . neither film could really called " classic , " but both solid , low-budget chillers fans karloff and/or lee enjoy . atomic submarine more straight sci-fi adventure story , title vehicle facing off against underwater ufo . again , this " " picture all way , but it retains some charm spite overuse newsreel footage . first man into space treads more familiar territory , organism space inhabits body astronaut . thing craves blood , so you guess what happens next . not bad little film , but probably least bunch . i applaud criterion making these films available pristine condition . i'm sure there audience more same type films . only downfall this collection -- all criterion discs -- price .	-1

sometimes there seems no rhyme or reason combinations movies they come up these 2-packs but " mullholland drive " " swimming pool " they came up quirky combo . if you not like david lynch those who make movies mold then you should know going just avoid these two . but if you like quirky films force you think figure out what hell just happened movie , then this well-suited pair . " mulholland drive " written directed david lynch certainly more style than substance , lynch creating his more surrealistic film yet . there might those who think this some sort film noir because there scene where couple hard-boiled cops show up spout film noir type dialogue . but there bits pieces different film genres throughout film , which clue tapestry lynch tale . when second main character drama , betty ( naomi watts ) , gets off plane hollywood ready pursue her quest become star , it never dawned me there more kindly old couple wishes her well drive off limosine . betty moves into apartment , only discover rita , who apparently suffered amnesia after her near death experiences , taking shower . betty canada , so she opts helping rita rather than calling police . two become friends more than friends couple best sex scenes seen movie last decade ( they also serve underscore how unsexy most sex scenes movies today ) . " mulholland drive " movie hollywood , or more appropriately dream hollywood . it means something rita , who remember her real name , pulls one she uses movie poster " gilda . " betty plucky young kids sticks who wants star . unwritten rule such people they would anything achieve their dream sense lynch film just flips dream over looks nightmare side equation . however , i no problem idea many those who watch this film " muholland drive " not come close making sense them until second time they see it many those people not going make effort . those us who seen lynch other films , most notably " eraserhead " " blue velvet , " we knew going probably going necessary . i mean , come . this david lynch people . what you expect ? " swimming pool , " i would say it more sensual than it erotic , although ultimately nudity this film secondary story . sarah morton ( charlotte rampling ) british writer crime fiction who apparently find no joy her writing , her popularity , her publisher , or any idea any other writer might writing something worth reading well . everyone waiting next installment her detective she uninspired . so her publisher ( charles dance ) offers her use his villa france place where she retreat come up new book . once there sarah explores house , taking notice leaf covered swimming pool back . she also begins write , although we no idea what she writing , sarah seems productive happy . then julie ( ludivine sagnier ) , daughter her publisher shows up unexpected guest . not only because sarah assumed she would alone , but because she not know he daughter . if anything , sarah waiting him show up so she get little relaxation her rest . instead julie shows up violates not only sarah privacy but here sense propriety . julie tends walk around topless pool apparently shows no sense discrimination bringing home men sleep . we know sarah disapproves such practices , but this not stop her watching julie , whether she swimming villa pool or making love some strange man . it then becomes clear not only julie becoming part sarah novel , but something going happen . " swimming pool " usually described thriller , but strikes me off mark . it more mystery , but subtle way , which explains why it difficult talk director fran�ois ozon film without giving away too much . this sort film where you going go back least watch end film again , if not entire thing start finish ( just like " mulholland drive " ) , make sure you understand what happened . what helped me out untangling this film most it i kept asking what sarah writing . there clearly connection what happening what sarah writing , but i kept waiting ozon show us what , which , end , only goes show how much i fooled this film . this regard film ends up surprising rather than shocking , keeping subtlety sensuality film . although they both quirky films they certainly odd decidedly different ways it interesting see which these two you end up preferring . last piece advice not watch them same week ( watching them back back would incredibly weird things your brain ) .	-1

premise this movie competent but quiet unexciting accountant ( pignon ) getting fired no particular reason except someone go he considered expendable , something zero eyes his employer coworkers . opening scene says it all when he willingly omitted annual company photo staff : he not missed anyone . pignon very depressed considering ending it all when his new neighbor adjoining balcony intervenes . neighbor idea help him : he should pretend he gay then his employer too concerned " correctness " fire him -- they'll bend over backwards pretend they're not prejudiced . neighbor ( retired industrial psychologist ) doctors up some photos head accountant ( pignon ) bodies some gays entering gay night club . these sent anonymously pignon boss , quickly photocopied spread throughout company . president quickly decides it would very bad strategy fire pignon , because these days , they wouldn't want alienate gay market , particularly since they make condoms . it sounds like thin one-joke movie , but actors good enough it quite amusing doesn't drag . gerard depardieu ( very funny guy ) plays santini , captain company rugby team who aggressively heterosexual makes disparaging remarks gays constantly . he warned he better buddy up pignon ( coworkers who basically playing joke him ) or else he'll get fired . subplots involve pignon relationship his ex-wife estranged son . there very funny scene pignon gay pride parade . whole film made less obnoxious episode involving gay-bashing ( violent ) makes it clear subject really rather serious , even if film funny .	-1

chinatown shows up top five all-time films so many people , it probably difficult say what it exactly people find so wonderful it . absolute magnetism deft performance its emerging star , jack nicholson , no doubt one its stronger assets . while story brilliantly unique quite interesting , it not exciting , per se ; it dutifully structured detective genre , aside occasional outburst violence , rather quiet cerebral . screenwriter storyteller robert towne scenes dialogue spare but sparkling , cinematography film editing . perhaps its greatest asset its director , roman polanski who , his art set directors , magically re-creates los angeles it 30 . whether staging scenes against bleached white adobe , palm-lined street twilight , or office bathed venetian blind shadows , polanski gets perfect , painterly shot every frame . he effortlessly guides all his actors -- lead supporting alike -- subtle , but heartfelt performances . this one those movies where actors seem believe they themselves time place they actually characters they portraying . add all this moody , evocative score its unforgettable love theme suddenly economical becomes expansive , filling screen dazzling movie-making its best . devastatingly powerful last scene screen legend , rivalled , perhaps , only casablanca .	1

i remember how movie hit me when it first released . i not yet 30 , fairly recently married myself , pretty relentless seeing every new non-traditional american movie i could . mazursky personal favourite , especially bob carol , next stop blume love . he telling stories no one else dared tell -- no cross-country mythic hippes , no foul tongue-lashing nicholson vehicle , not even fonda ( jane ) showing just how sexy glum . jill clayburgh perfectly suited era -- attractive without wondrous , teeth imperfect shown up close without apology , dancing her panties ( clayburgh signature would later become tedious ) -- most all her genuine humanity , self-deprecating manner heartbreaking vulnerability . she both movie star clean normal , same time . looking film now , it fascinating try distinguishing whether its original power any currency . i showed film college class first-year students , all women coincidence , they split -- many thought it coy many others startled greater power this film over sex city -- what emerged seminar , what i think sets this movie apart " its time nothing more " , women film viewed mature ( good way ) , searching human beings , while quartet gals sex city seen desperately clinging their notions youth exclusion their own deeper needs desires . class really taken aback when they realized women mazursky film same age samantha , carrie co . , alone , makes " unmarried woman " worth adding important film lists	1

this very good movie i watched my " horror classics collection : 50 pack " ( asin : b0001hagtm ) i got amazon ( under $20.00 ! ) . so first off , i would recommend buying 50 pack where you get 2 other vincent price movies ( bat last man earth ) 47 other good movies almost same price buying this movie itself . far this movie goes , there few suspenseful parts you wonder what going happen . mainly , movie give you some memorable quotes , vincent price always deliver great voice his . all characters good job acting ( typist great scream ! ) . some parts seem bit unbelievable some questions don't seem get answered , but who really cares ? only 75 minutes long , this movie better than most horror movies come out today unoriginal go shock value . so while this might more murder mystery than " horror " movie , it worth watch you'll satisfied end ... unless course , you not like black white movies , if case , then you probably wouldn't reading this review . p.s. i love gary . taylor review when he says : " price plays it slightly prissy , very high-camp manner tremendous dose black humor which he so famous . " that so true	-1
acting especially leads ( moon so-ri sol kyung-gu ) fantastic ; moon performance convinced me she truly disabled . also , pace felt faster than it actually . beautiful cinematography , like so many korean films . i saw this seoul when it opened , two native korean friends who also loved it . while i remain little ambivalent how so many acclaimed korean dramas portray rape , this film able make protagonists ' disabilities secondary plot not focus . sometimes difficult watch , this movie wouldn't made hollywood , it definitely worth watching	1
edges lord received very little publicity when it released , american release went straight dvd . yet this film demands watching more than once . haley joel osment gives possibly his best performance ever , says lot considering his outstanding efforts sixth sense , pay it forward , a.i. , second hand lions . he portrays young jewish boy poland during nazi occupation , who sent live catholic family rural poland , where he must pose catholic order survive . only person , besides family he living , who knows his true identity , village priest played william dafoe who gives understated yet excellent performance . drama intense throughout , but it builds even more intense climax . all children movie give remarkable performances which further serve show true nature what it like live under nazi occupation whether jew or christian . this movie not missed , it movie should watched together families children above age 1	1

poster owen coughlan pretty much said it all , but it warrants seconded . taking purely subjective approach - concentrating those genres , films amp ; filmmakers which hold special significance him - martin scorsese makes not only these subjects live breathe , but captures entire history american film manner informs , excites even inflames viewer measure scorsese own archivist passion medium . his refusal tout his own body work , soft-pedaling impressive filmography anyone assembled , order keep focus men women who sculpted built artform first seduced him wide-eyed four-year-old both touching typical scorsese reverence his forebears . many lesser-known neglected films sampled here serve dual purpose : one , dowsing rods pointing worthwhile movies left off general-consensus , afi-type lists ; secondly , reminders we've all seen extraordinary films dismissed or ignored critics , public , even ourselves earlier points . you'll finish watching this great doc champing bit go rent roaring 20s phenix city story sure , but you'll also want begin your own voyage rediscovery through 100 years movie history wide eyes seeing new exotic old once-familiar . can't ask more than any historical documentary - well , i'd've loved this even more twice length , but let not get greedy ..	1

rule #1 gothic film criticism : products hollywood ( this year disgrace 2006 ) absolute tripe -- worthless or less than worthless . it should therefore come no surprise best lycanthrope movies recent times both foreign : british-luxembourg production " dog soldiers " canadian gem " ginger snaps . " differences two films striking ; while " dog soldiers " focuses very manly men encountering werewolves scottish highlands , " ginger snaps " concerns two teenage sisters , one whom metamorphosing into werewolf . first film inevitably recalls " night living dead " inasmuch title soldiers barricade themselves farmhouse withstand lycanthropes ' onslaught . " ginger snaps , " however , calls mind depalma " carrie " associating onset menstruation dark supernatural forces . both films share common bond extraordinary imagination -- both present very appealing/magnetic characters facing most horrific situations . all working-class infantrymen " dog soldiers " portrayed sympathetically , yet without sentimentality : they true iron men -- " balls british steel " -- unable destroy their supernatural opponents , but capable looking death straight eye while going down fighting . samurai ! girls " ginger snaps " comparably impressive : suburban goths , they obsessed idea violent , indeed gruesome death . furthermore , title character ( acted superbly katharine isabelle ) superior -- gifted cynical insight into world , insight which seems far beyond her years apparent experience . effect , she visual verbal artist cruelly destined slow transformation into four-footed monstrosity ! much victim predator , she seems more ambiguous figure than heroic warriors " dog soldiers . " nevertheless , she never loses one interest or sympathy ; even monster , she least avoids banality she spent her life loathing . despair mingled delirium becomes dominant mood " ginger snaps . " thus one point ginger imagines herself " force nature " ; but minutes later , her sensuous beauty takes grotesque turn , pathetically she asks her sister brigitte " what am i ? " contrast , keynote " dog soldiers " exhilaration -- joy battle , however futile battle may seem . despite apparent differences tone , both movies converge masterpieces nightmarish vision -- wonderfully crafted , yet bristling expressive energy ; respect , fierce emotional interplay charismatic ginger more withdrawn , sensitive brigitte simply unequaled . horror just doesn't come more convincing or compelling shape than " ginger snaps .

" mississippi mermaid " early francois truffaut film , if it looks familiar -- it may you've seen " original sin " -- angelina jolie/antonio banderas remake film . louis mahe ( jean-paul belmondo ) plays wealthy factory owner who lives small island , reunion , near africa . beginning film , louis eagerly expecting arrival his mail-order bride . photo hand , he impatiently waits her arrive , when he confronted julie roussel ( catherine deneuve ) who not woman photo , he happily swallows story she sent him photo someone else -- after all , they both engaged minor deceits during their courtship mail , so he overlooks warning signals marries her anyway . soon , louis becomes suspicious his new bride real identity , but he continues elect acceptance . however , when he receives letter julie sister demanding know why she hasn't heard julie , he forced confront julie . julie promptly cleans out joint bank account disappears ... i never fan jean-paul belmondo . however , this film , his facial expressions extremely impressive , i began see perhaps i overlooked him past . catherine deneuve plays chilling julie roussel/marion vergano . beginning film , deneuve plays demure julie , but when persona julie dumped , deneuve assumes identity marion , ice queen emerges . whereas angelina played julie/marion role sizzling passion , deneuve icy , controlling evil . however , this precise reason it difficult understand why mahe continued adore julie/marion . partnership hell theory just doesn't hold on-screen relationship mahe marion -- there wasn't enough sexual chemistry explain it . perhaps it can't helped given age film , but denueve manage two topless scenes -- one which almost causes car acciden t.t he film dated . airplane travel scenes tedious . when it time action , camera just speeds up , effect preposterous . however , " mississippi mermaid " well worth look if you die-hard fan either french cinema or catherine deneuve -- displacedhuma	-1

mccabe mrs. miller often talked one list director robert altman seventies films takes cinematic genre ( namely western ) subverts it point making it seem like attack its cinematic precedents . traditional western gung-ho heroism nowhere evidence , it seems , mccabe mere parody hero director invites audience laugh . if this case , than mccabe mrs. miller would , best , looked upon satirical look-back cinematic tastes fifties . self-congratulatory " how far we've come ... " negation western romance favour neo-realist version west populated cast ambiguous charaters anything but heroic . if altman " long goodbye " transported hopelessly out-of-date phillip marlowe into californian seventies than " mccabe mrs. miller " inverts this transposes typically indecisive modern man(californian or otherwise ) into context mythical west . but this both " mccabe mrs. miller " it western precedents disservice . film works best not suberversion genre , which end just satire , but subervsion or , more correctly , deconstruction myth ( regardless individual singular genre ) which much grander . if elements subverting western seem implicit this than it true point pre-conceived notions archetypal western hero would ignoring moral complexities john wayne character " searchers " or william holden " wild bunch " , name couple.at outset , we presented figure mccabe , newly entered into presbyterian church society . brash , intent playing cards buying rounds , impression bravura western confidence we solidified circulating rumour his killing man days gone . skip film end our initial impressions justified . myth confirmed flourished ready continue.it movie middle acts where myth subverted . warren beatty exceptional indecisive businessman whose assertiveness whittled away scene . not any western since " johnny guitar " female taken such authoritive role julie christy here . she decidedly dominant partner , both their business their relationship . decidedly , this subversion but it film focus business relationships which ultimately makes it more . when it comes point where character asserts mccabe never killed man , audience accord . yet , myth comes . it all stronger more romantic its rooted work-a-day realities . this , it much comment art it western little ultra-realism . there myth its own making myth altman vilmos zsigmond stunning cinematography realize this beautifully here .

shakespeare much ado nothing my first shakespeare play , read or studied , no means i disappointed . i enjoyed humor , mistaken identities , sense foolishness love . shakespeare comedy although written several years ago still proves relevant today . his use love crazy things people find it , once found keep it , always prove timeless message . shakespeare mainly communicates how foolish deliberate people act when they find themselves love . title also elaborates fact people spend entirely too much time worrying nothing . characters become enthralled present ignore future reality their circumstances . many characters also develop sense selfishness when asked choose themselves or any one else . later story we see benedick choose love over himself his characters changes softens through his own confused heart . character don john tries stir up trouble soon married claudio hero . through cleverly thought out mistaken identity infatuated pair soon dwindle public disgrace , only found innocent end . after this action occurred beatrice tells benedick she would like see his friend claudio dead what he her cousin . benedick chooses women he loves over friend he knows . although benedick not kill claudio he still made this agreement his heart betray him . amusing aspect play constant changing relationship beatrice benedick . we first find them deeply involved their continuous war words . soon these two bickering characters find love through fight through constant misunderstanding these characters display hopeful love one . however , reader left questioning whether or not this love true . one my favorite scenes takes place orchard when claudio , don pedro , leonato plan trick attentively listening benedick . knowing he only feet away , behind bushes , shakespeare writing pokes fun his feelings future desires beatrice . i love humor way their one conversation alters benedick choices . important comic relief character would dogsberry his trusty assistant verges . usage malapropism adds humor story it message unable matched any other character . shakespeare making point characters this story illustrating their obsession hear now instead looking grand picture their situations . he showing his readers not take life or your relationships too seriously . aspect this play posed point went equally previous lesson crazy things people love . characters this story often would just pick up anything person they felt they loved ., flip side would just quickly forget person . example these actions when claudio hero their misunderstanding claudio shamed her front their town what he understood betrayal . immediacy actions urgency reason all often compromised characters their emotions . much ado nothing refreshing comedy light , but also significant meaning . shakespeare truly captures mind humans seeking love crazy world . play proves relevant although language may different story not unlike our society today . i would absolutely recommend this play anyone looking watch humorous love story unfold before them . i very much enjoyed reading shakespeare cleverly envelops his reader into story crazy characters their crazier reactions love misunderstandings . i so much fun watching this play performed seeing genius unfold shakespeare intended us all see . this play not soon nor easily forgotten generations come . i'm so happy opened its cover now hold it my bookshelf .	1
i am generous giving this film two stars . i saw trailer it , while it looked intriguing , looks deceiving , much like bulk this would-be psychological potboiler . i think photography work acting deserve minimum two stars both excellent ; general storyline , however , drivel . many reviewers noted how film fundamentally makes no sense , there parts where i agree wholeheartedly . i don't mind thought-provoking films leave you wondering what actually happened , but this mostly shallow end standpoint plot construction . it inconceivable me how two female leads ( charlotte rampling , ludivine sagnier ) could tolerate one ; further , it incomprehensible why rampling didn't merely leave france when sagnier started making her life miserable . believe rampling would actually help sagnier conceal murder impossible . yes , i know entire character daughter ambiguous end , but inasmuch character constructed rampling mind murderess negates charges cinematic intellectual superiority holds rampling judgment suspec t.t he entire movie filled characters excruciating watch , only real reason two star rating actors outstanding job their roles . i considered briefly watching film second time make sure i understood all nuances , but i just hated it too much first time give it second chance . this one film looks positively great two minute theatrical trailer , but looks positively awful light day hulking 103 minute feature . i am very open-minded unusual , imported , avant-garde films , but while this movie touches all three , i merely relieved when it over .	-1

matthew bourne version nutcracker storyline begins victorian orphanage , where dr. dross ( drosselmeyer traditional version ) his wife portrayed pompous meanies who intimidate kids . further contrasting original , dross children ungrateful , spoiled brats , act true form during their visit orphanage . governors arrive inspect ward , but there more bickering than revelry , presents they've brought children get taken away soon " festivity " ( read commotion ) over . come bedtime , clara dreams nutcracker doll ( who dead ringer puppet howdy doody show ; hilarious ! ) comes life , breaks apart walls orphanage , whisks her away snowy paradise . second act takes us " sweetieland , " where everything ( everyone , apparently ) made candy . when clara falls love nutcracker prince , love triangle (!) results when sugar plum fairy also makes overtures prince . after requisite series theme dances we're back orphanage , where clara wakes up discover her " prince " actually one boys ward . unique mix characters storyline held my attention throughout , help original tchaikovsky score enabled me keep my bearings beginning end ( i.e. , " so this music occurs when this character . . . " ) . more one familiar traditional nutcracker story , easier it make leap into mr. bourne fantasy , comparisons this original interpretations more interesting enlightening . [ i would definitely not recommend this anyone first viewing nutcracker]the dancers/actors display over-emoted gestures facial expressions , but this necessary convey much more comical spirited production ( performance filmed before live audience ) . expected , choreography also strays traditional , incorporating mix modern dance , swing , even folkloric elements . i like this lot . you see hint more traditional ballet steps , although , without pointe shoes " ballerinas " more free execute diversity movement . choreography amazingly tight , even curtain call cast taking positions cue . costumes anything but traditional , ranging dull , threadbare orphanage clothing wild , feathery , colorful ( pink dominates ) outfits sweetieland . some clever elements incorporated into mr. bourne storyline allusions movies ( " one flew over cuckoo nest " one ) some bits playful sexual innuendo-sweetieland characters licking each other well candy ( children likely remain unaffected ) . also , ending dance suite involves many highly self-absorbed personas who , when not watching themselves mirrors , seem playing out game one-upmanship dance dance . very fun watch . sound quality fantastic : clear , bright , well balanced . camera work made excellent use both traditional oblique-angle perspectives , but many instances image framing where performers cut off waist ( my pet peeve ) , thus depriving viewer some excellent footwork body language . run time 80+ minutes zipped pretty quickly , i would enjoyed seeing some scenes played out little longer . still , it good show , i'd recommend this performance anyone but firs t-t ime nutcracker viewers or ballet traditionalists	-1
i started watch eternal " sunshine spotless mind " , after first 15 minutes i realized i could not turn it off drive work ( which i supposed ) . i what jim kerry character joel - i called my boss left her message i would late . i stayed home i watched film . i cried , i laughed , i sighed , i felt - i lived through it . there not so many films we don't just watch but live through - me , esotsm . finally , charlie kaufman film i absolutely love . " john malkovich " amused me ; " adaptation " irritated me - too much charlie there my taste even if he looked like nic cage . " eternal sunshine ... " kaufman masterpiece relationships , memories , reality , intolerance , impatience , inability listen others , understand them . how easy it insult one you love most . how difficult it forgive yourself . how often we rely modern technology fix our inner problems . how seldom we realize painful happy memories go together . you not get rid ones keep others . it may not best romance film ever but it damn close . it tender poignant valentine card kaufman sent all us - remind us love exists , relationships survive , even if they die , we memories them , nobody or nothing take our memories us . it just coincidence kaufman references second time tragic great love eloisa abelard his works ? i applaud michel gondry his brilliant directing ; supporting cast , including tom wilkinson , mark ruffalo , kirsten dunst . jim carrey kate winslet played their best roles ever i hope see carrey more often dramatic performances . but beginning everything there word - without kaufman screenplay film would not happened . thank you , charlie .	1

fan zombie movies someone who enjoyed city living dead zombie , i very disappointed house cemetery . fulci manages create good mystery first two-thirds movie , only squander it some poorly executed scare scenes . house cemetery researcher ( whose work never specified ) who moves his wife his kid into house massachussets order finish out work colleague who killed himself his mistress . titular house only place they really find moment , so dr. boyle , his wife lucy their son bob move despite lot bad signs , like boarded-up door cellar tombstone dr. jacob tess freudstein front hall . bob little red-headed girl friend who keeps warning him how bad house ( though no one else sees her ) . furthermore , people keep claiming dr. boyle town before non-existent daughter ( which he denies , not totally convincingly ) . he also seems some secret relationship babysitter , anne , who starts unboarding cellar door middle night . lucy seems either recovering or suffering serious psychological issues . got ? good , because half stuff never gets explained . only things get worked out little red-headed girl identity identity killer ( neither which hard figure out ) . there some nice visual moments earlier parts film ( fact killer one normal hand one rotting hand , photograph changes each viewing , mannequin gets beheaded starts bleeding ) but fulci ability handle gore moments disappoints . he lingers too long over some deaths , makes killer so ridiculously slow snail could outrun him bits like babysitter head falling down stairs come off funny rather than scary . compared injury eye scene zombie or christopher george chopping through coffin cotld , dr. boyle chopping through door around his son head feels like self-parody . fulci other films incoherent plots , but rarely way seems work against plot ( dream-like nature city living dead seems appropriate given prophetic dream heroine gets mystical nature threat ) execution setpieces usually fantastic . house cemetery neither thing working its favor . it not hell living dead-level bad , but fact it some genuinely good acting ( especially paolo malco , who plays dr. boyle ) interesting set-up almost make flaws worse . also , this version " never before seen deleted scene " , but it no sound just extended reaction shot after bat attack	-1
there seems several films regarding this one . story corruption property deals , story fathers their children , tentative romeo juliet romance course martial arts guns . those who like cross-culture , " romeo must die " , you ! jet li who fresh " lethal weapon 4 " really delivers this action-packed movie . playing han big one him . aaliyah(1979-2001 ) , rb sensation really got her acting chops gear playing alluring trish o'day , who shadowed bumbling maurice , played funny , anthony anderson , but i personally would hoped more michael wong less anthony anderson ( his constant ' dim sum ' refrain quite irritating ) but actors act , plot moves film enjoyable enough . i'd enjoyed x-ray effects movie whenever fight going happen . i liked part when han refused fight woman , he used trish fight her . it looked more swing dance me . since trish words backed him up , enemy impaled through heart . after final fight , trish father ( delroy lindo ) , wanted meet han himself , i ' glad he got chance , i think it silly him demand handshake him , but hey , he wanted who " cat " , make sure he . han never declined any offer only know who troublemaker behind " war " . before anyone remember seeing aaliyah " queen damned " ( which i personal dislike ) , look into this film first . i love jet li , but this film not good ' kiss dragon ' but better than ' one ' ' cradle 2 grave ' but inferior jet li hong kong movies .	-1

i liked this movie lot better first time i saw it ...... when it called " star wars " . i really liked scene where eragon looking off into sunset . boy , how original . i haven't read eldest , but i'm assuming princess eragon sister . this correct ? i wondering when han solo going show up , then course he . i also like scene where eragon take detour go cloud city rescue princess . then she tells him its trap . i expecting villian say , " magic strong you , eragon , but you're not dragon rider yet . " i hear writer only 16 when he wrote this . big deal . lot aspiring novelists writing stuff 16 . it never gets published reason . their brains not fully developed , they don't enough life experience absorb their influences reshape them into something original . i think this definately case here . mozart wrote his first symphony 5 years old . we never hear one , though , we ? way , aragon one main characters lord rings . its like this kid isn't even trying original . changing first letter , but leaving name phonetically identical not original	-1

i my little pony fan since they first came out 80 . i collecting newest generation ponies mlp-themed merchandise add my old collection . i all cartoons movies so far g3 , first few quite corny imho , but they got progressively better . princess promenade good story line kept even me ( 26-year-old woman lol ) interested see what happens next . animation quality well-done ( except expected little mistakes here there ) songs not annoying like most other cartoon singing , characters very likeable . only thing still lacking g3 movies some kind enemy . my favorite episodes 80 pilot special which very well-done bad guys while still not ' violent ' . i think adding few darker characters would add alot contrast interest storylines . one thing disappointed me princess promenade ' spike dragon ' . i remember spike 80 cute , scruffy-voiced baby dragon such great character him . i not like way he drawn this film , or his ' proper ' personality . i miss good ol ' 80s spike . so why i gave it 4 instead 5- spike favorite character mine old cartoons , it upsetting see how they changed him . but it still great film , those who new mlp wont notice or care change . previous g3 film ' very minty christmas ' also very cute , so check out well . i look forward next film when we finally unicorns- especially since probably means there'll unicorn mlp toys released well !	-1
actually paid good money see this local cinema ! went good friend who real fan stokers novel , before i even got say word she already asked , " what hell we just watch , because it wasn`t dracula !

world war ii , channel islands taken over nazis people who'd lived island before then pretty much left their own devices . they didn't military protection because it wasn't priority send forces protect one island . inhabitants basically two choices : stay or go ( evacuate ) . series open , you see families faced reality these tough decisions . some ( most ) send their children away " put up " other families . some adults leave well , including jewish shopowners who simply hand over their keys trusted friends who remain behind island . some cases , husbands wives separated there other scenes parents standing dock , watching their children hauled off what seem very small boats ( my heart my throat watching those scenes ) . i found all this fascinating , relating wholly dilemna families who stay or go , deal indignity taken over country - or pain leaving it all behind , not knowing if when you'd see your home again or what would left when you returned . all this builds up actual occupation island , which starts out bloody massacre docks , planes flying overhead strafing innocent people then ... strange calm after ( awhile anyway ) . there forced politeness german officers met political officials island but animosity mistrust both sides clear . things move fairly slowly after germans arrive , building tension bit bit . alliances formed some germans families but , other cases , divisions cause painful repercussions . movie focuses primarily few families this allows close-up view what they may encountered . one couple strained marriage tensions rachet up during occupation -but they also , times , see each other new eyes . mostly , though , this film reveals how " fuzzy " things truly become during war , how morality twisted values changed ... or how some people rise occasion become better . there isn't false note this one . my only quibble ( it minor ) some parts seemed overly long , some dry spells events . but overall this movie fascinating i learned something part history which i really knew very little . i'm grateful i got opportunity so .	-1

both sets reviewed many times so i am making mine short point . vol . i ii both thematic ( i . deals places -- famous world cities ) ii ( best ) involves events . best two entries " circus " shows chan first time his large family 12 ( it grew 14 later series ) deals murder very unpopular circus owner . " cc olympics " amazing piece work . #1 son ( great keye luke ) contender nazi occupied berlin olympics . this premise it own ( even it great subplot ) makes this one best oland series . none chan francishe films ran more than hour ( 70 minutes top ) , so both sets containing 4 discs quite expensive ( although fox reputed spent $ 2,000,000 restoration ) . round out set sidney toler wwii outings released mgm -- chantology ( which far cautious due times -- series moved studio monogram ) . if you real fan , then all three pricey sets worth investment . i tried buy them used lesser price . beware ! once you start watching series ( unfortunately many finer outings lost their copyright only available poorly made homemade bootleg dvd-rs ) , you get hooked most famous oriental detective ( based real life honolulu detective ) all time , amazing charlie chan . great series best genre .	1
i don't usually spend money dvds , but i love first six seasons this show . sci-fi channel regularly plays re-runs , but when price season 1 dvds dropped $15 , i couldn't pass it up . special price may something quality dvds . one episode , you can't hear anything apophis says , two other episodes skip alot . despite flaws dvds , i still gave this 4 stars . it great tv show i am very happy i one season dvd play anytime i want . i'll watching see if prices other sets drop , too	-1
let me make this very clear . i am not woody allen fan all , but i love this movie . humor , music , acting ... everything this movie first rate . it made me nostalgic time i didn't even live through - that how effective this film taking you back era radio . oh , i also don't usually like films led child actors ( " home alone " , shudders ) , but seth green ( who 12 or 13 years old when this made ) phenomenal . so , even if you , like me , don't much care woody allen films , give this one try anyway . i think you'll very pleasantly surprised	1
movie suggested lytton strachey fine essay gordon appeared his classic eminent victorians , indeed story brewing long time before combination international interests unleashed khartoum english speaking world . it time when olivier , newly remarried surprised father young family , desperate money wouild snatch up any job , so film world brightened , if that word , olivier appearing any old movie if they gave him enough lucre . it if he saying , i repertory thing thirty years , it time payoff . thus we got extra helpings ham bunny lake missing , shoes fisherman , battle britain , really any old blockbuster . it rare 60s movie didn't room olivier it . he never good any them , but khartoum his performance mahdi causes enough offense nearly justify , years later , recent subway bombings london . russet makeup smeared over his face ( slightly different shade than blackface he used othello ) , olivier bites every piece scenery known man , playing rhe mahdi mad tyrannical prophet islam , like westerners fantasy al qaeda , hollering white men blood letting his strange fantasies allah cloud his limited intellect . next him , gordon ( charlton heston ) almost looks like sane man . maybe filmmakers making some sort antiwar statement . this distance it hard say . what we see pretty frightening , there over top then there over top mahdi	-1

fan mme . austen , thomas hardy , d.h. lawrence other sundry novelists manner , i freely admit hopeless addiction " period " pieces -- romances , particular -- this weakness clearly plays into very generous aforementioned 2-star rating . " northanger abbey " charming bit camp rainy afternoon , but please don't expect this movie anything like big-money hollywood adaptations mme . austen other works . acting over-the-top ; soundtrack , deplorable ; characters ( exception eleanor ) completely unsympathetic . catherine portrayed insipid half-wit , rather than day-dreamy post-adolescent verge womanhood . peter firth henry tilney vascilates compassionate , brotherly concern annoyingly superior arrogance . end movie , i lost all patience them convinced henry catherine fully deserve misery they inevitably wreak upon each other . ( this romance buff ! ) most give up before end film , but true austen fans enjoy parade costumes , witty repartee , opportunity daydream regency culture . watch it or don't -- but if you choose watch , make sure you so sense humor forebearance .	-1

i saw shorter/santana this tour , still t-shirt prove it . it awe-inspiring moment music history . santana doing his brand jazz-rock fusion since ' 70 , but taken detour into pop world . santana " lotus " " caravanserai " masterpieces , not mention carlos ' work alice coltrane . reviewer quite obviously not his homework , leon " ndugu " chancler worked santana 1974-1976 , * before * joining weather report ( chancler weather report 1975 ) . santana friends wayne shorter many years , recorded " swing delight " shorter 1980 , which may bit ambitious fell fairly short their potential . however , any professional music reviewer truly believes drummer chester thompson switched keyboards this tour bumbling idiot . chester thompson , keyboard player , playing santana since 1983 , well * major * name hammond organ players , main keyboard player tower power 10 years . chester thompson , drummer , played weather report one year , 1976 , but long-time touring drummer genesis . he great drummer , but he'll never keyboard player level his namesake santana band . this tour amazing feat , while shorter much richer history jazz-rock world than santana , their playing seemed perfect complement each other . i eagerly await next time carlos decides take such risk leave comfortable pop world explore jazz textures shorter . santana also performed kickin ' version miles davis ' " silent way/it time " , which former written future weather report keyboardist/leader joe zawinul . weather report/shorter connection goes much further back much stronger than our friend sam would us believe .	1

i , like so many its fans , cannot understand what minds critics time who bashed this film . no , it certainly not quiet man , thank god . ireland reflected ryan daughter not your quaint , leprechan-filled stereotypical place beloved world doesn't know much real ireland . atmosphere this movie haunting disturbing reflective great deal irish life , particularly time revolution against british rule . attitudes narrow-minded villagers realistic line church-dominated lives they led , irish great begrudgers so their jealousy lovely daughter local publican quite believable . however , this story young woman married respectable kindly older man but yearning romantic love takes greater significance when it addresses deeper issues involved : retribution , redemption , forgiveness , betrayal loyalty . love scenes sara miles christopher jones , playing shell-shocked british soldier who arouses desire she kept under wraps , some most intense moving i've seen . when they become enmeshed village suspicions , prejudices hatred english , all set against backdrop brooding rather sinister irish countryside , tragedy set place . this riveting film filled outstanding performances , beautiful scenery universal themes . robert mitchum particular outstanding what may his best ever performance , one very much against type . , course , there ever-present star show , ireland , incredibly beautiful land saints scholars , informers patriots , martyrs conspirators . this film add your collection .	1
this movie made back 1975 where it seems everybody jumping one person bed . plot pretty thin . this guy entrusts warren ( without soft focus lens dick tracey ) look after his girfriend . warren plays hairdresser so this guy makes incorrect assumptions warren sexual orientation . i think this movie would made better documentary warren sex life however i give it 5 stars some reason which i can't quite think right now because it 110 degrees outside here hot australian summer which kind fries my fragile little brain	1

idea behind story well acting three main characters both overcome actual plot this movie . it recieved higher grade then i would given it because acting , i almost wished i could seen it pre 9/11 well post 9/11 , just see how i would react differently . last night first time i've seen seige , it surprising . maybe not great , but surprising . i think what got me most how terrorists didn't care their lives , just they don't over iraq . long message clear word got out , they continue doing what they doing until message listened . movie , it amazing see hollywood depiction chaos would ensue after such act . especially since this before real incident happened just same way.at parts , i wishing less unnecessary plot points , well some them come together better , but whole , seige it job .	-1
this movie just bit fun ! acting , directing production values very good . maxwell caulfield makes excellent reluctant hero john rhys davies injects humor into his villanous role . medieval setting more convincing less glamorous than many movies i've seen . script pretty good , dragon eggs land like comets earth , but we aren't sure first ( neither characters ) what they . even though movie not bloodfest , it too scary children . dragons kill people , there fair amount suspense , dragons frightening	1

this nostalgic bit filmmaking 80s . sights sounds inimitably 80s . however , this sort enigmatic film . much it part 80s it seemed lack chic timeliness those days . i don't know why but david caruso one actor who i remember indelibly connected it . every time i think this film all i remember caruso screen presence even though he minor yet disquieting character . steven bauer very good gives heartfelt performance . barbara williams seemed rather detached added obscure feeling this film john getz performance well . bauer , williams getz remain no more than shadowy figures upon recollection , while production design , cinematography story remain imbedded psyche . story interesting disturbing same time i wonder who really thief hearts this tale giving film ultimate conclusion . i think douglas day stewart directed only one other motion picture he primarily screenwriter . film ambiguous style seems bolsters fact . film very provocative mix sensuality , sexual repression seems represents era when introverted self gratification glossy lifestyles replace traditional intimate values otherwise loved ones . interestingly , this film seems strange allure it leaving indelible impression once viewed .	-1
many thanks reviews here . whear , arlan ebel , mickey moose 15 . this amazon reviewing its best . read those three their entireties . what stands out me after watching this movie seductive wholesome portrayal santa rosa . time also given this film nostalgic value , deepening american romance small-town life . details all work make us feel comfortable this town , down traffic cop who knows names whereabouts everyone who lives his town , severe but helpful librarian , lovely white house its big porch lawns , dinner scenes where all ( girl ) children help their mother serve mashed potatoes . further we move time this movie , more powerful its image innocence becomes . contribution co-writer thornton wilder ( our town ) very evident here . perfection location makes arrival uncle charley ( played brilliantly joseph cotten ) all more ominous . ominous what this movie really good . outside santa rosa all confusion , shown when panicky young charlie unable locate her rescuer ( detective jack graham ) any addresses he left her . ties santa rosa rest america remain tenuous . end , battle good evil seem get resolved , but allusion " crazy world " outside santa rosa last scene , reminds us this resolution not meant felt final . there " ghost world " outside comfort santa rosa its physical double , just uncle charley shadows young charlie . it world where film significantly begins even if it not where it ends . sum , beautiful white house both front stairs back one . it hard forget seeing shadowy figure uncle charley through window those back stairs , which also become young charlie preferred way ; it because he knows she use them her uncle almost able kill her those stairs	1

this second installment cartoon network halloween dvd . it got halloween-themed episode kids next door double dose courage . personally , besides franken-bravo episode , i thought they'd put second episode billy mandy there . maybe next volume . thing , i thought i am weasel episode would either " i am franken-weasel " and/or " i ghost " follow up " i am vampire " episode first volume . but dvd title " grossest halloween ever " , " power odor " seem fit it . goes same powerpuff girls episode entitled " reeking havoc " (i expecting episode where girls battle zombie magician ) . like i said before : maybe next volume . perhaps volume three , i noticed halloween-themed episode billy mandy one cow chicken . plus , some other scary-looking episodes other cartoon network shows like ed-isode where single-d masquerades monster terrorizes neighborhood , or time when dexter watches scary movie experience horrifying effects watching it , or one where kids next door fight some zombie nerds . , hey , there brand new ed , edd eddy halloween special called eds ' " boo haw haw .

we bought season one our daughter when she three she absolutely loved all episodes . i searched searched second season but kept getting reports sony would not release second season . i am ecstatic they finally . previous reviewer wrote , this not princess promenade . these saturday morning cartoons form 80 when thundarr he-man very popular . yes there monsters , yes ponies often " mortal " danger . yes , animation not crisp like todays computer drawn animation , but all episodes wonderful show kids if you good person stand your friends , good things happen you . this something many thin skinned , terrified children today should learn instead coddled mindless entertainment like dora or blue . off topic , sorry , back discs . songs simple catchy , our daughter 4 1/2 now sings most songs season one . she hasn't learned season two yet , but it only matter time . i would highly recommend this all children love play little ponies	1

i live el centro , winter training grounds blue angels . i watched them train january through march good many years . people who buy this dvd probably expecting see 45 minutes air show . instead , you hear mumbling narrative john travolta which very much history naval aviation , too little flying . lead pilot , or " boss " assigned pentagon , this video not point out " boss " this team removed because safety violations . other pilots didn't want fly him . best blue angels video i seen " blue angels : xtreme close-up " which aired military channel . it pure flying . if you want lots air show mixed interesting behind scenes then i recommend " blue angels : year life " . just don't buy this one unless you want fall asleep .	-1

i took this movie very personally , found beginning tedious , middle painful ending joyous . i keep this movie . every actor it ( it quite line-up pros ) outstanding . fortunately none reviews ( i read ) gave away ending or much plot . reviews . houseman more than one scene many more than dozen lines . camera work good enough ( i don't know enough movies tell good bad ) i suppose , i found it little labored , stunned triteness seeing shots women feet when one hurrying follow other . unlike review , i feel life-changing event occurred things going decidedly different , better both protagonist others . unlike heroine , i'm turning 60 , not 50 , i not see 50 old . but heroine said , 30 , 40 , 50 - she told expect overwhelmed each these birthdays " traumatized " turning 50 . woman said despite these warnings , she unphased each birthday until she hit 50 , traumatize her . i don't remember how i felt turning 50 , but not much i don't think , nor much any other ages . but sigh turning 60 me down count . i'm just taking up violin . thing i tried doing few months college many years ago , but gave up . now it " too late " anything more than hobby , i feel greatly motivated . enough . i doubt it make you want watch picture . i recommend this movie without reservations . allen protagonist split infinitive one early scenes . but rest his grammar good this flick . pleasant change	1

i really took ' very bad things ' when it came out ' 98 , i watched it other day friend ( not seen it since its run theatres ) , i found i still esteemed crazed entity unique fervor . i think what most commendable ' very bad things ' , least person like myself , this actor peter berg directorial debut . not its technical virtues , which it possess , but because berg created picture such grim ferocity , holding back so little , most dangerously , entering directing world product , its neccessity , going receive near unanimous criticism its " distaste " . here thing ... despite sensationalistic way film approaches most horrific circumstances , i find ' very bad things ' almost brings within me sense empathy because , all all , five main characters film -- group old friends -- not bad people . seriously -- how many groups genuinely decent guys take vegas buddies ' bachelor party ? furthermore , they inherently despicable because they're getting loaded , snorting cocaine , generally acting like crazed little boys night event ? oh , but one them pounding prostitute -- if none other characteristics qualify making someone evil , surely this one must . well , not me . large , these guys appear likable middle class schmucks , stuck so many within half-baked life . where many find them unlikable without hesitation , i empathize because they all flawed ; once favreau soon-to-be wife introduced ( played bitingly diaz ) , it hard view him much more than pathetic noodle , completely subserviant witch behind beauty . then you've got piven stern , playing two dichotomous brothers general disdain each other personality complex ; piven lively but lost , single apathetic towards his career , probably acting bit younger than he should , while stern , contrast , responsible but neurotic ; uptight family man who no easier respect given his life accomplishments anal behaviorisms . leland orser reclusive , enigma shy guy doesn't offer much look up , christian slater demented complex made up handful self-help books easily most pathetic five . basically , these guys all normal some senses but completely deprived others , before night begins their descenting journey into madness , none them , my eye , could judged despicable any justification ( okay , so maybe slater could , judging real estate selling scene ) . film fateful climax , i pretty fond entire group . so , then , you've got premise , my mind ; awful accident occurs hotel room vegas , prostitute no longer living . thing , it wasn't anyone fault , unless you seriously blame piven act ( if prostitute wasn't responsible taking part circus act ); simply devestating accident . yet , because nature how system tends work , accident could still prove bring down more lives consequence . perhaps if they weren't all coked up , their decision making abilities might steered them better direction . nope -- they high kite , scared abandoned baby . essentially , point we see them make one mistake after , usually out survival instinct , no means rendered act . so ensues suffering paranoia all , reaching snowball effect until film finishes . if you ask me , if these guys weren't relatable or capable likelihood , film wouldn't last beyond intial moment chaotic hysteria ... but it . throughout most it , film expresses nice emphasis exaggeration , lends some comedy dire consequences proceed . but , many said before me , ' very bad things ' doesn't really seem like comedy . slater character , his outrageous justifications their nasty acts , comes highpoint exaggerated comedy . yet , it surely no drama , sense melodrama least . rather , it just detatched , furious account bizzarely interesting but fatal situations , up ' till this point , people who've never encountered such fearful , life-altering experiences . combined berg energetic direction , overall , impressive , convincing , intense performances -- wavering seriousness comedic ( my favorites piven , stern , orser diaz ' ) -- whole thing just ashamedly entertaining . it just . what else i say ? i think highly moral people might shun film , but anyone knack fatalism oughta really dig ' very bad things ' . abuser only abuses because he abused . while this might seen cowardly , i think we all , least secretly , view many things such angle , especially if events such hit us or those close us . indeed , we all whim great magnet who , this case , just happened cause asian hooker slip wet bathroom floor , letting her head gracefully plow through towel hanger wall . it dark it twisted . it ugly , sure . i myself no issues people disliking it , least claim not judge them it . i just hope those who fact repulsed least attempt understand why some may like it , not judge them unrelenting way many seem judge film , which sometimes seems near likes possessed demon	-1

i really wanted like " third man out " more than i . it all makings fine movie , but i felt it little forced , little scattered , story didn't hold up terribly well . i am happy say " shock " really fine movie vast improvement over " system . " it preserves continuity strachey character , we get new murder mystery , tons more back story , much more natural-feeling , interesting , thoughtful feel relationship strachey his partner . some chuckles inside jokes , there real feeling here , this film takes some chances . it deals coming out , self-identity , parenting , more . mr. strachey investigation takes him inside gay conversion group , or " ex-gay " group , film thoughtful deals respectfully all characters . course chad allen best part this movie , seems born , almost , role which he pulls off , somehow , conveying feelings emotions barely perceptible change expression . this film worth seeing , enjoying , thinking . i look forward next installment allen/stratchey series	-1

ben bolt capable director , here he good job - everything but his lead actor . music wonderful , just enough make your spine tingle . problem here jodhi may . she turns endlessly one-note performance . she seems focussing so hard not ever blinking , while her mouth perpetually agape . mr bolt must blame this , because she certainly seems decent actor . nonetheless , her performance drags this interesting production down into realm cartoon . unfortunate , children housekeeper - ghosts - solid supporting cast . script also awkward times clumsy . i suspect other reviewer correct ideally wanting hear this story read firelight - either 100 years ago , or perhaps tonight	-1

" sopranos " may most critically acclaimed tv series all time , but it surely features one largest , most complex cast characters ever assembled small screen . thanks those characters , season 2 grabs hold you very first scene first episode doesn't let go thirteen hilarious , violent , sad episodes . story continues revolve around massive shoulders belly tony soprano . end season 1 , tony survived " hit " arranged his uncle junior his mother , livia . but family family , both uncle junior livia still breathing outset season 2 , even though tony keeps insisting livia " dead me .

i've after this movie while , but put off , people telling me it no good , various bad reviews i've read etc . after bad day work , i found it very reasonable price , nabbed it . i'm glad i now , surprised when i didn't get yelled buying it :) this film very strange , very ott storyline , not much it makes sense person who only bought film see her favourite actress angelina . i quite shocked start it discover , wee geeky guy girl next door , paul dano . ( who quite nice looking guy when he takes his glasses off . ) film starts him befriending guy , then pushing him front truck . it snowballs there . what puzzled me most this film , lack decent characters it . ok , angelina fabulous ever , actually suited her character , someone who kinda psychic , see what happened dead people etc . oliver martinez ethan hawke horribly miscast , just plain horrible too . i just don't find french accents sexy ( despite fact most time he very little say film ) , it just me , or anyone else find ethan hawke very rat-like ? charming image i know . kiefer sutherland i thought suited role he , i've only previously seen his blink-and-you'll-miss-him role phone booth , he comes across kinda guy - suitably creepy . ( haven't seen 24 . ) angelina gets her kit off this film , so if you want good look nearly everything , then guys , you'd better get this film . i dread think how long she spend makeup this scene , cover up her numerous tattoos she . some say finale this film let down , honest , i didn't think so . oh my god !!! finale your face , totally unexpected , i couldn't believe what happening . it made up certain other points movie lacking , although i jump out my seat least 3 times , screamed cos there some scenes where you get such frigh t.t his basically must-see any angelina fans . she plays marvellous part this , i actually enjoy film , definitely watch it again	-1
a.i. one those movies caused much divide viewers ' opinions , many varied reasons . it certainly movie multilayered seen many levels . me , a.i. holds special place my heart . it masterpiece ranks alongside those movies experienced rather than watched lingers long time ( it still after many years ) . it hauntingly beautiful one power touch emotional resonance what makes you truly human . like shawshank redemption ( one my other favourite films ) evokes power friendship , hope redemption ; a.i. evokes power dreams , love reunion . both films utilize universal theme possibilities completion through journey life . , i am sure , like other viewers suggested , this film revisited again sometime future seen different ligh t.t he acting excellent , especially haley joel osment david also jude law gigolo joe . also worth praising this film musical score john williams . me , it confirms him greatest movie score composer history . main theme soprano hauntingly ethereal , both sorrowful soothing same time . piano score like lullaby evokes memories childhood innocence purity . ** warning : spoilers here if you not watched movie !! **the movie android boy who programmed ( his little silicon soul ? ) goal love his human parents ( this particular case , his mother ) , simply , loved return . that all . but , unexpected happens when their once incurable human son cured returns them so effectively causes his mother , monica , abandon android robot . so , this where real journey begins : level abandonment , loneliness absence love . android boy , david , begins his quest return motherly love again but travel through dangerous world search clues fulfill his grandest wish . many viewers suggested this film too long final 3rd movie should cut , so david never realises his dream loved his mother . but , my opinion , missing whole point this movie . david programmed goal love loved his mother . his `program ' reason his existence . human terms , it this heartfelt dream love gave him meaning living , only following his dream would it ultimately bring him home happiness peace . it david unwavering faith eventually fulfilled his dream ( complete his program ) , course , helping some advanced mechas . 3rd act , me , completes cycle life ; not just a-to-b ending ends bleakly without meaning . if you cynic , materialist , believe stories metaphor no real meaning , love no power striving dreams no value , then pre-3rd act best where you leave this movie . me , 3rd act moves beyond limitations physical level onto philosophical , metaphorical spiritual level . david gifted temporary resurrection monica so he complete his goal . how ironic ! first , humans play god create machines . machine gradually becomes more human . humans regress become more like machines/or animals . then finally , advanced machines play god recreate humans ! david not only finally fulfills his mission loving loved his mother , he also , through journey life begins android/machine evolves into what it means human : through abandonment , loss love , hope reunion , unwavering strive one dreams faith no matter what impossible `physical limitations ' against you . love lost but regained one most blissful experiences humans this what david eventually experiences . it his emotional experiences relationships humans transforms him . very act loving loved return makes him human . he realizes truth told her end : he `always loved ' . time space ( even 2000 years ) no power over his dream love loved . although initially seemingly futile , reality it only temporary barrier proved completion his goal , he finally able what machine cannot : dream . transformation machine human finally transcending condition finally reach ultimate truth , me , what this film . again , how ironic it it takes `machine ' teach us what it means `human ' . end , david returns home `where dreams born ' ... realm eternal , spirit soul ? it bitter-sweet ending . bitter physical ; sweet metaphysical . way , you know `ai ' japanese actually means `love '	1

this my second favorite john woo movie great touches action drama , when i first saw this film ( 5 years ago ) i wasn't used seeing this much violence screen ( i thought lethal weapon extremely violent time ) i shock more then once my jaw dropped . this film very violent but compared other action films this really tame nowadays . minor points this film would some bad acting some worse acting some spots , some weird cuts editing , subs terrible , same audio quality some camera work bad , but this john woo first ( if you count heroes shed no tears ) landmark heroic bloodshed film so we all know he could worse much worse . yun fat chow , ti lung leslie chung their good moments bad moments , most good moments goes chow ti while leslie only one or two moments . plot like this cop must confront his criminal brother . that it . if your typical hollywood action goer this your perfect find . but i said if your new heroic bloodshed films don't make this your first one , i'll say stick killer hard boiled few weeks then move . but if your hollywood action movie goer make this your first if you handle it move other heroic bloodshed films so . this film big landmark action genre even bigger landmark underground action genre . i really recommend this film any action fan !!!!	-1
this would one worst movies i ever seen i sat through lot turkeys my lifetime . it concerns advertisng executive played kirk douglas . eddie very bad nervous breakdown following unsuccessful suicide attempt . then he procedes harrangue everybody he meets his messed up life if anybody could care less . eddie also carrying illicit affair gwen , played faye dunaway . when eddie making love his wife played deborah kerr he thinking gwen !!! i realize millions married guys all over world this but don't make it right man once said . after half hour watching this movie you get very tired eddie whining ms. dunaway makes very intelligent observation " screwing i'm getting not worth screwing i'm getting " . gee . i felt pretty screwed after hiring this piece junk video store $3.50 !!! i give this movie 5 stars because i kind like faye dunaway although she appeared better films than this one	1
one jayne mansfield last films certainly most unrestrained this outrageous sex romp ocean liner . plot , involving bed-hopping mistaken identities , served excuse her patented infamous nude scenes . this provocative , sexy , sensuos delight quite controversial back early 60 which original version banned many cities replaced much edited version . when playboy published group still shots movie including one described jayne " writhing seductively bed " issue playboy banned many cities across country . overall , this movie provocatve , sexy , sensuous delight that very well worth watching especially it original , unedited movie version !	1

don't believe negative reviews . i repeat : don't buy lukewarm responses . if you looking uninterrupted gut-busting laughter , audience laugh-track cajole you , you might better served pryor other movies or works artists like sinbad , chris rock , dave chapelle , bernie mac , george carlin others who followed his footsteps . " here now , " which roger ebert called " 90-minute documentary one man talking , " richard pryor evokes cadence relevance none above could reinvent . he rises gift genius talent savant . make no mistake , this film contains some pryor best moments . yet these moments not justice superficial label " comedy . " when pryor ties his arm off shoots up heroin , wincing intensity he stiffly pauses waiting hit materialize , then transitions into liquid shiver euphoria before his entire body falls limp -- it might disappoint those reviewers who expecting see moe , curly , larry . rest us spellbound power poetry man who comedy what jack kennedy politics ; rare achiever stifled too young not paralleled since . pryor masterful , ad-libbing sketching us roller coaster laughter , tears , pure marvel human condition . those who buy this appreciate cheap thrills rather than intellectually politically prepared moved , i say this : " you're no richard pryor .	1
i love these kind films go way beyound what we're used . monster house one my faves because it somewhat scary because it just treat watch . it actually spook factor some scary movies lacking . house alive ! owner crazy mean takes bikes balls little children who so much step blade grass it lawn . it calls little children night . house isn't afraid cops sucks whole cars into it teeth . movie also hysterical humor clean original . what starts out movie freaky house freaky owner ends up actually teaching us small life lesson we actually care animated characters . if you liked toy story then you definitely love this . this would also satisfy scary movie lover because it genuine thriller- but animation .	1

this very ... very ... very ... uh ... well ... interesting dvd . let see ... how i say this uhh ... it sucked . i'm type person who usually loves everything i watch , i love almost every genre its easy me like things . especially anime . if i say anime bad ... its pretty dang bad . this anime 2 siblings who win 2 legendary skins online game , . hack . they won skins 2 legendary characters who beat game . even though sister excited ( her skin black rose , yea , you know who i mean . hack video-gamers ) , brother ( he kite skin ) well ... isn't excited . it just pretty lame show insults amazing video games other . hack anime which masterpiece . if you really -- i mean really -- want check out this series , i reccomend manga ; it much better .	-1

these guys playing basically same songs last twenty years . but they still look like they're fun ( unlike stones other bands should retired long ago ) put great show . fleetwood buckingham best business , bar none . rendition " tusk " they give here dynamite ; i love happy faces fleetwood makes when he plays because those same faces i make when i listen him . lindsey going nuts , jumping dancing around like loon priceless . i give four stars only because this : i accidentally put disc two before disc one too lazy get up change discs . disc two just so freaking awesome disc one little disappointing . but i still watch it - just not much second part concert . i don't care if they're still touring when they're walkers . if they keep putting shows like this , i'll keep showing up . i only wish i born decade half earlier than i so i could seen them their heyday	-1
i really enjoyed this movie . let my sister borrow it she her boyfriend really loved it well	-1
now , this real anomaly : mae west starring film based successful play she wrote back 1926 . so theoretically , this film could made into silent movie , here it , turning up over 50 years later 1978 . even these more enlightened times , they didn't use original title sex , calling it sextette instead ( although opening credits put first three letters into slight relief those who might otherwise missed it ) . i'm big fan mae west , i finally let my curiosity get better me her final film , which i warned against many times . happily , i thought it delight beginning end . mae west unique history sex stars movies because she able somehow both play role sex goddess simultaneously parody same role . so while other sex queens could not gotten away doing such role this one age 85 , mae much more than " get away it , " even this age it not all parody all time . allowances made very few things . her wig one them , her slightly bizarre makeup makes her eyes seem way too far apart , her slow movements time time final one . still , she obviously taken very good care herself over years , gets show herself off one point series beautiful gowns ( keith moon over top her dress designer ) she supposedly prepares herself screen test . she clearly lot fun . film set up so she consistently deliver one-liners made her famous . these one-liners still work her , some 45 years after she used this technique her first film . ( line " girl who works paramount all day . . . " probably funniest any her one-liners . ) i sat there huge smile my face anytime mae onscreen . i would consider her inspiration those who feel after they reach certain age , it time give up . mae west just effervescent zestful here she her 1930s films . her co-stars quite good , dom deluise leading pack , followed closely ( no particular order ) tony curtis , ringo starr , george hamilton , alice cooper . i hope i forgiven thinking timothy dalton , who makes up final member sextette title not quite their league ( way , " sex " latin " six " i suspect original title more this than it " act " ) . then again dalton playing straight man all these buffoons , so his part little less showy than theirs . also , his singing voice decent although he could stand some lessons phrasing ( not breaking musical line partway through phrase ) . speaking singing , mae three numbers through course film . she makes winners out all three both through her singing voice ( remember she even creditably sang opera 1935 goin ' town ) through force her personality . now , this something we would missed out if sextette made silen t.t here number star cameo turns . it fun see regis philbin way back when ( i didn't realize he well known 1978 ) , it trip down memory lane see once-ubiquitous rona barrett , bit bizarre see one ed beheler playing jimmy carter , something he apparently made minor career out ( even some gop campaign ads ) . probably most touching cameo george raft , who played lead mae first film , night after night , 1932 . course mae loved surround herself bodybuilders , she gets scene number them here . these not just guys they picked up off street ; they all athletic credentials or hold titles such mr. america , indicated closing credits . okay , so gone wind it not ( hence 4 stars instead 5 ) . it still lot fun , it great see mae west go out such grand style	-1

look past surface this movie it really loneliness , range consequences around " falling love " someone you don't know . yeah , characters debauched , stupid things , but it all related their need " connect " someone . all them make mistakes , none them happy end . other reviewers mentioned , this isn't film everyone ; there several gross-out/desperate sex scenes , but they work context movie . i don't much more say hasn't already said ( said better ) other reviewers . i'll finish up adding if you went small , liberal arts college where everyone knew everyone , everyone business ( i ) , trust me , you " know " most people movie probably get weird combination nostalgia " thank god i'm past part my life ! " when watching this film . also features great 80 soundtrack probably best use cure song movie ... ever .	1

i like movie . i thought it very interesting story . but i am huge fan toni collette i think this her best role i've seen so far . robin williams good too but collette really shows off her acting abilities this one . she very creepy it . she plays woman who'm we think blind but gives one most chilling movie stares i've seen while towards end movie . so if you like her . definetly see this film .	-1

no , this movie isn't ' so bad its good ' or anyything stupid like , it genuinely entertaining . i think least three things ended up funny , but , if real people similar situation , probably would happen , such guy who acidentally pricks himself tranquiliser while attacked , which realisic considering he panicking his hand box tranquiliser darts . thankfully , aside horribly overused ' get out water!' line , movie avoids any clich�s , unless you count character who acts surprisingly like steve irwin , which i doubt counts clich� since steve irwin actually real guy , although it strange so many australian characters monster movies act like him . i guess this going last time while though , because it going something taboo long time . while cgi creatures monster movies always some amount cuteness , jurassic park movies , where ' cuteness ' accidental result cgi creatures extremely stupid-looking , more recent movies , where it seems intentional , title creature possibly cutest cgi movie monster . i know fifty-foot crocodile swallows people who shouldn't able cute , but it . i guess this sign how anime tokusatsu influenced western culture over last decade or so	-1
i saw most this movie my children ; they watching little afternoon tv while i cleaned . i pretty surprised see content wicca religion , wicca songs earth wind fire sung " nice girls " vampire teeth . they made it sound like , " oh we wicca , there nothing wrong ! " reviewer mentioned this would never tolerated if this movie included dogma judaism , islam or catholicism . i let them finish watching , because i wanted them see whole thing before i explained them many people world believe wicca religious venue witchcraft . i am not sure if they caught whole idea wicca movie , but you know , these tiny little minds like sponges . next thing you know , my daughter casting spells saying , " but mom , i saw it scooby doo ! " i agree reviewer it should clearly stated this movie it contains content wicca . i only saw it tv , which i could turned off . what those who spent their good money it found out later it includes positive teaching paganism .	-1

oliver twist one dickens orphan novels , this film adaptation , david lean excellent job capturing feel despair protest against social conditions novel depicts , namely difficult , dilapidated situations those employed workhouses 1830s london . also , this film works show people general , especially those little monetary means or sustenance , succeed life find hope despite rough upbringings . film visuals camera work extraordinary . opening scene quite illustrative , we see pregnant woman walking across field storm approaches she barely able make it work house give birth son oliver . after giving birth oliver , she dies , oliver twist left there work exist little way food . scene shows point view sick feverish oliver who slowly fainting while standing before judge pickpocketing . conditions which oliver lives harsh . after coerced his fellow peers while workhouse , one day he asks more food ( famous ...

" chocolat , " " what eating gilbert grape , " " something talk . " he also very well known directing music videos world famous swedish pop group , abba . film 12 year old boy 1950 sweden . he very rambunctious when his mother falls ill , his antics prevent her recovering , so he sent live his uncle . he meets new people there makes friends towspeople . he often compares his misfortunes those worse off than he . film some excelent scenes more rural areas sweden some fine photography also . it remains very popular film this day recieved or nominated many awards . it won golden globe best foreign film nominated best director ampas . though it described many people family film , it got pg-13 rating us . mainly nudity sexual diaglogue . there half second full frontal female nudity , though non-sexual , it still may cause parental concern . other scene involves material i feel uncomfortable mentioning but parents urged watch film themselves before letting their children see i t.t he special features criterion dvd include lasse hallstr�m first film , " ska vi g� hem till dej eller till mej eller var och en till sitt ?

that mostly what you need know movie - it intriguing notion . vampires recently announced their presence world , now they serum take instead drinking blood . nsa cop steven grant understandably upset this after his partner killed vampire , especially when he teamed up vampire cop aaron gray . however , they slowly reach uneasy truce start work together figure out who it killing people , since vampires actually peaceful people who find murder distasteful . way , gray introduces grant beautiful lucy westerna grant finds himself falling love . we meet some other very memorable characters - character west , who apparently slavic , looks sounds irish , interestingly enough ( i guess it because he slavering revolutionary ? ) . one most amusing things this - me anyway - overtones 1984 constant announcements nsa headquarters ( " open hand not grasp discipline " " nothing true , everything permissible " ) signs ( " informing your enemy makes him your friend " " one step forward 1/2 step back " ) ; not mention people dressed decidedly soviet military style or 50s style , everyone smoked all time . cinematography beautiful ; whole film washed out , creating almost black white effect , while retaining some color . all vampires quite pale , course , but other than their fangs , they really aren't so different - even children . acting pretty good who wouldn't love grant sexy voice ? ok , i'm fan vampire genre so course i'd like it ; but also this gave us different look world i enjoyed it thoroughly . if you like vampire flicks all , you'll love this one	1
i pleasantly surprised find movie current interesting it when it first came out . brilliant director talented actors contributed , but most important , , script , still fresh very much point . one not quote any more " greed good " because it politically incorrect . but , believe it , it still rules wall street corporate world . latest news selling america proves it . i recommend this dvd without any qualms .	1
i watched this again see if i could pick up ' where ' movie i should've clued things weren't they seemed , innocent characters certainly anything but . i also realized why serial killer part beginning movie ( something i didn't pick up first time ) . murders led test ' necessary ' order reveal one huge clues becomes turning point movie , helps couple characters ' wise up ' . definitely worth watching , mystery fans ... chrissy . mcvay - autho	1

i seen many takeshi kitano films , but this one haunts me especially . it very poetic , sad , beautiful , complex . what you say yakuza film begins serene , tender paintings ( kitano himself) ? kitano gives probably one his better performances here , playing yet version disillusioned cop , but more depth this time . this not say his other films shallow ( quite contrary ) , but here emotional resonance makes this film even more moving powerful . yes , it violent , but all kitano films , he doesn't wallow it , even though it brutal . i've always liked everything this man ( even his comedy kikujiro , which got terrible reviews ) , this probably my favorite his films .	1

i picked up this movie bargain bin decided give it try . boy , am i glad i ! this story tense strong . both scott wolf tim roth play good guys , it just they're motivated different things . roth sees wolf character " man he could " takes hit job personal vendetta . then , time progresses he takes new mind set , his outlook changes you find yourself rooting more his character than wolf . but there no bad actors this film . i never party five fan , but wolf acting here nothing short amazing ! story ends little too abruptly ( major plot thread left out there ) , but i still very satisfied movie when it over . way , it gets its rating mostly language ( there not really much ) subject matter serial killer . if they'd just toned down couple words , this could easily passed pg-13 . strong , compelling story hold you until film over . recommended	-1

edward lionheart shakespearean actor who more ham than talent . his plays savaged london critics , who now denied him great acting honor . he shows them error their ways . vincent price plays lionheart one his most effective slightly campiest roles . i say slightly campy because price actually effective job showing lionheart sympathetic manner , his reading shakespeare ( when he not doing it lionheart stage ) good . diana rigg lionheart daughter , edwina , psychotically effective price . lionheart sets out prove his critics wrong dispatching them ways drawn shakespeare plays . among methods , one set up kill his wife jealous rage then taken off ( othello ) . one upended butt wine ( richard iii ) . one pound flesh removed ( merchant venice ) . one stabbed hacked death crowd ( julius caesar ) . funniest ( slightly sickest ) reserved meredith merridew ( robert morley ) , who first finds great pleasure his two poodles he loves dearly ( titus andronicus ) . those who enjoyed this scene , i highly recommend julie taymor titus anthony hopkins . among actors playing critics , addition morley , some britain finest : dennis price , jack hawkins , harry andrews , michael hordern , several others . price known now , i suppose , hammy horror specialist . he made lot money enjoyed himself immensely doing it . but guy could good actor . i thought he very effective shelby carpenter laura . occasionally late night cable you see samuel fuller movie called baron arizona . price excellent it . i think theater blood first-rate movie , but it best enjoyed if you passing knowledge shakespeare plays . cliffs notes always it me . movie camp , witty , literate gory . nice combination . dvd transfer very good	-1

this remarkably good film one history great men . this film features above-average acting storyline reasonably true history , rather than hollywood puff piece . film begins caesar confrontation dictator sulla , ends course , his historic assassination senate . thing i liked best this film my opinion it fairly realistic look julius caesar . it mostly not try glorify him ( , example , colleen mccullough her masters rome series books ) . nor it demonize him . film shows caesar went gaul provoked wars mainly his own political purposes ( enhance his stature home ) when senate sought call him account , this what motivated him turn his army against rome essentially overthrow roman republic . these not necessarily laudable acts , film not gloss over these points . scenes caesar imperiously dictating harsh laws proscriptions senate show time his death , absolute power indeed corrupted caesar absolutely . film much better attention detail concerning roman parapernalia such lictors who attended roman consul , other similar details . purists appreciate this . excellent quality this film casting acting , both excellent . acting generally good . jeremy sisto criticized his portrayal caesar , but i thought he reasonably good job . richard harris absolutely nails role dictator , lucius cornelius sulla . christopher walken fine cato , although this not major role film . heino ferch very convincing vercingetorix ( king gauls ) . i not think jay rodan convincing mark antony . overall , though , this film surprises performances its generally excellent cast turns . this film sufficiently good , fact , one why it not " bigger " film . i not enjoyed film much this one several years , causing it merit 5 stars . sets , acting , dvd reproduction this film all excellent . this film satisfy those us who seek historical accuracy film one history great figures , but storyline similarly engage those who simply interested good dramatic entertainment . this one highly recommended	1

what ---- . " tale revenge " ? why everyone their review say ? b/c it written box cover ?? this interesting compelling movie , but w/ very odd , abrupt ending leaves you hitting " rewind " button saying , " what minute , it over ?? i miss something ?? " afte watching this , i scoured internet , wikipeida , amazon ... still no reviewer seems able say what meant ending this film . my takeaway it -- she going hang , die ( go heaven ); he going stay earth .. but maybe when they meet again ( heaven ) , they get married . ?????? how come no one else come up w/ definitive meaning end this film ? subtlety great , but not if it so damn ambiguous nobody universe seems able define or explain what this film all . it not revenge . maybe it love obsession sadness silliness despair . sorry , can't really recommend this one !	-1
i finally got round watching this history channel last night . it screened part black history month , which october here uk . it powerful piece filmmaking . movie barely started i already feeling its power . scenes brutality injustice black people endure during civil rights movement , combined mournful voice joan baez singing " birmingham sunday " just too much . tears came easily . i immediately knew i just it dvd . spike lee earned oscar nomination this documentary 1997 . i think he should won , ( statue went mark jonathan harris " long way home " ) , i think this possibly one most significant movies he ever made . he surprises avoiding firebrand rhetoric he known he tells this story how four young african american girls murdered white supremacist bombers back 1963 , without voice-over narration , opting instead story told those who there ; namely girls ' friends families , civil rights activists who birmingham time . using these interviews , some which joyful ( those who prefer remember girls way they lived ) , some which excruciatingly painful ( those still grieving their loss ) some which verge ridiculous ( namely , former alabama governor george wallace - you see it believe it ) interlacing them archive footage , lee firmly establishes segregational fervour hysteria existed birmingham , alabama 1963 . bomb went off september 15th year we given run up significant events preceded act devastating consequences followed it . it made very clear how denise mcnair , cynthia wesley , addie mae collins carole rosamund robertson died while it made equally clear ( comments bill cosby , instance ) , how world much poorer place without them . more significantly - although this probably never give girls ' families friends any solace - it strongly suggested their deaths acted catalyst led upward surge civil rights movement south , black vote end segregation . one man eventually convicted murders but his co-conspirators never caught . critics denialists often question point looking back , raking over past , opening up healed wounds , blah , blah , blah , but i'm one those firmly believes regardless our skin colour , we cannot possibly know where we're headed if we don't full picture clear understanding where we've come . i felt sadness , bewilderment anger watching this but i also felt lot pride . this important history lesson . let all those who ears listen .	1
first all , director mr. robert . webb quite home westerns so he delivers job . ( " white feather " dvd still one my unfulfilled dreams ! ) . robert ryan ( he great here ! ) mayo ( girl past ! ) they're perfect match romantic mature affair . well , since this one released 1956 , one can't avoid notice some " coincidences " or maybe " clich�s " regarding other famous western movies : 1 . " high noon " ( 1952 ) - consider main idea - marshall alone face hired killers . arthur o'conell/lloyd brigdes play similar roles , denying help first but reconsidering later . remember kid first only offer help cooper/ kane . 2 . what say howard hawks ' " rio bravo " ( 1959 ) . same conflict . only help comes ex-bad girl hotel ( feathers/angie dicknson ) , jail keeper - same good old walter brennan extra hired helper , colorado ( ricky nelson ) who also brings girl eyecandy - jeffrey hunter - they even dress alike . only jeff more familiar gender . jeffrey hunter , fan , i've watched many his movies i think he didn't so well while playing such divided character thad anderson . when he grabs mayo hotel room , he totally not himself very far gentlemen type , unreproachable person he ( won him part christ kok ) . he pushed too much particular scene results so unnatural . other hand , there no doubt his unic presence screen adds plus this - time - western . nowadays , however , this might one best re-releases last two or three years . 3 . rio bravo bad guy name burdett here we saloon owner named barrett . 4 . let not forget city drunks paul . burns/ dean martin . if you compare you'll find more resemblances . but point " proud ones " 1956 while " rio bravo " release 1959 . oh , yeah , someone said richard widmark jeff already played same roles or similar characters " red skies montana " ( 1952 ) . sum up , who cares originals when we all these amazing actors , cinemascope great colors amuse us . buy all those dvds , watch many times you enjoy yourselves while you find out which one best performance . still say : there isn't single bat , spider , mummy , +fast or +whatever beat films like mentioned above . not even all gd " effects " world	1

sure , retail price four cds together $240 so $180 sounds like good value . except amazon selling first three cds $30 apiece fourth $41 which only adds up $131 . why world would someone pay extra $50 just buy all four once ? cds themselves great - no problem there . i just think someone amazon marketing division went little wonky this pricing no one caught it . seriously - save yourself some dough . until price all four cds drops below cost buying them separately this no bargain	-1
nova look storm drowned city large excellent study hurricane katrina , concentrating storm itself failure levee systems new orleans . no obvious political agenda , documentary only touches upon human aspect storm aftermath , pointing no fingers city , state , or federal government . it not if katrina took new orleans completely surprise , city dodged " big one " number occasions , including previous year . ivan monster storm changed direction last moment , sparing new orleans , everyone there must breathed sigh relief . i find it hard believe some city officials scoffed dire findings 2004 hurricane pam simulation major storm hitting city - it common knowledge decades powerful hurricane would flood new orleans . it beautiful city , but let face facts here : this last place anyone should built metropolis . we're talking bowl sitting several feet below sea level , bordered mississippi river lake ponchatrain , gulf mexico within hailing distance . expansion robbed city what little protection it storm surges , outdated levee system hid number vulnerabilities throughout city . documentary follows katrina path its origins off coast africa its fateful rendezvous gulf coast august 29 , 2005 . it offers one most understandable explanations hurricanes i've ever heard - why they form , how they behave , etc . katrina meanders her way across florida her way toward new orleans , we see communications parish officials experts national hurricane center - precautionary actions they began taking . days before katrina hit , everyone knew this could storm everyone dreading so long . strangely enough ( fortunately ) , we only see or hear mayor nagin once - when he calls mandatory evacuation city . this documentary really isn't government response- nor it even mention all irresponsible reporting days after storm hit . once katrina her worst moved , documentary shifts failures levee system . built withstand category three hurricane , there no wonder all incoming water overtopped some levees . bigger question why some city interior levees failed , since water never rose high enough overspill canals there . these areas , we see how levees broke due primarily water pressure . retrospect , they say underpinnings those canals should put deeper into ground when they built , but i'm not sure how effective would , real problem loose dirt foundation areas long shut off annual silt deposits mississippi river . final segment looks ways protecting new orleans future . even when fully repaired , levee system still vulnerable category 4 5 storms , meaning city no better off than it 2005 . some more radical solutions offered up here , however . example , one suggestion allow mississippi flood certain areas , it used , thereby building up disappearing wetlands used help protect city storm surges . when you consider time money required secure new orleans ' future , you wonder if it even worth it . devastating katrina , she not , truth told , " big one .

these words follow these next few paragraphs going seem snobbish boisterous , if it offends anyone , i apologize . yet , i cannot all my mustered soul , say i liked rollerball any way shape or form . if given opportunity walk hot cinders gasoline drenched feet or watch this horrid science-fiction , heavily symbolic film again , i would choose first . gasoline isn't bad , it ? muttering un-impassioned lines lead actor james caan , " your face " symbolic nature film , all way random unsolved moments johnathan his estranged wife , we ( viewers ) left nothing but sloppy film reeks symbolism deeply involved masses old sci-fi film only cult status because it released mid-70s . nothing more , nothing less . those sit here argue it huge film due visuals , elements strength government , power one man topple such corrupt way living , i cannot buy it . what i witnessed i watched this film nothing more than campy sci-fi film attempted smart 2001 , but instead just seemed recycled director norman jewison reading too much into " 1984 " " fahrenheit 451 " . i don't want sound like i hate intelligent cinema , when fact i crave it each every time i place film into my dvd player , what i don't like cinema blatantly symbolic just because it knows it trying reach opportunity thought cult film . rollerball , i feel like scenes too contrived overall nature it attempted represent . this needed simple film resistance against controlling government all tightly rolled into game known rollerball . jewison adaptation , i felt game rollerball got wrong end stick . i didn't feel like there enough time or dedication spent game . what really irritated me this film scenes games which tried look artistically like kubrick film , but failed , but also didn't enough cohesiveness hold film together . jewison could not " connect dots " our characters when they not roller rink . i mentioned this before , but i couldn't keep my eyes open long enough when caan spoke because he mumbled his lines ( providing little no emotion behind his character outside fact he really roller skate ! ) could not guide us through tunnel . central character , i felt he wrong fit this film . we needed someone strong , yet ability demonstrate verbally what they doing fight corporation . i also couldn't follow scenes party , scenes caan maud adams , eventuality moonpie . jewison left us guessing wanting more , but instead answers he would just throw us back rollerball game . it cheap move , i felt cheated him this film . end movie i saw some opportunities chances jewison didn't take , it angered me because this film could great , but every level it just fell short . i read other reviews say caan excellent choice this film because he represented aging sports star very well , but me he just fell flat . his acting , especially his speaking , seemed mumbled unemotional . i couldn't tell if he actually doing this fight corporation or just because jewison behind camera yelling " action " . i know caan capable so much more ; i just don't see why he didn't feel need give everything this character , unless he didn't see value him either . final scenes him moonpie laughable best , it just made me consider this film stronger emotional actor instead just your typical " man man " helmed this project . same said cardboard-esque representation we witnessed maud adams . emotionless babble . if jewison didn't us watching very loud mundane game rollerball , then he forcing us turn our volumes up down trying listen this emotionless babble coming mouths our actors . why didn't jewison get better actors ? i couldn't tell if it acting itself or direction just fouled this film . also , why 2018 look quite bit like 1975 ? if this where world headed , i need ask my father couple articles clothing ! overall , i cannot sit here recommend this film anyone . i read other reviews , i notice growing trend . you either going love this film or adamantly hate it . i seemed fall latter category . i willing give this film chance because i admire science fiction projects , but my hatred towards sports themed films got best me . there not surprises this film , there apparent lack innovation creating future , overall , game caan played wasn't great . i watched one match trouble watching rest . it seemed tedious boring view spectator . i realize hidden deeply within this symbolic references towards violence , media , corporate rule ... but honestly , if you would rather see film demonstrated better , you should check out oliver stone natural born killers avoid this film all costs ! thankfully , i remake here home watch later tonight . i know it horribly worse ( which seems impossible ) , but least it eliminate any remembrance i this utterly diabolical 1970s piece cinema . this definitely not one records books . shame you norman jewison ! grade : * out ****	-1

ramones raw basically marky ramone handheld camera annoying johnny , joey , dee dee c.j. while tour . there some great live footage band playing some classic songs . dvd doesn't really tell story but more narrative ramones life road . inner relations band not touched upon all . fact , watching ramones raw you'd never know johnny joey hated each other passion . most running time lighthearted gags inside jokes interspersed concert footage . complete look inner workings band , well making most their albums , pick up end century dvd it much more comprehensive look band whole . recommended ramones diehards completists only	-1
one my early saturday morning favorites kid . i get up watch fireball xl5 ! it also big topic discussion play playground during recess . robert robot favorite . while it may seem lame today standards ( computer graphics animation ) , it great its day though it rarely given any credit , it influenced science fiction series followed . great way jog memories baby boomers ! i just wish they would sell individual dvd show or least " best " dvd some better shows , like they " best thunderbirds " . this set may little pricey casual fans who just want show their kids or grandkids what cool when they growing up .	-1
i no intention watching this movie , none . there nothing it i thought i would like , but when friend mine wanted rent it , i nothing better , i watched it her . i wrong . i should wanted watch this one . it best understated , definitely overlooked . there few places where it bit ' out there ' me , but all all , i totally blown away how much i actually liked this movie . not kids . fact , probably not all adults , but if you like things little out ordinary , truly relate some more basal darker sides human nature , this sure send chill or two down your spine . there beautiful image love unrequited this movie , almost poetic nature , but so obscure it hard grasp it entirely . i consider it like i would work art , not everyone going understand it , nor everyone going get same things watching it , but i think it worth watching	-1
great escape portrays heroism prisoners never giving into their captors pompous honor nazi germany . group becomes monkey wrench all turns determined send their adversary russian front . my only complaint it shown letterbox format which saps some power story . wasn't this picture worth full screen format ? but this probably par epics era . stars carry load bigger life even though you peeking through window . steve mcqueen man epic tales this one not fail deliver . even doomed failure he never gives up . resist every last breath motto prisoners . guile guts served them well end germany defeated even if only small part escapades escapees . grit abounds through fiber every man sworn serve allied forces . we owe these men debt we never repay , but always respect . it takes courage put your own well second behind cause . unfortunately we seldom triumphed glory since time . this war made sense while successors seemed steeped politics . something normal person hard time understanding . let just hope global war put rest this one . we look back great escape admiration gratitude . but we never repay what sacrificed these men	1
out everything i own , this movie one sacred me ... this one my fave .. i've seen it countless times ... it great cast , great director .. willem dafoe amazing it ... i'd say out all movies he , i'd rate this one his best ! not best movie edward furlong though ( lt ; -- i'd say t2 him ) , but he played his role well .. ya gotta love danny trejo ... he great every movie . this movie pretty realistic ... i mean it written actual convict .. edward bunker ... there actual convicts movie extra , not mention trejo ( who real con well ... special features this movie explains this , gives interviews ... special features awesome .. ) . if you like this movie , look into some more works edward bunker , especially his books , " education felon " etc ... i can't express enough how great movie , so i'll end my review here ... if i could give this movie infinite amount stars i would , cuase it good . when i searching copy it , lowest it sold $30 , that what i ended up paying mine ... but i ready pay $50 it ... it definitely worth whatever price it sells ..	1
this arguably herzog greatest film . fact he not only finished film under most trying circumstances ever faced film director ( only apocalypse now comes close ) , but film true spectacle , amazing watch awe inspiring . kinski perfect fitzcarraldo , madman who wants build opera house inquitos natives . he wasn't even supposed film , but jason robards got sick during production , leave film . herzog carried kinski , notoriously difficult ( but brilliant right director ) actor gives role right amount passion surprising grace ( especially end film ) . location shooting superb , but when you see ship actually moving up mountain , you completely awestruck . even though you only see it move few inches , those inches feel like miles . this film should seen tangent burden dreams , because it makes you appreciate scope herzog achievement . this grand example herzog filmmaking , one most imaginative , daring films ever made ....	1
i never thought movie criminals could dumber than ones " dead presidents , " but kidnapping-for-drug-money plan this movie absolutely worse . soon i saw where this movie going , i just shook my head watched idiots go ( i'm talking characters -- not real actors ) . this movie pretty silly me . timberlake absolutely terrible thug , two people forewarned me this , but i figured i'd see myself . every time i heard him curse glanced his tattoos , i laughed louder . his friends even more entertaining ; bunch suburban kids who thought kidnapped cool ; guy so high out his mind he didn't realize up down ; ransom kid who so excited " criminal " scene he completely seemed forget he danger . i don't know where movie stores put this one when it comes out sale , but it really should go into comedy section . scene where they go " buddy , buddy , buddy " made my stomach hurt laughing goofiness . i'm sure that'll copied off high schools everywhere . thing actual plot story ( different actors without druggies ) would've great ; but people who played roles absolutely so out touch point where it looked like i watching vanilla ice video , or something close it . i would've given it more stars if movie meant parody drug dealing , but previews , it sounds like company going drama . cons : i could've gone without hearing constant racial slurs this movie . it annoys me when people culture say it ; so it definitely annoyed hell out me hear several characters use certain words . i didn't find all funny .	-1
it not best episode though it crowning piece . not best because there far too many too long battles which quite repetitive effects . but it essential episode understand or extract some meaning this fantasy . vanity human king turning criminal since he tries burn his surviving son , who he not like , alive . hobbit frodo who entrusted mission carrying ring back into pit hell also shown vain somewhere his mission . vain because he believes he entrusted this mission because he special , though fact it mission going make him future somewhat special . vain too because he not understand he cannot succeed alone . there help sam dramatically shown essential fulfill his mission , not betray it , not let some kind disgusting giant spider deep caves earth distract him rob him ring , which it actually , not fall into pit himself underground traitor ring . but lesson more us than hobbit himself since he not seem learn his simple lesson very easily . main lesson batttle only won when everyone , including dead come up fight . this inclusion dead into fight makes it slightly spectacular allusion jesus other saviors who go down into limboes or hell some salvaging adam eve or euridyce . but meaning - film - comes some strong imagery used fair level insistance . world cut two . dark forces evil one side whom ring returned order destroyed , all others representing light . contrast light darkness , underground traps , caves tunnels open air countryside , blue sky very dark grey if not black sky , more or less civilized use fire good side its evil use bad side . final battle front black gate looks like wall finally crumbles sinks into ground end like some other wall fell 1989 . only modern vision since when books written wall question not even stand . since then this image turned around since two walls built but no longer forces east or north , but forces west , one palestine other mexico northern border ( case north not supposed bad side , yet ) . history twisty times . books written during cold war they represent this vision time world cut two , black white , etc . this today changed too this simple splitting reality two not correspond reality though it still very active minds people who still think lot either/or line . so today , what used reflection cold war fear becomes rather simplistic we experience everyday how this approach world life leads catastrophes other swampy situations . end this third episode return peace quiet turns slightly emotional not say sentimental or even sentimentalese . too much crying indeed too much sadness compensated joy peace , love couple weddings . altogether it brings tale end but it not reach height second episode , though we see some inspiration recent series field fantasy , harry potter who links modern world this underground fantasy world like stephen king dark towerdr jacques coulardeau , university paris dauphine university paris 1 pantheon sorbonne	-1

lucio fulcis zombi 2 my opinion greatest zombie movie ever made[dawn dead close second]and should every horror fans collection . people say its rip off romeros films , but doesnt every zombie film take something night or dawn dead . romero basicaly created whole undead zombie genre . fulcis picture actually quite original . setting tropical islands south america very effective . zombies look amazing , much better than romeros blue shaded gut munchers . fulcis zombies rotting , decaying monsters . each one its own original qualities . only thing i dont love movie pacing . it takes like 40 minutes film get going , but once it get going its nonstop zombie gorefest . speaking gore , zombi 2 plenty it . wooden splinter through eye scene this day one most infamous gore scenes ever put onto film . if you havnt seen this movie then you should first punch youself face then go buy it immediatly .	1

my vote most underrated film 2002 tuxedo , bittersweet romance starring jackie chan jennifer love hewitt . chan stars jimmy tong , lovable misfit who owns antique bookstore . hewitt plays del blaine , bookish college student insatiable hunger word-puzzles . jimmy ( understandably ! ) enchanted love-inspiring curves coed lush body . though initially reluctant , del eventually swayed asian bookseller quirky charm ... his wardrobe ! jimmy woos his beloved aid confidence-enhancing outfit title . its second act , film turns into road odyssey . jimmy convinces his best friend rex ( played joe namath , former quarterback los angeles rams ) travel across country him search j.d. salinger , legendary author franny zooey . one film most endearing delights salinger cameo , his sole on-screen appearance . touched grace style , salinger resembles latter-day cary grant or silvery jimmy stewart , silver fox who win anyone over twinkle his eye . final scene candlelight dinner olive garden . when stars kiss , it clear chan more verve than men half his age . electricity two leads undeniable	1
this excellent movie all formation , training , ultimate disastrous ordeal under fire australian horse dragoon 1915 during ww i . mel gibson mark lee play two main characters , different backgrounds but similar their patriotic fervor superb running ability . movie three parts : first takes place australia where gibson lee introduced become friends ; second cairo where they train ; third gallipoli where they eventually slaughtered , thanks poor british planning failure british commanders muster up take initiatives when they became available . ( ironically , retreat gallipoli peninsula after operation doomed failure british planning masterpiece hardly man lost . ) second part bit too long , though first very good third superb . it meant , watching annihilation australians battle scenes excruciating . authentic feel period achieved through close attention details , russell boyd photography eye-popping . top-notch production all way	1
always one my favorites , it seems get better age , timepiece it . closer cloris leachman timothy bottoms i think one best closing scenes movies , ben johnson soliloquy fishing hole also memorable . if i one gripe movie there seems too much cybil shepherd , considering how great rest cast . but that quibble . its own way i think this movie everything " american graffiti " same time . says lot coming age also growing old understated , wistful fashion . great soundtrack , too . best kudo i throw this movie when mickey mantle watched it he broke out crying , it rang so true ( mick growing up godforsaken corner oklahoma same time this movie takes place godforsaken patch texas ) .	1
well .... i just recieved this disk i very high hopes ... let me say , most met .... but there couple things i got tired real fast ... first all , if i wanted see many crowd shots , i would bought " dancing party people : movie " .... i would loved see disk mostly man himself giant screen background ... would cool ... show me what it like crowd , not crowd itself ..... there couple quick shots chapter 14 , min into chapter show perfectly what i mean .... my other complaint man himself ..... he really comes across butt-load full ego .... many , many , many instances him striking " jesus christ pose " ... all my years going parties , i yet see dj this much he during this set .... other than those complaints , i nothing but praise it ..... i not checked out special features yet , just movie itself i truly dig it ... music top notch , quality picture sound supurb .... although this may not mean much , seeing how this my first review , i fully recommend this disk fans electronica everywhere ....	-1

" 2001 maniacs " , my opinion , only type horror movie that really , really hard get right 2000s : horror-comedy . everything else under horror banner - monster movies , ghost stories , psychological thrillers , slash/carnage-type horrors , etc . - all them lot great representatives recent years , all over world . there humorous moments number horror greats - " freddy vs . jason " , " final destination " series , " bruiser " , etc . - but almost all attempts full horror-comedies , my opinion , stalled - most them would better picking one style or other maybe trying inject little bits other instead walking line directly ( i admit i haven't chance see " slither " yet , but one look promising ) . " 2001 maniacs " huge success horror-comedy though , reminding one greats like " re-animator " " evil dead 2 " so gloriously plowed fields outrageously bizarre . three groups young travellers - least two them heading off popular spring break destination - take wrong detour end up surreally odd town where it still seems pre-civil war old south , eve large annual festival , populated characters ranging merely odd ( sometimes likably so ) truly disquieting . locals familiar cars modern technology but just don't seem any ; travellers assume this all tongue-in-cheek re-creation old south , charmed enough overflowing hospitality some town residents ( including its gregarious mayor - wickedly played robert englund ) they decide ditch their previous plans accept invitations stay weekend enjoy festivities . wincing but overlooking truly tasteless parts ' re-creation ' , they settle what looks fun weekend all - until things start take creepier more threatening tone ... talented cast turn what could really stupid , crude comedy into something really flows film just enhances its weird vibe . several characters , judging their first moments movie , could turned out so excessively unlikable drag movie , but too averted you get know them . robert englund global treasure - he plays this role pefection - he almost all his movies - knows precisely what bring each moment . " 2001 maniacs " bloodily inventively violent , unpredictably quirky , sexy enough exposure keep both guy girl viewers happy . well-made unorthodox , it welcome addition 2006 rich horror offerings	-1

this 1984 performance " eugene onegin " kirov just marvelous . when they're their game , nobody performs russian opera like russians , this performance sense real occasion . it hard know where begin praise - voices , characterization , sets - they all terrific . all four main singers young , good looking , excellent stage presence , inhabit their characters superbly fine voice . drama very real here , everyone inside their role , even smaller parts . there not wobbly voice bunch . none old fashioned , curdly-voiced female singers use inhabit russian performances too often . sergei leiferkus poised , dark onegin , even gaining one sympathy end . tatiana novikova lovely , lyrical soprano radiant tatiana , totally believable both young ingenue later gremin wife . larissa dyadkova joyous outgoing without going overboard olga , yuri marusin impassioned tortured lensky . prince gremin famous love aria act 3 , sung nikolai okhotnikov , so poignantly it practically brings down house . staging traditionally , best befits opera , lovely costumes beautiful , evocative sets would hard match . glorious ! unlike first two amazon reviewers this video , i thought picture sound just fine . fact , balance voices orchestra model clarity , both well projected easy hear . conducting yuri temirkanov ( who not mentioned kultur dvd presentation ) quite broad very poignant , yet he all requisite drama fire when called . temirkanov particularly good transitions lyrical dramatic subjects . kirov orchestra very fine , special kudos first horn . chorus dancers must also receive special praise . good russian choruses special ring them so right this music , dancing ( this , after all , kirov ! ) joy . among few mostly insignificant caveats some excess audience coughing , some minor picture flutter distance shots , tendency film too much dancing too far away . nothing get remotely boil . this dvd classic status written all over it . easy 5 stars	1

this review refers " les liasions dangereuses " - 270 minute extended edition(wellspring dvd ) ... i love this story try see every version it comes out . this one made 2003 , wonderful jos�e dayan , purely exquisite . this tale deadly seduction updated adapted 1960 . good choice director , we get see it played out differently although much closer present , still gives feel 40 years ago , moralities key players might still considered bit shocker . this update , story revolves around center arts , run none other then woman we all love hate , madame de mereuil . she long time , off again lover , valmont scheme connive destroy relationships lives . revenge madame wish , valmont only too happy comply her wishes , knowing she his reward end . he best when seduction hand . but things get complicated valmont , when his heart takes unexpected turn towards madame tourvel . innocent bystanders , young c�cile de volanges virtuoso musician raphael danceny , also get pulled into web deceit . valmont wants out though , must find weakness put end madame merteuil . it marvelous tale wickedness . now , i know some may agree me no one compare john malkovich take valmont , but i must say , rupert everett quite convincing actually , physically , takes look devil himself . who else but catherine deneuve , could follow act like glenn close . deneuve take little different , she gives madame multi-faceted personality times even likeable . so we , audience , get drawn into her schemes well . she so beautiful , even now , one hardly take their eyes off her . nastassi kinski madame tourvel leelee sobieski cecile . both turning excellent performances . danielle darrieux , valmont wise aunt , who seems see all . it excellent production . beautiful vivid colors take you back 60 . fabulous costumes , scenery . presented widescreen(anamorphic ) 5.1 sound french english subtitles . it three part production . each part separate disc , each running hour half . sure catch lengthy conversation dayan special features . play game once more this absolutely mesmerizing update . merci beaucoup .... laurie	1
if you already own " half baked , " don't waste your money " fully baked edition " dvd , because extras huge waste time -- added comedy bits so poor it embarrassing , like something high school kids would produce . director commentary also thoroughly uninteresting -- unless you wanted play smoking game it -- take hit every time she says " funny .

steve railsback stars this imaginative different sci-fi film alien vampires . i first saw this when it came out liked it because it so different . special effects predate cgi , they not incorported into film , where films strength lies . moreover , plot itself extremely interesting suspenseful . steve railsback american air force officer assigned astronaut program . he only survivor his spaceship . when he lands back earth emergency pod , search what happened crew , what happening earth . there strange occurances beginning happen london , people beginning turn into vampires . aliens space made earth their giant blood bank , race destroy three aliens who landed earth . film very good , leaves you susense . i really liked way director , tobe hooper , used alien vampires film . different treat time . i recommend film , parts which dated , however , this not detract films suspense or thriller element . recommended . it definetly worth watch .

watching tv series dvd where you whole season go through whatever speed you wish , delightful treat . i hooked first season dvd almost felt post partum depression when it episode 13 finished i realized i didn't second season hand keep following adventures vic mackey all others barn farmington . quickly remedied one-click amazon two days later i second season hand . during this season you brought up quest hijack money train strike team , capt . acevada quest city council seat , thefurther marital problems vic mackey , civilian auditor report fallout many , many sub plots continue swirl through this amazing series . there no disappointment second season . once again , i found myself watching 13th episode wondering where time gone then scurring computer right after it finished order third season . series probably not everyone . there considerable violence , much bad language , some conversations sex sexual orientation not young ears , it adult fare it comes you like runaway freight train . it also compelling fascinating . i never seen anything like it tv	1
someone who practicing pilates quite awhile now , i am always lookout short pilates workouts which appropriate my intermediate level ; i also prefer my pilates videos mainly abs-focused . happily , this 20 minute overall body workout fit bill perfectly . although it purports full-body workout , it actually concentrates mainly abs area , some back work thrown counterbalance . also , performed instructor amy brown , this workout definitely intermediate level ( " beginner workout " referred dvd case simply amy assistant , liza , showing modifications , not separate workout ) . workout begins pilates breathing reclined position . then amy moves what she calls " hundreds " but which different version this exercise than i've ever seen before : she simply breathes her legs air her head up . fact , throughout this workout , amy adds many unique variations traditional pilates matwork , such doing twist while holding teaser . i also found sequencing exercises very different what i've come expect pilates . example , right after hundreds , amy goes into criss-cross , rolling like ball comes fairly late workout . however , i thought sequencing worked very well , especially amy tendency balance out series abs moves some brief back work ; i liked this lot . there only one side-lying move , but because i prefer abs work , i didn't mind this . thing i liked this workout pacing : amy higher number reps than you usually see pilates workout , but pace never rushed . other hand , this workout moves steadily no down time exercises . amy concludes workout few neck stretches , which i absolutely loved ! overall , i found this very enjoyable , thorough pilates workout , i know i get lot use it	1

" sealab 2021 " great show . fifteen minute episodes regularly managed pack twice many laughs your run-of-the mill half-hour sitcom -- it fast-paced hilarious . this season itself , however , show started going downhill slightly ( i think ) during episodes found season 3 set ( although " red dawn " " craptastic voyage " still couple my favorites ) . ( final ) episodes these season 4 dvds continued this trend , show just not quite good its last few episodes . however , this one some good stuff -- i liked " shrabster " lot , though i don't think all my fellow fans agreed one . we all agree , however , " cavemen . " , course , none episodes bad " der dieb " ( probably least funny episode series ) . if you haven't seen " sealab 2021 " yet , yourself favor pick up season 1 first -- it best ; you'll laugh your head off through " stimutacs . " this one completists , but they'll completing great show -- ya gotta love " sealab . " fignuts	-1
i hadn't seen this while until recently , it still me my toes . this came out when i high school , but i didn't see it until after i graduated ... but i remember hype it " racy " . i really didn't know what think it first ... but after seeing it few times , it grew me . maybe it sex ... or crime drama thriller ... killers getting away killing ... or combination above . i remember hearing reading stone mixed-review performance beforehand , but after seeing it myself , i personally thought it fit character . you never really trust her , although times you almost want . i hadn't even really seen douglas any movies before this . if you liked this , than fatal attraction must see well ( i didn't see fa until after this one ) . throw here beautiful score jerry goldsmith ( which classical musician i noticed ) , well what become one my favorite dance tracks since i heard it high school , la tour " blue " dance club scene roxy . far flaws , i agree reviewer realism her antics she getting questioned . what wrong these guys , what really makes her so special ? they really haven't seen anything like her , polygraph guy says ? that main thing bothered me , but it movie , long you know , don't take it too seriously . there lots funny moments , esp . curran friend gus ... " that magna cum laude ***** fried up your brain ! " i didn't know this same director starship troopers showgirls , but this far better 3 . i think this one those movies where you either like it or you don't . again , movies aren't always supposed realistic , so just appreciate it what it . some movies keep you watching it more than once , others don't ... you don't always valid reason why . me , this just one those movies :)	-1
here thing : northern exposure one greatest series ever grace airwaves . no matter what music playing behind it , it still same scripts , same actors , same plotlines , same energy cast , same spirit show . if you actually remember every scrap music played during original run series cbs , try this out : whenever you hear different music what you think ought there , just hum missing music yourself . problem solved , right ? would it nice if original music included these sets ? maybe . it effect show any way whatsoever ? hardly . it still brilliant show , dvds close we're ever going get original show . take what you get , folks , because they didn't release them all ..	1

i watched this directors other movie " dancer dark " while i didn't like it , i felt it very different cookie cutter movies hollywood turns out , so i gave this movie chance 2 1/2 hours later i found myself wondering if director this movie anti-depression drugs or what ? this darkest most nightmare induceing film i ever seen . story young girl who marries finds love outside her faith , only her husband cripled , just not what i ever want see again . some may like it , but directors(in both films i seen)must fun around , both films kind leave you so dumps you feel(at least i do)unclean seen it ! i find myself hopeing this man finds himself some help , because he seems very down life all humans world . some may like it i said , but i'd watch 24 hours test patterns before i'll watch this kind downer movie ever again !!!!!!	-1

great military movie . it shows what airmen during vietnam war ( or american war , if you're reading this vietnam ) wanted - take fight enemy . great wish airmen come true big screen . retired air force member , i laugh all naval antics shore leave because today military makes them verboten . carrier landings bars angeles city or olongapo no longer exist since us military ordered out there . still , guys great fun letting loose this movie then faced death when time came . scene where willem dafoe his pilot avionics failure , it made me sit edge my seat , because former avionics technician who worked f-16s , i could feel fear subtle panic they facing during battle . i always ensured my avionics components worked so our aircrews would not experience sensation . note : captain , who trying aircrew disobeying orders , fred dalton thompson ; he wasn't mentioned credits some reason . great movie storyline , superb antics troops shore leave , really cool aerial footage . must add your war film collection	-1

first i'll say this movie classic kung-fu movie providing everything you could ask , including : blind villianrandom fight tournamentone-armed heroflying guillotinemany different types fightersthe precursor dhalsim street fighter2booby traps one even two hit combosafter reading other reviews here i feel need talk quality dvd . i think lot reviewers way too picky their expectations . this freaking late 70 kung-fu movie made overseas budget couple thousand dollars i'm guessing . if you want see slick glossy movie perfect quality then rent jet li newest straight video movie possibly starring dmx . i understand quality could better , but who cares ? what you really expect when you buy this kind movie ? sure , some parts dubbing suddenly switched subtitles then switched back minute later , but just adds whole cheesy kung-fu experience . if this dvd wasn't good enough you quaility otakus then grow pair restore movies yourself . seriously , eat it	1
this very good movie i watched my " horror classics collection : 50 pack " ( asin : b0001hagtm ) i got amazon ( under $20.00 ! ) . so first off , i would recommend buying 50 pack where you get 2 other vincent price movies ( bat last man earth ) 47 other good movies almost same price buying this movie itself . far this movie goes , there few suspenseful parts you wonder what going happen . mainly , movie give you some memorable quotes , vincent price always deliver great voice his . all characters good job acting ( typist great scream ! ) . some parts seem bit unbelievable some questions don't seem get answered , but who really cares ? only 75 minutes long , this movie better than most horror movies come out today unoriginal go shock value . so while this might more murder mystery than " horror " movie , it worth watch you'll satisfied end ... unless course , you not like black white movies , if case , then you probably wouldn't reading this review . p.s. i love gary . taylor review when he says : " price plays it slightly prissy , very high-camp manner tremendous dose black humor which he so famous . " that so true	-1
i theory : audiences getting smarter . whereas before big hollywood movie massive marketing push would've all rage , now people starting know better . they're realizing terrible movie terrible movie no matter how often we see julia roberts deal more romantic comedic mishaps or much stuff michael bay destroy . so when movie comes like john malkovich , or memento or even visually impressive like matrix , we stand up take notice . building career largely inventive music videos , first time director spike jonze comes out gate probably most unconventional comedy you'll see . loserly craig schwartz ( john cusack , always good ) aspiring puppeteer who can't get any work . then he his dishevelled looking wife lotte ( cameron diaz ) leaving their small new york apartment pets everywhere since lotte pet store worker . craig , due his puppeteering skills gets accepted company located , amusingly , 7 1/2 floor , complete cramped ceilings . he also strong attraction one his co-workers , feisty maxine ( catherine keener ) . one day while working , he discovers small day going inside he finds out he see world through john malkovich eyes 15 minutes unceromonious dump new jersey turnpike ditch . craig maxine get idea : charge 200$ people experience john malkovich which novel idea until lotte goes through feels deeper connection , especially around idea maxine . then we bizarre love square or star or something since craig loves maxine who loves lotte but only when lotte inside john malkovich ... ' head . try not wrap your head around it since it better explained movie after awhile you don't even worry stuff like vessels or portals , you just go it . casting course important no one seems wasted , even diaz , who i normally can't stand . real treat though course malkovich since times you almost can't tell if he acting or if he really quirky . then there comedy which subtle first-was-funny-but-now-it-ain't like 7 1/2 floor small ceilings but then film shows you what happens when malkovich steps through his own portal it becomes not only technical marvel but one flat-out funniest things i've seen lately . only problem story certain point it shifts gears film almost speed walks its climax rather than lurching forward , like it shot foot . like amazon review says , i don't know if film warrant repeat viewings you get more out it every time you see it but first viewing quite something	-1

until i browsing through showtime television other night . i like robin williams , so i figured it worth checking out i'm actually really glad i . i'd never seen movie advertised so i didn't know anything plot . basically , williams plays man who known ' cutter ' . cutters take memory implants people brains when they die scan their entire lives make one hour or so ' remembering ' type thing dead person funeral . many people really like idea it , while others think memories best left remembered your own . there some indication picketing christian groups who think it against god use implants . everything william life surrounds one event , he unable remember clearly , but carried him guilt event , until one day , while cutting man who recently died , he see boyhood friend his it triggers quest find out where this man what happened him ... hopefully alleviate his guilt over even t.t urns out , he wasn't remembering things exactly way they happened . we lot human beings ... our emotions taint our perceptions , but one thing memory implants don't feel , so they record it exactly it happened . i won't reveal much more so not spoil plot , but i say movie good , but ending left bit desired . all all , it worth watch	-1

there no doubt this movie classic , after watching it once i could see why . after repeated viewings movie started grow me . movie isn't scary i though it would initially , however it still quite scary movie . i would certainly rate this movie amongst my favourites all time . some people say movie starts off bit slow drag places but i disagree . it start off father merrins story or else movie plot would make no sense . whole movie gripping harrowing . this essential view anyone who loves good gruesome shock now	1

sometimes film version novel falls greatly short original material ( demi moore execrable 1995 re-invention scarlet letter ) other times motion picture rises far beyond story upon which it based : happily , this version last mohicans probably foremost example latter possibility . this simply among my favorite movies all time , how anyone fail swept up this one mystifies me . telling superior version james fenimore cooper hopelessly plodding 1826 classic , verdant appalachians north carolina standing 1750 new york book , there everything one could want here , violent war , tender love scenes , stirring score , panoramic captures natural beauty so perfect it little short sin show this movie anything but widescreen format . daniel day lewis , always captivating his performances , delivers central character , heroic white man raised mohican , hawkeye ( here re-named nathaniel breen ) who first leads band newly-arrived scots through danger british outpost wilds , then later after surviving brutal massacre , tracks woman he loves across frontier hostile huron village , where he undertakes courageous rescue . that course razor-thin description multi-faceted plot , but trust me , there more going here than i could easily describe review three times this size . this director cut took me moment appreciate , since i'd seen theatrical release so often vhs , but watched both versions now , i think there scope this release dvd enhances film even mega-fan like me .	1
when it comes sex there few basic positions everyone seems use . missionary , doggy , spooning , oh my favorite ... woman top . although video focuses basics , they build these adding variations each these well add seated side side positions . additional pointers provided hosts how prolong sex , how make sex better , well different techniques make your partner scream joy . filming tasteful . models attractive . presentation information straight forward . overall , i give this dvd 5 stars	1
up until today , i would given this wonderful movie , which we watched my spanish class , 5+ stars . but i not all like ending ; it very much ruined it me . i'm person who needs closure . yes , this movie demonstrating tragic topic should sad . but just cruel , end poor little girl singing how she so lost . we don't know her fate . i also felt roberto sort villainized character . he point gaby lose mother . i hope alicia , when she left , going get gaby . what i would like know what they decided sara , her possible grandmother . again , i need closure ! i expecting depressing ending , but not left hanging like this ! arghhhhh . i also problem gaby born captivity . it makes scene where little boys suddenly burst into her room kind pointless ; it meaningful , powerful , one my favorite scenes until i realized she just startled . i guess it still meaning , but , i dunno . just my nitpicky , i guess . i also want know who pedro . also , what gaby possible parents got them arrested . i realize it could something very minor , but it would nice know . all i know they all could gun-toting revolutionaries . overall though , it wonderful movie i am considering buying it myself . i especially loved scenes involving las madres abuelas de la playa de mayo . acting fantastic . i just am bothered all these questions never answered	-1

i agree some previous reviewers : this matthew bourne his best : he genius story-teller choreographer . his swan lake become top notch variation classic ballet his recent nutcracker bound become same . those us who no chance ever seeing this production staged theater , this dvd not missed . i find watching it arousing ( full meaning word ) , emotionally shattering , ultimately cleansing manner classic tragedy . i agree others previous reviewers : nervous , mtv style camera work distracts dancing overall composition this brilliant theater piece . his commentary bourne offers sort reasoning hyperactive cutting back forth but it comes across after-the-fact attempt save integrity his own work . there indeed too many close-ups prevent viewer seeing dancers dance , just eye settles movement camera shifts . but i found second viewing i could watch sections dvd slow motion without sound track could see appreciate lot more bourne remarkable sense pattern movement terrific discipline energy dancers . i give this dvd five stars because this only version i am ever likely see even its directorial flaws it conveys high artistry erotic energy not only bourne reworking bizet carmen but also essence original opera . i think bourne work staying power we treasure his productions over years , above all perhaps magnificent swan lake . but where dvd his cinderella set wwii london ?	1

i love this movie few reasons . one those reasons i'm huge fan previous film ' whole nine yards ' which this serves sequel . next fact bruce willis one best underrated actors out there captivates my attention every performance he gives . third , biggest reason i love this film little scene where jimmy ( willis ) oz ( perry ) visit local pub get little ( or lot ) drunk . whole scene worth price rental . i guess since it reminds me so much myself my friends ( i'm emotional drunk ) whole morning after thing so way it would happen . all all laughs there , some forced gags bit cheesy . ' whole nine yards ' far superior film , but this sequel not without it moments bruce willis matthew perry great comic team . bruce tackle everything action comedy drama should recognized little more . this may not end up your favorite title but it won't your least . premise follows oz jimmy they try rescue oz wife ( jimmy ex ) mob boss trying get revenge jimmy . amanda peet plays jimmy wife whose fed up softy jimmy become trying tough contract killer jimmy once . there subplots twist end makes this more than no-brainer , but fact still remains film makes little sense ... but it doesn't really matter . just sit back , relax , don't think it enjoy it what it ... or least watch drunk scene , then pop ' whole nine yards ' really enjoy yourself	-1

this one greatest games i missed , 3 quarters anyway . i only saw 4th qtr wished i seen entire game . now i see this entertainingly high-scoring , last-minute affair many future nfl stars this dvd . previous reviewer stated though , video/image quality somewhat poor(the audio isn't great either ) . during some replays or image transitions , you see some pixellated images . closer you screen , more noticeable flaws course overall it definitely not up quality dvd standards . said , it still watchable visuals usually good enough most part color vivid if you watch it its natural 4:3 mode , it looks really good sharp times . ( note : i watching dvd 52 " rca hdtv-compatible big-screen philips 60 " hd-built tv . it looks better if you view it fullscreen mode , but i like watch it panoramic/ 16:9 view my big-screen , which unfortunately stretches images little hence extra pixellation ) . content , it delivers this area . * handful brief featurettes concerning university texas football team , emphasis vince young . * game its entirety , including pre-game bit ferrel/usc vs matt mccounaghy(sp)/texas . * get this ... two condensed , bonus highlights great game texas ohio state , blowout texas ou ! i not expecting this pleasantly surprised they there(esp classic ohio state ) . ( note : these highlights terrible bootleg-looking image quality , but still watchable)this how i would rate this release : 5 stars , if you loved game or love college football , you've got it your collection . 5 stars , if you're texas fan . national championship you won , plus bonus features including 2 other game highlights . 3 stars , if you loved game or texas longhorns demand only best picture quality available because it . this dvd let you down case . personally , i thought game great enough offset not-so-great image quality(which still very watchable imo comparable other releases this type ) . overall , highly recommended ; but i wish they would better job putting these dvd together concerning quality control	1

i now seen two judy garland movies -- wizard oz this one . all bets off third . i could go singing morbid distinction judy final film . she plays -- get this -- world famous tough-talking yet vulnerable vocalist tormented personal life appetite prescription medication martinis . quite stretch . overall , this movie confused hybrid melodramatic soap opera , london travelogue , " live " judy garland stage performance . it probably filed under " musicals " your video store , but that not really accurate -- nobody spontaneously breaks out into wizard oz-style song dance production numbers . instead , tunes performed judy alter-ego " character " jenny bowman pseudo-live sold out ( course ) solo shows london palladium . she sings handful oddly forgettable unremarkable showstoppers , including title song which features unfortunate lyrics such these : i could go singing , til cows come homeand rooster starts crow , crow , crowwhen i see your eyes , i go all out i must vocalizetil you shout " enough already ! " i could go singing , til moon turns pinkanything faust ink-a-dink-a-dink ! not even judy manage deliver this stuff convincingly , but she gives it her best sho t.t he notable exception little-known gem torch song , " it never you " kurt weill , which certainly deserves heard more often . there also some remarkable instrumental soundtrack music mort lindsey ( co-composer jeopardy theme song ) , especially zippy " helicopter ride " symphony experimental , ives-ian " matt dilemma " interlude . you get see judy son ( matt -- dilemma he doesn't yet know he judy son ) performing gilbert sullivan drag , if that kind thing you're int o.o therwise , jack klugman , dick bogarde , rest cast merely props judy stage , though kid who plays matt likeable enough chap i guess . dramatically , though , i could go singing awfully cornball , overwrought stuff , it all comes abrupt , unsatisfying conclusion . it also doesn't help mgm dvd cheapo affair no bonus features speak ( no , " theatrical trailer " doesn't count ) only barely adequate mono sound . grade :	-1

out seemingly endless amount slasher films released early 1980s , house sorority row stands out superior example genre . graduating seniors theta chi want one final party before leaving college facing real world . there just one problem . their rather puritanical house mother , mrs. slater , absolutely forbids them engage any activites involving booze , premaritial relations , drugs , or anything else made college so much fun circa 1983 . so , logically enough , girls react pulling prank unintentional result apparently killing old witch . unfortunately , mrs. slater bad manners die just party get started . what group up-and-coming sorority girls ? well , they basically end up dumping mrs. slater house filthy pool then go attend perhaps most uncomfortable party their lives . however , party gets going , they discover mrs. slater body no longer pool . , night progresses , girls start disappear one one unseen stalker makes its way through sorority house , armed only slater surprisingly sharp cane ... needless say , plot description doesn't really this film justice . however , slasher films -- whole -- probably most predictable genres . mark good slasher film it holds audience interest even though audience already knows pretty much everything that going happen . this task house sorority row easily accomplishes . whole , entire cast gives performances cut above what one usually expects this type film . if victims all pretty much types , actresses playing them all likeable rather endearing chemistry . though most them clearly too old just now graduating college , they believable group who friends four years . its own way , house sorority row almost becomes diner all female cast slasher subplot . all girls well but standout performances given kate mcniel ( who probably one best so-called " final girls " slasher film history ) , harley kozack , especially eileen davidson . vicki , instigator prank , davidson probably one most likeable " bad girls " ever . her growing exasperation just how difficult it cover up one simple accidental homicide borders both hilarious oddly touching . house sorority row directed mark rosman it his sure touch elevates this film above its genre . he protegee brian depalma obvious watching film smoothly executed set pieces which manage create level suspense absent most other slasher films . towards end film , mcniel must face killer while under influence sedative rosman shoots these scenes her point view psychedelic style threatens actually give good name psychedelic styles . all all , rosman creates sadly underrated thriller house sorority row	-1

i've fan alejandro gonzalez inarritu since 2003 ' 21 grams ' so when they aired `amores perros ' ifc few weeks back i just watch it . following same formula ' 21 grams ' inarritu gives us brilliant story interconnects lives three very different people very tragic event . we first octavio ( gael garcia bernal ) who living his brother ramiro ( marco perez ) his wife susana ( vanessa bauche ) . ramiro abusive cold this leads heated affair octavio susana . order make enough money two them run off together octavio begins fighting his rott money . we next daniel ( alvaro guerrero ) , tv producer who gives up his life his family order pursue relationship supermodel valeria , but tragic car accident causes their relationship unravel , their nerves get frayed their love slowly painfully die . last story trilogy revolves around el chivo ( emilio echevarria ) , homeless man who makes money hitman . when el chivo hired businessman kill his partner only find out his partner also his brother , he chance teach them both lesson learn something himself . it may car crash links these three stories , but it people within them , lives they live lessons they learn connect them such deeper more meaningful level . acting brilliant here , both bernal echevarria turning out award worthy work , truth told debut directorial piece inarrito delivers near flawless film	1

highest praise i give any movie , while watching it , i begin dread fact it end . i found this story enjoyable .... then some . lead character , ripley , presented well-aged version sociopathic con artist played matt damon " talented mr. ripley " . played inimitable john malkovich , this older , wiser ripley infinitely more sophisticated , sly , treacherous , fascinating . he lives wonderful italian villa gorgeous wife/mistress who knows embraces his true nature . when publicly insulted neighbor , played dougray scott , he initiates plot gain revenge , ultimately turning innocent man into hired killer who then tortured his own conscience .... punishment could never affect consciousless , sociopathic mr. ripley . malkovich unique actor , never content merely show up speak his lines convincingly , he actually becomes character ... every devilish smile , lick lips , flash anger , etc . becomes expressive action character , not actor . he so completely suited this role it impossible envision anyone else playing par t.t he dialog wonderful .... complex , intellectually stimulating , natural . indeed , some comments nature ( absence ) conscience guilt achieve level fine literature . conversations generally riveting , humor generally very dark , suspense reaches hitchcockian levels . scott character , who dying leukemia , sinks deeper deeper into depravity his hapless plight , he actually begins seek , rather than fear , death . this very sophisticated , emotionally involving story appeal strongly mature viewers . it never received attention it deserved , ranks among best " undiscovered " movies . i give it my highest recommendation	1
this stunning romance thriller . it breathes like hitchcock . after watching it i went back beginning film when jeweler asked max ( vincent cassel ) which three beautiful rings ( how he described them ) he choose . max think it we find out who he choose end film . he not sure his engagement muriel when he overheard voice his lost love lisa ( monica bellucci ) . there he must find her find out why she left him two years ago without word . he finds clues which may lead him unsuspecting surprise . music camera work excellent you follow characters throughout story keeps you thinking .	1
many us growing up , leonard bernstein * * american music . this excellent , thrilling pbs biography captures essence bernstein . he flamboyant actor podium , but it never seemed forced . his performances seemed intensify music -- he like speaker quot ; spinal tapquot ; went up 11 instead just 10 . watching this , you begin feel music-intoxicated bernstein himself must . this documentary doesn't whitewash his dark side -- substance abuse , ridiculous radical-chic politics , certain predatory sexuality , deep unhappiness struck him middle age ( after he world his feet . ) he turns 70 , you see dissipation written all over his face . but he man great musical gifts who changed american culture , this fast-paced video captures very well	1
not very realistic movie , but very enjoyable . whoopi almost her best . doesn't pluck heart strings like " color purple " , not moving " clara heart " , but certainly showcases her comedic talents . loved " silver box " " tropical fish " comments . some very funny parts require real acting talent . thoroughly enjoyable film best enjoyed someone watch it you .	-1

there really not much i add plotwise other excellent reviews here amazon . what i say though helena bonham carter often referred " queen costume dramas " which unfortunately pigeonholed her into some kind one dimensional charicature herself some eyes . well .... it henry james ' wings dove ( one better james " novel adaptations screen ) under very able direction iain softley where " mrs. tim burton " blossoms shows she pair eyes express complete range emotions without saying word . ( didn't norma desmond , great silent screen star sunset boulevard say , " we didn't words ... we said it our eyes ! " ? ) . though wings dove certainly fairly engaging story it own right ( it melodrama certainly follows some formulas ) , it miss bonham carter beyond-admirable performance makes this beautifully filmed streets canals venice tragic love triangle really worth watching alone . some actresses so fit bill their characters ( i am reminded meryl streep sophie choice fernanda montenegro central station , currently helen mirren queen)that ever consider remake down line some director would mean outdo what already perfection . bonham carter hit absolute career defining moment this film . here she not ingenue 1983 room view , but full come-of-age bonifide star who received both nominations hollywood foreign press academy . she deserved every bit those accolades role kate , wings dove really kate story anyway . supporting cast , linus roach more than suitable merton plays well opposite miss carter . i , personally , never found parts americans played alison elliot elizabeth mcgovern anything all . i truly feel miss elliot fails capture necessary fragility/emerging sexual woman role any kind true conviction millie theale . miss mcgovern , part limited best , but there not much there delivery nor look	-1

perhaps it success other , recent randolph scott westerns released this past year dvd , but now warner brothers releasing very reasonably priced triple-headers two 3-film packs classic scott westerns 1950s , it indeed great news fans classic " little " western , randolph scott , who many ways epitomized western star 1940s ' 50s . these three titles purchased together three more set pitance . although warner scotts not generally superior columbia products , they still superior westerns very entertaining , filled action kind dramatic adventure so treasured fans genre . several , including colt . 45 , fort worth , riding shotgun , very good . here hoping warner release carson city ( one best early 50s ) , sugarfoot , bounty hunter ... if they it , westbound , one seven budd boetticher directed scott films . i'd even enjoy seeing much-maligned shoot-out medicine bend ( young james garner) ! thanks , warner brothers	1

top fact it solidified steve mcqueen " king cool action " 1970 1960 . it always best not forget his more challenging films so much character development intimacy like papillon . i only wish this dvd more extras got better special edition treatment than it , but we all can't winners . nearly all mcqueen films got treatment past year or so , including my favorite bullitt . dustin hoffman early career proves impossible top graduate , straw dogs this well . i simply can't stress enough how great this movie , upon first view many years ago , i couldnt take my eyes off screen . sentiment still very much same i ability watch this film now over over it still hits me exact same way	1
i came into stuart gordon " king ants " expecting some weird blend science fiction horror . just look title . doesn't scream sci-fi/horror ? considering gordon other features almost always reside deep well blood soaked cinema , one could safely assume this picture would cover familiar ground . here guy who made films like " re-animator , " " castle freak , " remake " pit pendulum , " h.p. lovecraft adaptations " dagon " " beyond , " christopher lambert sci-fi vehicle " fortress . " i think it safe assume " king ants " should fall within these parameters , right ? boy , i wrong ! title " king ants " couldn't more misleading describing themes this movie actually covers . there no king , far i tell . there no ants , although they would quite difficult see unless they mutant ants stood fifty feet tall . instead , gordon gives us film adapted book charlie higson , film deals bad deal gone wrong subsequent bloody revenge wreaked upon principals unassuming housepainter who literally wrong place wrong time . well , least gordon penchant blood soaked cinema remains firm this project . sean crawley ( chris mckenna ) your average young guy just trying get housepainter when opportunity comes knocking one day form portly duke ( george wendt ) . two men strike up friendly rapport while working house , duke promptly invites his new friend meet most important individual . this person powerful construction contractor named ray mathews ( daniel baldwin ) , beefy thug love golf hatred certain accountant down city hall called eric gatley ( ron livingstone ) . mathews offers our boy sean specific sum money if he'll simply follow gatley around town report back his movements . it seems ray involved several shady schemes , schemes meaning kickbacks projects , eric nosing around hope saving city some money sending mathews slammer . crawley , always lookout few extra bucks , sees no harm tailing suburbanite . he heads over gatley home start his mission , can't help but notice accountant incredibly gorgeous wife . sean spends some time doing job reports back mathews . then something ominous happens . ray sean heart heart while mathews liberally gulps firewater . contractor seems indicate something " bad " should happen eric gatley , if something " bad " happens , big payoff might cards whoever carries out dirty deed . least this how crawley interprets conversation . next day he follows gatley home murders guy particularly brutal , bloody manner . then he turns up seeking payment mathews , but ray expresses anger what happened . he claims authorities all over him because they think he gatley bumped off . not only he refuse hand over cash , he tells crawley get lost . sean not sort chap take no answer , his persistent efforts get what owed him results kidnapping series extraordinarily brutal tortures inflicted upon him mathews , duke , few other stooges . much their everlasting detriment , ray company fail kill their former flunky . sean escapes , help most unlikeliest allies , returns full health goal seeking revenge his tormentors . end . i left bunch particulars out order not spoil film , but " king ants " really simple above summary . wronged man seeks revenge . that it nutshell . hands capable stuart gordon , however , movie manages entertain thanks number exploitative factors . first presence kari wuhrer , brunette movie actress who plays eric gatley wife susan here . through most unusual circumstances , she ends up offering help her husband murderer . her role also requires her some acrobatics her birthday suit this viewer greatly appreciated . second , gordon doesn't shy away violence . we've got golf club repeatedly hitting head , pools blood , refrigerator used murder weapon , gory showdown results all sorts ghastly indecencies . " king ants " contains more than enough bloodshed satiate avid gorehound . third , finally , gordon isn't above throwing few scenes weirdness just keep audience off balance . check out hallucination crawley experiences during his kidnapping . what heck thing all ? who knows , but it entertaining appropriately kooky . " king ants " sort category all itself . it doesn't really fit into field horror , it not entirely home standard revenge flick genre , either . if you like horror you like revenge shoot ' em ups , however , you'll probably enjoy gordon movie . i know i ; i would definitely watch this one again . dvd version film , extras abound . we get trailer , commentary track gordon , wendt , mckenna , lengthy behind scenes feature containing interviews many principal players . this short documentary interesting number ways , such learning it george wendt who played big role bringing this movie fruition . give " king ants " go if you get chance . it worth watching .	-1
" night heaven " opened 1983 terrible reviews even worse box office . it mainstay ten worst lists everywhere . it dubbed " flashdunce " after hit movie year . really , its not bad . insubstantial , yes . ill-conceived , yes . entertaining ? quite . lesley anne warren plays faye , speech professor local community college who marital problems . her husband whitney ( robert logan ) , emotionally stunted inventor , seemingly lost interest her she becoming depressed when her sister patsy ( deborah rush ) takes her out friends local strip club . there , faye surprised club star stripper , ricky rocket ( christopher atkins ) , same cocky student she just flunked her class . when he sees her audience , ricky virtual lapdance her , it isn't long before they plunged into affair . actually , there probably very good , serious film buried somewhere writer joan tewkesbury original script , which glossily directed oscar-winner john . avildsen , who went this fiasco " karate kid " . unfortunately , casting christopher atkins what obviously originally supporting role hurts film considerably . cast after his breakthrough role " blue lagoon " , atkins received star billing all film pre-release publicity . but warren logan lead characters , most screen time obviously main relationship film . this caused film quite obviously heavily reedited emphasize atkins character , who total jerk , completely amoral unlikable , poorly played one worst actors ever spit out hollywood system . this sinks film faster than " titanic " . result , what should serious examination marriage crossroads becomes smarmy sex-comedy/marital drama which disparate elements just don't fit . note brief 80 minute running time . this one film which i wish could reedited director cut , so we see what writer director original intent . instead , we forever saddled studio botched reedit . spite all this , " night heaven " remains entertaining easy watch . lesley ann warren gives good performance here , although i'm sure this film isn't listed her otherwise stellar resume . robert logan also quite good , although his presence bit eye-opener considering he best-known family films like " wilderness family " this film comes close soft-core porn any major hollywood studio film recent decades . deborah rush gives able support , there decent performance here actress named sandra beall ricky long-suffering girlfriend slick . late carrie snodgress also couple good scenes ricky mother . unfortunately , atkins ' horrible acting just negates performances everyone around him . it impossible excellent work when person you acting can't act save his life . it makes you appreciate warren work even more . she manages give good performance under circumstances commendable . one note : this film contains one sexiest love scenes i ever seen film , one only three reasons see it . other two ? warren performance bryan adams ' now-classic love them " heaven " , which plays its entirety over opening closing credits . when you take away seven minutes these sequences , leaves 73 minutes story , which makes cuts even more noticeable . " night heaven " one bomb early ' 80 should much better , but remains more entertaining than many much better films era . ** 1/2 ( out *****) ; ** execution ; *** entertainment value	-1

first , allow me clear up widely misunderstood notion . " minotaur " not receive its bad rap solely because it initially aired sci-fi channel . vast number elements , unrelated sci-fi network , contributed this particular disaster . monumental lack competent direction , nonexistent writing , laughable acting , " minotaur " would easily doomed itself failure any cable channel . what particularly troubled me most this film , however , its inexecusable waste two outstanding talents . rutger hauer tony todd . " hitcher " " candyman , " crying out loud ! how these two guys get suckered into throw-away roles they here ? they both deserve so much better ! , uh , not burst anyone bubble , but wasn't minotaur supposedly half man-half bull ? i admit my greek mythology tad bit rusty these days . but i seem remember reading up this specific legend my younger years grammar student . critter this here film seems little out place .

i confess big fan coen brothers , which why i surprised my response this film . cast die , it all makings terrific film . unfortunately , far it gets , cast cannot undo what screenplay seriously flawed , due its inability decide what type film it should . unfortunately , it looks if director could not make up his mind either , producing film neither fish nor fowl . first , i thought it would screwball type comedy , george clooney role would gone cary grant golden age filmmaking . then , it seems take direction altogether , if it supposed romantic comedy dark side or simply satire gone awry . who knows ? coen brothers surely don't . film lacks total surety identity kills it , despite stellar cast . it flop , pure simple . plot line fairly basic one . it slick , greedy grasping , unscrupulous matrimonial attorney ( george clooney ) , kind gives all lawyers bad name , greedy grasping gold digging beauty ( catherine zeta-jones ) , who gives all beautiful women bad name . their paths cross , chase . unfortunately , viewer not give rat behind either one them . there nothing would ingratiate them viewer , due two dimensional , leaden screenplay nowhere which laughs few far . if you die hard coen brothers fan , i am , yourself favor , rather than buy this film , rent it first . you thank me this advice , once you seen this film	-1
" caddyshack " absolute classic -- up there other personal favorites same era ( like " stripes " , " jerk " , " back school " ) . other reviewers noted , cast comedy perfection . rodney dangerfield , chevy chase , ted knight simply couldn't ( never ) better . practically every scene least one quotable line , often not , i find myself rattling off entire exchanges dialogue . one my favorite lines ty " i feel like hundred dollars .

this movie introduced me fred macmurray child . watching silliness laughing harmless fun , all based silly premise . this type movie sunday nights when i kid afterwards various local stations finally new disney channel before they started original programming adding other shows dubious ( but more " hip " ) nature . if you like silly fun whole family , check out this title or any other family movie features fred macmurray , kurt russell , tommy kirk , joe flynn , ken berry , keenan wynn ed wynn , hayley mills , jim dale , dean jones , tim conway , don knotts , robert morse , phil silvers , or mickey rooney . you won't disappointed !!	1
i'm so glad oscars turned out way they this year because no one more worthy receiving statue than martin scorsese . if you ask me , he should get one his every endeavor there never more consistent director genius history movies -- my biased opinion . his artistic integrity absolute body his oeuvre magnificent . i'm not sure how anyone else could made his landmark successes -- goodfellas , casino , taxi driver gangs new york -- any better . even secondary works like mean streets departed close perfect . this documentary , they go right primary sources , actors who worked him , means describing him . views jodie foster , paul newman , robert de niro , willem dafoe , joe pesci all recorded . i also liked scorsese insight music his movies separate character itself . i never considered before .	1
i saw this tv when it came out . i'm sure it made-for-tv movie , it should stopped there . i remember looking forward seeing it , then totally bummed out . i wasn't expecting it good original , but geeze , it shouldn't allowed same name or main character . totally different plot , totally corny . this made chick flick ? someone mentioned what his names blue eye , woman peril . if i remember he drive through utah idaho plays chicken cops . no cop going play chicken ! why doesn't he buy freakin ' plane ticket ? instead he tries kill himself so his wife nobody . arrggh	-1

mel gibson took quite risk when he directed starred this affecting , poignant look male bonding . he surrendered his movie-star looks plays deformed man , whose biggest " action " scene holding back his barking dog . nonetheless , man without face triumph gibson ; it moving , thoughtful examination prejudice , love growing up . he matched his performance stunning debut nick stahl ( who not equaled this performance subsequently ) . stahl perfect young boy whose need true father figure propels him seek gibson guidance preparing his acceptance into boarding school . usually daft margaret whitton offers understated effective performance his oft-married mother gaby hoffman good his young stepsister . although much smaller scope than many gibson subsequent films , i found man without face much more enjoyable than bombastic braveheart , it underappreciated achievement gibson career .	1

faith hathaway just graduated high school one week away going into army . she full hope life . robert willie ( man this movie based ) , his accomplice raped murdered her . she raped , stabbed 17 times , raped after she died . director this movie denied requests made faith mother , gave all attention only person who deserved die . where mercy faith ? where compassion faith ? where people protesting faith life ? finally where story mercy which denied faith ? what her suffering her family ? barely foot note this movie . ohh sister prejean discovered lie when it suits her case .	-1
shrek ( mike myers ) ugly green ogre who only likes life when he alone . naturally , he rather upset when his swamp invaded all kinds magical creatures . seems lord farquaad ( john lithgow ) trying create perfect kingdom . everyone knows you can't perfect kingdom magical creatures around . but shrek not going take this lightly . setting out talking donkey ( eddie murphy ) , he goes meet lord farquaad demand his swamp back . but farquaad other ideas . he looking someone go quest him . mission , rescue princess fiona ( cameron diaz ) fire breathing dragon . so he makes deal shrek - rescue girl , he his swamp back . naturally , shrek agrees deal . but fiona not all what shrek thought she'd like . she secret . all this makes perfect fractured fairytale . this computer animated movie riot . it takes many fairytale conventions turns them their ear . there also lots great small gags , usually expense classic story . disney . katzenberg obviously feels need get back his ex-employer . but , disney fanatic i am , i must admit some those jokes my favorites . way , movie develops great heart well subtly slips message loving people who they . animation , while bit rough " extras " wonderful main characters . only problem movie , it big one , crude humor . shrek ogre . we get it . fortunately , these jokes lessen movie progresses . there few jokes questionable young children well . course , most them probably won't get many jokes anyway . this fairytale adults . fun one	-1

i thoroughly entertained this 4-dvd set , basically because dyn-o-mutt character i always laughed my you know what off . his malfunctions coupled blue falcon seriousness my opinion what make series hilarious . lots credit goes vocal delivery gary owens who spite ridiculous situations his character put through thanks " dog wonder " , watching blue falcon slow burn malfunctions dynomutt then hearing him call his side-kick " dog blunder " , etc etc . well , me it funny but my sense humor off wall anyway . frank welker voices dynomutt . scooby side collection , i enjoyed programs ... pure nostalgia reasons if nothing else , scooby-dum makes appearance well . i give dvd set 4 stars because some same reasons discussed other reviews . this complete collection episodes aired under banner " scooby-doo/dynomutt hour " best my knowlege . however , mumbley , if i'm not mistaken , later added show title well later when several additional blue falcon-dynomutt scooby shorts produced { not full half-hour episodes , 7-8 minute shorts } . each dvd there contains menu selections course . however only one disc provides bonus material ... dvd #4 ... side 2 . i also search each dvd find masterpiece segment , which only runs little over 7 minutes , giving spotlight wonderful voice actors cartoon ... including what could one don messick last interviews early-mid ' 90s . clip don isn't dated it not certain when he ... he passed away 1997 so it safe say it before 1997 . frank welker shows us his vocal tricks ... he portrayed both fred dynomutt series ... oh , casey kasem also featured . anyone ears tell casey voice shaggy plus few cops criminals { including swamp rat one episodes } . casey , don , frank there nicole jaffe { velma } heather north { daphne } gary owens { blue falcon } . gary also narrates segment bonus selections side 2 dvd #4 recalling history scooby , which includes appearances fred silverman one half ruby-spears team created program . whole , nostalgia , i give dvd set 4 stars . like others said , it would've nice official opening credits theme songs here .	-1

this movie many ingredients make it truly great , including phenomenal cast , lead cate blanchett , great scenery cinematography . actors playing elizabeth , cecil , walsingham spoke acted admirably , each phrase spoken such honesty feeling , but words themselves rendered performances useless . director author script greatly misunderstood characters material . they should read elizabeth first biography elizabeth jenkins . it useless say movie not need historically accurate but only entertain : author director more historically accurate , they would not created unbelievable character they created elizabeth , who turn hysterical , defeatist , overbearing , childish , tyrannical , who never shows her core intelligence , her great love her people , who private core described her motto " semper eadem " , always one . elizabeth ruled her advisors , she not totally ruled them . she would not put up norfolk screaming her across council table , nor would burleigh allowed it . cate blanchett wonderful acting presence pearls thrown before swine , wasted character portrayal totally lacked any integrity , much less truth . how could director think woman he trying portray any kind real woman ? ending me blushing embarassment one all . we laughably given william cecil wimpy ineffective , walsingham mastermind behind throne . one reviews said director inspired rush play walsingham much like hindu god krishna . i suggest he should first read some english history	-1

let me accept fact lotr my most beloved film i already own extended editions films one set ! i'm really not surprised see new line coming up edition trilogy . films like these they squeeze collectors much they !! still , inspite this new set containing both theatrical versions extended cuts films also much hyped costa botes documentaries , my advise anyone buying lotr first time is- not buy this set ! spend little more you get all movies full 6.1 dts ex glory , alongwith hours endless in-depth bonus features which probably you'll spend rest your life watching !! please aware , these new editions not contain dts tracks , no commentary tracks director , weta workshop or cast . all you get both versions crammed into one single disc just one documentary bonus second disc ... nothing else . it would better idea new line released documentaries separately without forcing consumer buy films again .... even this not end , once hd format gains little more acceptance , they'll excuse come up new version trilogy ! beware , extended edition set ultimate lotr experience , terms films or bonus features . go get it ... its worth all money spent !	-1
first all , who spastic genius who decided concert films change camera angles every five seconds ? this terribly anoying , especially when every third shot same audience members . this may fun home video , but not mass marketed commercial release . dance hall crashers awesome band . much fun seeing dhc concert their highly kinetic stage presence . it would great if this dvd concentrated band whole not just different extreme closeups switched dizzying rate . since dhc supposed focus , why director insist featuring so many shots audience ? it gets your nerves . i love dhc . their live cd permanent place my playlist . but this horribly made dvd only made it through three songs . perhaps if i front stage night , i would appreciate it more .	-1

this movie much better than " vanilla sky . " " vanilla sky " mostly copied " open your eyes " but too obvious less convincing . ( tom cruise , though good some roles , didn't fit this role well . ) " open your eyes " takes little longer draw you , but once it you there it takes you far beyond where " vanilla sky " . also , jungian dream aspect " vanilla sky " poorly , whereas " open your eyes " represents dream experience very well . i recommend watching both movies before you buy one . but if you're going buy , get " open your eyes .	1

" forensic case prepared against sabich interesting because it predates active use dna criminal investigations . also , actions medical examiner " painless " kumagai ( shimono ) alternate comical ridiculous . nevertheless , trial centerpiece movie truly engrossing . trial judge larren lyttle ( winfield ) quite amusing speaks his mind . what we come realize middle film political intrigue , blackmail , sex influence * everyone * film . anyone even tangentially involved case dirty some respect . no one innocent . although you may guess true identity murderer before trial ends , i promise you never forget speech delivered denouement film . sabich says final minute film , " there crime . there victim . there * * punishment .

this great movie won best picture 1987 acclaimed both public critic . oliver stone directs his first movie vietnam ( second " born fourth july " , great movie ) telling his own experience going war . very beginning we see everything military they don't show when they recruiting ( ugly painful true war ) . movie goes until you see absolutely everybody completely nuts , doing drugs , killing randomly , even killing each other . this waht war men . you not human anymore . movie obviously rated violence , there some very tough scenes make anybody cry . toughest my opinion one village , when they kill -among others- mentally retarded ( course harmless ) young guy , woman . then they set village fire , rape some women , get away it . whole cast excellent , specially dafoe , who my opinion nails his character . dvd comes excellent terrific documentary called " tour inferno " ( 30 minutes long ) film stone , dafoe , depp , etc . talking movie . there also commentary stone captain there . this movie should mandatory all high schools america . if there no soldiers , there would no wars , war iraq looks lot like war vietnam . usa making same mistake again , government so blind see ( or maybe they don't care people , just business all weapons ' companies -bush ' frieds- making out it ! ) . but let smart , let just ignore government . they always get their way . let smart close all rotc programs schools . how we so hypocrites those programs schools ? education we really think our children deserve ? not happen any other place world , not even cuba . let invest money education . real education . how many trilion dollars bush wasted iraq so far ? how much money government invest education ? health ? people who live work america ? parents : teach your children . nobody should join army . let politicians -real leaders , not bunch idiots we today spread all over planet- job , we'll see how many would go . let commander chief go war himself . there no question it : there would no war . they wouldn't go . they would try negotiate , try solve conflicts peacefully . again , this great movie everybody should watch . masterpiece just not , but also makes us think , educates us . everybody should ask themselves : war ... it worth it ? what ...	1

story young award winner filmmaker competition going through trials tribulations trying get " his " first feature film made given wonderful treatment christopher(spinal tap)guest . it cynical hysterical look how hollywood bent how it make anyone bend eventually submit its neurosis . unlike many favorable reviewers i'm not fan christopher guest later works that not just because i'm envious him married jamie leigh curtis(lucky dog ) . i don't find guffman or best show more than mildly amusing best . save bob balaban guffman(when sparky comes back , i almost bust gut ) . sometimes artists their best work up front . i like woody allen first three pictures best(what up tiger lily , take money run , bananas ) . i think this case here . guest hit gold . great script , terrific performances incredible ensemble cast . near genius(i'm gonna steal one other reviewer word here because it so perfect , kudos thanks ) " turn " jt walsh delivering two greatest non sequiturs film history(alas , " great " dying so soon before his time like warren oates robert shaw ) . fabulous work martin short , teri hatcher , , , walsh , jennifer jason leigh , fran drescher , dan schneider , jason gould , wakter olkewicz seriously i could keep writing names 5 or 6 lines . there tons people this sublime comedy . its only drawbacks it misgivings made eighties all its trappings rather sloppy reunion scene(bacon/mckean)that comes off way too cloying . other than this rare comic treat anyone who see cynical side hollywood . someone said comparing this player like comparing bagger vance caddyshack . i'm not quite sure which one suppose good which suppose sub-par . caddyshack classic so big picture . i am big , big fan altman big picture even par player . if either more biting i would give nod big picture . though , richard grant performance almost good walsh . nick's(kevin bacon)flights fancy hysterical . this inspired unfortunately one-of-a-kind comedy .	1
this truly horrible movie . 7 seconds , huh , yeah 7 seconds realize i made mistake renting it . acting horrible , plot horrible , filming horrible ... everything horrible ! i hopeful because snipes , which why i rented it despite not ever seeing movie anywhere before theaters . guy store even told us he told it good movie ! snipes couldn't even fight scenes make them look real . ending car chase ends so abruptly you suddenly see them sitting next pond behind their house completely love ! huh , they romantic interest ? they hinted it , but never showed this happening . not rent or buy this movie . stay away , or you sucked into it shaking your head wondering why you rented this movie	-1
requiem darkness far your average anime . this statement , vague but poignant , well describe essence series . it isn't normal . it delves into human psyche deranged supernatural ways , all honesty , probably shouldn't viewed anyone under age 16 . if made into movie , rating would more than deserved . but here i am , 13 years old , after watching show i'm still alive kicking . basically , if you're squeamish , requiem darkness may bother you times . satoshi kon masterpiece tends some pretty graphic stuff its openings-case point , one introduction depicts grotesque obese man rigorously chomping what could very well slabs human flesh-another shows seven women burned stakes , blood running their eyes . all fairness , those two worst cases , main body episodes usually don't contain anything close such violence . point you don't want giving this your eight year old . i've talked violence , so i feel obligated tell sexual aspects show . firstly , there very little-to-no nudity . if memory serves , there no topless scenes . not say there not sexually inappropriate episodes . one episode devoted largely scandalous sexual relationship father his ( notably over 18 ) daughter . there , well , " motions " couple flicks tongue shone . very last episode shadow woman raped depicted . so , understand first if you're too young make amazon account than you most definitely shouldn't watching this show . now , moving . while there ongoing plot , requiem darkness largely episodic till last few shows . each episode independent , singularly brilliant , entity itself . writing storytelling simply amazing , plot lulling you into trance capable rushing you forward any moment . tale usually unfolds you follow main character , author looking stories write his book " 100 ghost stories . " author gets tied affairs three supernatural exorcists , who find ( eventually ) murder excessively sinful souls . exorcists seem always know what going , while author put together facts like detective realize often strange obscure situations going around him . resulting rhythm story , simply , magnificent . if anything drawback series , it animation . many people criticize its looks , i can't blame them . art isn't particularly well . it stylistic , way i think good show . only main characters detailed faces , crowds onlookers strange , almost inhuman looking complexions . environments often warped-perhaps not fully color , or bowing like someone bent them inward . some people might think these effects bad thing . i'm personally indifferent . i'd go discussing requiem darkness , but-lo ! life harsh . if you're age , get this show . you'll not regret it .	1

jason reitman makes impressive debut director this entertaining comedy `thank you smoking , ' which more satirical than any comedies his father ivan reitman made . despite film plot one nick naylor , ace spokesperson tobacco industry , `thank you smoking ' refuses take sides while keeping us hugely entertained its dialogues . aaron eckhart delivers superb performance nick naylor , chief spokesman lobbyist tobacco industry , who his `spin ' mode easily manipulate opinions suspicious audiences tv show . nick also good father his son joey ( cameron bright ) , before whom nick tries role model . today nick thinks brilliant idea production placement - how showing hollywood stars smoking spaceship ? - he flies california his son , meets suave movie producer wearing kimono ( rob lowe ) , his free time delivers package ailing old man ( sam elliott ) who sue tobacco company . satire funny , but its target changes frequently . it could tobacco industry ( why not ) , but also could those politicians ( represented william . macy senator ) who seems very hostile nick , nick himself . sometimes story goes too far , which includes brief episode abduction , but it most effective when it shows nick darkly funny conversations his friends , lobbyists alcohol guns ( mari bello david koechner , calling themselves mod squad ) over their lunch . other cast includes robert duvall , adam brody , kim dickens , . . simmons , katie holmes . acting unanimously good , but film belongs eckhart nick naylor , or his art spin . film may lack thought-provoking ideas on-going social issues . still what you see `thank you smoking ' always amusing , clever , even absurdly funny , never boring	1
imagine you found out you going die few months . what would you ? what would you decide mattered you ? what would you think you accomplished ? what would you consider left unaccomplished ? what would you want your legacy ? those questions facing centeral character akira kurosawa ikiru ( meaning " live " ) . brilliant actor takashi shimura plays role kanji watanabe , midlevel bureaucrat who spent his entire career doing little more than protecting his own job looking busy while actually accomplishing little . one day this man learns he terminal cancer soon die . this revelation makes him start reviewing his life , he concludes he nothing worthwhile . he tries " live it up " newfound friends loose women , but this not fulfill him . he cannot bring himself tell his own son daughter-in-law his fate ; caught up their own petty problems , they seem little time old man . eventually he meet kind kindred spirit , worker bureaucracy who quitting her job because she too feels she doing nothing useful . but even she cannot help this poor man who needs love , fulfillment , sense purpose . so watanabe finds his own reason go through his final days , reason centered around doing genuine good , regardless chance reward . after he dies glory all goes lesser bureaucrats who , while previously fighting him every step way , now bask spotlight claim glory , paying him much lip service while denying him true honor . normally i don't give so detailed plot description , but i've so here two reasons : 1 ) few people , particularly america , seen or even heard this movie , 2 ) i want point out how universal themes , how this movie could easily remade today any other country any other culture any other cast . while watching ikiru i kept thinking good modern title might , " more things change more they stay same . " like so many kurosawa films , this movie , though black white old , feels completely contemporary its concerns its content . while much made kurosawa concern japanese conflict collective individual , issues ikiru resonates any culture , not just japan . these bureacrats sound like bureaucrats which we all familiar . this very deep film , filled themes existentialism movies rarely tackle . it asks biggest questions asked life . same time , it never feels pretentious or preachy . story complex , not terms plot twists , but terms its " inner life . " yet running time two hours 23 minutes , ikiru moves very quickly , feeling faster than typical 90-minute hollywood film . this probably because there lots ground cover , also because effortless acting . takashi shimura performance watanabe one greatest cinema . though shimura not widely known west , he one japan major actors 1950s 60s , kurosawa worked him often . see him kurosawa seven samuri , made just two years after this film , completely different performance , one swagger bravado . other cast members also outstanding , especially miki odagiri young female coworker . she too feels straitjacketed her job government paper-pusher , but she young not tied down responsibility so she leaves . sort date watanabe she confides she humorous names everyone department based how they behave , his " mummy . " rather than offended , he agrees her this insight helps shape his vision himself what he must redeemed . it hard believe same director who made such beautifully-composed samurai films also could direct contemporary dramas look effortless this . yet film , or third act it , also reminded me very different motion picture -- citizen kane , believe it or not . while stylistically two masterpieces little common , both deal man , recently dead , who pieced together those who knew him partially . they try make sense his actions without ever getting full picture , while we , omniscent audience , . they misunderstand his actions , ascribe many selfishness when they actually exactly opposite . ( often kane reverse true . ) only difference while watanabe fundamentally sympathetic character , kane not . also , kurosawa manages tell his story without flashy technique or set pieces . ikiru also strangely foreshadows life real japanese hero second part 20th century , yutaka katayama ( or " mr. , " he called many ) . katayama head nissan motor west coast division north america 1960s 70s . he brought task when nissan piddly carmaker no consequence , especially north america , which then ruled big , powerful ford gm cars . though katayama not motivated thought his impending death , he hard-working wanted succeed america , which he through steady , unflagging determination . but he also went against grain japanese business protocol , encountered wrath his superiors tokyo . ironically , more successful he became , more he resented . ( his far less aggressive successful counterpart east coast more highly regarded japanese bosses . ) after establishing nissan major player america , katayama unceremoniously retired superiors moved took credit his work . he died obscurity , but today mr. revered figure nissan , even used advertising campaign several years ago . executives now dislocate their jaws praising him . it all sounds too familiar . second dvd two features , 90 minute documentary kurosawa own production company his working methods , wherein he discusses everything writing scripts editing final product ; 40-minute feature making ikiru , cast crew interviews . both docs excellent you watch ikiru more intelligence after you see them . there also film trailer commentary track which i confess i haven't time listen . it stephen prince , author warrior camera : cinema akira kurosawa . criterion once again standard which all dvd makers should aspiring . print , while scratched battered bit age , good we're likely see . it unfortunate many years kurosawa work not better taken care . like nissan mr. , he without honor his own country , because he considered " too western " his outlook . like mr. , his name now evokes nothing but praise his homeland . fortunately , work this " mr. " finally preserved . ikiru film you should investigate even if you've never seen japanese movie before , even if you've never heard akira kurosawa , even if you " hate " foreign or black white films , even if you think you no interest subject . because subject fact very modern universal , you quickly swept away relevance story . ikiru very dictionary definition term " timeless classic .	1
woman sets out rescue her sister afghan city kandahar way meets displaced persons war , refugees , starving , walking wounded . film focuses particular women children forced survive under hostile conditions . their marginal existence desert sands border iran afghanistan reflects their status within taliban-ruled country which they live exile . even more dramatically , film explores plight those who lost limbs land mines . particularly informative commentary actress nelofer pazira included dvd . her comments reveal eloquent detail not only making movie ( shot where it takes place ) but rationale behind creative choices made , often fly , film crew worked under difficult dangerous conditions . while western news coverage continues focus military political aspects warfare middle east , " kandahar " much reveal devastating impact noncombatants . definitely worth seeing	1

it must made huge difference me i saw movie before i read book - i 3 little girls - based some other reviews this movie . i really enjoyed movie ( my girls - they watch it over over ) . it just fun sweet . i really enjoyed " modern " comic spin fairy tale , medieval setting . i couldn't wait read book . i admit i little bit confused when storyline turned out different , but i continued read i really started appreciate common themes movie book - how they'd chosen portray them movie . i also appreciated book its own . i glad it different movie . it same yet different way made it fun read . i didn't already know how everything going go or how it would end - except general " happy ending " sense . after reading book i could also understand why they chose put story screen way they . my perspective anyway , i think put it onscreen exactly book would taken some magic out it . it definitely magical just right book but movie i really think it would come across cliche - just telling cinderella story . instead , movie honored themes book while stepping things up screen - spinning story differently making them bigger than life/outlandish ( if you ) . highly entertaining i'd recommend book movie anyone - especially if you little girls . just remember - get best out both - watch film first	1

after reading very positive reveiws this late 90 thriller i decided it deserved least rental . i must confess i am glad i happened stumble upon this movie amazon because it everything horror movie should . screenplay very put together , plot setting intriguing yet mysterious killings ( or cinematography if you want make it sound all fancy ) visuals quite impressive it 500,000 $ dollar budget . now , only real complaint i say film acting horrid . now dont get me wrong not all acting bad but i would lying if i said most actors okay , truth most them very little experience made film look all-around quite bit less professional hard look elite horror film . i think if producers would known when they made film it would so well such great reveiws number veiwers than they would more than willing dish out few extra bucks order some more experienced actors . i thought david hewlett played david worth ( architect ) acceptably i also thought nicky guadagni performance helen halloway ( doctor ) pretty good . other than those two i thought acting very lightweight . guy played quentin ( cop ) really bad which quite shame just because characte big role film really important ... also i thought they could gotten better more experienced guy play role autistic boy ( or man it some what hard tell ... ) . i know i keep going acting but i cant wonder away truth much . concept idea film really quite brilliant , screnplay brilliantly written story line meshed extrodinary ease . despite acting i heavily impressed film overall very good . grade : b+	1

much written miscasting john travolta bill clinton this movie . not much written emma thompson casting . arguably , emma thompson , star movie versions jane austen stories , would just badly suited hillary role travolta bill . hillary raised suburban chicago , no apparent ties england , far genteel , reputation . however , emma wonderful hillary ; fact , since trashing bill clinton little further purpose , hillary-watching promises much more fun future . so who hillary seen not only writers but also emma thompson ? she compassionate , calculating , flawed , hyper-intelligent individual . she , written movie , " more moral " than bill so far observing code personal conduct , but " less moral " politics . movie would it , she would hesitate lot less than bill using relatively brutal political tactics . she shows great willingness externalize her feelings , accepts very little personal responsibility . like so many us , she sees where noble ends might justify means , expects others around her same . this remarkable performance . hillary star continues rise future ( it almost certainly ) , this movie might become sort emotional lynchpin understanding very complex very fascinating person	1

i'm avid fan bruce campbell . i can't say this series best work he ever , but it takes care wondering how well he would zorro type role . series itself little far fetched , satyre times , but it funny . puns , wisecracks , sarcastic conversations extremely cheesy . i love it . wish they continued this awesome series .	1
" fog " fairly typical representative john carpenter movie . it certainly its moments , yet it leaves viewer unmistakable feeling " what might . " this sense it reminds me bit michael mann 1985 version . paul wilson " keep " , fascinating yet flawed horror movie which i watch over over again vain hopes discovering it actually good . stripped bone , " fog " story small new england fishing town which celebrate its centennial ( or bicentennial .... or anniversary some type ) . eve this occasion local priest , drunken sot played hal holbrook , discovers town - like all horror movie small towns - terrible secret linked its founding . this discovery coincides appearance nasty fog off coast which tends leave dead people its wake , moving towards town . various characters town , including local beer-guzzler ( tom atkins ) nubile hitch-hiker ( jamie lee curtis ) radio deejay ( adrienne barbeau ) so , all isolated fog soon discover what inside it , how it related " terrible secret " , old sin which modern-day townsfolk mist pay . you see , while idea not exactly new it pretty cool , when i popped " fog " into my ancient dvd player recently i so after hiatus many years , hope my earlier judgement film wrong . this i disappointed . like " keep " , " fog " never gets any better ; unlike " keep " it actually gets worse . paper this should not happened . besides carpenter , who coming off well-received efforts like " assault precinct 13 " " halloween " there impressive cast actors which actually reunites good bit original " halloween " crew . besides carptenter jamie lee curtis , there also girl who played annie ( michael first onscreen victim ) , well guy who played sheriff both h-2 . replacing ubiquitous donald pleasance hal halbrook , venerable john houseman makes appearance film opening creepy , storytellin ' sea captain . even janet leigh involved , bitchy yet rather likable wife fog victim . ironically , tis part film problem , it many . first off , there far too many characters . film cluttered them some reason carpenter disobeyed standard horror movie order whittling them down film progresses . most victims throwaways no way integral plot , nearly everybody introduced beginning still walking around end . we needed more killings , not less . second , performances . this movie good actors , but dialogue best inconsistent worst embarrassingly stupid . worst it ladeled onto adrienne barbeau , who gets repeat idiocies like , " my son trapped ! trapped fog ! " " look out , into darkness .... beware fog ! " gag . third , villain(s ) . carptenter achieved some neatly creepy atmosphere beginning film , but he never delivers it : there no real payoff . this because he couldn't seem decide whether it fog itself or what fog actual " baddie " film . result no one antagonist ever really emerges . " fog " might well run o ' mill flood - faceless impersonal . movie its moments -- creepy opening , moments atmospheric horror sea , excellent cinematography , which used particular effect creepy fog-dwellers . but end these fail outweigh movie many flaws . today , i still regard carptenter most wildly inconsistent director out there . one hand he gave us p-13 , halloween , escape new york , thing , all classics ( cult or otherwise ) . other hand he also gave us crap like prince darkness unwatchable ghosts mars . there fun but flawed outings like they live mouth madness . i would like say fog falls this last category , but i really can't . it just isn't very good , that sad fact it . bottom line ? beware fog .	-1
i die-hard red sox fan they come past 30yrs my life . i love sox , ups downs rooting them , new england . i hate this dvd . 90 minutes viewer must endure watching number barely distinguishable red sox fans follow team during 2003 season . most these people annoyed hell out me . it unbearable . i don't want watch bunch whiny , overly self-involved jerks my tv . i also thought there would some insight/interviews players . there nothing worth mentioning really . every once while there annoying shot kevin millar acting like ' tard or talking something makes no sence . fact , there more scenes this film no point reference , or capture dialogue middle sentence i never knew what hell anyone talking . it like bad film school project . it blows . i sat down all excited watch this thing after they won w.s. this year i all i got one big bum-out	-1
' vanishing ' reminds me woody allen film ' match point ' which i also watched recently , they're both thrillers which approach their subject matter very flat , realistic non-sensationalistic manner . creating outlandish criminals schemes rushing over them so we don't notice how absurd they standard thriller formula . these films , however , take relatively simple believable acts violence examine them depth . sense , they're opposite thrillers , slow deliberate , all building up finale which proves surprisingly affecting , certainly more affecting than traditional thriller climax . unlike most people here , i won't tell you this method necessarily better or smarter . they both work very well , `the vanishing ' this more methodical approach quite well . film opens introducing us rex saskia , dutch couple vacation france . we get know them fairly slowly , they're obviously very affectionate , prove much more believable appealing couple than you'd usually find film . before too long they stop gas station saskia heads off get them something drink . she never comes back . rex becomes obsessed , continually investigates , putting up posters flyers . he this three years , he knows very well saskia must dead . nevertheless , he can't move ; he must know what happened her . this isn't single perspective film , however . we also introduced , quite early , raymond lemorne , man who abducted saskia . he doesn't seem like killer type , he apparently quite balanced family man . he seems go through plan intellectual experiment more than any thing else . he it ? he get away it ? raymond quite impressed rex persistence , he even contacts rex via postcard , leading their eventual meeting film grimly inevitable climax . again , this film very low-key . there almost no on-screen violence , my recollection , not even much strong emotion or yelling . they all almost always manage keep lid it . sluizer shot film very straight forward manner . he rarely makes any sort comment camera , but simply records what going . it doesn't conventional plot arc either , no traditional rising action or raising stakes or what you . it everyday life sort approach , approach which refuses shape story into standard movie plot form . nevertheless , it draws you , making you * need * know what happened , just rex . this film greatest supporters love tell you how intelligent this movie , but i'm not sure if i really buy argument . it not dumb movie , certainly , but there really isn't all much it intellectual standpoint . it touches themes predestination obsession so , but that nothing particularly new or remarkable this way . it require patience just different most films , which doubtless throw some dullards , but while capacity patience taste different tend go hand hand intelligence they really aren't same thing . this all say , i think stupid people tend not like this movie , but not because they don't understand it . it just not their thing . `the vanishing ' cleverly structured , though , shifting perspectives , first showing us crime rex perspective , then raymond , slowly revealing information film goes . however , i think it bit too drawn out middle , showing raymond contemplation rex rex endless attempts solve crime bit too long . beyond this , rex confrontation raymond isn't interesting it might . this point we've learned almost everything there know , so some it proves bit reiterative . still , ending packs punch , doubtless made more effective occasional slight dullness other parts film . performances surprisingly good film this cheap . mentioned before , saskia rex very likable , not movie couple all . gene bervoet performance rex probably key film . if you don't sympathize him there isn't much pull you into film emotionally . ( i , so i . ) donnadieu raymond psycho like few others i've seen film . he intellectual villain , which isn't rare , but he different because his intellectualism isn't cover madness lying underneath . he just so coldly logical detached , confessed sociopath , madness doesn't even describe his condition . he barely even human . hmm , guess that it . again , i don't think this quite masterpiece some . it still bit slow dry times , but characters intriguing enough structuring clever enough carry it . ( , again , ending quite good . ) definitely worth look if you want see different sort thriller . grade :	1

since " pianist " many roman polanski earlier movies undergoing reappraisal this should no exception . reviled time its innovative use " shocking " images linked most unfortunately charles manson/ sharon stone murder , it slumbered basement many years . today it seen perhaps first time what it : extremely subtle complex analysis way powerful organisations deform mind " ordinary " people/ or , if you prefer it , psychosis gradually take grip most normal individuals . this case organisation witches ' coven but film also seen other religious/ political overtones . particularly clever way director keeps us guessing throughout what extent rosemary ( mia farrow ) deluded her " paranoid " belief her husband neighbors plotting against her her unborn child . yes , i know , put way it sounds pretty clear cut case , but such rosemary naive honesty ( despite criticism i feel mia farrow inspired choice this film ) we continue believe , against all odds , she innocent victim . polanski staunchly refused throughout film indulge gratuitous " horror film " excesses . there no vomiting final scene which rosemary first time sees her " demonic " baby positively shakespearean its restraint , baby merely described characters ( you imagine ) opposed seen . throughout this film it mind rather than stomach working . it great movie well worth revisiting . certainly i could not see any modern director remaking it successfully . true piece kafka	1

i would rate show 5 stars , this review extras features special edition issue . i recently bought all special edition releases " stand alone complex " after trying research what i going get extras not included regular edition . i found listings amazon product details little confusing incomplete some volumes so i decided write this guide others trying decide . i'm not going review " ghost shell " episodes or series general because there so many excellent reviews already this site , most you probably know this great anime tv series already . there various other reviews say some dvd cd errors them bandai replace them corrected discs if you send them exchange . i not ran into problems yet , although i haven't gone through whole series either . i also state i love tv series well both movies , but i would recommend imported region 2 version gits2 : innocence if you region free dvd player . dreamworks really messed up release omiting english dub putting hard hearing subtitles instead regular ones early issues movie . most people find them very distracting annoying . first off discs themselves , you get two dvd discs each volume same episodes both discs . volumes 1-5 4 episodes each , 6 7 3 episodes each making 26 episodes total series . both discs anamorphic wide screen encoded directly high-definition masters . both discs also english subtitles . each set also two interviews voice cast or someone associated production anime , printed dvd insert pamphlet or booklet different interviews such each volume . all discs region 1 . disc one dolby digital 5.1 japanese english , dolby digital 2.0 english japanese . disc two dts 5.1 english japanese dolby digital 2.0 english track . volumes 1 2 include soundtrack cd music yoko kanno , most excellent versatile composer music tv series . anime lovers know her work many fine soundtracks she countless other anime movies tv series . volume 3 black xl fruit loom tee-shirt section 9 logo front major kusanagi graphic back . nice shirt ! volumes 4 5 collectable i.d. cards section 9 member . volume 6 black xl fruit loom tee-shirt section 9 logo front batou graphic back , i.d. card . nice shirt again ! volume 7 tee-shirt ! this time it white xl section 9 logo front , laughing man logo back ! once again nice shirt ! it also comes tin box that supposed hold all 7 volumes dvd set . i excited getting box but when it arrived i disappointed design . it kind like rectangular lunch box you used take school kid , without handle latch . its also thinner metal dents easily . it marketing type printing backside pertains vol . 7 only , dvd cases stack inside one top other . spines cases not visible when you open box , only front last case you put . so you take all cases out tin get specific volume . there also not room cardboard sleves dvd when you got individual volumes , no room soundtrack cd either . all said , i disappointed box . because it odd dimensions it doesn't stack well my dvd library . i would much preferred normal five sided box usually comes dvd sets . overall i'd say it worth it buy volumes 3 , 6 7 new get shirts if they interest you pick up others used if you save some money series . if you're interested dts soundtrack options . i much prefer dts mixes dolby digital wanted soundtrack cd well . also cardboard boxes come volumes 3 6 better than tin box store your set when you complete series , if you stack them shelves one row dvd top row , you fit movies into those boxes well fill them rest way	1

honest , i loved japanese original this movie so much my first watching american version little tainted . but i just watched richard gere version again , this time dvd , found i really like it more than i realized . gere so winsome ( i'll pay watch him dance any day , he aging gorgeously ! ) , lopez so elegant , all other characters so interesting , music so sexy , why quibble over which movie better ? this story entertaining touching its own right , even if not nuanced heartfelt japaese version . i watched ballroom dancing competitions years , this film conveys romance excitement draws people those competitions . story charming , adult pg satisfying ending -- how rare combination these days ? dvd offers good insights into ballroom training hard work behind movie , well wonderful " sway " music video . which reminds me -- soundtrack excellent , i bought , too .	1

well , i'd agree tweedle " fan service " pencil cards over top , but only because they inconsistent characters series . series very good character development , lots good back story early . only " fan service " episode " heart darkness " , which shows bare chested woman , but she not one main characters . it doesn't seem very provocative me , since there no emphasis sex , character only trying keep her clothes dry . still , this feels like " filler " episode , doesn't really contribute story . plot inconsistent seasons . heart darkness , girls search ancient key books , but episode 14 ( set up second season ) , we find books not ancient ... i like art this series , it hand drawn feel it , lots attention detail . i'd definitely buy it again	1
i've devoted pilates practicer over 6 years , somewhat sceptical any kind workout tried turn classic pilates into more aerobic-type exercise . still , i ellen barrett dvd ( self sleek slim ) liked both workout instructor ( she extremely personable impeccable cueing ) , so i thought i would give this dvd go . i'm very happy report i love it . i think ellen excellent job applying pilates exercises standing mat workout makes you sweat . i love feeling simultaneously stretching stengthening my body while also burning fat . even though routine moves relatively slow pace , other reviewers pointed out , use weights really gets your heart going . i'd rather move steady pace moves properly ( that pilates principle ! ) than flail around frantic speed , case so many workouts . many people seem think unless it really fast paced , you're not getting good workout -- that totally wrong . i should add i've always found weight training boring avoided it , so i'm very happy found way incorporate some into my workout . i also think people no pilates background probably just fine this dvd , but you'd probably get more out it even some rudimentary instruction pilates . i would recommend stott videos ( also all excellent ) starting beginner pilates mat workout . i work out 4-5 times week , using this dvd least 2 times week 6 weeks now . i still look forward it . highly highly recommended .	1
this movie one greatest war movies ever . not over- statement . if you any interest ww2 want see what it really like eastern front brutal stalingrad russia , then this movie see . it feels real complete mightmare , but you ; take your eyes off screen . its like great novel , visual intensity . acting directing this german film top shelf . its almost like they don't know cameras rolling , it really 1940 russia . it starts off so well germans , we see them celebrating rare day off horrors war italy . they fresh off victory north africa deployed russia take over vital supply line stalingrad affords its russian forces . soon fighting begins horror takes ahold german platoon . you see looks their faces scene after scene , when they begin realize this one battle not going victorious . further hamper grim reality their surroundings winter soon takes icy grip unit well beginning hatred their superior officers . this one interesting aspects this film . they seem hate officers much their enemy . officers lose command control platoon , they try deperately intimidate men see things " fuhrer way " . cold ominous , this film exact feeling you would expect this battle , circumstance . 5 stars - probably best war film all time .	1
masterpiece akira kurosawa featuring toshiro mifune , this time mifune not samurai armed sword but determined executive armed 50 million yen make deposit percentage shares would make him big boss national shoes , where he worked 30 years . night he make his takeover he receives phone call telling him his son kidnapped 30 million yen ransom . without second delay he makes arrangements pay kidnapper , but then he learns kidnapper made mistake took his chauffeur son instead . what he ? part moral dilemma part police thriller high low despite 43 years old still very powerful exciting . sadly though usually dependable criterion dropped ball this dvd no extras . not even audio commentary kurosawa expert stephen prince . it still worth buying just movie alone . watch police station scenes appearance sometime kurosawa leading man takashi shimura ( stray dog , ikiru ) .	1

this very underrated movie . hollywood courtroom drama manages almost totally avoid clich� ...? one scrapbook maybe . what i liked most it almost complete lack explanation motivation ( shades david lynch here perhaps ) most notably schlichtmann character , brilliantly underplayed john travolta . who could ever imagined said ? indeed all top stars (+duvall , macy , shaloub ) rein histrionics , which one reason why you watch this . what really made him change typical materialistic lawyer into people hero willing risk everything , well , you make your mind up ? word hero out place here , however , perhaps more disturbingly also so villain , film deal terrible crime . but then perhaps banality crime what it all . or should . whatever your view , you not go away without thinking some very searching questions concerning relationship law , justice human suffering . film ends perhaps one finest pauses cinema , travolta , faced bankruptcy , attempts vain answer judge question : where it all go ? see it	1
i only worked one office month i relate lot things this movie : printer barely worked times , overdemanding boss , rules regulations feeling any kind profit you're not going see dime it . unlike certain comedy movies which based primarily disgusting , rude or people getting smacked things , office space gets its laughs moments where you go " i know someone exactly like " . peter 2 friends work initech , computer company prides itself making workers what they've told . after hypnotherapy session , peter becomes carefree uninhibited but he gets promotion . how get back them ? put virus computer system takes remainders transactions puts them separate account . they get caught ? one great things this movie it seems take itself seriously while fun same time . while there no big comedy punchlines , film quite funny certain personas we've met such slooow tallllking guy ... mmkay ? or bosses restaurants making demands while saying it up you if you want it but i'm gonna whine if you don't . acting-wise film straight across board . while i only know 3 cast members(obviously jennifer aniston others dave herman , voice actor futurama john . mcginley ) , everyone perfect their roles even spout some great one-liners too . my favorite : neighbor , overhearing peter plan gone awry , declines offer visit peter saying " that ok , don't want you **** up my life too . " only thing i didn't like character you're going love hate never gets comeuppance , like somebody losing it punching him . kind disappointing . how skimpy extras . this " special edition " practically one making-of deleted scenes dvd-rom stuff . no commentary ? grr , which too bad cause i would've loved hear least anybody but still this film definately warrants purchase	1
i thought movie alright , but i am sorry i bought it . i would rather just rented it . it seems like half movie out focus , i am sure it purpose but i just don't get it . there few erotic scenes but they not worth price	-1

i missed reading this child . when i went read reviews it amazon determine which copy purchase my nieces , all i found movie reviews . totally unhelpful ! so , my comments book , secret garden , illustrated michael hague . ( addition i read our local library currently out print , but our librarian recommended one illustrated tasha tudor which print . ) its beautifully written its wonderful read-a-loud . use english language just lovely refreshingly old-fashioned . its got drama mystery but nothing especially scary . it easily one best children books i've ever read ( currently i'm huge harry potter fan ) , though its less fantasy more self-empowerment . somewhere i read every little girl should read this book . i disagree . every child should read this book . i read it ( 2 sittings , it so mesmerizing ) now i've started read it my young sons . its real page-turner no swearing , no smart talking no violence/weapons some very important messages how treat yourself others . there lots great talking points whole family . every family should own copy	1
although season 5 not bad season 6 , it isn't one best overall . rory going downhill all way , very unrorylike some ways making bad choices . she drops out yale among other things . this disappointment , but enough going it it worth watch if you're out gilmore don't want rerun previous seasons right away	1
nick lachey jessica simpson few good moments nick jessica variety hour . but show looks too ' 70s its premise , too donny marie-ish some parts sonny cher-in some others . lachey performance babyface nice . how come babyface didn't produce nick entire solo album instead batch people nick went caused soul-o flop ? he would given him some smooth stuff sing . but mr. johnny bench kenny rogers makes show look , sadly , too 1983-ish . how come they couldn't get somebody current perform it , say maroon 5 or kanye west , who both hot last april ? they wanted bring back variety show format , but it very hard it internet age . jessica isn't all good this show . i'd rather hear her music albums instead . they need bring new things format if they're going make show . now , lachey simpson would better off doing their solo albums than wasteful junk like this !	-1

if you're looking documentary life truman capote , you two choices : * truman capote , ae dvd archives ( 2005 ) [ asin : b0009hmtfs ]; * great writers : truman capote ( 2000 ) [ asin : b000fc2hng]neither one inexpensive , so i would liked review saying which one better . it turned out , i ended up buying watching both . although both programs roughly same length , differences significan t.t he arts entertainment ( ) version clearly better . it more information , photographs , film footage , interesting interviews than great writers version , which seems trying make some sort artistic statement its own - lots pictures grass waving wind , country roads , etc ., none which terribly relevant . you better off buying program .	1
i hardly believe some reviews i'm reading here . it seems every one wants more foghorn leghorn , speedy gonzalez chuck jones . they want cartoons 50s . well , i've seen most wb cartoons over many long years , speedy gonzalezes stink ; forghorn leghorn funny once then boring ; chuck jones most overrated catroonist all times . he made some good cartoons -- matter fact , lot good cartoons -- but he made lot junk too , including some his most heralded ( like " some froggy evening " which obvious , coy not funny all . ) tashlin , avery , especially , clampett , rule . porky pig feat , ( horror horrors ! ) black white cartoon 40s ( horrors again ) may funniest cartoon ever made . clampett only director who could make bugs bunny cartoon where bugs goat still make it hilarious : falling hare best example . but my god ! that war time cartoon references a-cards gremlins its too much expect people today understand ! this set even includes what probably freleng best cartoon : she acrobat daughter , wicked send-up night movies : but , heavenly days ( little fibber mcgee molly lingo there ) there references newsreels lew lehr ( who dat ? ) leslie howard bette davis petrified forest . lot reviewers here , i'm sure , offended inclusion anything so obscure this new millenium . " thugs dirty mugs " , there joke fred allen ; " gruesome twosome " , greatest cartoons ever , there parody jimmy durante ! it seems it asking too much expect anyone post baby boom understand anything happened before television age . i liked this set reason most reviewers here disliked it : because its concentration funnier , better written , more satirical cartoons pre-jones age . black white looney tunes terrific . i agree one other reviewers , though , i'd like see some tex avery travelogue spoofs . they hilarious collections corniest gags imaginable . pc stuff--it intolerable , but we just tolerate it . these fascists control this country now ( i don't mean since recent election -- it happened way before ) we just put up it . it just curious they think we should offended some stereotypes not others . stereotypes black americans shuddered but -- why , durante spoof take off italian american ; edward . robinson spoof " thugs dirty mugs " take off jewish american . finger shaking lecture old tradition this country only thing changes what we get lectured . thing never changes hypocrisy selective morality . other reviewers here , who probably favor pc fascism ( i've read few them ) make usual , unimaginative lame accusations : we don't like pc lecturing because we're all racists . fact i don't care what lecture . i resent fact lecture all . we turn these dvds entertainment , not any lecture how evil our ancestors . if there religious lectures beginning dvds modern movies , which may offend church goers , i'm sure pinkos would crab -- rightly so . it presence not content lecture offensive . but folks , just learn take it . it ain't going away . remember , no one really against censorship folks crab most it only crab because they're not censors they're not ones deciding what gets approves . right now what generally called " left " censors our culture it their version morality decides what we see enjoy what we lectured . get used it . but pc garbage what made me give this only 4 stars instead five it deserves	1
indeed 3d effects this film make you feel if you motion simulator times it very cool experience 3d fanatic like myself . i wasn't enamored music some other reviewers here but it wasn't bad . it need bit more humor harry shearer ( simpsons , spinal tap ) work but it cool goth looking fun kids except maybe very young ones . you need standard tube set make it work included system but rumor it version lcd projectors systems not far off . untill then this best we got . dukey flyswatte	1

folks , this movie alright , it not bad . probably best-worded review i've read " ken park " so far imdb . com . i think someone named " peedur " wrote it or something . not i agree him 100% , but good taken out this film well expressed his critique . look , fcc mpaa , you don't want me see something , then chrissake don't ban it . just makes me want watch it even more . all honesty , i don't know if this film should banned here america . " kids " " bully " made it through okay , even into theaters . when it comes teens sexuality , " ken park " might clark most truthful presentation it . now i know that gonna send many parents tearing their hair out , screaming , " what i ? how i save them this ? " well ... you can't . if you don't want believe any what happens " ken park " real , then you'd better just not watch it altogether . parents , heartbreaking truth almost all what happens here happened several times continue happen unabated . i've never lived visalia , ca , but spent ample time there . however , i born spent first 19 years my life fresno ( two remarkably similar close geographically ) . same stagnant lifestyle , same tendency listen punk hip-hop , same heat , etc . i appreciate clark effort humanize these kids this time ; none them what i would call " bad . " " kids " made kids look bad . " ken park " makes kids look bored , which what they really . don't scream heavens , asking why they would think such things , that nonsense . why they smoke dope , drink ad nauseum , jerk off frivolous sex ...? because there - - nothing - else - - - there . gotta alleviate boredom somehow . instance , when devout father scorns his daughter bible ... referring her beast whore ... nope , she just teenager . all teenagers beasts whores because you can't think any other label it . i personally sex supple young teenage filipino girls their parents ' catholicism-adorned house ? actually , right parents ' bed . i only 17 time . i've challenged my father fight , i've gotten impatient grandparents taking too long turn playing game , i've sat around living room watching mtv while hitting bong bitching how i couldn't wait leave wretched town . i've it ; it happens . never jerked off womens ' tennis while asphyxiating myself robe belt , but ... it areas like these clark starts lose me . there much more male nudity " ken park " than female , so don't expecting some wild teenaged orgy . there not even much actual sex movie . fact , if main characters this film but ... 4 years older ... i guarantee you this would not banned here america . visalia - never - looked good it " ken park " never again . it photographed directed two ace dps after all , so screen composition , lighting shading all luminous ... lack better adjective : warm . hospitable . film looks more expensive than it . my favorite scenes actually opening scene very final scene . without these strong bookends , i'd easily knock off half-star . i personally detest harmony korine ( kid just pretentious skater prick thinks he tarantino 12th power ) , however i like this script ... because it ripped right out headlines . parents , this not every teenager . it really not . but it lot them . " ken park " not seek illuminate teenaged psyche en masse , but offer examples what we think tragic squalid ... rather mundane existence . rather few exceptions " shock shock sake " scenes , it deserves more credit than it given . clark best film still " bully " , but " ken park " its merits . only those less discriminating tastes , obviously . tread lightly , but if you like your cinema ignore boundaries ( la miike takashi ) this one'll send you past envelope . 3.5 stars , but i'll round up audacity	1
liza timeless . enjoyed updates this concert always her music	1
first off , i am fan original series - escaflowne . it far up there top 5 favorite anime . it lot memorable characters , good action pretty decent story . this not original escaflowne . it not take part before or after series . it doesn't take place somewhere middle . it takes most main characters series totally retells entire story fit into movie . result ? not fan . basically , because entire movie you see 30 second introduction old characters suped up animation no depth . example , twin cat girls so fond lord falcon , show up instead brief 30 seconds singers stage bar . ummm yuck . lots more memorable characters subjugated this . perhaps , if you seen this first it would decent watch . myself , i very disappointed . good points this movie animation upgraded soundtrack well . even standalone product , movie no flow or depth it . it basically just compressed retelling escaflowne . i'd rent this skip it purchase . if you want purchase something , get escaflowne series . you much happier	-1
whole piece highly artistic tasteful . extra bonus wilby , grant graves all very pretty boys back those years . initially , wilby not most attractive one . but after watching it over over again , his charm getting irresistible . i haven't seen any wilby late performance australia . anyone knows how he doing uk ? sure he great actor but luck plays main role acting career . it comfort see him interview this special collection ( maybe shot 2003 ? ) - he still quite charming even though aged little . ageless classic can't recommend enough .	1

" legal eagles " supposed comedy . we're supposed find characters played robert redford debra winger amusing , their acrimonious relationship hilarious , way they end up partners despite all gibes romantically satisfying . problem movie too dumb taken seriously , thus too dumb funny . briefly , story takes place new york . robert redford assistant district attorney promoted da . debra winger defense attorney , daryl hannah young woman emotional problems , debra winger client . plot involves fire 20 years ago , when daryl hannah eight , fire killed her artist father purportedly destroyed large number his paintings . this experience left daryl hannah traumatized , but all not it seems , now , 20 years later , daryl hannah first accused attempted theft later murder . unfortunately , plot involves many elements simply don't make sense . i won't go into detail , but roger ebert good job listing four different major things make plot completely unbelievable . well story dumb i found some scenes supposed funny anything but . example , robert redford weekend father teenage daughter . one point his ex-wife threatens go court prevent him seeing their daughter . robert redford makes telephone call his ex-wife home starts angry monologue threats how he'll take her apart court . then he realizes he actually talking his daughter ! this mistake apparently supposed hilarious . ha , ha . scene robert redford debra winger together see one bad guys . robert redford takes off foot try catch him . debra winger , who doesn't know how drive car , feels it necessary her jump into robert redford car try follow him . she makes wrong turn finds herself going wrong way into traffic wide heavily trafficked street . there follows one minute her frantically dodging cars last moment . very funny . ha , ha , ha . this movie could fairly good romantic thriller if they fixed plot not tried comedy . but dumb plot unfunny attempts comedy make it complete waste time . rennie peterse	-1

this one movie aged , not well . it great when it came out ( i remember seeing it just after premiere ziegfield nyc ) , but looking it some 30 years later , it just doesn't stand up test time . october 74 run great , deadheads thought it last . film meant immortalize band , so . however , jerry editing , which puts too much focus scene detriment music , turns movie into documentary , rather than concert film . but , disc 2 real saver . 90 minutes great tunes - only music - including other one , dark star , china/rider , great sugaree , this may one best filmed records dead . get it disc 2	1
tom clancy movies some best ever adapted novels . though all books least twice good their movies , films still great action movies watch . quot ; hunt red octoberquot ; great movie , john mctiernen best right next quot ;d ie hard . quot ; connery baldwin both very good it , story russian nuclear sub defecting usa still enjoyable though different book . end movie very exciting . quot ; patriot gamesquot ; features harrison ford taking over role jack ryan after alec baldwin decided not it again . this one probably best three . story ryan his family london when he stops attempted assassination members royal family , he turn hunted ultra violent left-wing faction ira . this pic very exciting , also featuring great climax . last one series quot ; clear present danger . quot ; now , this one wasn't even close half good book , it almost completely different . this my least favorite because book so damn good , but it still enjoyable movie . it operation run against colombian drug cartel also kept secret president . however , when group american officials brutally killed colombians ( which spectacular scene ) , course harrison ford there , operation shut down , leaving behind american soldiers colombia . ryan ( ford ) mr. clark ( willem dafoe ) go get remaining soldiers , climax movie isn't quite intense climax book . overall , this very good collection buy , i definitely recommend it	1

this dvd first season now-classic simpsons animated series , collects show first thirteen episodes . not much really needs said simpsons , it one biggest pop culture icons ever . however , you really tell these episodes series rough around edges when it started . character designs unrefined , animation crude rubbery . stories feel like typical sitcom plots little simpsons edginess zany humour tossed , but not nearly enough it . voice-actors also still getting into character here , so their performances also different what they later matured into . luckily , fox loaded first season dvd goodies , including commentaries every episode some other fun retrospective material . presentation really nice too some original packaging disc artwork . i'd say episodes themselves three stars , but superb box set treatment bumps overall score up four . if you're casual simpsons fan , season 2 much better place start watching , thats when memorable episodes really start coming . but hardcores , this set great buy , nice start your collection .	1
denzel washington probably my favorite actor . even dog movie called manchurian candidate , he shone . tom hanks ? well , lemme quit hating guy . this well-intentioned movie , tom creditable job , we extreme close-ups funny colors camouflage spots where he overreached . i also pleasantly surprised see antonio banderas fly face his latino studliness playing gay guy . passionate one , though , since he still latino , after all . actually , this hollywood " message movie , " you know what means . it subtle michael moore . those who agree message flock beaten head it two hours . those who filmmakers would like see movie , those who don't agree message , stay far away it possible . there scene library where nobody wants sit table aids boy . way they stared him reminded me " lao wei china " experiences . denzel character reminded segregation , even though he too young remember it , started care tom hanks ' character . aids discrimination bad . actually , any discrimination all bad . that movie message . i agree message , but still . that all we've got . totally irrelevant non-sequiter , if name " sam francisco " means anything you , you've seen subtle commentary discrimination . i love great courtroom drama . this one merely good . so much agenda squeeze into two-hour film , they take few shortcuts here . sad , ain't it ? but even so , well-intentioned film i'm glad i saw . once . not twice . once enough , thank you .	-1
... which more than i say modern couple . if you expect see gwyneth paltrow take her clothes off , don't bother this movie . she plays frigid arrogant scholar , which not too much stretch her . my opinion , she not romantic damsel-in-distress material . she much more interesting when she plays cold cynical characters . jennifer ehle , other hand , shows quite bit skin . clandestine love scene two poets still stands before my eyes . i read book , so i could tell movie left too many loose ends untied . instance , it not clear movie why gwyneth paltrow character crying .	1

these types movies becoming quite trend hollywood . fight club started it ( which awesome movie ) . then sixth sense ( which also pretty good ) . after , it all went downhill . brown bunny , machinist , others , hide seek , etc . surprise endings twist , characters don't exist only main characters imagination , daed characters don't know they dead . these movies all surprising audience already overused plot twists . i predicted john torturro character figment depp imagination within first 20-25 mins film . why would actor depp status take part movie this substance	-1
this great one ! very interesting well presented , it definitely give you goosebumps toward end !!	1
this movie true garbage . it made no sense , no real plot , not offer any clever deaths or humor , or gratuitous skin . ending leaves you feeling stupid watched it all way end . i wake myself up 3 times during this movie , i wish i just stayed asleep . horror , horror . actually , sheriff kind wierd creepy because you knew he not acting ( there no acting ) you worry someone like walking around out there . i think people who liked this movie trying sell their used copies good landfill only . basically , plot make some headway end , but then they ran out money or maybe their 486 computer they using edit it died . or maybe they got bored walked off set . becuase their no explanation who killed everyone , everyone except innocent girl dead . it chainsaw killing lots scythe beheading , but i just could not care . if i could give this movie negative stars i would , but 1 star lowest .	-1
if you're craving soapy queer fix now queer folk no longer lathering it up , then queer-noir private eye thriller third man out sure soothe your ache . plot may bit serpentine dialogue stretched corners cover maximum political ground , but chad allen nuanced sexily hard-boiled performance easily compensates these shortcomings . private eye donald strachey , allen comes off spenser crossed columbo dash brian kinney tossed into this enticing mix . though ron oliver direction isn't flashy , it very appropriate noir flick set albany . like richard stevenson books -- pages which donald strachey conceived -- this film character concept tension these two dramatic elements . stevenson one first writers infuse pragmatic , ultra-masculine private eye genre unabashedly gay aesthetic . perfect synthesis these two influences , third man out gives us detective who shares waltzes moonlight martinis his hubby , drives banged up toyota tercel lay bad guys flat unsparing right hook . third man production values outstanding cable film . keeping richard stevenson albany setting smart move here ! network , so many well intentioned films go astray when they aim glitzy settings end up cheap canadian photocopies . only flaws worth citing : couple actor sebastian spence scenes ( during which he portrays donald strachey husband cross c3po uncle arthur bewitched ) heavy-handed score ( good feature songs sandbagged some very obtrusive " tension suspense " instrumentals ) . what most delighted me third man thrill watching genuine polished noir flick which , every respect , thoroughly but naturally queer . while third man isn't brokeback mountain , it milestone its own right . it well executed , enjoyable film hard-boiled detective who wears bad ties breaks out blushing grin when his boyfriend kisses him cheek .	1
honestly , this just good movie enjoyed rainy day or girlfriend/boyfriend . it not supposed great genre-defining movie , it just supposed fun . three leading ladies play their parts exactly way they meant played . cici ( sofia vergara ) bombshell , lorena ( roselyn sanchez ) strong intelligent woman , patricia ( jaci velasquez ) plays rich girl . they great chemistry on-screen their rivalry played very well . it accomplishes exactly what it sets out : fun , i can't believe people trashing it	1
i happened upon this film late one night , bravo or fx , some channel like . i wasn't planning staying up or watching it , but i found myself constantly pulled back this film i no idea what title . i just felt myself sucked into it . so i gave up watched rest it . i never so spellbound , not happy pastoral way , but nonetheless hypnotized , film i this . actresses perfect their roles . you get defeinite sense altered realities , claustraphobially close minds two teenage girls bit ' off ' put it mildly . graphic , horrifying its realities ... just amazing . once film over , i caught end where it said it true story names , i immediatly go computer read everything this case . i horrified trip i just ... peter jackson brilliant . there no other way around it . friend mine sat me down watch dead alive show me work ' guy who doing lotr .

david mamet shows extent his talent writer director ' spartan , ' superior thriller all right moves . mamet completely avoids cliches predictability keeping plot constantly moving challenging . bring your thinking caps this one . this story that mostly plot little else , but there nothing wrong long you rapid pacing . yes , things get complicated get there fast . i don't want go too much into plot fear giving away plot twists . basically , val kilmer plays tough-as-nails secret service agent who gets involved case kidnapping president daughter . that all i say . really experience this film , it best go cold , while plot twists flood script , they always seem logical things unfold . it also worth noting this isn't generic action film . fact there not much " action , " normal sense word . but something always happening , once mamet charges this ticking clock pulse-pounder , there no turning back . mamet also doesn't waste time trite character arcs back stories . he soley focuses plot suspense thrills . characters seem almost if they already know themselves know their role events unfold . but mamet keeps them interesting tossing small details them throughout film . all all , this great thriller deserves more accolades than it got . it highly intelligent , never boring , always challenging , super-efficient , simply superb . see it . * note * : not see trailer before movie !!! it horrible trailer gives away many films secrets	1

what disaster ! this movie complete waste time start finish . animation ugly , horrible , unrealistic three stories bland boring . what disney thinking ? oh , i know ! " let see if we eek little more cash out cinderella . who cares if we destroy beloved classic ? " several main characters completely different original movie it makes no sense . first story , king turned happy-go-lucky doting grandpa-wannabe into stuffy , sour old curmudgeon . suddenly there rule no commoners palace ? uh ... isn't there line original " every eligible maiden kingdom ? " palace full commoners night . story picks up prince cinderella return their honeymoon , so space few weeks , king completely changed . i guess they weren't creative enough come up anything would stay true characters . other two stories equally nauseating not worth my time review or your time read . avoid this mess movie . really sad thing " ugly , horrible , unrealistic animation bland boring stories " pretty much describes any disney sequel or direc t-t o-video slop market	-1

this delightful comedy spoofing spaghetti western genre . it saucy sense humor . story pair brothers . one outlaw posing sherrif hide law . other ne'er well brother who fast gun faster his dry wit . each brother his own reasons decides help group mormon farmers protect them guy who wants their valley . old brother so because he wants steal rich man horses . younger just wants steal mormon daughters . nothing taken too seriously this film including fancy production values . it comes across inexpensively made italian wester because what it . not prevent it entertaining . unfortunately , low production values seem carried over into dvd transfer . i don't know this due poor quality original film or if it just bad job . whatever case , it still very watchable enjoyable . this one not particularly edifying but it fun	1

independent film channel showing few classic horror films here lately . week or two ago , it first third " texas chainsaw massacre " films , now this 1983 classic sam raimi . i hope second film way !. this my first real viewing film i remember . i saw it bits pieces some years back , dug it , but didn't remember much film whole . boy , i've missing out !. movie unabashedly filled splattering guts grue , any horror fan relish film over top gore . this same guy " spider-man " ?. always great bruce campbell heads up small cast ash(ashley ) , who goes little outing woods three other friends . only one gets out alive . they come creepy old cabin , things pretty much go downhill there . they find odd things including book made human skin recording previous tenant . before you know it , our little group resurrected ancient evil , they won't getting out alive . soon , demonic forces start take over gang , until ash put bloody gory stop it . raimi sets right tone delivers his chills thrills nice , organic fashion . looking back these older films , one appreciates them more when comparing them modern ones fancy effects cgi . raimi doesn't skimp awesomeness idea , let it all rip bloody good fun . only thing skimpy film characters . exception ash , three other friends mainly decoration taken down most awful ways . setting itself wonderful , brilliantly shot raimi . let face it , woods scary . woods night downright terrifying . raimi uses wonderful skill make most wooded areas making them not only sinister , but making them feel if they really alive . some make-up gore effects get chintzy here there , but most time they gorehounds delight . what you expect here ?. impalements , dismemberment , chainsaws , shovels , so . it remains seen if raimi ever return his low budget horror film ways . it would too bad if he didn't because he one masters	1

constant gardener interesting case strong direction performances managing paper over plot holes some serious lapses credibility . it hard imagine two central characters ever finding themselves together anywhere but writer wishful thinking , investigation into drugs ' companies faking trials africa relies perhaps too heavily slips tongue or odd incriminating document or conversation , yet edgy but genuinely energetic direction , better performances subject matter , it surprisingly powerful involving definitely one best john le carre adaptations . perfectly cast , ralph fiennes rachel weisz limitations work roles once : his awkward , half-apologetic shtick her over-zealous head girl act right here they irritating too many other films . not all casting or performances good , however , bill nighy showing again why he better light comedy than straight drama . danny huston shows some awkward beginnings before overcoming them fully inhabiting his pathetic role spineless lovestruck embassy official - accent seems little too affected first before wearing . well worth investigating	1

1993 movie version secret garden captures magic inspiring story both children adults , while bbc television version not . it plodding style , avalanche dialogue , low production standards let inherent magic escape . no matter how hard they try , multiple repetitions word " magic " not make tv show magical . some portions tv dialogue lost thick yorkshire accents unintelligible dialect , interesting only language scholars . other extreme too many wordy explanations what we just saw happen plainly heard spoken . just because television script corresponds closely beloved book not necessarily mean it makes good television , or it captures spirit book . children capable understanding something special or wonderful happening simply watching event take place . 1993 movie clearly knows this wisely lets picture speak thousand words . movie version communicates vibrant love life . you get know unique , even eccentric , characters though they real people struggling hardships fears . without contrived manipulations , you drawn into depths heights their emotions through use stunning visuals , dramatic portrayals , pithy dialogue , moments quiet contemplation , serene musical soundtrack worth owning its own merits . tv episodes , other hand , lot effort expended but no real drama achieved . example , during what could quiet , thoughtful moments solitude , mood often spoiled voice-over or use grainy film outdoor scenes - distracting contrast clear videotape used indoor sets . i've never made so aware production methods camera angles . i'd rather just sit back enjoy . bbc actors good appear capable much better performances , but director content their shallow characterizations few instances mumbling , garbling , stumbling over their lines . several points i expected hear director yell , " cut . try it again . " unfortunately , it not up normally high bbc standards . it nice better choice	-1

season 1 " millennium " featured fantastic performances its cast dark atmosphere made " x-files " look sunny comparison . unfortunately much year ended up little more than " murder mystery week " fare . thankfully second season , supervised former " x-files " producers glen morgan james wong , changed all . second season began suspenseful ' beginning end ' , where frank black pursues mysterious polaroid man who kidnapped his wife . this episode also introduces comic relief season two , computer hacker brian roedecker . even though ' beginnning end ' would fit perfectly season 1 , subsequent episodes follow different path greatly improved series . starting second episode , ' beware dog ' , continuing episodes such ' hand st. sebastian ' , ' owls ' , ' roosters ' , haunting two-part season finale ' fourth horseman/the time now ' , we find out millennium group existed since beginnings christianity isn't nearly altruistic frank black ( viewers ) originally suspected . addition millennium group storyline , we also learn more frank childhood via two holiday episodes : ' curse frank black ' , halloween-themed tale where frank encounters ghost neighbor who committed suicide , ' midnight century ' , emotional story frank trying mend relationship him his father . latter we find out frank not only one strange gift , his mother blessed/cursed ability see angels . lastly second season even showcased two comedy episodes : ' jose chung doomsday defense ' ' somehow satan got behind me ' . these hours television completely different average " millennium " episode ( say least ) but they're still worth look nonetheless . i could continue rambling greatness season two , but you'll really buy dvd set form your own opinions . dvd set come some bonus features , but only one worth season two documentary " turning tide " . rest bonus materials second-rate best	1

culkin(henry ) good job portraying scary lunatic , because he gives off spooky air . his acting , however very dull , takes away movie . however , culkins dry ( but convinving ) performance completely compensated performance elijah wood ( mark ) . not only mark most adorable , loveable child , but his performance jaw-dropping . spotlight this movie really belongs wood . he acts every scene out utmost emotion , passion . he makes this movie one best . it battle good ( mark ) evil ( henry ) . henry plays lunatic son , who awful things his family others . mark comes live henry his family while after his mom dies . henry mark cousin ( too bad mark ) . mark see evil lurking within henry , but he prove it his aunt uncle(henry parents ) before it too late ?	1

this movie , based thomas harris book , remake movie ' manhunter . ' story leads up events popular silence lambs film . red dragon remade because studio wanted cash surprising popularity hanibal lecter . unfortunately supply thomas harris books exhausted . so they revisited retitled this prequel silence lambs . thomas harris book original manhunter dr. lecter intriguing support character only . but now hollywood discovered hannibal character brings moviergoers so they take every opportunity red dragon add or lenghten scenes dr. lecter put him center stage . original manhunter fine film directed michael mann . it featured brian cox ( bourne identity ) dr. lecter william peterson ( csi ) special agent graham . this movie lacking all aspects original ( book ) . while anthony hopkins portrayal good mr. cox edward norton clearly out his depth . he unable convey complex emotional trauma agent graham experiences when he assimilates mindset sadistic killer who wipes out entire families . performances harvey keitel ralph fiennes also wasted here . my advice-buy or rent original .	-1

i am fan several atom egoyan films , curious milieu this one . since seeing it , i find my mind drifting back it some consistency ; empirically speaking , i know it affected me some levels i'm only dimly aware . i thought kevin bacon take character meant remind us older jerry lewis rich daring ; colin firth made indelible impression his straight man , repressed but debonair brit standing dean martin suave italian-american . alison lohman seems not quite up her key role , i found myself wondering if egoyan might someone more cerebral like sarah polley ( he cast her so perfectly sweet hereafter ) mind instead . classic whodunit dressed up artsy chronology , you find yourself changing your mind few times what really happened before final scenes	1
print looks like you're watching it through muddy water ; this something unclear " public domain " status this other capra works ? doesn't he family could help out his dvds way chaplin family , or even , use opposite extreme , family edgar ulmer , who released superlative versions some pretty dicey movies ? point if people paying something they deserve get it served up nice , all various dvds meet john doe painful watch . we've heard years re-worked ending film , one exists ( or existed one time ) . bring it ! now pleasure nearly entirely watching gary cooper react barbara stanwyck pure life . it sort like ball fire but bit more subtle . moviemakers knew they agood thing teaming two , because cooper slow-moving , nearly snakelike screen presence got injection caffeine when placed next stanwyck vibrant beauty her gorgeous clear gaze complexion . she doesn't even speak , she emanates something very basic her bones her posture . okay , movie writes itself into corner , what else going happen except if gary cooper not going kill himself movie break trust it established viewers . this always doe problem , it cheat come out ahead itself , it didn't work 1943 it still isn't working now . it great up until hour fifteen minutes ; then you feel gears start whine complain " hollywood " tries solve basically philosophical dilemma	1
i've never particular urge see breakfast tiffany . i'll watch any movie , but there few i don't want spend money such . i found this movie library figured " why not ? " here my review ; movie based novel truman capote ( subject last year " capote " this year " injustice " ) stars audrey hepburn one her most famous roles . anyone who didn't know this , hepburn doesn't play character named tiffany ... tiffany name jewelry store . anyway , hepburn plays holly golightly , eccentric playgirl who lives barren apartment nameless cat uses men way make money . she not golddigger , but whatever she ... it pretty close . holly needs money she middle looking wealthy man marry when less-than-wealthy paul varjak ( george peppard ) , writer , moves next door . two exchange romance candor holly begins calling him fred ( after her brother , who army ) . romance doesn't seem like it going anywhere ; after all , holly looking mr. " rich " right paul ( fred ) poor writer who also seems kind male prostitute one woman who lives 2e . course , this romantic-comedy so you know they're going hook up ... but what happens actually pretty entertaining funny . i suppose most humor comes fact film directed blake edwards ( pink panther fame ) ... majority comedic relief comes mr. yunioshi ( mickey rooney ) , " japanese " manager holly building who frequently remind her keep noise down . mr. yunioshi , course , tanned mickey rooney fake teeth yelling fake accent . he hilarious though , truly great character . character i liked cat , cat . sure it simple character , but i don't know man ... cat cool . hepburn peppard chemistry great , this movie made 1961 but picture perfec t.t his truly gem 60s . if you liked movies like when harry met sally , then you should definitely like this . wonderful movie . grade :	1
" above rim " city game basketball , played asphalt rough , physical style , where rewards status glory neighborhood . it shot location harlem , especially rucker playground , legendary court where , 1970s , visiting stars like wilt chamberlain julius erving would drop play local heroes . movie moves action up present tells story high school basketball whiz named kyle ( duane martin ) who attracted attention top college scouts . georgetown recruiter stands several games . kyle dreams someday playing nba waits anxiously letter intent georgetown , which doesn't come - maybe because , attempt impress scout , he hogging ball taking unwise shots . parallel high school basketball , but world its own , neighborhood shoot-out , tournament held rucker playground teams sponsored local merchants , including drug dealers . kyle plans play team run his school coach . but then his best friend , bugaloo ( marlon wayans ) , talks him into visiting club run sinister birdie ( tupac shakur ) , kid seduced its shabby glamor into agreeing play birdie team . this not wise move . birdie drug dealer , that fact well-known tall , silent shep ( leon ) , former rucker star who moved out town but now back security guard high school . shep once friendly kyle mother ( tonya pinkins ) , now , they begin see each other again , he tries guide kyle direction college , away superficial glories shoot-ou t.t he movie climaxes , course , big shoot-out game , violent surprise i found less than likely . but that not really what it . it more dreams poor black kids use their basketball skills ticket out inner city . this elusive dream , brilliant chicago-based documentary " hoop dreams " demonstrates . only tiny percentage high school stars ever play college , let alone nba . but kids like kyle can't help hoping . both shep his mother point out education , not nba ticket , real reason go school . movie lives easily streets where it shot , performances - especially martin , shakur pinkins - convincing . we get sense daily rhythm character lives , drama , movie finds room surprising amount humor , especially dialogue . movie , directed jeff pollack , co-written pollack barry michael cooper , who wrote poetic evocative wesley snipes drama " sugar hill .

this movie one those family charmers something everyone . there exciting animated portion children . there love story ladies . there battle world war ii germans guys all ages . tying all these different aspects together wonderful concept ; angela lansbury mail-order witch ! during world war ii , parents sent their children london country because london bombed continuously . three children , carrie , paul charlie rawlins ( performed cindy o'callaghan , roy snart ian weighill , respectively ) , placed eglantine price ( lansbury ) . we quickly learn miss price completely uninterested caring any children they may upset her mysterious plans . children , we , soon learn miss price witch training , training received mail ! because miss price actually very nice , if somewhat eccentric , lady , she works compromise children , allowing them live her her large home . we also quickly learn mail order school closing , miss price looking important lesson . children miss price off find headmaster school , mr. emelius browne ( played david tomlinson , who also performed " tom jones , " " mary poppins , " " love bug " ) . their mode travel bed miss price modified using spell . mr. browne astounded his spells actually worked . however , mr. browne also sorry but he unable provide important spell miss price seeking ; spell could save england hitler ! soon children , miss price disbelieving mr. browne off portobello road find book containing spell , instead running into bookman ( played sam jaffe , who gunga din 1939 movie " gunga din , " other great movies such " ben-hur " " day earth stood still " ) . after escaping bookman , children adults head off mystical island encounter group animated talking critters . returning island , three children two adults prepared rest searching important spell when they discover german submarine landed soldiers planning create mischief english countryside . ending this movie charmer intrigue even most jaded movie fans , provide laughs everyone . this movie pure escapist fantasy begins very real life event , much like other similar stories such " alice wonderland . " i think angela lansbury makes this movie believable . she slips into her role very comfortably , making you believe she somewhat bumbling witch who barely controls her own spells . she admittedly novice witch , but very believable novice . this movie centers her her acting ability . once you accept miss price apprentice witch , traveling bed , which accompanied dated special effects ) , animated talking animals , armor moving itself easy accept . even easier accept laughs go story . this movie era when disney studios fool-proof formula delivering good family movies . this family movie one best , treasure every family movie library .	1
" goonies " my favorite movie all time . i bite my tongue whenever i watch it anybody because i literally quote movie verbatim . i've considered doing one person stage screen play , but i just can't seem get truffel shuffel move down . hehe ever since i saw this movie kid , it taken ahold my imagination never let go . i lost count how many times i've seen goonies now , but somehow , i never get tired watching film . it still amazes me how this ' 80s movie stood test time ; albeit imagination sheer genius richard donner steven spielberg . you know there 20th anniversary celebration gathering fans all over world back 2005 ? they all met astoria , oregon ; where goonies filmed back 1985 . jeff cohen ( chunk ) sean astin ( mikey/frodo ) even showed up event . correy feldman showed up few days after official event over well . it long rumored sequal goonies works , but unfortunatly , it seems warner brothers killed all hopes not relinquish rights donner speilberg ! talk huge mistake- jerk alert ; seems wb ridden up troy bucket . i could go this movie , but instead i elaborate goonies film subject .. pop soundtrack film score ..... " goonies " pop soundtrack capures fun-loving decade ' 80s listening these songs makes various scenes movie come mind vivid detail . my favorite track off cd probably reo speedwagon " wherever you're goin ' ( it alright ) " . i also quite like philip bailey " love alive " because song played during part movie where troy catapults brand off side cliff little girl , pink , training bike . classic ! who could forget cyndi lauper " goonies ' good enough " track ; not me . i love this song well , it brings back some incredible memories ' 80s this movie specifically . now .. address film score controversy .. there some debate whether or not entire film score ever released united states . many say it simply bootleg got around small circles . ( go soundtrack.com learn more film score . ) said , i know , however , film score recorded ' world premier recording ' cd , " best adventure " . i this cd , goonies score it , quite simply , amazing ! i'm not kidding , when i played it first time , i actually teared up . so nostalgic beautiful . recording this cd almost 19 minutes long ; it recorded city prague philharmonic . this only legitimate cd entire goonies film score ever released ; booklet this cd , " best adventure " also confirms recording ' world premier ' dave grusin goonies film score . there bootlegs circulated goonies film score it ebay . some these pirated cd so called ' previously unreleased ' tracks film . these ebay sellers blatantly lie trick try pass these cd off original ' imports ' japan etc . some people believe anything , so i am here set record straight tell you truth . i even found one ebay seller california gone far changing his user id three times try get away selling slick looking bootleg . this particular pirated cd 2 ' gold ' cd goonies dave grusin film score also so called gold coin prop replica two bumper sticker decals pirated music . i am keeping record what he up . avid official goonies collector , ebay seller also professional graphic designer , i hate see people getting ripped off greedy liars who know photoshop too well who visit knikos too often . i could go exactly how these bootlegs constructed believe me i could whip up exact repliac within day .. yup , even down printed gold discs , ' high quality ' decals , ' unreleased tracks ' , photo booklet gold coin replica . anyways , consider this information buyer beware , word wise , warning . all cd other than best adventure goonies film score pirated . so there no confusion , there legitimate japanese pop soundtrack import , which you see amazon picture above , but there no such thing japanese film score cd or any other film score cd other than " best adventure " . who knows if entire score ever officially released usa well , but , my opinion , found " best adventure " cd even better than finding one eyed willie rich stuff . while i think it , who knows whether warner brothers finally let richard donner steven spielberg make amazing sequal goonies . all stars up it well , but nooo , warner brothers go screw it up ! ( okay , enough stealing mouth lines ) . haha . i really feel , order get film score released officially usa , also order get sequal made ( before everybody starts looking like one eyed willie ) people . people like us who love this movie who dream big . like mikey said , it our time down here ; so start writing , warner brothers , people ; let your voices heard . it our time .. never say die .	1

i seen this movie many times think it very entertaining . brigitte bardot absolutly beautiful , she free sprited bohemian style makes her unlike anyone movies , yet she vulnerable innocent marilyn monroe .. i see how this movie caused uproar 1956 , but it nothing compared movies today . opening scene bb nude sun bathing wouldn't cause any commotion today , fact , some parts really funny watch . plot loosely based marilyn monroe life orphan who forced marry so she doesn't go back orphanage . problem she love two brothers , when she married one . there also older rich man offering her life him . it all leads wild erotic dance bb sexy opened skirt , bare feet , hair flying .. " this woman needs tamed " lol ! i think juliette just misunderstood , lost , lonely , girl , who only power seemed her beauty attention she got her many male admirers .. i would love see restored copy film , but i don't think it any " english dub " i don't like reading sub titles . i hope they release dvd dub option it . this one great classics era . it easy see how bb inspired hippy generation her bare feet untamed hair . beatles said she their favorite pin up girl ! this movie made her internation star .	1

this one those films makes me think it must impossible anyone make truly great film . back cover makes it sound like must-see anyone going through tough time their lives wanting shoulder lean , it seems all critics concur that not inacurate description , yet when i tried watching this film , i couldn't stand it ! whole thing jumbled mess . it kept going back forth things i just didn't care , tedious , boring things , i think it focused too much criminals involved story , making them sound sympathetic or whatever , when film cop who overcome grief ( supposedly , or something like ) death his partner who viciously killed criminal . story like this shouldn't spend petty time detailing exploits , trials tribulations whatnot why vicious killer kills people whatever else all whatever ... when writer wasn't focusing goodfornothing criminals , it focused bunch pathetic backstory , kind makes teenagers cringe thought reading book ( too much " character development " ) . then i saw truly breathtaking film , titled batman returns ( 1992 ) blown away its depiction heartbreak combined stunning visuals , everyone else like " oh , who cares ? " i truly hate this film i hate society lets people make such mediocre crap then acts like its their civil duty put up it ( watch it ) then say they liked it . no , not all my favorite films action/pop-corn flix . i also liked 1999 bringing out dead , well 1976 taxi driver , i even enjoy occasional " little movie " ( there too many mention , but i'll start last one i saw i enjoyed : wild dogs , director hanging garden - film i hated ) . ok , that all i say this film	-1

memories both good bad light up what yet remains day . this story how man finds comfort remembering what he achieved , what he lost . remains day saw reuniting merchant/ivory/jhabvala/hopkins/thompson team made howards end two years before ( 1991 ) . it almost pinter/irons/streep team made french lieutenant woman 1981 , mike nichols directing this time , but other commitments forced nichols just co-producing role . it would interesting compare pinter jhabvala treatments kazuo ishiguro book . this merchant/ivory their prime , it sumptuous production creates period milieu ( 30s 50s stately english country house ) without falter , proceeds suitably stately pace . there two parallel developments throughout film : first we see lord darlington ( james fox ) use his wealth position try soften resentment germany feels over harsh treaty versailles , only him disillusioned end . second concerns romance two servants house ( hopkins stevens butler thompson kenton housekeeper ) . darlington convinced more damage since war than during it , situation inevitably give rise war unless something ameliorate germany position . his standards old fashioned ones english aristocracy : fair play , don't hit man when he down , always act honour . however he fails understand something already ameliorate situation , it german , adolf hitler . he believes hitler . fair darlington , most europe before wwii believed hitler ( even his staunch opponent winston churchill once fan ) . one point darlington , who very kindly man , dismisses two jewish refugees whom he employed , simply because they jews . but it bothers him , point film onwards , he begins realise his mistake . during after war darlington hated nazi sympathiser collaborator , it breaks him . darlington gone through same experience prince salina leopard . what we seeing here values one generation replacing those . darlington tragedy he outlived his time . his values sneered , his position no longer unquestioned . he doesn't know what when dealing those who don't share his standards culture . sense , worthy he , he dinosaur . it smaller age , when working men decide policy they know nothing voting general election , where very people he trying aid treat him contempt dupe ( " we call them concentration camps , you call them prisons , but it much same " ) . butler stevens staunch defender english class values period . he built his life ideal service , more democratic age dawns , he difficulty adapting it . stevens knows order dignity must prevail , he what amounts small army under his command , each whom must know his duty his place whole machine function . stevens ' ally this formidable task miss kenton housekeeper . this alliance two capable people flows love story which second plot strand film . slowly stevens loses faith darlington , pivot his order . several times he denies knowing him . he sees great house its army servants dismantled . new , more egalitarian times bring new owner new master ( film american millionaire lewis ) . yet throughout stevens keeps his feelings himself . he no more expressive . it kenton who makes all moves their romance . stevens remains passive subject her decisions . now here difficult matter . throughout film we see stevens tormented again again his inability express his emotions ( superb job acting hopkins ) . we never know why . there no indication film stevens considers his ideal service more important , or substitute , his emotional life ( we told his father worked butler , yet he married ) . there moments when frustrations both stevens kenton treated humorously film makers . motivation given both stevens darlington indicates structural flaw film , its one weakness . we given no clue stevens ' silence his feelings . we expected feel it weakness darlington attempt appease hitler . but it historically unlikely him not so . time darlington meetings hitler elected chancellor germany , not fuhrer . he hadn't put anyone concentration camp . he published mein kampf which he expressed incoherent theories race not many could understand ( even , it said , hitler himself ) . he made demands take over part czechoslovakia which germany plausible right . he shaping up strong man europe ; many politicians relieved see him successful . it time when ' totalitarian ' no pejorative meaning .

i think this most historically accurate account reign elizabeth i . read many accounts this time period , i impressed how much detail went into recreating actual events . i found commentary wonderful , but distracting . there no subtitles , so commentary spoken over dialog . there also some occasions where commentary repeated itself ( same comments given different events ) . i think you end up watching dvd thru first - then watching again commentary .	1

this dvd reveals marketing campaign bush administration goal go war iraq . they no reason until 9/11 . but first they convince american people . other words , they lie . first lie : iraq weapons mass destruction ( wmd ) . very broad sense wmd mean chemical nuclear weapons . but chemical weapons tactical or battlefied weapons kill hundreds or even thousands . they also degrade rapidly usually within matter months . then , you see clip g.w. telling his audience saddam several hundred tons chemical agents . there clip condi rice saying aluminum tubes could only beused fuel rockets even though our energy department , un , ambassador wilson claimed they could not . next , there cheney claiming iraq reconstituted nuclear weapons . repeatedly we shown clip after clip bush , cheney , rumsfeld , rice powell claiming iraq wmd capability , claiming they couldn't wait smoking gun come form mushroom cloud . this nuclear side dvd which strategic application , kill millions . when asked if rumsfeld knew definitely where iraq keeping their wmd , he replied , " tikrit baghdad . somewhere north , south , east or west there . " really narrows it down . second lie : there connection al quada saddam hussein . this administration wanted us believe saddam would give traceable nuclear material bin laden so he could use it against us . we supposed believe ultra-control freak , madman virtual pagan would ally himself religious fanatic whom he might share power popularity . sure ! saddam support terrorism , which amounted giving $ 25,000 families suicide bombers israel . there no terrorist training camps under his control . period . third lie : attempting paint anyone who disagreed administration policy traitor . [ ... ] it clear this superb dvd this administration " data mining " i.e. defining their theory then looking any evidence suppport it , rather than other way around . analysts cia who wanted get ahead began write their intelligence estimates suit what they knew administration wanted . analysts who said there no connection ignored . vice president cheney made unprecedented 29 visits cia 9/11 start hostilities . he ever ask , " you certain iraq not involved ? " what would analyst conclude ? why rumsfeld suggest hitting iraq one day after 9/11 ? there no aluminum tubes , yellow cake , wmd , nuclear or chemical . we went war lie alienating our allies , giving our enemies reason . some important questions emerge this dvd : weapons inspector hans blix stated : " how could anyone [ bush administration ] 100% sure existence wmd zero percent knowledge where they ? " now neocons claim these missiles moved syria , but they don't know exactly where . now , how you know sure something one place if you don't know where place ? if israelis knew iraq all these wmd chemical nuclear weapons , wouldn't they bombed them ? would they waited us ? mossad , perhaps finest intelligence service world , spies all over place . they guided israeli bombs iraqi reactor 1981 . anyone believe israelis would sat their hands ? finally , why president bush take us war when he knew :o aluminum tubes not missiles or fuel ? o scud rockets didn't even range get europe ? o ambassador wilson told him iraq not getting enriched uranimum niger ? o letter niger claimed uranium deal made , actually fake ? o weapons inspectors stated iraq no such wmd capability ? o if this president took us war knowing their evidence lie or even suspect , isn't impeachable offense ? richard nixon charged impeachment violating his constitutional oath , failing ensure our laws faithfully executed , making false misleading statements , misuse cia , withholding information congress , deceiving people united states false misleading statements . sound familiar	1

ever since i saw " fahrenheit 9/11 " ( which i thought ferociously hilarious ) , i trying check out michael moore earlier work ( both books films ) . i finally got around see " big one " this weekend . i felt like i could really relate michael disdain corporate america spent time working major corporation myself . i could relate employees various corporations who continually gotten screwed over corporate machine . i think it hilarious how random house tried reign michael shenanigans during his book tour their escorts . while there lots hilarious moments when michael tries confront various company ceos why they laying off their employees when they making good amount cash , there also good mix drama . one my favorite moments film when michael went capital wisconsin talk then governor tommy thompson his welfare reform policies two women who living below poverty level . apparently new welfare reform policy tommy signed when he governor doesn't work everyone . i love politician michael women confront state capital equivalent snake oil salesman , no one buying his schpiel because those women went through process new welfare reform they still living below poverty . one most personal touching moments when michael book signing borders ' bookstore one people line woman who recently laid off ford co .. i moved michael concern woman . i also liked his conversations other people like diners iowa ( i think ) just getting their overall opinions presidential election ' 92 . like his other films , " big one " mixes biting satirical humor real-life drama . michael moore movies me like mtv show " punk'd " socio-political message without talent-challenged ashton kutcher	1

i've seen mike stern group live many times , after first few songs , somehow you get bit bored . this concert kinda same . it got great musicians it , though . great thing mike you tell he plays heart lot intensity . he actually gives 100% when he plays . i've never seen him keyboardist , which probably what lacks . dennis chambers great musician , however , his performance not really audience much it himself drummers . there very little his solos even behind songs average listener appreciate enjoy their level . if you drummer you appreciate what his doing very complex , but get boring average listener . bob franciscini great sound , but his solos get little abstract times but then he stops here comes mike again . richard bona phenominal bass , although he doesn't overplay like other members group it fact makes him shine . he great job tipatina . overall it good performance . i preferred see dave weckl than chambers , myself , but now i just view dvd whenever i wish see mike that good thing	1
this excellent film . billy bob clean-vut barber who keeps himself . his wife married him because she liked he didn't talk very much . it tragedy epic proportions , great performances all involved . only thing me holds this back five star film fact every single scene someone lights up cigarette or taking deep drags one . alone justifies this film " " rating . when watching this film , it seems they encouraging people " cool " smoking pleasurable thing . most notorious moment me when frances mcdormand sitting bathtub asks her barber husband ( billy bob ) shave her legs . he walks somberly cigarette drooping his lips she tells him give her drag . this putrid moment just drove me crazy ! but then , just my opinion . overall , film could good greater if it not incessant smoking throughout . plot slow yet intensely emotional . if you don't mind smoking , then you probably enjoy this dramatic tragedy . if you strongly opposed smoking or children who interested seeing this , you should review film before letting them see it	1
i already fan welles " touch evil " when i came across this gem 3 am one night public tv . variety reasons , i keep volume off , but nonetheless i spellbound couldn't wait hear dialogue plot ! set little expensive casual viewer , but film so entertaining if you catch it sale or used i heartily recommend shelling out it . it fast moving , quirky little film noir some amusing dialogue ( my favorites include " criminals aren't worst people - they're just stupidest ! " " they're penitentes - it means they're sorry their sins " - " they must awful sorry ... " ) . whatever reasons history personality there , welles films simply over-critiqued . this enjoyable any 40 bogart caper flick accident history left it sadly ignored - so " thank you ! " criterion finally giving this marvelous film it day sun . i pleased opportunity see other ' versions ' film , but snappiest version still " confidential report " - warts , continuity gaffs all . it somehow comes across very humorous - something i felt new edit lacking . that odd because footage mainly same . perhaps it pace dolivet version maintains . one thing criterions bw transfers i bone pic though , shadows simply too dark . my home vision vhs copy seems easier eye little details within shadows apparent , where criterion transfer they solid black . i same trouble watching " seven samurai " i'll keeping my vhs , too . ah , well . overall i'm thrilled hope they release " trial " someday .	1

this quite simply best book film adaption ever accomplished hollywood . ever . i am author myself , part what inspired me narnia . my heart always tied this land created cs lewis . it pure magic , this man phenomenal writer his story original fantasy . first , let me tell you my usual reviews book movie translations . i absolutely detested lord rings trilogy . i know it sounds harsh , but i hated those movies . peter jackson , though great director his own right , absolutely butchered tolkiens world . me , those movies if he took book , rammed it into shotgun , fired , picked up scattered remains , glued mismatched pieces together handed it actors . thats how bad i think they . if books never , those movies would great stand alone movies , but they aren't , because they removed many better sections tolkiens tale . harry potter . i loved first few books , i got really pissed off movie when it came out because once again , they cut out many better scenes book . i stopped watching movies after second one . so , you probably expect , when i walked into movie theater december , waiting see chronicles narnia : lion , witch , wardrobe , i very antsy , very skeptical . narinia closer me my heart than any other novels hollywood ruined , so i expecting worst , same time , dreadfully depressed what " worst " could mean . i walked , i took my seat , film started . beggining " blitz " scene began , i immediatly noticed how close reality planes bombing manuevers . ( historian heart , thats brownie point right there ) then i realised importance this first scene . director putting viewer into middle lewis time . showing you what surroundings he writing this . right then , i started hope . movie unfolded , children got train , first opening strain true " narnia " music began play , i began cry . no joke . i sat cried first few minutes i heard music . because i knew right then there , narnia stepped out cs lewis mind , out his book , onto this screen . this director managed bind very essence narnia into this movie . there differences . it true , changes made . but they small , they few , they far . whatever it director this movie , it bound spirit book into this film . i cannot tell you how happy i when i left movie theater . there no words describe it , coming writer , who describes things living , thats pretty damn hard come . this film magical . everything , all casting , all sets , all lines , if they personally overseen c.s. lewis himself . when you watch this film , you there . you stepped through walked into narnia . so , if there any doubt your mind buying or watching this movie i hope i cleared it up , because i tell you if you shell out whatever cash buy this , you very , very glad you . best thing movie like this , gather your family close you , sit catch lights off , christmas eve , watch this . welcome narnia folks , i never thought we'd make it , but guess what ? aslan worked miracle just you me	1
i not enjoy this movie very much . after reading what this movie , i really high hopes it . i expected it very interesting moving . but after watching it , i somewhat disappointed . one flaws this movie it focuses too heavily friendship main character little girl ( main child character ) . she becomes obsessed him develops crush him . she gets jealous possessive when he tries help or others , whether they children or adults . i certainly not like part where man innocent child take her place transport death camp . addition , i strongly suspect her voice dubbed woman voice . it not sound like little girl voice all . this movie flaws play end movie , where main character children try show red cross what really happening jews europe , , my opinion , not very well . children pushed into space supposed represent gas chamber , then they quickly pulled out . main character , knowing he children going killed anyway , should concluded play children lie down pretend quot ; sleep . quot ; this would sent less ambiguous message red cross . overall , despite these weaknesses ( several others ) , i found movie passable , am not discouraging anyone watching it . however , i certainly not add it my collection holocaust movies . some holocaust movies i feel much better , would strongly recommend , include schindler list , sophie choice , europa , europa , escape sobibor , good evening mr. wallenberg , life beautiful , triumph spirit ( latter two movies among best movies i ever seen )	-1
only problem this dvd there isn't enough info original investigation . this truly fascinating watch , very sad commentary state mind middle america even nowadays . these children screwed over so obviously our " justice " system sad really burns heart anyone who believes justice . most fascinating character still crazy step-father who totally " sketchy " really appears much more capable murder than docile children who convicted . i haven't seen first film would love know more just how these kids railroaded . they alibi , what argued motive etc ., etc . these details would nice addition this film just so everyone more familiar background , however , this still very interesting flick . very sad	1

i heard this movie years ago thought premise sounded funny , but never made any effort see it . i happened notice it video store other day when i saw sean hayes it , my memory it came back i thought , " okay , sure , sean , it least entertaining . " i really wasn't prepared how deeply funny , sad , brilliant this little film . let get past problems first : bad lighting , amateurish camera angles , okay , yes . but story wayward reject april ( katie holmes , who so brilliant perfect i can't understand what happened her career -- oh right ; tom ; oops ! ) her desperate attempt prepare thanksgiving dinner her estranged family , most hellish apartment building nyc , superb . some lines come out nowhere just force you laugh , they so funny true . patricia clarkson mother cancer oliver platt her loving , keep-positive-at-all-times husband , just simply outstanding . movie keeps moving all times its funny-tragic plot , its sad little subplot boyfriend bobby ( derek luke ) trying find nice suit impress april family , just takes hold you drags you this dysfunctional family world insists you go ride , whether you like it or not . sean hayes not big part i thought he , but indicated without shadow doubt his off-kilter comic timing cinched him part jack " grace .

( i say i loved it ? )yes , you get over atrocious lighting ( hello people -- ever hear lights ? ) , if you claustrophobia you might freak out feeling tight , crammed little apartments , but if you get past those things you enjoy ou t-t here humor tinge tragedy , you're treat . thumbs up all way	1

frank mccourt best-selling book so good , this movie so true it , if you liked one , you'll like this because rarely film so close book . it amazing , given what normally case . even though film brought no surprises , i still thought it fascinating because fantastic cinematography here great job actors . muted colors this film beautiful lighting superb . then again , it hard go wrong nighttime streetlight-lit shot cobblestone streets . directing talents alan parker never more evident than here . he should more movies . book , " angela ashes , " biography mccourt his extremely poor irish family . all three boys who play mccourt various times his development excellent here . whole cast excellent , matter , led " angela " ( emily watson ) husband malachy ( robert caryle ) . two sadder-looking faces , you never see , more rainy , dreary town ( limerick ) you never see .... so if you're looking happy , uplifting story , pass this one . however , if you want film totally true great book , wonderfully photographed film one acted well .... some unique humor it , check this out . i don't want leave out humor , key ingredient mccourt otherwise- depressing days growing up . humor dire poverty never went together so well mccourt made it sound through his book filmmakers through this movie .	1
three problems this film : 1 . pacing - film pacing doesn't vary . it very boring . matter fact , this wouldn't problem if film much more tense ( e.g. , " speed " ) , however this film lacks high-action intensity pull off such slow expository speed . 2 . effects - too many sequences this film rely color light superimpositions , there overabundance high-speed imaging . scene changes employ erratic barrages images desensitize viewer thrilling " horror " scenes . furthermore , they fail make enough sequential sense film plot really mean much film greater whole . upshot : film relies too heavily art editing , point where plot twists no longer interesting . 3 . triviality - plot conclusion quails face " so what ? " question . viewer left sense , " i sat through film ? " light points ( 1 ) ( 2 ) , this obnoxious bit icing cake . don't waste your life . alon	-1
violent anyone ! this movie horrible . cast good , but plot stinks ! its just this family who super powers . then this kid wanted mr. incredibles side kick . ( way) mr. incredible says no so then he hates him . then kid turns evil kills people , wants every body like him . thats origanal . there barely any jokes you laugh once every 20 minutes , there way much violence . killing , guns , punching , bombs , they say stupid words sometimes . i not like person who directed this film because he should not like violence . so i not recommend this movie anyone . especially 2 disc special edition !	-1

this dvd really good selection gang/ rascals comedies , among best bunch ! " free wheeling " ( 1932 ) much said supposed racism gang/rascals , but this possibly most anti-racist all gang films . dickie moore snooty mother overprotects her impaired son refuses let him play stymie , who she referrs " colored boy " " street urchin , " but guess who saves day ? strong stuff 1932 good stuff today . mike fright ( 1934 ) hoot gang " international silver string submarine band " running amuck radio station . love gag where tommy bond sucks lemon ( " they're good your freckles " ) while leonard tries play trumpet .

i really looking forward movie . my goal expand my understanding this historical period . many scenes looked like they used old sets 50 westerns lighting technique disappointing , these alone not turn me off watching . my real gripe movie dialogue acting . within first 10 minutes movie , stage coach robbed , my attention drawn portrayals actors . they not believable dialogue just sounded like something came out book young readers . later , when alerted posse nearly upon them , other rider responds such uncharacterist language male ruffian i laughed . movie plodded forward , scene after scene left me wondering , how quickly this thrown together how come they didn't rehearse more . i felt my patience endure several more hours unfair punishment . i generally try watch movie entirely but frankly , i think it embarrassment waste time . maybe it got better ( why i gave it two stars ) but i find doubtful . i am wondering if both tom berrenger other author missed many classes script writing 101 .	-1
this truly one finest films ever made exposing tyranny cuban communist state over one its weakest subjects . irony film , effeminate homosexual poet , actually bravest , strongest most heroic man film . only " real man " reinaldo arenas . while latin ' macho ' heterosexual males actually cowardly accomplices no honor , guts or bravery . reinaldo patriot , real man who not lack courage his conviction . this film make you rethink concept manhood , our homosexual hero stood firm against castro dictatorship , continued his conviction world literature which dominated pro castro left ... thus guaranteeing his works would never published . unashamed his sexuality , he faced death same conviction he faced injustice while living castro communist cuba . see this film . one caveat , i suggest you buy dvd see film english subtitles . poetry dialogue make experience something you'll never forget . imagery film , outstanding , musical score perfect . scene johnny depp both transvestite gestapo like communist interrogator my opinion one his finest performances . especially memorable , lezama lima explaining our hero since tyrant cannot govern beauty , he wants destroy it , allowing 400 years cuban culture go down drain while everyone applauds . there so many universal truths this film one simple review cannot possibly elaborate 1/10 them . however i guarantee you never forget this film . just remember use english subtitles it stay you rest your life	1

2005 " upside anger , " missed out during awards season ; it didn't well boxoffice . but don't pass it . it features chilling performance joan allen boozy abandoned stay-at-home wife ( her husband apparently left sweden his assistant ) , great comeback performance kevin costner her neighbor , who plays beer-buzzed ex-baseball player turned radio dj ( he hired talk baseball but he doesn't want ) . scene where costner first learns allen husband abandoned her hoot . he arrives her door , beercan hand , discuss idea turning those tulgy woods behind their property into subdevelopment , things progress bizarrely there , ill-matched pair end up making each other comfortable , finally they're least embarked road happiness . supporting cast great , too . allen four daughters , superbly played ( oldest youngest ) alicia witt , keri russell ( " felicity " ) , erika christiansen ( " traffic " ) , evan rachel wood ( " pretty persuasion " ) . each memorable scene or two or three . director mike binder turns up kostner not quite pervy producer . he overdoes sleazebag bit , but maybe that point . beware ! film begins ( ends ) one those pseudo-significant voiceover narrations ( wood ) funeral scene ( rain , course ) . might make you roll back your eyes hit eject button . but don't it ! there quick flashback three years before , when action starts , you begin realize you haven't seen all characters you're now introduced among mourners . so , various crises develop way , you begin ponder who among others buried . when you find out , it quite shock .	1

i all prepared rate " hard boiled " slightly above average hong kong shoot-em-up entertaining but nothing would distinguish it similar fare . then director john woo serves up inspired finale hospital rank one most ingenious action segments screen history . set-up some gangsters stashed arsenal hospital morgue . police uncovered operation which leads stand-off them hoods . caught hospital staff , patients , some oh-so-cute newborn babies . less said better . nevertheless , woo throws out rulebook what action film . woo essentially toying us first hour or so order throw us this delicious curveball . i imagine some people revulsed this segment . personally , i awestruck grateful artist like woo taking risk	1
i forever dark why anyone would dislike this piece theater . so many times you hear how " cerebral " " inaccesible " sondheim shows . it so hard people think feel same time ? beauty this piece it forces audience think their relationship art ( either artist or patron ) same time allows you care characters deeply . alright , so you listen it few times before you really begin " get it . " this work allows you witness artist ( considered genius many ) who devotes himself competely his work only realize he must it expense all his other relationships . " beautiful , " during which george tries but realizes it too late connect his aging mother , " we not belong together , " when love his life tells him she simply cannot #2 anymore , i am not sure how anyone watch these amazing moments not moved . score haunting acting ( except few moments don't quite work mr. patinkin ) astonishing . it very risky choice opening number during which soloist hardly moves , but bernadette peters draws you start ... brilliant acting . perhaps voices not " perfect " dvd they original soundtrack , but give me actors who willing sacrifice perfect vocal delivery emotional content any day . this production one my favorites essential anyone interested artistic process	1

okay , let get one thing straight , acting pretty good . all kids cute adorable pretty darn good job their parts . vin diesel good lovely watch , lauren graham movie ! ( think : lorelai gilmore ) . though , lauren looked different some reason , i couldn't quite place it ; added pounds ? new hair style ? i don't know ... anyway onto storyline , or lack there . put it simply , it appears object write movie vin diesel it , style kindergarten cop . however , someone failed hire good writer , or director ! they rushed through intro cut through blah-blah ( substance ) story just so they could arrive part where they could " showcase " vin diesel this role tough guy caring some adorable kids . it not convincing ; so many scenes just happen they leave you feeling like you whiplash . all all , it probably great movie kids 8 , 9 , 10 years old .	-1

this product limited no longer made universal studios . steven spielberg prefers you buy his new " enhanced " version e.t.i , like most reviewers here , prefer original version this movie . what spielberg 2002 this movie he computer-animated e.t. , enhanced few scenery shots , added two extra scenes , digitally removed all hand guns . now i don't mind him adding extra scenes , but all other things basically changed film . i liked e.t. puppet . he more real . speilberg basically just threw away all work puppeteers ( which made up little people , boy no legs , lady doing . . ' arms ) . yes spielberg , i understand this what you would if given technology back 1982 , but you don't change anything . digitally removing handguns replacing them walkie-talkies stupid too . government agents use guns stop anyone who tries stop them . spielberg philosophy behind doing this he regretted government agents using guns apprehend kids . but that what agents . how they going stop kids walkie-talkies , say , " hey , i walkie-talkie i'm not afraid use it . " spielberg also upset guns family film . well , he didn't really make this " family film " when he allowed cussing it , such " " word , " " word , somebody calling someone else " pen*s breath . " how come you didn't edit spielberg . so if you , try buy this product , because this only way find this film its original version ( unfortunately this product 2002 version but it all worth it ) . every director should freedom what they want films , but keep original versions fans please ! goes you too george lucas .	1
it amazing how hollywood publishing industry bent their knees secession mythology , birth nation present example melodramatic falsification . this very dull , shapeless , stilted movie . i wouldn't bother denounce it artistic grounds , but since it above all piece propaganda , i'm compelled condemn it history . what it presents " war states " version civil war , which gallant southerners defend their homes , their beloved hills dales , their cultured lives inexplicable invasion rude hordes north . there only two black characters , both sentimentally loyal their southernness their masters ; otherwise , slavery beside point . generalship lee jackson , course , idolized , while northern officers above rank colonel portrayed fools . battle scenes perfectly predictable ; guys charge foot , other guys shoot , fields littered bodies . wouldn't little exposition logistics those battle more interesting ? how real it show only one train , southern , war won more transportation than musketry ? if you believer myth lost cause justice secession , if you ever cottoned notion war wasn't really slavery , then i challenge you honor ! i defy you read just one heavy , scholarly book , arguing slavery william lee miller , professor university virginia . it retells debates occurred house representatives , over slavery , 1830s , twenty-five years before election lincoln . uncompromising sectional hatred expressed those debates surely convince you civil war deeper roots than you thought , slavery indeed central issue both sides , blue grey	-1

dead end classic , but one that pretty much forgotten these days rarely revived tv , let reissue circuit . it shame , because alongside crusading social drama it also one most strikingly designed magnificently shot films thirties thanks greg toland remarkable photography richard day marvellous set . almost every shot film extraordinarily imaginative - not just beautifully composed , but also absolutely right scene . william wyler hands , it still works pretty well drama despite plethora stereotypes . joel mcrea , most unjustly forgotten star 30s , makes best worst them idealistic but starving would-be architect , dead end kids when they still kids hadn't changed their screen names half dozen times display early signs all irritating shtick would turn them into one most painful ensembles 40s , but sylvia sidney striking worker , claire trevor hooker ( no typecasting there ) bogart disillusioned gangster make most their opportunities . but marjorie main bogie mom ? that hard sell best days ! bogart dead end kids would cross street warners lot co-star angels dirty faces couple years later , but this one beats even cagney classic . sadly no extras , but dvd transfer quite superb . highly recommended .	1

would " caligula " or " nero " shocked what their city , eternal city , become so many years into distant future ? or would they ( probably more likely ) find themselves fitting right somehow ? this one notions i found myself pondering i watched this movie . it really great movie , it certainly worth any true film fan time . i may even liked ( some it least ) better than ( again , some ) la dolce vita . grown up italian family - my father born " pagliarone " ( roughly , slang dialect term meaning " stone hut " ) ancient very rural village molise - i myself definitely right home , so speak , watching scenes like famous " dinner piazza " . ( personally i could watch scene again again not get tired it , but ... maybe it " italian thing " , so speak , others would not find it so amusing ) . however there certainly no dearth general humour found antics wild cast characters which fellini always brings into his films . roma course no exception this . example bedridden obese old woman hairnet , who owns building he stays rome when he first arrives rome , who tells him , " now let just live peace not bust each other balls " ! or bald old man who rather convincing mussolini impersonation . my personal favorite though would probably ultra-tanned " continental " type guy who approaches female american tourist second she gets off bus , telling her , " you very bella " offering take her picture her . or young man piazza scene ( which supposed taken place some thirty years prior ) who wearing gold medallion one those black nylon " do-rags " ( kind rap stars wear today ) , yelling up his dark beautiful brooding girlfriend get down piazza before he throws her off balcony . sure these walking stereotypes , these characters , negative ones . but , they say , there kernel truth ( least ) all stereotypes there not ? instance entire " dinner piazza " scene , any italian or italian-american must admit , definitely resemble some sort " prototypical " pre-emigration summer-night-in-bensonhurst or some place like , plenty gold chains , " dago-t " , " pane vino " go around . more serious note however most touching scene ( this point usually generally agreed upon i think most movie fans ) scene sudden ( apparently accidental ) destruction ancient roman frescoes modern work-crew . obviously this fellini artistic condemnation , if you , massive industrialization city modern times , ( clearly potentially disastrous ) effects what we may call " godless modern " encountering ancient sacred . cruel loud machinery encountering long-buried , " resting-in-peace " , " sacred " . such imagery , like fellini vision vanishing ancient frescoes , so evocative it truly make viewer want weep . athough rome improved much since fellini filmed it back 1972 , this film , during both time periods he shows it us , city appears delusional . vaguely delirious fever perhaps . or throes long restless night full tossings-and-turnings wild " half-waking " dreams . it these dreams fact constitute " images " " vignettes " fellini shows us throughout film .	1
[ ... ] this film deeply moving my perspective because it so well produced . subtleties nuances what truly distinguished film . thus , instance , very low current homosexuality which undergirds two main characters always present , always acting , but doing so behind scenes , way keeps viewer unsure exactly where deeper feelings stand two men . nuance love-hate relationship our two protagonists share one . they example classic case " can't live him--can't live without him " . [ ... ] essence , what i found so truly impressive film its realness , realness disguised under character persona . joe ratso not truly cared any other male until they met one rely one . ending film quite tender , depicting how caring gentle loving joe nurturing ratso during his debilitating illness their bus trip florida . film indicates transformation , expansion , growth both characters , they come realize their lives much more than parochial narrow self interests . this film won several academy awards ( 1969 ) , my opinion , deserves its classic moniker . both hoffman voight turned excellent dynamic exceptionally convincing performances , i would say this film showed them their best acting potential . i added this one my small collection expect enjoy it years .	1
last reviewer said it all . this great concert , great deep purple era . but they ruined this disc . transfer horribly poor , looks like it bad videotape transferred pal ntsc , not professionally , so it jumpy quality . i very excited get this new disc i one brazilian boots it years . while this disc some interesting extras , dual layered dvd-9 , missing song , it all wasted horrible video transfer job they . it looks like vcd it so bad . band should embarrassed unauthorized overseas versions this show look much better than this . i'll probably never watch this disc again brazilian version i bought ebay years ago looks much better . there got much better master this show than this . let hope they pull this coaster remaster it right way . i just don't understand it . my advice go ebay get one those overseas boots this disc because they much better quality than this piece junk	-1

first time i saw casablanca , i didn't understand why everyone loved it . i tend look relationship aspect films , my eyes , romance rick ( humphrey bogart ) ilsa ( ingrid bergman ) lacking . set , no one knew whether ilsa supposed truly love rick or not which caused bergman play part ambiguously . however , i finally realized relationship strong because rick love ilsa . it didn't depend mutual affection all . this revelation , i able see film what it : masterpiece . rick own rick cafe , seedy bar casablanca during wwii . casablanca still free nazi control , though nazi leaders swarm streets . this makes it place filled refugees hoping escape america . these refugees leader against nazi , victor laszlo ( paul henreid ) . he brings his wife rick , beautiful ilsa . it throws rick into tailspin ; two lot history he brooding over her since she left him . there , he begins act rather uncharacteristically . no one deny cleverness script ; afi recognized many lines it 100 years 100 quotes ... list . also recognized afi list theme song " time goes .

`brian song ' , true story brian piccolo his fight against cancer , one most critically acclaimed `made tv ' movies ever released . this due mostly heroic story acting chops mr. james caan . film , chronicling relationship two football players chicago bears , one white one black , showcases these two men they bond over course time . brian ( caan ) helps his teammate gale sayers ( billy dee williams ) when he injured during game need physical therapy heal his knee . likewise , when brian diagnosed malignant cancer gale there his bedside giving him emotional support , helping him put up his fight against his latest opponent . brian fight lost , but his story lives . film based novel `i am third ' taken fact brian always second ( or even third ) choice team , always one best , but never `the ' best due players like sayers . acting this film bit lacking , although caan giving yet terrific performance , shelly fabares fine job julie , brian loving wife , but williams performance shy reserved sayers bit forced , his breakdown locker upon hearing brian condition completely unbelievable . caan acting legend , releasing this just before his brilliant turn `the godfather ' sure get him noticed . this film remade before , story not changed , but it caan brian i'll always remember .	1

400 blows francois truffaut first feature film , 47 years later , it remains ( my opinion ) his best most famous film . it not hard understand why . movie not perfect , it doesn't visualistic stylishness jules jim . but every line , every shot , every moment movie seems come straight truffaut heart . film semi-autobiographical -- like antoine , truffaut lonely juvenile delinquent . truffaut would make series films chronicling anti-hero antoine donel ( jean-pierre laud ) , but none those films matches overwhelming impact 400 blows . story simple enough -- antoine , dreamy , sad boy , neglected his self-centered parents , gets trouble school , engages some petty theft ( typewriter , specific ) . his parents think him burdensome trouble , so he sent away juvenile deliquent school . not much storyline , it ? well , that genius 400 blows . i've yet see film recreates teenager life such keen eye sensitivity . truffaut uses deceptively simple devices " follow " antoine his sad journey . one such example antoine interview psychologist deliquent school . it filmed one long take , camera focuses squarely antoine . psychiatrist/counselor never seen , so antoine speaks straight camera , i felt like he speaking straight me . antoine answers questions mix insight , sensitivity , naivete , incoherence . antoine talks everything his sexual impulses his relationship his parents . one point , he says , " oh , i lie now then , i suppose . sometimes i'd tell them truth they still wouldn't believe me , so i prefer lie . " example day outing students antoine school . truffaut uses overhead shot follow students they skip prance their way around streets paris . beginning , children all one line . but slowly , kids begin diverge different directions . it could hokey , but scene unforgettably charming . , course , final " frozen shot " become one most famous film history . again , simple device , produces huge emotional impac t.t ruffaut responsible much film success , but huge part film performance jean-pierre laud . his dark , sad eyes , he reminded me little sal mineo rebel without cause . many children tend " overact " attempt appear serious , but laud performance so understated pitch perfect end movie i thought antoine friend , someone i wanted protect . antoine mother ( claude maurier ) also perfect . she not horrible , abusive mother , but her self-absorbed insensitivity becomes painful watch . i love way she rushes around crowded paris apartment , if she didn't patience sit down even second . when she coldly disowns antoine during visit juvenile deliquent school , it absolutely chilling . criterion collection dvd commentary track robert lechaney , who portrayed antoine friend rene film . there also interviews truffaut laud . highly recommended .	1

movie head takes look trappings closeted gay son ari ( alex dimitriades ) traditional greek orthodox upbringing . director ana kokkinos tries flush surface isolation alienation one man feels his family alternate lifestyle they would never apporve . within this script , ari enters into realms drugs unprotected sex then comes realization this how his life must end up . alex dimitriades his credit helps this movie tremendously , his dark good looks , brooding nature , tortured portrayal man torn secret life . however , this actor cannot carry movie alone other characters movie not come through vividly . director wants make point how various ethnic beliefs impacts hardships some who want come out but afriad too , yet avoiding confration must take place parent offspring viewer injustice because full message not delievered . director should concentrate more family life interactions giving greater sense anguish , instead ridiculous clubs parties . movie continues its downward spiral , it comes abrupt end no real realistic resolution comes head , thus viewer left seeing gay movie where it easier let audience draw conclusions than movie itself diving deeper than surface drugs , sex denial	-1

we purchased this visual gospel well over 10 years ago when there wasn't dvd available price $80-$100 . we've given copies this video many people gifts simply because we think it best depiction real , human jesus he would . bruce marchiano portrays character beautifully range emotions he shows he pulls viewer amazing . whenever i watch his portrayal jesus garden gethsemane rest events after , it drives home point this jesus who laughed totally human also felt all pain despair he endured . he it willingly ? i think there times doubt despair but character shows believable glimpses doubt supported incredible faith . i'm shocked some bad reviews listed . fact , i wish i could give this video 10 stars . without doubt this most inspiring video i ever seen my life . i hope pray it never goes out print i wish more people would open up their minds jesus who real , who smiles , who gets hungry dirty , person who feelings just like us . after all he fully god fully man . jesus this video not smokin ' anything one poor reviewer indicated . quite contrary . it sad know people close minded judgmental cannot open their minds viewing such believable human portrayal miracle man who walked earth . i'm completely amazed feel unbelievably blessed we watch video this interesting , mesmerizing , engrossing " word word " bible . i think directors producers this video inspired vision create artistic piece masterful showing time period , how word written passed down generation generation , gives viewer much more accurate realistic time-frame how jesus taught disciples everything he . this best money you'll ever spend .	1

i must begin saying i am not fan shirley maclaine early work . her speaking voice shrill , i think raves mainly her body . so it worth noting i love " what way go . " when actress big name longevity , there one movie you point say , " watch this movie , you know why she star . " i feel this movie movie miss maclaine . she sings , she dances - move move gene kelly - she carries this movie entirely her frequently bare back . she throws herself 100% into every ridiculous costume change situation , always self possessed , but not self concious . here , her body certainly made use , take-off french art films equally silly , sexy , laughable ... but her over top performance humor lifts it all above air-headed plot . film itself gets kudos me because , like miss maclaine , it knows exactly what it , comfortable , laugh itself . when she says , " it like one those big budget movies , all love what she wear next " we know there no pretentions here . what this movie . it quinessential movie celebrating girl . it also happens pinpoint rare moment movie history tough women , when boys took over . it deserves it very special pink dvd box . it unique . silly , slapstick , sometimes trying way too hard , but great kick off your shoes , pile up popcorn treat	1

' war peace ' book i my teen years loved read , sensing it gave picture life something ' large ' ' deep ' beyond anything i known my own experience . movie so oddly constructed , course so poor language feeling if not spoken same breath book , nonetheless its virtues . its picture opening ball , its world bright color costume enabled me ' image ' my own mind its world i not able reading book . one things which most struck me watching film my sense comparison images screen , images my mind characters i somehow ' thought them ' reading book . henry fonda certainly not ' pierre ' . he too thin not overall bearish strength , tolstoyan power book makes pierre . other hand , audrey hephburn natasha film replaced any picture i might my mind , became ' natasha ' . so this least film gave me . film too long , confuses times . but it i said , picturesque , colorful quality which makes it more enjoyable spectacle than anything else	1

i should bought this dvd before i . i never allow 3.5 star rating distract me again , particularly when some attacks against this dvd infused immature invective against finn personality . pacing , perhaps most important aspect any yoga set , nearly perfect , allowing one truly work body pose while meditating . it almost seems like i am swimming through this session . even though he places set backbends after his salutations before his triangle sequence , somehow everything works . also , this gem some most important poses yoga , whether one classic hatha or power yoga . two single leg standing poses ( warrior iii king dancer ) probably two most important balancing poses yoga . i enjoy how he ends his triangle warrior sequence each one repectively . eion seated pose sequence borrowed straight astanga minor modifications also quite impressive . furthermore , his dvd something every other power yoga set lacks -- complex inverted finishing pose sequence . when complete yoga set performed , it leads rejuvenation no other workout match . i only long version because i am doing this sequence strength yogic complexity completeness . anyone who takes yoga seriously truly wants increase body/mind connection needs this beautifully complete yogic experience	1

it ironic ( or perhaps not ) woody allen mia farrow midst terrible breakup when this film came out . i only saw it recently , it one those films technically would never fly , unless allen behind it . i enjoyed partial-documentary sequences where characters discuss their marriages , breakups , etc ., dark comedy surrounds it all . sydney pollack judy davis old married couple you think would stay together forever , but they're breaking up . woody finds himself strangely drawn one his writing students ( juliette lewis makes film ! ) , who seems get every man she meets string without even trying , mia hooks up liam neeson ... there certain shallowness protrayed when it comes people , really hit me . perhaps i going through my own marriage breakup time i saw this awhile back , it struck chords me i didn't think it would . any case , this not madcap woody film . it sometimes harsh examination how people deal each other , don't always realize what they've got . you need right mood this one , but it worth time	1

( most " collections " , you doubtless know , usually grade flicks thrown together genre or stars ' names ) . but this really classic collection . sure , claude rains 1943 version " phantom opera " relative crap , most horror fans agree : too much opera , too little phantom ( can't compare lon chaney 1925 silent version , or even maligned 1962 version herbert lom nobody even remembers ! ) but ' 43 version , included this collection , only inadequate entry . dont put-off price : this steal given contents , even if they're out-of-stock you go one off-vendors	1

this difficult movie me review , because my attachment original book . adam wacky , fun-filled sci-fi romp novel so rich ideas movie can't really more than touch few more important themes . movie tries hard here but i say some best ideas left out , no doubt due time money contraints . but some adams best ideas characters made it into film , few notable omissions , which i mention below . even conceding those few omissions , movie visually appealling breathtaking special effects . however , i few problems flick , although i enjoyed it thought it good flick overall . main problem i movie i think casting could better . still , it good although not stellar . example , sometimes actors seemed less than absorbed involved movie , except brief scenes here there , i thought most convincing players stolid unprepossessing vogons who beaurocratic bad guys film , although john malkovich character good . but then one expects mr. malkovich perform his role his usual ability panache , even if film itself less than stellar . also alan rickman good voice depressed robot . also , i said , some best ideas left out , such restaurant end universe party there , bumbling but sensitive cops . i'm sure many adams fans wonder why those very funny entertaining scenes omitted , but no doubt practical considerations made their omission necessary . i still enjoyed movie despite these flaws , dazzling special effects probably worth paying freight see movie just themselves . but i suspect die-hard adams fans miss original inspiration adams goofy , fun-filled sense wonder made actual books such phenomenon . still , all all fun movie worth seeing despite few shortcomings	1

while i occasionally grew frustrated this film , i soon realized what director roeg trying . this should left up individual viewer figure out . what should particularly noted here not only gorgeous location photography , gorgeous indoor photography roeg use color , but also wonderful performance theresa russell milena wanton heroine . she simply beautiful . story two polar opposites ( art garfunkel russell ) meeting colliding psycho-sexual relationship told fragmented , flashback fashion get confusing . but if you stick it , it powerful charge . it no way pleasant or amusing . culmination their unhappy relationship disturbing even appalling . there other films similar themes ( " betty blue " " turkish delight " come mind ) but they were'nt quite this dark . recommended adults only	1

shutter would probably rate one better asian ghost flicks come out over last couple years . i stated review movie red shoes this style movie getting too clich�d . after taking break few months i recently started watching asian ghost movies again . only major downfall shutter several movies came out after it released states first so takes away some impact . i seen shutter during its initial release i'm sure i would liked it more . now that not say i didn't enjoy shutter because i very much . but like i said several movies came out after shutter just happened released here first . despite clich�s shutter , proves asian filmmakers still capable making movie like this make it enjoyable . unlike some other ghost movies it takes while before haunting begins . normally few things start happen it foreshadowing things come . but shutter it starts happen rather early stays through movie , which what helped keep movie moving . let honest here though long haired asian girl doesn't exactly strike fear it once viewer . we seen it so many times now it lost its impact bit . but directors banjong pisanthanakun parkpoom wongpoom still able make best scenes they able make several scenes lot creepier than they really should . while i can't say i scared , but there several very suspenseful tense moments , which majority lacking recent movies like this . all asian ghost flicks i seen recent none badly made they just suffered too many clich�s , but this movie able make best them . mystery angle rather solid , but same time i felt more time needed would made movie even stronger . while script wasn't bad , shutter sometimes bit slow when there no ghostly haunting . characters ok ; while they weren't boring they weren't strong enough carry movie when there no ghost . but said there very interesting twist character tun . he not innocent most characters these movies excellent change pace . like i said there flaws ; again we seen this style movie played out , while characters good they just weren't interesting enough carry movie too long . besides clich�d only problem i shutter some scenes just fall bit flat . me it just seemed characters often repeating themselves scenes just different words . that not say shutter wasn't well-written ; it solid script most part . but there also several things shutter excellent . scene when ghost side car creepy scene provided great jolt when ghost chases tun around late movie one creepiest scenes i seen asian ghost flick quite sometime . those new this style movie i would say shutter should one first films you see so it doesn't lose impact scenes . those who well schooled these movies , shutter won't offer you anything you haven't seen before . but said it far one better asian ghost movies despite clich� it probably keep you entertained . i stated earlier review several movies made after shutter just happened released here states first , which shame because it hurt movie little bit . closing despite clich�s some flaws , shutter excellent movie shows there still some life left this sub-genre .	1
i bought this dvd because i ~ apparently unlike many other buyers ~ thought first season best ; especially first half first season . back when it addressed what it like move across country , or just out your own , after college professional , social , financial issues we faced doing so . after season one , melrose place went touching meaningful yet nighttime soap ( albeit fun one ) . if you want suds catfights , stick later seasons . if you want wonderful friendships some drama ~ reminder those wonderful terrifying times ~ definitely buy this dvd set	1

it great see something totally different come out asia . while their ghost stories aren't only ones produced they most popular over there states . it sort like american slasher movies if you look around 80s dominated them , but isn't all made american horror . after my last viewing ghost movie , which south korean movie red shoes i decided take break . while not bad it just suffered same basic formula past movies . bloody reunion there no asian ghost girl found , which nice change . i wanted see this movie quite some time , but what i got wasn't what i really wanted . i'll skip plot rehash since there already description here amazon . lot people compared this friday 13th due whole deformed kid . besides bloody reunion very little common friday 13th flicks . first half bloody reunion quite slow we meet characters , but around midway mark things start come out we learn past grudges . while , bloody reunion interesting set up my problem there no sense dread doom lingering . i never got feeling something bad gonna happen . john carpenter halloween it michael myers always lurking back round . dario argento it deep red despite killer only appearing when they killed . director lim dae-woong doesn't bad job , but he just doesn't create any mood first half . he try , but it just wasn't working . 2nd half when things pick up killer starts knocking off all characters one one . but problem killer shows up attacks . it not always kill scenes its more how it built up lot times . best parts movies like halloween , deep red original black christmas set ups not actual kill scenes . bloody reunion some graphic murders , which fine , but again there wasn't much set up . characters ok maybe if i cared more them approach would worked better . none characters really stood out honestly they all alike . i'll give credit makers going character development . we learn little them , maybe more so then your average run mill slasher flick , but when all said none stand out enough . asian horror isn't really known their gore these days , but i noticed they getting little bit more violent . bloody reunion some violent murder scenes while they cool looking i just wasn't all interested . one thing bothers me horror movies these days twist endings . it seems like every horror flick take some kind twist end . some work some don't some just seem they sake it . first twist bloody reunion might little confusing , but it all pretty much explained . but my problem twist without giving anything away it sort renders everything came before it rather pointless . i've seen other movies twist like this , but i don't know they seemed work where here it just didn't . i really wanted like movie while i didn't hate it i just walked away thinking how it really could so much more than it . it nice change pace though asian horror . ghost story really seems run its course . i like slasher movies , but not much i when i child . those into slashers asian horror you might like bloody reunion . again i didn't hate it , but i feel it could better . my opinion it more 2 half star movie , but since isn't option i decided go 2-star rating . bloody reunion doesn't come highly recommended , but it not bad boring night nothing .	-1

if you're looking over-the-top action sort sit down enjoy movie without overanalyzing it , this one you . some movies you pick all plot holes inconsistencies , but if you want action movie that loaded full action plus some obligatory dry humor , you can't go wrong last boy scout . fans bruce willis shouldn't miss this movie either . willis plays alcoholic detective who recieves call colleague his surveillance exotic dancer named cory ( played halle berry ) . but when cory gets killed professional hit right front her boyfriend ( played wayans ) detective , 2 team up figure out why she killed course , true action film style , there much more than meets eye . it fast-paced exciting provides plenty laughs . amazon reviewer said something effect this movie shows great contempt women i just didn't get this flick . maybe i just too mesmerized bruce willis , but whatever case , last boy scout entertain you down very last second .	1
i loved this movie , if only tommy lee jones tom wood ( don't know who ? don't worry , i'm only one ) because it sequal my most favourite movies . but if you're not considering this movie because your fantatical devotion single actor or series , then take your time deciding . director firs t-t imer , plot almost completely identical fugitive ( except ... tommy lee jones wesley snipes aren't cool together tommy harrison ) there fair number awkwardly ' funny bits ' . i would rate it average cop drama , fairly underwhelming sequel . however , i loved it , but i suspect my motives little different than most peoples ' .	-1

" those who tardy not get fruit cup !

i'd say i disappointed when i first saw first episodes unlimited . it named final fantasy , but very little linked it incredible video game series same name . story seemed immature generic not interwoven many character driven side stories ; only final fantasy mascots appeared ( chocobo , one ); music didn't reflect classical style went games . so , needless say , i didn't bother buying anymore dvds series . then box set came out , i admitted myself i least curious how this series would end , plus i learned gonzo made unlimited , gonzo yet fail me any my anime endeavors . i bought it , i watched first episodes again . i cringed , because suddenly i felt same way even found few more things i disliked it . but i didn't stop , continued watch , found , slowly , this series evolved . it became emotionally driven , lot elements made final fantasy great . there mascots galore ( stated chocobo , cactuar , moogles , summons , cid ) . some music heard heard previous games ( opening song -- not title song -- battle victory ) . still , it wasn't final fantasy its namesake , but i found watching anime entire way through okay . though it isn't good chapter final fantasy , it great stand-alone anime nonetheless . it great animation , strange style seems both classical cutting edge ( astroboy cg ) . story deepens two main characters search their parents , other story lines reveal themselves well , such kaze story , main character charge powerful gun capable summoning creatures into battle , lisa , martial artist power control elements . antagonists also turn into something more than they beginning . deeper , more sinister foe appears later , one adds sense dread story wasn't there previously . all all , it adds up one decent anime . value itself can't beaten . twenty-five episodes anime less than fifty-bucks . it difficult , however , recommend this anime . i'd only recommend this final fantasy fans who don't take game too serious . if you , you'll disappointed this anime . i'd also recommend it anyone who enjoys experimentation their animation . if you enjoyed kid story animatrix , you'll enjoy this	1

this set starts when richard bucket retires his work . just think , all day home his wife , hyacinth . if you've watched series , you imagine horror . this set , we see more haycinth sisters , father neighbors . they get more screen time this set than first four dvds . we also finally see hayacinth sister , violet , her husband , bruce . still no sign their son , sheraton , though . patricia routledge excellent job playing part stuck-up , snobby , british housewife high social ambitions . she plays character so well , she really makes you hate character hyacinth bucket make you feel great compassion everybody encounter her . psychological torture inflicted hyacinth her neighbors acquaintances becomes more developed more apparent set . one cannot help but feel great sympathy everyone she talks ( good laugh same time ) . extras so-so . they include some outtakes , interview patricia routledge clive swift british tv show , cast biographies , " memoirs hyancinth bucket " ( one hour flashback episode ) , some other stuff . if you plan buy series , i recommend you " keeping up appearances - full bouquet set " ( 8 dvds ) amazon.com, it much cheaper than buying this set first set individually . side note , there one episode where i think writers took hyacinth out character . she party which she invited some new neighbors , but she also invited her " socially unacceptable " family ( daisey , onslow , rose ) this party . normally , she would never this side her family mingle her parties .	1

reason your getting this obviously youve seen this show sci-fi found it entertaining ... now only difference i found this broadcast version sound par fuzzy ... sometimes you need turn tremble/bass down bit make sound little easier understand when fellas talking loudly ... but most part its not too terrible ... visually its pretty good but little pixelated during night/dark room scenes , but you take into consideration these sets giving you 4 dvds $20 dollars ... if you wanted remastered video/audio edition , youd probably paying price other seasons tv shows mid $50 dollar range ... so i just try not complantive things enjoy show its substance ... its worth price very entertaining ... so i highly suggest picking up copy so when season 3 finished we fans get next season dvd ... hope i helped you decide this ... ro	1

i ordered this 2 dvd set , including both original " fly " " return fly " starring vincent price , " grand seigneur " ( master ) fantasy sci-fi genre . i am glad i . i could ordered remake its counterpart " fly ii " , but i preferred start beginning i righ t.t he classics may less sophisticated sfxs ( special effects ) , but acting far superior . ambience two , typically fifties , adds charm whole . music tense , but not overbearing eighties movies screaming girl there , where one wants her , right time too ... who forget finale original " fly " , almost work slapstick comedy , but so dramatically funny . second follow-up , " return fly " not so brilliant , lacking glamour color ( although cinemascope ) , its story comes goes , but still valid sequel those very campy " drive-in " movies . whilst first , vincent price just shoulder al hedison , second he truly becomes star action . everyone who loves particular feeling fifties widescreen movies , won't disappointed . both not considered horror movies , or just science fiction ones , although elements both genres present , no , more likely , i would call them twist " film noir " genre . fact , especially first one , entire plot told while police investigation conducted , clarify vicious murder case . second , we more crime movie , which mobster blackmailing hero , obvious tragic consequences . while watching these two installments , one keep mind fifties , science fiction horror movies considered minor secondary genre . taste time western spectaculars crime movies , such said , so-called " film noir " . combining both fantasy/sci-fi genre truly daring move , well touch pure genius . doing so , allowed producers take some liberties its contents , emphasizing some elements exagerating others , build necessary tension style reaching well constructed climax end . both movies more than worth money spent , even newcomers fifties movies . while ' 80s version its own appeal , more modern adding some truly scary effects story , it not make it more interesting or more appealing viewers . i like jeff goldblum actor , but i cannot see him stealing seat vincent price . granted , he not play his role . while fifties you happy canadian family , its head , hard-working scientist , we ' 80s , receive eccentric scientist who slowly goes mad moreover solitary guy lose tie female journalis t.t his " fly " part one . part two , we also differences . said , " return fly " ( 1959 ) more crime movie legendary rescue hero its final revenge scene . " fly ii " , 1988 , fumbled attempt create sequel . jeff goldblum geena davis gone altogether . they don't even get chance cameo roles . we totally unknown actors something meant new story altogether . " return fly " we vincent price reprising his original role stealing show . nevertheless , now both versions out , when doubt , buy them both . also 1980s " fly " series available compact collection also affordable price . my suggestion you , viewers , buy them both then compare them yourselves . but warned . if you faint heart , ' 80s collection rather gory could cause you some visual shocks , while ' 50s versions more stylized lot left your imaginations work out . it up you	1

since i'm not customer here i'm using this kid forum . i'm not kid way . anyways , i don't get why this movie so highly regarded . it just most annoying movie i've ever seen . basically it same story retrieving lost bag money repeated three times . it not like we needed see shots lola running all time . there too many crazy cuts events don't seem make much sense . also , what all those cuts when lola runs past or bumps into any bystander streets ? how she any insight into pasts these people seriously why we need know them ? they're not essential story . one more thing why lola scream like such maniac why it shatter glass ? these all just failed attempts make good arthouse film . it poorly acted directed film unworthy praise it gets .	-1

how delightful learn this movie issued again dvd . i little more than echo praise other reviewers . it worth its weight gold . i first saw it soon after it came out , when i young teenager . i so impressed , many months afterwards , i wanted nothing more than become coronet player . i eventually settled piano lessons , somewhat later , guitar . there no question my mind " five pennies " seminal influence my decision learn music . result , playing music one those activities i still enjoy i meander through my sixties . this movie resides my deepest memories such classics " westside story " " breakfast tiffany . " its best virtue , my opinion , musical content . i still listen danny kaye rendition " five pennies , " there nothing compare kaye satchmo ( louis armstrong ) duet version " when saints come marching . " it goes without saying technology movie production come long way since 1959 . but technology alone not ensure excellence . it difficult imagine cinematography this movie could significantly improved modern techniques . i readily admit nostalgia colored my attitude toward this movie . but , what wrong ? i treasure those few things 40-50 years ago still vibrant my deepest memories . " five pennies " definitely one them . you won't disappointed this movie ; it one select few timeless . enjoy	1
this first box set released season one pokemon . this collector set indeed only 4kids american dub no second japanese version . it contains three discs ; each nice hard case slide into one cardboard sleeve . artwork box each individual case nicely . set contains first 26 episodes season one . note though , this not entire first season american version contains 78 episodes ( 80 japan ) . this means , according my calculations , two more box sets would need released ( each containing 26 more episodes ) complete season . also , aware episode , " beauty beach , " not its rightful slot not part this set . even though it first banned during season one , it later played " lost episode pokemon " during orange islands season ( though heavily edited ) . it not clear why episode not reinserted back into this season , would make logical sense . menus decent but nothing spectacular . when it comes scenes selection , each episode divided into only two parts . first , before commercial break , second , coming after break . video quality looks pretty good . after comparing color episode one this set version originally released dvd just three episodes , i found colors slightly brighter or vivid this version than other . overall , this best edition season one there date . it worth purchase if you not mind american version . hopefully , they release rest season one very shortly . i rate this product 4 out 5 stars because it not contain episode " beauty beach .	1

may i am little unfair my sweeping statement these episodes . it just so clear me mr culp mr cosby so tune each other peak their game any woodeness which natural bit part players exaserbated . said i loved episode american empress because enigmatic france nuyen fantastic it she brilliant engaging every episode she starred . someone who yet see san francisco these episodes like tourist brochure where go what see . tag your it particular favourite mine because scotty kelly hippy disguise interaction each other shop owner . whole these definitely not best i spy episodes , but because show exceptional every sense word this statement mine not inditement these four episodes which still very entertaining .	1

even it original 3 hour running time , film still felt bit too hefty . like lot cases extended editions ( opposed director cut ) , extended version simply alternate take ; kind optional version film should you feel compelled see it . i always liked dances wolves , directorial debut kevin costner multiple academy award winner , but i always felt like sum its parts won me over but maybe not unified whole . lt . john dunbar united states officer during civil war after unsuccessful suicide attempt him running bare into enemy fire but miraculously surviving , he option posted anywhere . he picks fort sedgewick , distant remote outpost where he'll live himself . hanging around camp wolf he names two-socks nearby sioux village over time , he becomes friends even becomes part their community . relationship one women develops but he still deal approaching officers who want conquer more land , effectively driving out sioux . extra scenes meant develop story offer more background taken their own , they actually work pretty fine . instead finding dunbar new post deserted , we actually see officers previously stationed just left . we get more screentime some minor characters which help flesh them out but takes away dunbar himself losing focus him . all scenes gives off feeling making movie more longer than it should ( costner says himself commentary when he says " it not secret i like long movies " ) but luckily there disc change so you don't watch all 4 hours one setting . far film concerned , it quite great film some gorgeous cinematography , excellent performances some pretty exciting action scenes . costner might not most immense range but there quite few films where he convincing this one them . i 2 complaints whole : narration read like kid who asked read book passages class kind uninvolving drone . when officers show up they almost this kind malevolent quality where they're portrayed hick morons guns . other than though i don't any issues film while it probably something i won't turn constantly , whenever i watch it i still like it . one concern i wish addressed where special features . it reminds me lord rings extended cuts where all main in-depth featurettes longer , expensive cut so while i no issues stuff we get here , 2 commentaries feature-length documentary broken halves , it would've worked bit if option all it theatrical edition would help people who want bonus parts but not it attached longer version film . it probably isn't going everyone cup tea there even times where i'm not big fan but there other times where i get quite involved it so give it shot see what you think . word caution : theatrical edition normally available full screen so it either 4 hour widescreen or 3 hour full . i can't stand full so buying this one inevitable	1

first off , i want preface this saying this movie not everyone . there those who like things spelled out them movie those who like challenge , this movie challenge watch , but well worth it . there not lot dialogue this movie i read somewhere director because he wanted capture scenes before after characters would spoken . heat moment , so speak . so what we see characters their most raw vulnerable , entirely naked some cases . without dialogue rely , actors forced use their facial expressions express their emotions which they superbly . i say i found everything this movie refreshing . i like cinematography use vibrant colors certains scenes well muted tones others . everyone movie just plain beautiful look first i felt movie seemed bit long , but then when it kept going there came point where i didn't want it end because i become so invested main characters who not seem superficial all . they very believable we all similar situations our youth . it seems there always something better other side , but there really ? i think fact storyline not totally linear might bother some , but i found it made story more interesting it seemed provide alternative versions or character perceptions what going . i so excited this movie i order director first film " thousand clouds peace " which filmed similar way ( little dialogue , much longing stares , etc ... ) but i found it not quite good . perhaps my expectations set so high this film . still , i think this director watch . next tsai ming liang , i think he my second favorite director now	1

if you interested knowing what challenges monarches other powerful people face , this movie great beginning . you may or may not interested russian history or even world history , but this particular story greatly encapsulates emotional , physical political issues faced two powerfully-born adults their children . other reviews this site terrific their critical perceptions this movie its strengths weaknesses , so i not go into too much detail " sell " anybody action or dialogue , or historical accuracy . suffice say this movie -- its unedited version ( crucial dvd ) fact tell it like it ( or ) . nicholas alexandra two human beings who happened born into western dynastic system still prevalent turn 20th century . they responsible , almost biblical sense , destiny humanity , only they opted out , then executed . this would considered " romantic " if humanity not such overwhelming need leadership designated heroes . dvd version critical see full relationship alexandria rasputin surrendering power , also see rasputin his full decadent expression ( which must positively repulsive russian history revisionists . ) it also necessary , emotional historic context , see " failure " nicholas -- he could no longer carry responsibility godhead . it also relevant see execution rasputin hands two hop-head fairies who also line inherit this godhead , they themselves dreams american incorporation . alexia ( nicholas alexandra only son , who also happened hemophiliac ) hates his persecutors very personal , adult hatred -- those who persecuted romanov dynasty people who hated themselves took hatred out leaders they loved despised . they loved their leaders , despised their need leaders . if you purchase this movie , whatever your reason or interest , please buy dvd so it unedited ( meaning uncensored ) so thatyou may judge yourself	1

due circumstances beyond my control , i watch this . , surprisingly , i enjoyed it am dive into written word . this milestone someone who embraced literature much his life , but avoided anything pre-1800s , especially shakespeare . anyway , aside , some impressions film : 1 . liked black white , set design , costumes , overall artistic design . 2 . thought there some really great artistic scenes , especially ophelia floating water . 3 . olivier hamlet : okay , but he seemed lack particular vitality perhaps better-suited younger less-mannered actor .	1

this third cheech chong film , coming after up smoke ( 1978 ) cheech chong next movie ( 1980 ) . films series traditional way -- characters continue , there something linear development per films ' chronologies characters , but plot this film isolation , threads holding it all together pretty thin . nice dreams , cheech chong selling dope barely disguised ice cream truck . they may struck it rich this point , or maybe cheech just doesn't know how read numbers very well . any rate , they not seem hurting money -- they bag it , after all , which they pursue later film -- somehow , they're living very expensive , big house beach outside los angeles , although it seems maybe they're just crashing friend friend place while he away ( he musician tour ) . lot it pretty unclear , because last thing cheech chong writers director ( only chong latter case ) concerned telling anything like traditional story . instead , it seems like maybe they high while they wrote filmed this . that usually meant negative -- idea denote how little sense work makes , or how little coherence it . i don't mean it way here . i don't mean it knock , necessarily . i mean it literally , consequently underscore kind stream-of-consciousness , absurdist surreal flow . those all very positive qualities , they occasionally here . but maybe cheech chong just looking easiest way string together number sketch ideas , not enough sketch ideas , because some them drawn out or reprised past their freshness date . probably goes whole premise cheech man ( chong ) selling dope getting into wacky situations while pursued sgt . stedanko ( stacy keach ) . nice dreams feels too much like cheech chong just coasting -- vamping while waiting next soloist start . although i love experimentation much anyone else , this film would benefited stronger focus telling story traditional way . i don't always think something different better just because it different . so this definitely step down first two films , although there more than enough funny moments keep fan first two films mildly entertained , most supporting actors , including returning ones , enjoyable even more potential . some skits ( word fits here better than " scenes " ) , like crazy house fiasco donna apartment , even " save whales " song , good most material first two films . but overall , it just seems like their hearts , maybe their heads , weren't much into making film time around	-1

this not your average crime story . clint eastwood plays man we first encounter preacher rural church . shortly into sermon , gunman comes starts shooting preacher . he takes off running eventually gets picked up young man played jeff bridges . two hit it off become buddies , even though eastwood character significantly older than bridges ' . over time , it learned eastwood bank robber . after big heist , money disappeared people who trying kill him think he stole it ( other crooks ) . eventually , they hit upon scheme rob same bank same manner before . idea nobody would expect them try things same way again . there trouble other robbers . one stupid other just plain mean . after successful heist , this leads problems which film must resolve . although action line movie story bank robbery , it really friendship two main characters . it touching watch sad unexpected end . it rather dated film but it still worth watching .	1

worth seeing , no doubt . however , makes you wonder what true genius like akira kurosawa would such original premise . this director here misses masterpiece film his hands something like hair . three main characters better developed audiance would more reason togive damn what happens them . alas , it didn't happen , although script pretty damn decent works most part . i said following so often past : give audiance something/someone care -- because if they don't kow much people your film they not moved what happens them . just way it . said all , i still maintain it worth seeing . branko djuric very good here . check it out . i wish i could given it five stars	1

this one my favorite movies . it immaculate : it not single wasted second -- it tight spellbinding . filmmakers juxtaposed tale horrific spree killing young very likeable sociopath/psychopath/psychokiller , played brilliantly martin sheen . when we first meet him , he young , southern good ol ' boy ton grace equal measure charm , tough , seemingly extremely self-assured , macho , self-reliant . he just this odd little quirk blowing people away if they irritate him too much or if they get his way , then stepping over their bodies , proceeding next moment . he obviously ill educated , ignorant , yet some point we see he made decision carry himself great pride , self-assurance , masculinity , whatever his circumstances . my favorite exposition his personality when he finally arrested ; he chats policeman though they just bunch good ol ' boys sitting around bar he buying drinks ; just cool cucumber , friendly , totally disingenuous . kind " what you see what you get , " now let get it . not hair out place , not tremor or tic indicate rage , malice , or , dare i say it , evil . juxtaposed him sissy spacek character , who sweet , young , totally sheltered , dumb , naive , but who also seems no trouble stepping over bodies putting her energy into staying alive doing what she get through moment . juxtaposed wonderful music -- something like calliope music , sweet dreamy . juxtaposed wonderful cinematography -- shots midwestern prairie , often flat , sometimes golden , never bleak . it totally mesmerizing satisfying . i hope i'm not only one who could not horrified all terrible bloodshed murder--i'm passing buck this marvelous film , which gave us story mass murder balletic fanciful context	1

okay , maybe last one isn't really european , but you get point . i watched this over weekend , rental everyone favorite blockbuster video ! i loved this movie ! it took us where roadtrip wishes it could taken us ! i really liked " scenery " way . i didn't rent this movie longest time , cover showed some goofball white dude pointing his fingers funny way this goofy smile ( he almost looked mentally handicapped ) it just looked so " dumb . " honestly . but cover unrated version , shows young female actress removing her bikini top , it looks damn hot ! also , unrated version ton more sexy scenes , including lots nudity . i also believe this first dvd i've rented gave index nude scenes , well index additional " unrated " scenes . now that' hot ! movie very funny , put together well . i felt like they actually europe , when you watch some special features , you learn they actually . i felt like hit every country they said they , but something tells me it only 1 or 2 , they used stage sets . but , scenes all realistic looking . i especially noticed this vatican . damn funny ! some other reviewers comparing this other american clowning movies , but i didn't see it way . i saw it us making fun their stereotypes . i mean how could you sex comedy europe , not berlin or netherlands comedy scene . scene where italian businessman keeps molesting tourists ? i roommate said italian man kept chasing her molesting her city bus , so yes , stereotypes based some aspects reality . get over your pc correctness ? okay ? it funny , because its partially true ! i stop short giving this five stars , but i give it this rating :d vd movie alone : 4 starsdvd movie special features : 5 starsmc white said : check it out !!	1

not your typical thriller ( where car chases .. ) . lord war constructed like documentary plot . cage excellent , so screenplay . movie not-so-subtly speaks against war , arm dealings , developed countries making quick buck misery genocide civil wars while same time hypocriticaly imposing embargos , sanctions , etc . prepared strong language , lot violence sexuality - all which give really gritty surface otherwise sleek story . many quotable one-liners fast pace make it solid entertainment , if you call it this thought-provoking drama .	1

" expressions faces both professionals amateurs cast tell story not only drudgery under oppressive political regime , but hopes despairs people suffer kind fraught romantic episodes story woven around . andula story not quite compelling enough justify price tag this dvd - there whole episode involving missing ring enraged suitor pops up disappears without much relevance . modern cinema-goers expect more meat story , i think . however , budding filmmakers learn lot pacing , reaction actors , not moving camera , difference directing professional non-professional actors ( extras interview ) .	1

i've always big fan arnold , this movie really lets him shine . one highlight ( many film ) confusing/embarrassing scene where arnold misunderstands invited over professor his daughter " tea " ( beatnik-era term marijuana ) . then there sordid scene where booze-addled arnold confesses what he saw hotel room he shares hercules . this scene alone whisks movie out kiddie genre it seems lumped into takes it level completely . yes , pretzy , arnold stang delivers spades . then there arnold schwarzenegger . his english wasn't very good time this made , but this ain't shakespeare he reciting , either . even this early point his career , it obvious man makings actor or politician . fact this movie made 1970 , long after peplum craze over gives it added appeal me . also , character hercules this movie big , strong lummox instead noble hero truer greek mythology than most movies portray him makes it my favorite genre . scene where he mini-tantrum after losing weight lifting competition , stamping his feet giving good herman munster " darn , darn , darn ! " impersonation fine example . although you listen arnold original audio , i prefer dubbed dad-voiced audio option myself . other favorite scenes : hercules falling outside airplane window waving old lady passenger plane , scene times square where hercules takes off his shirt makes his pecs move up down professor daughter .	1

frequent visitor himalayas closely touch both tibetans ( ordinary folks , not tortured ones ) chinese , i find this documentary interesting but terribly one-sided . i not met single wealthy tibetan nepal or india , who swear me he return freed tibet , run their government exile . fair " experts " , lot evidence chinese violence against tibetans real . i sincerely feel sorry them wish they could somehow compensated . however , documentary gets emotive it seems bent presenting situation tibet entirely viewpoint activists other victims chinese aggression . while it true many tibetans suffered died during invasion subsequent crushing riots erupted time time , it unfair assume soldiers police only ones responsible deaths injuries . there no looters , vandals , infighting ? if you ever witnessed these riots , would you think more people might hurt or killed soldiers not opened fire ? it also incredibly naive assume all tibetans think same . even dharamsala , seat tibetan government exile not without opposition , violence even assasination . while i think most tibetans good buddhists nice people , documentary seems associate everything sinful chinese everything saintly tibetans . this something i find totally unacceptable . few snapshots tibetan mobs welcoming delegates exile tell us nothing . documentary seems only able find tibetans who against chinese rule . they paint picture nobody tibet happy . this patently untrue . but then , this sort thing sells america . you demon , you damsel distress you must hero ( america this case ) . otherwise , it just won't sell . it not compassion all . if you really want " illuminated " , visit tibet tibetan communities all over china see things yourself . would far more enlightening . sadly , many journalists prefer interview wrong ( right ? ) people order get sensational story pay rent	-1

rock who this movie looking malnourished rotted teeth sinister contact lenses make-up ? this movie horrible . but , it typical van damme flick . horrible acting , over-produced cheesy waxy feel it , non-existent storyline usual idiotic ending . i admit though , i most van damme movies . he decent martial artist . my opinion his best movies " kickboxer " " bloodsport " . these his only movies actually enjoyable watch somewhat inspiring . i few observations / comments / questions make should humorous seasoned van damme fan : isn't it funny all his millions dollars van damme can't find plastic surgeon who hide silly bump his forehead ... why must every character van damme plays speak french accent ? he tries play wide variety different action hero roles but always character must some way originate france . isn't this preposterous ? you'd think if van damme serious his " acting " career he would attempted remedy this flaw . i mean , it not like his acting roles all challenging but it would nice if he even partially believable his roles ... why van damme always show his bare rear-end so much ? he think women watching his silly movies ? you'd think someone would realize mostly men watch action films majority men no desire see his naked backside so why show it ? ... it me or van damme need good hair stylist ? his hair especially stupid cyborg . he looks like he should cast " revenge nerds " ... speaking style , it van damme himself who invented stupid tucked shirt pleated dockers pulled up way too high over waist snazzy belt 80 look ? if so , this deed alone he should reprimanded ... why van damme such huge action hero ? he so friggin ' short if you saw him line behind you convenience store i don't think he would look all intimidating . least steven seagal tall tough looking although van damme definitely better shape . you never see seagal showing his muscles .... lastly , even though i laugh van damme i am definitely fan . said , i wonder if any his other fans share my sentiments producers , directors just everyone else involved most his many films . i think they should ashamed way they their work . van damme alot heart , maybe not so much stallone , but more heart than most action heroes like shwarzenegger , etc . people involved most van damme films truly disservice him action film fans everywhere . they should taken pride their work . it not like they weren't paid handsomely their services	-1
big fan roeg , bowie , sci-fi general , i intrigued enough purchase new criterion edition blind buy ( also aided my decision some positive reviews friends whose opinion i trust ) . overall , i think it great decision , if bit pricey . david bowie stars thomas jerome newton , who we first see stumbling around disoriented earth . he technical genius privately arranges meet one oliver farnsworth - scientific breakthrough lofty business plan mind . farnsworth quickly becomes his company manager begins amassing wealth thomas , who wants become rich reasons known only him . scientist , nathan bryce , also commissioned part research development - this time space project . around same time thomas meets young naive girl , mary lou , who helps save his life cares him ( eventually becomes his lover , despite thomas wife ) . while all this going , rival corporation noticed newton success keen bring his empire technology down . course , film like this , none matters all . that because thomas [ i]presumably[/i ] alien who come earth order save his small desert planet his family , who appear only survivors after two successive nuclear wars wrecked havoc planet atmosphere . i say " presumably " because , despite obvious ( scene his eyes , i say no more ) subtle ( his constant need water , his reactions moving fast speed ) visual performance/dialogue clues , film ends rather ambiguously this crucial point . my mind , possible layer newton not alien all rather fascinating . however , if taken surface only , nicolas roeg concocted visually sonically impressive sci-fi classic , fine appropriate misanthropic moody performance david bowie . roeg takes his time develop story around loose framework novel but uses number interesting visuals abstract imagery/metaphor order convey his major themes - loneliness vices man , ruthlessness corporate commercial world , way we would potentially react such visitor ( malice ) . other major theme , course , sexuality power sex destroy ; bryce considered problem because his taste very young women , newton fateful encounter mary lou , however control he may appear first , ends up doing same she introduces him joys follies human sexuality also alcohol ( which screws his system causes hallucinations - much like real life us humans , eh ? ) . film not without flaws . there number bizarre dialogue exchanges , especially newton mary lou , nothing enhance plot or development either character . one particularly fascinating but pretentious sex scene , using gun lot firing blanks sexual allegory , goes forever utterly pointless without context stage film . strange disturbing visual cues abound some particularly effective , but frequent use naked bodies writhing around some kind oatmeal throughout film silly . not nearly enough time spent reasons motivations how exactly newton intends save his planet . still , straightforward linear film would far less compelling not what roeg intended make anyway . it said writer accompanying interview roeg let spirit book guide his choices , large extent true ; he remain faithful [ i]spirit[/i ] narrative not deviate central plot . his distinct visual sense astonishing behold those unfamiliar his work . however , grade film dips slightly because flaws outlined above regard pacing , structure , story . despite all , i'm glad i bought it look forward seeing it again commentary order absorb all details i missed first time . excellent but difficult challenging piece science fiction visionary director - it amazing think " star wars " only year away ....	1

i am young actor europe , sweden i got uta books , respect acting , challenge actor previously my purchase dvd , uta hagan acting class . so , i already read through her books when i got dvd which i felt when viewing dvd must understand dvd . dvd not technical help tool show you how warm up or prepare play role or audition i thought it would . instead it quite amazing thing because you very first minute dvd walk straight into hb studio classroom view everything if you doing sit course you might interested . one then watch her students first get some instructions each exercise she then they based chosen exercise go up stage play dialogues against each other . after some minutes she stop students instead telling them what they wrong ask them if there something they could criticize what they just , why they believe it so ? after students talked their understandings she fill her own give very honest answer everyone . it obvious she knows what she doing her feedback always based how students reached goal exercises or not . i would say it worth buying if one serious acting but if one live close ny i would say you better off saving those money instead go down her studio , hb studio use those money classes ! i don't know how other teachers school but her exercises , her technique i feel just so authentic great something every actor serious his or her acting should master ! only thing this dvd not so good it copy old video 1970 i understand so style sound recording not greatest or up date today fashion . however , real actor probably irrelevant . so , overall i feeel it great dvd i give it 4 5uta created amazing technique based internal acting i feel leads authentic truth like behavior stage . i most definitely go ny take her class ! good luck all actors actresses world ! maybe i'll see you ny !	1
not knowing what expect this movie i went open mind . i amazingly pleased everything this film . it exceeded my every expectation more . chain crimes begins when dishonorable man named mainardi ( george hilton ) blackmails serial killer ( michel antoine ) into murdering his wife . after young couple ( alessio orano cristina galb�) burglarize murderer car , newly deceased corpse its trunk , killer sets off maniacal crime spree . film moves steady clip , camera movements slick professional cinematography makes great use shadow create atmosphere heighten tension . film receives stunning 2.35.1 anamorphic widescreen transfer taken film original negative . aside some really minor print damage shows up form odd speck here there , very occasional scratch , this transfer looks amazing . acting good all around , however , antoine steals show magnificent cruel , conscienceless killer . cozzi direction also brilliant he pays homage great dario argento initials d.a killers lighter . " killer must kill again " ( otherwise known " il ragno " , or " spider " ) great 70 giallo classic fans genre certainly enjoy .	1

late 1960s academy award winner clint eastwood ( pale rider , unforgiven ) certainly established himself actor such features good , bad ugly ( 1966 ) , hang ' em high ( 1968 ) , where eagles dare ( 1968 ) before also taking role director his film play misty me ( 1971 ) . high plains drifter ( 1973 ) eastwood 2nd directing gig , written ernest tidyman ( shaft , french connection ) featuring eastwood himself . also appearing verna bloom ( animal house ) , geoffrey lewis ( every which way but loose ) , marianna hill ( schizoid ) , mitch ryan ( lethal weapon ) , jack ging ( sssssss ) , stefan gierasch ( silver streak ) , ted hartley ( ice station zebra ) , walter barnes ( every which way but loose ) , anthony james ( unforgiven ) , dan vadis ( bronco billy ) , billy curtis , one many little people featured film wizard oz ( 1939 ) . film , which takes place seaside mining town known lago , begins we see lone horseback rider ( eastwood ) traveling across shimmering desert landscape , making his way towards town . his arrival draws much attention , particularly three gun-toting yahoos who , after getting uppity stranger , soon find themselves dead . turns out trio weren't just you run mill riff raff , but gunmen hired town protection , specifically against three other men , soon released prison , who townsfolk believe return revenge ( seems three men currently prison once held position three now deceased men held , before particular incident occurred they railroaded into jail ) . anyway , town leaders , now without their hired guns , decide offer stranger position protectorate , given ease which he dispatched their previous choices , stranger accepts only after promised complete run town . deal seems like good one , until stranger starts taking liberties above beyond what they believe fair equitable , causing consternation among more than few residents ( result townspeople start turning each other ) . stranger begins making good his end bargain ( setting up drills such men town ) , three men , including stacey bridges ( lewis ) his cousins cole dan carlin ( james vadis , respectively ) released prison proceed make their way towards lago , their intent seek reparations against town them wrong . town prepares their arrival ( including spiffy , new paint job , stranger behest ) , we continue learn more more past incident within town , one gruesome secret shared all , rationalized away most . me this very straightforward tale what goes around , comes around , especially terms everyone lago getting exactly what they deserved based their level involvement past , unspeakable events . i've stuff my life come back bite me ash , but never extent depicted here ... then again i never found myself position either participating or witnessing brutal crime ( doing nothing help ) . various points film eastwood character identity questioned , which it never flat out specified but given key aspects film it seemed pretty obvious me . short dream sequence early one should provide good idea where his character coming if not , then final sequence should ( hint , there metaphysical element involved ) . while eastwood character here not name , aspect not meant reflect some his earlier italian made westerns where his character generally not identified characters there here not same . there plenty nastiness film including some whippings , cold-blooded murders , acts misogyny , so , but interestingly enough , they all seem their place within story , especially given what we learn terms despicable secret most all town share . that not say all actions stranger justified but given underlying circumstances they weren't entirely unexpected . overall i think i pretty good handle characters ( their motivations , where they coming , etc . ) , except one female character played marianna hill , who seemed real weirdo . her character would glom onto most dominant male figure present which she would then seem resent them , particularly so stranger , but perhaps this result eastwood character interest her superficial best , something which she felt wasn't accustomed . regardless , she one those women who should wear sign around her neck stating `look , but don't touch ' . far eastwood , well , he eastwood , presents himself much one would expect role like this ( cool , distant , enigmatic ) . i thought his direction wonderful his performance . far rest cast , primarily made up character actors , i thought they all very well , story provided just enough material attention each given their respective roles within film . my favorite part film , besides confrontation sequence end , comes near beginning eastwood character arrives into town , enters saloon , begins getting verbally hassled three roughnecks which he brushes them off heads off shave bath , three troublemakers not far behind . they continue verbal jabs , when they fail get rise out him , they turn violent , forcing stranger react , resulting lesson learned all not mess bull lest you get horns . all all i thought this great film , one better westerns come out 1970s . picture , presented widescreen ( 2.35 : 1 ) , looks pretty decent , but could used little cleaning up , my opinion , there slight flaws present throughout ( when i say `slight flaws ' , i mean minor dust flecks such , but nothing overly obvious ) . audio , presented dolby digital 2.0 mono , both english french , comes through very well . far extras there production notes , cast crew biographies , theatrical trailer , subtitles english spanish . cookieman108	1

when i review movie , i look issues family traditional values discuss picture . this rather obscure canadian movie so it pretty hard find - maybe looking amazon.ca would more productive - looks matter sickness death point view fifteen-year-old girl , tamara . her artist father moves them into house where teenage son owners died leukemia . shortly after moving , tamara mother diagnosed tuberculosis leave family sanitarium . so , tamara her younger brother sister face number issues this movie - moving new location , going new school , dealing serious illness , etc . it happens neighbors across road them ( supposedly ) baptists so tamara soon faced issue religion . [ her mother avowed atheist , but wise enough let tamara decide herself whether go church or not . ] evangelical christian families , this family presents some interesting issues . kids swear like military sailor . what kind christian testimony ? when tamara starts pick up some language , her father no uncertain terms let her know she not use kind language . it really their fruits one knows godly person , not their religious doctrines ? there one delightful scene where three girls two boys go skinny-dipping farm pond . ( my father grew up skinny-dipping , my wife i well , all our kids now my grandchildren continuing tradition , so , course , i could relate . ) this not erotic scene - tamara her siblings , it just way they swam . baptist brother sister , i think there bit rebellion involved . when baptist father discovered them , he " blew his stack . " i feeling if tamara father discovered them , he would joined kids cooling off ! after watching hundreds movies dealing children , it also refreshing see one where children both parents . not only , they both very loving parents . course , her age , tamara really angry her father - how well i know . ( when my oldest daughter fifteen , i worst dad any girl could gotten stuck ; when she her first baby go back work , i one she wanted care her precious bundle . ) still tamara dad patient understanding ; willing show his love giving her hug when she needed it . i understand it , director this movie ( real-life mother actress who plays tamara ) professional photographer . this movie little rough around edges , sometimes feeling disjointed , although framing scenes very good . yet , both my wife i could follow story . point movie question meaning illness untimely death . why some people pray get healed ; others pray still die ? why it , if god anything healing , religious person child dies while nonbeliever recovers ? this film never classic . nonetheless , it make you think . if you want fast-paced action , look elsewhere . if you like real human interest stories , this one film worth looking . issues dealing illness death , general family relations , this five-star movie . chopiness , due inexperience movie-maker , drops it four-star movie me .	1

" second chorus " not widely known film , but it probably enjoyable any fan fred astaire . if you're not particularly fond astaire , you might want pass this one since seeing astaire action unusual role main attraction . story danny o'neill ( fred astaire ) hank taylor ( burgess meredith ) leaders band . two intentionally failing college , because they like atmosphere , also because long they officially students they spend their time running band making pretty good living it . when ellen miller ( paulette goddard ) enters picture , they both get greedy want her attention themselves . thus they each double-cross other both wind up getting expelled university , thus ending their cozy arrangement their band . they spend most rest film continuing double-cross one , this time over trying get into artie shaw band well trying win over affections ellen , who now works shaw . end , danny hank patch things up decide work together , good results coming their teamwork . things not so great this film mainly quality video , less than great comic timing , tiresome scenes . lester chisholm , played charles butterworth . mr. butterworth no edward everett horton , less-than-adequate character actor you just want shoo guy off stage every time he turns up . also , if you're watching this film see lots astaire wonderful dancing , you'll likely somewhat disappointed . he some singing dancing , but this film mainly shows off his comic abilities , which mischievous astaire plenty . this part would better if comic timing script tighter , though . second feature , " that dancing " documentary made 1985 same lines " that entertainment " . however , my humble opinion " that entertainment " it before it better . actually , this documentary seems bit drawn out lacks excitement its predecessor . however , you get see some good shots astaire others doing some pretty impressive dancing . considering low cost this double feature , ardent astaire fan it probably worth it	1

teen comedies always turn up big business box office , this generally due fact creative forces behind these movies include plenty crude humor , sex , nudity allowed under mpaa ratings system . most time these teen comedies dime-a-dozen , opening big fading shortly thereafter , little lasting appeal audiences . however , there some successes genre more staying power than others , examples would " animal house " , `scary movie ' franchise , `american pie ' series . those examples successful teen comedies , they all some common traits which they share , basically they packed full sex , nudity , crude humor language . however , one thing these examples successful teen comedies , even unsuccessful ones lack any amount heart or soul story . 2004 , fox studios produced yet teen comedy appease masses short while , " girl next door " . starring elisha cuthbert ( tv " 24 " ) unknown lead actor named emile hirsch , " girl next door " would stand out other teen comedies come before it or even after it , this movie contained one thing i said lacking those others , heart soul . " girl next door " story 18-year-old matthew kidman ( emile hirsch ) , straight-laced , overachieving , good boy who never really lived life fullest . , until he spies his incredibly sexy neighbor ( elisha cuthbert ) changing window , finds through his desire her , he anything everything her . but , matthew gets thrown somewhat loop when he discovers his perfect `girl next door ' actually former porn star , who trying forget life she used lead . now , matthew sheltered life quickly begins spin out control he attempts help his new girlfriend leave life she knew embrace life she longs . reason i feel this movie far above those other teen comedies i listed , some which i enjoyed way , like i said earlier " girl next door " contains plenty heart soul its story . this movie isn't simply sex , yes there obligatory teen comedy element this movie , but this movie actually discovery sex isn't only thing look relationship someone . prove point main character story , matthew , who way played perfectly emile hirsch , forced learn true meaningful relationship woman , he must get past his lustful desire only want physical body , no regard emotional side woman . lesson he learn hard way , it forces his character mature throughout story , until finally he able committed relationship this `girl next door ' , he discovers she more than just beautiful woman , former porn star , fact she person real feelings . all she asks matthew he move past her former life see her who she truly . writing this story better than most contained this type movie , generally story fairly thin , pretty much there link each crude joke next or bridge gap sex scenes ; however , this movie story main focus , yes there crude jokes couple sex scenes , but story isn't simply minor plot device get audience these obligatory teen comedy sequences . actors all very good job bringing their characters life , appear enjoying themselves immensely roles they've given . elisha cuthbert emile hirsch share great chemistry helps elevate this movie almost romantic comedy level , instead just teen comedy . timothy olyphant ( " man apart " " scream 2 " ) makes several appearances throughout film shady porn producer , he manages steal almost every scene he , actually provides matthew some rather sage advice , though inadvertently i might add . if you fan teen comedies , but perhaps tired same old thing , then check out " girl next door " , i promise you it more than your average teen , gross-out sex comedy . " girl next door " available both rated unrated editions , both contain language sexuality/nudity	1

i disagree negative reviews this one big time . concert awesome ! picture sound great my tv/stereo system . although different than their concerts late ' 80 early ' 90 ( one should expect ) , jon , always , crowd singing , dancing , waving their arms unison ( not so unison times , lol ) even though it pouring rain fans ( some band ) getting soaked he exhibited his expertise front man he so well . if you looking origional ( cd ) versions not variations or " strays " their songs ( especially their infamous hits yester-year ) , this not cd provide ( though you shouldn't disappointed ) . just note variations mostly , rockers still rockers only 1 exception i think - i especially loved " runaway " rendition - it hauntingly beautiful ballad blew me away i'd buy this dvd again song alone . just their self stated anthem " just older " all i think bon jovi music reflects their maturity band it especially reflects their musical talent genius . fact they now playing 2 generations audiences , many which thought " crush " their first cd , fantastic says lot band their talent their ability appeal more than " just older " crowd ( just check out all young faces crowd absolutely thrilled there rain ) . i also thought it cool concert also broadcast over radio , i sure wish bands here . they played 19 songs total ( i rarely went concert where band played 19 songs - especially rain ! - i've quite few concerts past ) , 3 song encore ( " keep faith " rocked ! ) . awesome fire works show end concert band leaves while " thank you loving me " plays background ... nice touch ending . also interviews , pictures , more dvd . get it while you , it well worth it ! jon , richie , david , tico , hugh ... my hat off you all ! i wish i could there	1

this movie my favorite movie . ever . i feel terrible giving it two stars . but it gets 2 stars because i am comparing it rhino version , which i also own . i also own original vhs . i watched this movie least once year since i 8 except 6 years middle school/hs . i sit class watch it memory my head . buy rhino version . if you can't find rhino version , this isn't half bad . its just version much better , since i growing up older copies , new one flaws , minor newcomer , blinding me . i also am physically unable watch any " special edition " star wars because those changes , if gives clue my movie anality . buy rhino version if you find it . one complaint vhs this cool " glitter " effect couple scenes involving energon unicron internals . it present vhs , it came out wrong rhino version , totally gone 20th . thanks deleting part my childhood . comparison rhino version : remaster terrible . mine seems flicker strange artifacts . colors totally off . hot rod basically magenta/pink instead red his orange not orange like orange , it orange like cheaply made basketball . widescreen fake . it cut fullscreen . i wish you weren't such liar , sony . cover art : d- . no detail . looks like whoever new show drew it afternoon or two . matrix looks like honeydew . it would got but prime there . very few extras worth it . i bought this remaster , hoping some clean up restoration glitter effect , they weren't there	-1

so many folks already know plot resolution " tale two cities " , detailed review unnecessary . this may lessen suspense but should not diminish appreciation this fine movie . this well-done mgm classic old school . ttc set against french revolution 1789 , but absence french accents not detract . neither " paris " obviously shot hollywood back lot . ronald colman lead virtually carries picture . he plays slacker london lawyer who clears young frenchman , donald woods , trumped up charges . woods moved england escape treacherous atmosphere smoldering paris . woods ' uncle , played basil rathbone , planted fake charges . br over top effete , haughty , snobbish french aristocrat . colman woods love same young woman , elizabeth allen , crux ttc . woods wins her hand but makes mistake returning paris-and promptly thrown into cooler sentenced death . prove his amour allen , colman visits woods prison -and switches places waiting list guillotine ! subrogation completely believable , not maudlin least . ttc moves briskly ; most not notice two-hour run time . less time would inadequate involved plot . it , viewers should still watch ttc closely fullest appreciation . some key scenes brief ! ttc shot beautiful black white-perfect gloomy subject matter . why anyone would colorize-or remake ! - this classic mystery . original cannot improved upon . this reviewer so impressed film , he bought book , perfect compliment/complement any self-respecting movie	1

i watched " camille " " four horsemen apocolypse " only because i never seen rudolph valentino film curious see what all fuss . now i know . i purchased " son sheik " , after seeing it several times , am captivated his charisma just like thousands before me through years . course , it bit corny several parts such fast motion they comical ; but , if accepted fantasy it , it truly beautiful , sexy romance . i've seen many reviews which his facial expressions thought comical ; but , most part , i mesmerized sexual tension came across those georgeos eyes ! when he first brings his dancing girl his camp lights his cigarette slowly takes off his belt while watching her over his shoulder smoldering stare , i actually felt fluttery would loved girl ! i not , personally , seen any male hear t-t hrob since valentino , present day , come even close rivaling his natural ability project such sensuality screen . raised eyebrow ! whew ! i now purchased " sheik " see where story all began . can't wait get carried away again	1
i must say i am taken aback many negative comments thrown this film . what many reviewers miss fact , aside western , this also story which duke plays opposite strong woman . there constant trading off two who upper hand -- duke not realizing just when he thinks he put ann-margaret her place she deceiving him toward her own purposes all . compared quiet american , mclintock , donovan reef , hatari true grit , this one film where duke doesn't exactly carry day over his female interest . therefore , it quite refreshing its own way . unlike other reviewers , i remember this film more fondly i others 1970's--including shootest . terms movie cowboys whom times passing ( duke terms which hollywood leaving him behind ) , i prefer remember aging john wayne this way . even outwitted one hell woman , john wayne more dignity himself than pretenders who followed . ( yes , i mean you , kevin costner . )	1
i've wanting this since show canceled . its just too bad there isn't anything past season	1
this great , sexy , mystery thriller really keeps you your toes . there no pointless panning dialogue leading up excitement film opens intense car chase . james spader keeps your attention fullest introverted former cop john parker his cool demeanor rye wit , keeping you guessing what hell going through his mind . spader you engrossed role so much you find yourself shoes john parker- getting away small mountain town , clearing your head painful divorce tragic loss partner , getting wrapped up steamy romantic affair , suddenly running aftermath bank robbery whole town shaken up . if approached wrong way , some dialogue scenarios may come accross somewhat corny , but it really modern action-mystery movie style 1940 black white mystery movie . even soundtrack gives it vibe black white picture . good own because you'll probably want view it multiple times .	1
i hated this movie . not one character redeeming quality . mom aging hippie denial who smokes pot boffs rock stars half her age . rock star self-centered self-important no talent . son playing kissy face impossibly beautiful co-worker . daughter-in-law playing kissy face rock star mom ! dialogue sounds written original music atrocious . only good thing i got out this discovery t-rex song i previously unaware .	-1
forget multitude indiscretions jfk may committed his sadly short life watch this film . it tells story cuban missile crisis 1962 . it isn't 100% accurate . kevin costners character never existed , although it may mixture number actual real-life people . however what it shows , some great performances , how close nuclear catastrophy we came 1962 . i only one time , so no personal recollection events , but if this film 50% true then we should all grateful jfk power not bush . jfk mostly lone voice government full hawks who advising him go all out nuclear first strike . jfk went behind their backs deal russians . course if you believe all out nuclear war sensible option then you hate this film . rest us though , this very well made film shows how great politician kennedy really	1

this honestly one worst films i ever witnessed ... gay or straight . i am amazed it actually got made , let alone distributed ! i hate mean , but it hard watch ms. lesnick . her talents must lay elsewhere . she not act her way out box . oy !! she should stuck her rabbinical studies . seriously folks .... you should just rent it see how bad it ... you fascinated . i am sure helen lesnick lovely hard working woman , but what flat actress . her heavy black blue makeup made her look like drag queen fact she says she 34 film insane ! she clearly looked 45 + . i am all accepting yourself you age , but woman such deep lines her face , she looked like road map . if you force us stare your face 2 hrs ( tons annoying close ups !! oy again ! )please consider boxtex next time . well she got film made out there , starring herself lead . i am sure great accomplishment her ... but , painful us .	-1

apart colin firth intense portrayal main character , this movie really lacking any substance . times it seems like it makes sense there thin plot grasp , but then too slips away . most psychological thrillers , things not what they seem . there several twists plot , but most them happen last 20 minutes movie , ultimately viewer left completely confused , rather than shocked intrigued . colin firth character wakes up week-long coma after car accident which he believes his girlfriend died . he meets mena suvari , who helps him cope his " trauma " , some reason attracted him despite his erratic mannerisms strange habits . filmmaking also little strange quite few slow-motion-esque shots . i wish i knew better way describe them . strange shots where maybe filmmaker only showing every 5th frame , but slow motion . it distracting not very aesthetically pleasing . there , however , very creepy dream sequence middle film defintiely pays off . dvd no extras all , unless you count previews subtitles	-1

" oh ohio " self-assured slice life touch viewers while disconcerting them all while . its comedic aspirations don't come full fruition its screenplay tad undercooked , but actors overcome this suave , easy charm . poking sly , understated fun overemphasis sex society , it neither prudish nor those who need slapstick find humor . sex may centrifugal force film , but this no " 40-year old virgin , " even though paul rudd plays similarly sympathetic characters each . priscilla chase , played parker posey , ambitious , ditzy woman fast track large-scale corporate success . however , dismay her schoolteacher husband jack , played rudd , she consummate cold fish . she may know exact number times they've sex , but she never single orgasm - ever - due " sexual dysfunction . " nor she seem interested doing so soon . things go up smoke . she may caused problem , but jack cannot get past fact one woman he not satisfied bed his wife ten years . after moving garage confiding his friend colleague popovitch , played cheeky delight keith david , he finally begins full-fledged separation priscilla when she becomes overly addicted vaginal vibrator . he moves manly arms apartment complex - " why settle mundane when you king your domain ? " - gives advances sophisticated 18-year old student kristen , played perfectly mischa barton , who lost her innocence long before he came . priscilla thus left find her sexual identity . she pursues sex random men , but she finds it unsatisfying . sex sex shop clerk justine , played heather graham , doesn't trick either . wayne pool guy , played zest warmth danny devito , however , puts entirely new spin things , awakening " parts cleveland " she never knew existed . wayne she finds liza minelli hoot her scene overzealous sex therapist , posey really brings it home when jack finally gives priscilla satisfaction missing their bedroom merely calling her cell phone during , all moments , important board meeting . it where phone specifically , course , matters . " oh ohio " equal parts raunchy touching it cloaks its characters genuine humanity . sex may come them , but it who they , not what they , matters end	1
i could not sit through this movie . acting screenplay terrible . this film could described bad made-for-tv movie best . i ended up fast-forwarding though entire movie after first 30 minutes turned player off before i reached end . i couldn't take it anymore . this movie one worst i've attempted watch long time . not recommended .	-1

room full . almost everybody filled their white styrofoam cups black coffee taken their seats . when i finally got nerve stand i felt so self-conscious i wanted crawl under my chair . " my name charley deriemer , " i finally said , " ... i ... uh ... i'm fan ... uh ... frighteners . " but i'm disappointed lot it , too . this horror-comedy too much humor wit not enough cheese qualify cult flick . all film computer generated flatulence , me , eventually loses impact . cgf so clutters up story-line , which already complicated , i think peter jackson , director , must fallen love his computer toys forgotten there story tell . it doesn't help while most movie over-the-top funny , last part sinks into old-fashioned scare-um gore-fest without cleverness , just jake busey grinning lot teeth people jumping out big knives their hands . so why this movie so likable ? first , most time script funny clever . second , several sequences manage create great blend humor , raunchiness , special effects drama ( funeral cemetery , museum party egyptian wing ) or real jolt dread foreboding ( lucy mansion patricia ann , beginning psychiatric hospital scene ) . third , movie some fine , grotesque acting weird unsettling ( jeffrey coombs , dee wallace , jake busey ) or weird funny ( john astin , chi mcbride , peter dobson ) . fourth , you can't beat love story reaches beyond death into eternal devotion . patricia ( dee wallace ) johnny ( jake busey ) , love forever means never say you're sorry . fifth , my mind most importantly , it michael . fox frank bannister . fox personality star firepower able turn typical nice-guy character into man we really like . fox master portraying flawed , vulnerable nice guys we almost instantly sympathize . it rare talent . me , he manages most time overcome continual show-off intrusion all computer generated overkill . exception when he involved massive tube heaven looks like slinky steroids . when he screen , even when he enmeshed silly blue-screen aerobics , he makes film human grounded . it shame jackson all money all those computers play . he didn't really need them . just watch how he builds dread when lucy arrives creepy old mansion whisk patricia away safety . it one best , most skillful scenes movie , there hardly computer effect seen until last it ... when dread suspense swept out " wow " stuff swept . there lot great stuff this comedy serial killers , demonic possession scamming psychic investigator who brings his own ghosts . there lot frustrated , too . most part , i just use my fast-forward button now them . i like movie even its faults . now if only someone would make , " johnny patricia versus mommy daddy , " featuring knife-wielding mommy leather-suited daddy people under stairs . would make tag-team match worth watching . original , basic dvd 110-minute theatrical release . there director cut 122-minutes which probably brainchild production company marketing department , division double-dips development . dvd transfer looks just fine	1
freddy one most three easily recognized horror movie characters world . most people don't know names movies , but they know glove . just like , they don't know friday 13th , but they know hockey mask . 1984 , horror world set fire nmoes original . how .... well i don't really know . i think this movie much better than original , my favorite out series here why . first , script much better . first movie ton holes it , dialogue characters seemed akwardly structured . it like akward group date person your friends want you meet , except your watching it . you know characters should saying something but they aren't . big problem time script . nancy tells her dad come over her house twenty mintues . during those 20 mintues she manages set up numerous booby traps catch freddy , heart heart conversation her mom , still 10 minutes fall asleep . second movie , script feels natural . there some pretty funny parts script , dialogue characters seems real . i understand these movies aren't oscar worthy but still . best example when girl asks male lead why he doesn't use key start his car . she says " well , someone could steal your car , couldn't they ? " then he says " deadly dinosaur ? " just way they talk sounds real , it not normal cheesy horror movie line . second thing this movie better acting . nancy first movie down right horrible . it not she bad actor . she great job chase sequences acting scared . where she faulters way she says lines . they just feel so forced , like your watching middle school play . when she yells " kruger !! kruger !! come get me you ..... b****d " it just feels akward . even when she says something simple like " sc**w sleep , or s***w your hall pass !!! " it just doesn't work . they should girl who played tina play nancy , she would much better . second movie , male lead delivers . sure , some parts little over top but he really good job character . he teenage boy , who wants fit , but weak mind , perfect freddy take over . i thought it cool idea , not only could freddy attack you your dreams , he also take over your concious mind . i mean , why not ? it still mental right ? third thing this movie better editing effects . first one effects okay budget they , but often times it cuts away so fast you don't know what happened . or they show them too long effect lost . this one times it just right . it long enough gross you out , but short enough not lose effect it . plus they bigger budget , but i think first movie could lot better better editing . this isn't greatest horror movie ever , but i think it right up there . it definitely my favorite out series . some people say it filled homosexual references things , but i never got out it . i thought it good twist original movie , made very well . you think what you want , but first movie me , doesn't get it . it too many holes gaps effective .	1

this movie made 1963 , if anyone tries judge movies 1963 todays standards they typically think movie boring slow moving . movie based true story , there book you read if you want more detail . you probably more great actors ( james garner , charles bronsan , mcqueen , attenborough , coburn , etc ) this one movie than you combined all hollywood today . today all special effects , blood guts more brutality better . imagine any movie today no cursing , would not get past screening room . listen richard attenborough classify all germans one enemy , not differentiate ss gestapo . we war all them , not just ss . teenagers drive todays movie market there few movies which keep their attention if there no special efects . this movie adult movie , plain simple . motorcycle scene awesome . i think steve mcqueen most it . richard attenborough one tough guy movie , you not steroid pumped up tough , you tough your mind . music score great , scenery great , actors great it entertaining movie . i really tried tell i enjoyed this movie it good movie . remember this movie made only 16 or so years after wwii	1

this movie plain bad . yes good gun fight but where kung fu . theirs plenty american made film way better terms action sequence . man even gun fight face off much better then killer or hard boiled . maybe im not into old fashion gun fight like these two movie , i would rather watch movie like ballistic kiss , great gun fight , some kungfu little special effect . i don't care if killer or hard boil made 10 or 20 years ago . it just didn't live up my potential . this 21st century , i need some special effect . i don't understand why some you people keep living past . trust me their way better mivie then these two made 70 80 . take example god father 1 2 , much better movie then these two , go recomend this movie customer not some lame movie like killer hard boil . chow yun fat check out my review hidden dragon crouching tiger	-1

recently , i picked up dts version bargain price . since there plenty reviews , i keep this short . special effects ( efx ) sensational . i watched this movie past thought it ok . now i viewed this movie through my home theater , i rate it 5 . video transfer fantastic 5.1 sound superior . there excellent usage low bass surround speakers . this give your home theater work out . movie definite purchase 5.1 surround sound value .	1
it important director immediately establish level trust his/her audience . we need believe we capable hands introduce us characters situations make perfect sense , events follow one unyielding logic . first , i felt decision made early film decision outside " trust " i described above . toward end film , i realized decision ok - even though i thought it bad idea filmmaker part make particular decision . i wish screenwriters worked harder come up different way get point point . problem " real " decision i lost faith director/story almost immediately because it appeared - time - utterly ridiculous . there scene where cat came jumping out closet shock value , my lord , i can't count number times where tired old trick used . whenever happens , i immediately think someone lazy can't come up better way give audience quick scare . besides - it quite awful leave cat locked up closet because they tend start using it their bathroom , you just can't get cat pee out * anything * . movie progressed , it began move fairly reasonable logic flow , i started gain trust director/story again , even though there some unnecessary characters scenes . dakota fanning ( emily ) , amazing actress whose ability portray wide range emotions many actors actresses years more training experience would give their left foot , perfect character part . we see her happy , we see her completely dead inside , we see her unbearably terrified . her tremors tears terrors ring true . she best actor film . ( which saying quite bit . ) movie man whose wife dies he moves country help his daughter cope . this didn't make sense me , because psychologist , father , david , ( deniro ) , should known just plain stupid . we don't see many emotions deniro after his wife dies , too disturbed me . again - i didn't feel capable hands , so i questioned everything looked wrong . while beautiful house country , emily what everyone calls imaginary friend - charlie . david frustrated this , few conversations former student his close emily . that where story starts pick up . charlie more more part emily life , david feels isolated . end , it seemed movie going " sixth sense " feel , it almost achieved it , but fell short . we're shown obligatory flashbacks , but they aren't convincing , shocking , or immediately understood those occurred shyamalan film . ( i saw " sixth sense " theater its opening weekend . i'm hard hearing , i wear headsets , thankfully , drown out idiots who like talk through films . however , those headsets couldn't keep me hearing shocked gasps audience . it shame shyamalan trying recreate same shock rest his films , because he failed miserably . ) if " hide seek " wasn't incorporating elemental template " sixth sense " , it would made more interesting film . or if " sixth sense " never made , it might more interesting . but i don't think it would much more interesting , because i said , flashbacks shocks those flashbacks supposed cause fell short . case point : " sixth sense " rating 8.2 imdb.pro, hide seek rating 5.5 . i tend trust those ratings , because members imdb.pro film aficionados , thousands people ( 129,000 ss 13,600 ) cast votes . it good sample .	-1

or not not one more well-known mel brooks films , but rip-roaring slightly naughty fun . it sets itself apart other mel brooks films superb , well- structured plot even some serious social commentary . mel plays lead role opposite stunning anne bancroft , his real-life wife . their personalities add real acting chemistry film . charles durning got academy award nomination best supporting actor his role gestapo commander . i really like " naughty nazis " number - hysterical	1
it worth attention ? definitely . it worth money ? absolutely . it worth effort ? certainly . it worth two years ? probably . it worth wait ? not really . it deserve last effort great late director ? unquestionably . plot eyes wide shut unfolds , tom cruise nicole kidman struggle attract audience attention . they attentively invite viewer into their fantasy world , which dreams might reality reality one single night becomes long unforgettable dream . good actor tom cruise this movie , nicole kidman manages steal show him . scene during which she reveals her husband how she would easily given up everything : him , her daughter , her life naval officer powerful combo her performances critically acclaimed die broadway play blue room . only flawed scene kidman alice , ex-gallery manager , who currently unemployed , sequence where she tells her husband she terrible nightmare . her sobs unemotional scene it not come out strong rest her performance . famously feared orgy scene indeed peculiar . it captures viewer attention , but it really needed ? scene serves little purpose conveying true message thin line imaginary real life . entire scenery inside rich mansion , where orgy scenes take place , where masked men pray hookers , fantastic regardless controversy its necessity . stanley kubrick , master filmmaking , gives imaginary twist marriage , dreams , reality life . but once viewer exits theater , he or she loss words thin line dream world reality disappears . such effect indeed kubrick last legacy .	1

clint eastwood looking cross television films but no success . until italian director , sergio leone decided bring western italy . leone decided liberally steal great kurosawa films . this much like yojimbo original zatoichi . eastwood plays gun hire , man no name . he stumbles into corrupt town . town controlled two rival families . he proves his abilities but when both sides vie his services , he accepts both offers pits two families against each other . this film created persona eastwood would follow him next two decades . dvd extras : none	1

good premise story line , most part decent dialog , outstanding acting ( except sleepwalking gyllenhaal ) , so what missing ? what missing plausibility . movie grief doesn't dwell it , but it must show early grief there . if this properly , viewer accept even most outlandish behavior character way dealing grief . kasdan it brilliantly ' big chill , ' mere thirty seconds glenn close sobbing shower . silbering failed anything like `moonlight mile , ' so eccentric parents goofy fiance seem uncaring preoccupied only themselves . i couldn't overcome it , even though i tried good while . time gyllenhaal bares his soul court it way too late ; what might otherwise quite affecting seems only outlandish .	-1

this televised ( pbs ) gala turned me casual , occasional opera listener into full-fledged fan . most specifically , it introduced me beauty splendor wagner . i recorded gala video , watched it time time over years . while pal version referred reviewer may contained entire performance , this dvd not . it comes awfully close , though . there missing arias which performed evening alfredo kraus ( werther aria ) , gwyneth jones ( " questa reggia " ) , vladimir chernov ( figaro aria barber seville ) , others -- most notably , wonderful " va pensiero " performed incomparable met chorus , cherubino aria wonderful fredrica von stade ( much better than selection included here her ) . but when you still close 5 hours glorious music like this , these complaints minor . this neophyte opera listener , i knew wagner composer rousing music used " apocalypse now " . i not prepared astonishing beauty prelude " rienzi " , which opens gala , nor could i believe intensity waltraud meier performance isolde " narrative curse " " tristan und isolde " . but it james morris ' performance " wotan farewell " which moved me near tears , which , noted earlier , turned me into devoted fan this music . there many other wonderful moments this dvd ( personal favorite : roberto alagna bryn terfel duet bizet " pearlfishers " ) . you probably won't watch this one sitting , but each performace , you thoroughly won over met orchestra . incredibly , unlike met centennial gala , which used many conductors , entire james levine 25th anniversary gala conducted maestro levine . may he grace pit metropolitan opera many years come . needless say , i couldn't recommend dvd release any more highly	1

there comes time when you exposed film ... song ... photograph ... piece history sends you place where you either want ... or wish avoid . i saved film " aria " father day ... because when i began watch it six months ago i quickly enveloped aura nostalgia tugged my heart . i don't know how review such film " aria " . there never anything like it , nor there again . it cinematic brilliance ... cinematic brilliance ... cinematic brilliance . you get point ? it visual masterpiece ... musical masterpiece ... simply piece art ! i'd remiss if i told you it everyone . this one very much romantic ( sometimes erotic ) flick i would highly recommend hopeless romantics this planet . unfortunately , eliminates most men earth ... but not me . i don't remember last time i cried so much ... so hard ... so consistently ... than this operatic , eroti ,. connectic , endearing ... sometimes tragic epic . it filled love ... pain ... hope ... joy ... sprinkled passion ... eternal love ... lost dreams ... hopeful fantasies ... art ! many films left me speechless ... this one never find way keep my trap shut . maybe it romance me provoked tears ... but this film one goes straight heart ... soul ... ears tears . if you've ever love ... lost love ... yearned love ... or simply enjoyed thought love ... " aria " you . see it loving friend . i swear you'll swap tissues ... you'll hug ... you'll cry out loud ... that what makes this film such epic heart . what wrong tears ? what wrong wanting ... ... losing ... possessing strength eternal love passion ? isn't what life all ? all this captured without script . soul orchestrated operatic classics . it profound sound ... visual candy only cinematic artist could capture film . this one made pr ... me . it go down one finest films i ever seen . only one hint ... it series vignettes build intensity . star-studded cast includes many classic actors actresses ... but their challenge this ditty capture your heart without script . guess what ? they . here box . go out ... rent or buy this box ... some kleenex ... bottle chardonnay ... hold hand someone you love . i , regretably , home alone ... when i let stan ( my dog ) house after film ... he never received better back rub ( scratch behind ears ) . i'm still lost " aria " . tranquil mood ... imagery ... beautiful music live me forever . phew ! this one simply awesome !	1
i should known what expect " extreme " marketing phrases all over cover ... raw brutal , yeah right . i fully understand not wanting put out super produced dvd ( though i enjoy ones released their peers ) but these bootlegs horrible . sound too distorted ( not distorted guitars)in live footage ; even some music videos quality shotty best ( which inexcusable this era technology ) . if you want sound preserves more , pardon this word , " raw " feeling take cue bad religion " way " dvd . it soundboard , but that it . there lot comparisons " cliff ' em all " but come . tribute band member who passed away , bootlegs only choice . even so , it funny how bootlegs 1980 sound just good , sometimes better than , sound here . humor let down . all lyrics inner struggle self improvement one would expect something more than scenes puking someone window . , what , four minute clip other musicians saying shadows fall suck gay ? i teach 9th grade , i think even they would feel this humor too childish . i would only reccomend this dvd those who collect shadows fall . those us who like music would better off just listening albums . long live image attitude over substance	-1

i found this valuable collection my dance library . first segment teaches what many instructors fail teach- orientation smooth transitions early , this video guide you easily . transitions left right created teaching pivoting foot almost magically , creating smooth graceful dancing , no more boring dancer , learn dance all your audience , not just those facing you ! cross step use arms over head framing head , taxsim which much overlooked , hip pushes , beautiful traveling hip circles , undulations . second segment teaches funtastical drum solo , easy learn . it easy add this choreography make it more challenging . there so much this video , learn flow gracefully or bump beat drum , let beautiful neon guide you into spellbinding journey this mystical dance . overall , i totally enjoyed quality this video only improvements i would make would backdrop or setting which needed color . learning video easier my opinion if instructor faces mirror or works angle student follows . overall those minor compared all offered	1
ferrell crew really firing all cylinders here . anchorman funny bursts spurts , same old school , but this one keeps up fevered comedic pace up checkered flag . it makes fun french , jazz music , friends dorothy , but also makes fun nascar , rednecks , kfc , taco bell , applebee , but such way even people or things spoofed would enjoy this movie . dennis miller not funny long time , i remember he tried make joke dixie chicks , how their criticism war wouldn't go over nascar dads . but hey , dennis your agememnon references ruined monday night football those same nascar dads , you never go over them . ferrell go over them , even he parodies them , they love him , he slip some steve earle into soundtrack , it sound redneck but actually very subversive . ferrell totally get away all it . i watched this movie christmas my dad , he loved it , my nephew also received copy it christmas , he liked it too . there very touching father/son back story , it appeals all ages socio-economic backgrounds . i just realized french driver played guy who made borat . i hear he funny movie , too . let all get thrown out applebee's!!!	1
i've hoping release this series long time now , anxiously look forward other seasons , lot entertainment price	1
this pretty cute funny , really if i could i would given it 3.5 stars , but there not half star rating here . all all , it well put together .. vein fun old scooby doo cartoons i grew up . various worlds they visited during adventure added story kept you getting bored one scenario . i freely admit , i am more partial older ones .. they just seem little more solid me than current ones , but overall i think this good kids watch , they would fun it learn few things way .	1

there much concern this series would never see light day . fox restored these films cable tv eye towards video release . however , when films first ran cable , there storm protest asian groups . they protested fact charlie chan not portrayed chinese actor ( although other chan family members played asians)and some his mannerisms might viewed stereotypical . defense these films , charlie chan always good guy he always outsmarted his opponents . films must viewed context era which they produced . they good clean fun . no bloody violence screen ! i am happy fox courage release these films dvd . interest them extraordinary . first two volumes moved top amazon sales charts within few days release . hopefully , all fox chans come dvd near future .	1
if you choosing which volumes keep , this one falls under must category , although second episode , " return babel " clearly stronger one . episode , we get return mark lenard spock father , reincarnation his previous role season one romulan commander who meets his doom pitting his wits against capt kirk . this time , lenard shows more staying power his new role ambassador sarek endure years come even through st : tos movies . what makes this episode very good also great acting newly departed jane wyatt who puts very heart-wrenching emotional performance her role spock human mother . plot also very good fast moving well making this overall one best episodes entire trekdom let alone second season must your collection . first episode isn't classic but it still some good points which includes surprise revelation end lt . uhura no less figuring something out combined grey matter kirk , spock bones failed which impressive . plot fast-moving premise interesting scottie gets hero change . overall , this solid volume 2 powerful episodes strength " return babel " must any tos collection . highly recommended	1

ok , so i'll admit brad pitt accent not perfect there no way any ira man would pretty ( imagine if brad pitt looked like gerry adams - i doubt he would get many roles ) . but accent actually not bad , belfast people actually say " foks sake " quite frequently . i agree there some dubious moments plot action scenes little far fetched , but hey , this hollywood , there enough " gritty realism " feel imparted elsewhere distract viewer these minor inconsistencies . harrison ford plays same character he played patriot games / air force 1 / fugitive , which fine me since i enjoyed all those movies i am big harrison fan . i didn't find plot partucularly confusing ( it pretty straightforward really ) . although i certainly wouldn't venture say script delivers chapter verse hellishly complicated political situation . ireland , it least go some way explaining mechanisms ( personal revenge , indoctrination ) drive cycle violence there . bittersweet ending desired effect .	1
i loved this movie ! it wasn't scary i hoped but other than it fabulous ! lisa brenner gorgeous she shines ellen rimbaur ! it great prequel " rose red " , which also fantastic .	1

made pittance , initially released just two theaters , ultimately grossing over ten million dollars , " sweet sweetback baadasssss song " became progenitor " blaxploitation " film craze seventies . considered seminal film african-american cinema , director van peebles feels it influenced independent film movement whole . its jazzy editing strong hero set it miles apart standard fare - one see how african-american audiences could see this film long-overdue cinematic thunderbol t.t he plot simple . sweetback ( van peebles himself ) grown up bordello become one its central attractions . one night , he agrees accompany pair police officers downtown questioning . murder case lacks suspects , gesture appears compensation force lenience toward establishment . en route interrogation , however , police intercept youth street brutally beat him . using his handcuffs , sweetback kills both officers . rest protracted chase , sweetback using his fists ( among other body parts ) make his way border . police question his companions , hot his trail guns , bloodhounds ( one point ) helicopter . van peebles eye striking shot , there some vivid scenes police officers brutalizing sweetback friend beetle get their point across . while its historic contribution clear , " sweetback " little offer modern audiences beyond its kitsch value . van peebles strong presence laconic hero , but there not much way narrative or memorable characters savor . there plenty sex violence ( ' ' rating fully earned ) , but it episodic - much film seems enormous montage repeated street scenes dialogue clips , effect rapidly becomes tiresome . thirty years after its explosive release , " sweetback " remain compelling film historians students . its torch passed other filmmakers , but pioneering effort itself not dated well . ps - dvd release interview director . initially , it shares some formal similarities feature , but later it settles into some interesting ( amusing ) anecdotes . pps - i just saw " badasssss !

" santa waiting , santa greeting , now you're nodding , now you're sleeping , you good mom dad , santa knows if you've bad ! " you won't able help but sing this fitting christmas song after watching this flick . dvd anchor bay put together pretty good . i'm only rating this first film mind . i haven't watched second one yet , but if i remember correctly what people said , half movie flashbacks . not good . avoid other 3 sequels well some not even related first . however , first film really creepy music , clear picture dvd transfer , several good moments enjoy . beginning where they visit grandfather creepy when he starts ranting how santa punishes bad children christmas eve . then billy parents killed robber santa suit same night . fast forward four years billy living orphanage strict , iron-handed mother superior who believes punishment necessary bad children ! fast forward ten years billy 18 working department store over christmas . after seeing fellow co-worker harrassed back room while flashbacks all horror he experienced when he younger , he finally snaps begins killing spree punish all bad ( including one antlers deer head hung wall ! ) holiday-themed film , i thought this pretty good . my favorite black christmas one much better far , but this one worth any true horror fans collection . even if it just all controversy it caused when it first released 1984 because they idea killer santa suit too much some people grasp . while i agree kids don't need see commerical advertisements posters suggest santa dangerous , this movie pure adult entertainment . kids go summer camp trick or treating , but i didn't see people complaining friday 13th or halloween films when those came out . silent night deadly night should not singled out because . parents simply don't need their kids watching this , end story . that why it rated . just reminder all parents santa not real ! we let kids believe he real mere fun it . isn't just bad ? check this one out horror fans	1
jacob kornbluth written directed this explosive little film such finesse multiple messages life ghetto , power need family , introspective view children caught fault lines life , incomprehensible difficulties mere survival world chaos all delivered conviction power . this very fine little indie film deserves wide audience . zaidmans family five living tenement building new york city area where streets ghetto tenements house myriad people lives one struggle . mother sue ( mary-louise parker ) sole financial supporter since her husband paul ( david warshofsky ) stroke victim leaving him wheelchair bound brain damaged . not even her visiting mother ( lois smith ) tolerate sue volatile temperament unable stay offer relief . izzy ( michael silverman ) active child while his brother sam ( jonah bobo ) sister amy ( chelsea harkins ) seem not mind confined their apartment , watching tv their disabled father . sue best friend ruth ( audra mcdonald ) her only contact sanity this household not only drains her time when she not working support family , but presents her husband who nearly vegetative her child izzy who needs 24 hour monitoring ! izzy cannot resign himself bleak future what his home represents so spends his time braking into people apartments just relief it , doing little damage but breaking entering purpose showing absent owners he some degree power over them . times he takes his best friend robbie ( jelani jeffries ) order proof rapster kids street he powerful . once his reputation established he taunts colleagues some ventures ends up purse snatching crime spree . one point izzy , friends tow witnesses , breaks into apartment he thinks deserted only discovered young couple who throes sex . couple listens izzy pleas mercy stories why he there , yet izzy taken police station where his mother comes obtain his release . izzy promises change sue desperation , only supported her friend ruth , comes close breakdown seemingly insurmountable obstacles her life . just when izzy finally makes some verbal contact his father , further realizing his hopeless future , he goes break-in outing starts fire his own building . this creates momentum finale story , one which little said words but much resolved eye contact body language : ending must saved impact it holds . mary-louise parker once again shows her ability create characters who not only touch but grab our hearts . michael silverman fine little child actor ( bobo , hawkins , jeffries ) manages keep his character within bounds credibility - no mean trick role it written . supporting cast likewise top caliber . only criticism sound system : kids doing rap even just ' talking talk ' simply unintelligible , so much izzy interaction his ' gang ' lost messy mixing . best thief world solid piece work , not easy watch because content , but very powerful little drama represents only drop ink megapolis new york ( read world ) . grady harp , april 05	1
unfortunately this happens time time again : mexican filmmakers hook you interesting premise , but then they don ; know where go it . acting good ( federico luppi , argeninian mel gibson he takes severe beating every one his films ) , but we reach end film , we left hanging without conclusion . art ? no ; fart . rent it if you feel like wasting few hours	-1
we should start making one thing clear : films zalman king no basis reality whatsoever ; they're erotic fantasies , pure simple . how else explain his casting choices leading roles his films : carrie otis , sherilyn fenn , david duchovony , richard tyson , bridgette bako , etc . people real life seldom sex appeal above-mentioned names . then there stories cloak these fine specimens , which almost always involve young innocent woman led down road sexual discovery , usually domineering though charming man , who she secretly lusted after sometime . what king films lack dramatic verve , they make up hitting their intended target : your libido . critics pounced like never before his feature film adaptation anais ninn erotic classic , ' delta venus . ' but they clearly missed point , ' delta venus ' isn't so much feature film , it most epic , most visually beautiful episode king 90s showtime series , ' red shoe diaries . ' context , it succeeds its fairly modest goals . set 1940s paris , ' venus ' introduces us aspiring writer named elena ( audie england ) . what appears morning ritual , she rushes banks sienne bitter january cold , muted urgency , one thing : watch handsome lawrence ( costas mandylor) -- man she yet meet --- row through foggy river . it isn't too long before she meets lawrence party thrown her agent , marcel ( eric da silva ) , discovers lawrence also writer , thriving , if controversial career . he , fact , leave france american tour support his latest effort --- but not before whirlwind affair elena , which far more profound effect her than she could ever imagined . lawrence gone , no money , no luck getting her stories published , elena crew friends --- artist , singer , their same-sex lovers --- suggest elena model nude cash . but marcel got more lucrative idea : she could write explict sex stories nameless collector erotica , who'll pay her handsomely it . ulitmately , elena accepts both offers , when collector , through marcel , insists graphic realism her stories , she ups ante her own sex life , fullfilling her desperate " desire plunge into living " " capable many loves . " audie england performance elena unfairly panned . she isn't great actress , but she just right mix doe-eyed innocence , restless intelligence , raw sensuality bubbling just beneath surface make her believeable . her initial scenes mandylor mildly touching , we see her teeter school-girl crush burning womanly desire . if nothing else , she least marked improvement over woozy carrie otis ' wild orchid . ' take how you may . costas mandylor really isn't this movie much , but he makes most what there . two chemistry , without which ' delta venus ' would really terrible critics said . granted , king doesn't always hit mark ' delta'--a sequence set party st. tropez particularly irritating his reach themes seem overextend his grasp . there definitely points which dialogue seem strain capture nin prose . critics also complained this film simply doesn't reflect reality life 1940s france . ( ugh . ) but counter , go back top this review read first sentence again . you really expecting zalman king give you blow-by-blow hitler invasion france ? if you're going this simply watch interesting love story -- turned beautiful cinematography , gorgeous actors , atmospheric lushness -- you not disappointed . fans tv show ' lost ' fans get kick out cameo made adewale akinnoyue-agbaje mysterious clairvoyant who gives ... special reading redheaded prostitute	1

those turning this film answer all questions last two episodes evangelion ( nge ) series didn't answer , i suggest you look elsewhere . if anything , this film provide you precious few answers but multitude new questions . those wanting highly provocative , thought-provoking , intelligent most poignant conclusion nge series , then no fear . i try explain some more perplexing elements this film , without giving too much away , well giving my thoughts opinions same time . film structured final two episodes series . so first half , ep . 25 " air/love destructive " concurrent series episode 25 " world ending/do you love me ? " . second half , ep . 26 . " my purest heart you/one more final : i need you " concurrent series episode 26 " beast shouted love heart world/take care yourself . " much like nge series , end evangelion ( eoe ) weaves complex story where images dialogue closely related philosophy symbolism . these themes played out through psychology each characters ' own mind . it essentially microcosm entire series . opening scenes before " air " title card ep . 25 shinji overlooking ruins city , then entering asuka hospital room , ( i'll leave it there ) set mood atmosphere . showing effectively very disturbingly this not going easy film . first half roars out gates breakneck speed , we see hostile takeover nerv seele organization each nerv member desperate attempt hold it bay . we also see mental states two main eva pilots - shinji asuka - reduced too . shinji severely depressed after killing last angel , kaworu , whom he formed close bond . asuka same mental boat shinji she sits bottom lake her eva , which she feels she can't pilot anymore . what interesting paths driven these two characters this point . ideas finding one self-worth ( examined perfectly final two series episodes ) , what happens person when taken away . same time seele trying initiate their plans third impact using unit-01 downright creepy looking mass-produced eva series , gendo his own plans involving rei lilith . asuka , ( little help inspiration her mama ) rages extremely violent battle evil evas , gendo takes rei down lilith . he this unite souls bodies adam lilith only find his scorned lover , ritsuko there . it interesting two most shocking violent scenes ( asuka/eva battle gendo/ritsuko confrontation ) played out bach beautiful " air " . infusion music this film truly brilliant major reason why many scenes so effective . however , this point film where most people start become completely lost . without really good understanding nge story ( perhaps even one ) , it hard not . it very difficult make extremely complex simple , however i'll try without many spoilers . suffice it say seele trying initiate third impact reduce humankind back its original form - primordial soup life where all souls beings one . gendo different plans just wanted see his ' dead ' wife , yui again . neither seele or gendo plans go exactly they meant . unit-01 , shinji , ends up becoming tree life , ark which all souls ushered through into lilith egg . understanding idea nge , humans - lilim , we're called - born lilith , rei essentially lilith helps make this clearer . what happening near this point 3rd impact occurring because unit-01 mass produced eva encounter . this returns geo-front ( sphere like cavern where nerv hq sits ) its original form , egg lilith ( we see this during " eye " -like explosion ) . after giant rei/lilith forms , shinji essentially given reign over future human race rei/lilith herself . this point , tempo film slows crawl most surreal images scenes begin creeping . even most seemingly simple scenes such young shinji playing sandbox swing , mountains , setting sun background just rife symbolism ( hint : try relate everything this scene something show , it scenes , characters , or themes ) . here , psychological interplay main characters crucial , shinji wishes played out real world . when he feels everyone deserted him essentially says ' everyone just die ' when instrumentality joining all souls through lilith really begins . what important note shinji thoughts after his ' choice ' made . place he escapes - world instrumentality where all souls one - his questioning this choice all his choices what we see here . more than just his questioning choice , we also hear him questioning meaning reality dreams . this not just random philosophical ramblings . it study character , well creator , thoughts feelings . shinji holds all humanity future his hands or , more accurately , his own mind . when you consider how psychologically scarred shinji , idea he completely shape future earth all humankind what makes this so interesting . once he allowed world he escapes , he faced choice whether stay or come back . he discusses these things rei kaworu ( lilith adam ) , we hear his final choice reasons why . ending eoe , titled " one more final : i need you " rightfully confusing almost everyone who sees it . however , it also perfect note end series . not only it leave us uncertain characters future , but it also expresses frustration realization shinji choice culmination all struggles lead them there . this film simply divine marvel . much like series it watched multiple times one uncover all its hidden layers meanings . but it doesn't lose its ability invoke emotions thoughts even after several viewings . there scenes immense power drama film - many match best most films i've seen . but i think it quiet moments make this film so moving memorable . sandbox scene one i've mentioned . live action shots monologue bach magnificent " jesus bleibet meine freude " ( jesus , joy man desiring ) playing piano it . even more subtle moments , such shinji sdat ( walkman type ) player out batteries ( more significant than many would think ) , gendo broken glasses rei place . vivid beginning instrumentality played out appropriate sad-song-with-a-pop-beat " komm susser tod " ( come sweet death ) , it these scenes never fail give me chills . there great quote goes something like " truly wise man always more questions than answers . " this series film asks more questions than it provides answers . what it tries make you think those questions , rather than provide easily digestible story . some may call story incoherent disjointed , but what many don't realize deep psychological philosophical leanings behind show inextricably linked storyline itself . so distinguish one other impossible without realizing how two intertwine effect other . if you merely try breakdown sci-fi storyline , then you confused much it . this because story so big so encompassing many finer details can't uncovered without diving deep into inner workings series . end , i only speak myself when i say nge superlative job doing everything great work art should . it made me laugh , it made me cry , it gave me chills more than one occasion .... but most all it made me think . anyone who wants enjoy this show just meaningless work science fiction so , but baffled they're crushed multiple layers extra contextual meanings . so , if you want understand nge , you not only pay close attention small details within show ( small scenes many episodes back play role film ) , you really open your mind up ideas presented , how they effect story . however , taken film , conclusion nge series , end evangelion staggering achievement powerful last testament what , my opinion , greatest visual series all time . * dvd notes : those considering whether buy just eoe or eoe/death rebirth 2-pack , i suggest you go eoe unless you don't own director cuts last several episodes ( available platinum collection ) . ' death ' mostly muddled re-crap entire series , while ' rebirth ' merely first 30 minutes eoe . death also doesn't contain remastered visuals or audio like platinum collection , so you'll getting low quality re-cap . death really doesn't even work introduction nge , because most everyone not aquainted previous episodes would confused structure recap . only thing worthwile ' death ' something called " magi archives " which provides great information key people , places , events , thing series . this very helpful those who feel completely lost all jargon series help clear some things up , even if it won't answer any bigger questions . so just stick eoe unless you feel need completeness get death rebirth well	1

first off , julia roberts me actress who become more beautiful age even this day . said , i anxious see this movie because her cameron diaz . i seen my best friend wedding three times i must admit i viewed it differently each time i've seen it . what i mean this i never really able decide which woman groom should end up ; his bride-to-be or his best friend . granted , julia every rotten thing she this film break up her best friend wedding so viewpoint i favored him ending up cameron . other hand one reviewer put it , julia her best friend more chemistry than groom his bride-to-be so viewpoint i also favored him ending up julia . during film , there times when i rooted julia get her man despite her despicable efforts win him over yet other times i wanted cameron end up groom . this movie still entertains me even after knowing outcome . aside simple plot breaking up wedding , this film good humor , good acting , decent soundtrack , overall believable chick flick most part . even guys like myself should find it entertaining i am normally picky when it comes chick flicks . special edition dvd worth picking up if you haven't seen features . one featurettes shows original alternative ending which much different how film originally ended . which two endings better ? only viewer decide . me , i'm not telling . anyway , bonus features overall good plentiful . only problem camera focus one featurettes somewhat off distorts picture bit . nothing too serious but very noticable . i suppose sequel this movie would interesting but then who knows how well it would turn out	1

i loved natural when it came out 1984 . mythical quality story , terrific acting perfect cast , great editing , great direction made this film one my all time favorite sports movies . so this year new dvd version released called director cut . apparently there 20 minutes new footage added , but editing results film only 6 minutes longer than original . chief difference two versions backstory relayed primarily through flashback " present " , roy hobbs returns his childhood home after 16 years away . he retrieves " wonder boy " , then goes new york start his career ny knights . new version works okay , but i frankly preferred original . i preferred its slightly more deliberate pacing , i don't think new scenes ( primarily extended versions already existing scenes ) added any real value or perspective . indeed , one scene which memo travels meet roy road actually detracted cohesion story . bottom line : if you loved original , you'll like this one . it still basically same film . i just don't think it needed any tinkering	1

wiktor grodecki brave filmmaker , one who unafraid address controversial subject , yet one who able make powerful sociologic statement creating metaphorical art film demands respect . grodecki interviews young boys ( ages 14 - 17 ) who male hustlers prague : he wisely removes ( most part ) interviewer questions allowing individual boys make spontaneous , searing comments . these young lads discuss why they became male prostitutes , how they deal selling their bodies , where they find their business ( train station , swimming pools , etc ) , how they feel johns their fellow hustlers , manner which they business including way which financial aspects come play - all way burns faces these young lads into our psyches . half way through this film grodecki introduces pavel rousek , man who day pathologist performing autopsies prague morgue his off hours ( using pseudonym hans miller ) creates , casts directs gay porno videos his home . rousek shown autopsy table gowning , gloving , grotesquely performing autopsy real cadaver while discussing both professions . there moments while he gloving he explains why he doesn't allow his boys wear condoms ( buyers his videos don't want see condoms ) , contrast his self protection vs enforcement prevention sexual protection his actors devastating . rousek miller then shown filming boys his home , explaining details achieving visual effects pornography : simultaneously we again hear boys views aspect their ' careers ' , creating pitiful tension . there almost no total nudity this film when it occur lighting so dark obscure it - making overall effect even more dense effectively tense . under all this lurid talk grodecki uses classical music - albinoni , mahler , mozart - which again provides contradiction makes topic digestible . final question grodecki poses his subjects involves boys perception ' soul ' while there variety responses , overall message these lads sell their bodies career , but soul ' what you think ' , something cannot taken you . several these boys screen presence faces , they noticed regular film makers , would probably give them legitimate careers . but power film comes words these boys , knowing completely their choice life , therein lies sorrow . this tough but very fine piece filmmaking . interestingly , grodecki absorbed this material used it create his subsequent feature film mandragora ( reviewed under title ) . this film more powerful two . not movie everyone , but certainly important document way life few know fewer understand . grady harp , september 05	1
umberto lenzis eaten alive my opinion way better than cannibal ferox . film so cheesy its hillarious . charectors , especially main male charector , funny watch . mane male charector slaps female role every 5 minutes so she calms down or so she dosnt give up their hiding place . worst thing film there 4 or 5 scenes different cannibal movies including lenzis man deep river . there also scenes lungle holocaust mountain cannibal god , i dont mean minor scenes , i mean big scenes , mostly gore scenes . scenes actually shot film some gory moments including decapitation , ear cut off cannibalization scene breast cut off . throw some brutal rape scenes topless me me lai you yourself pretty decent exploitation flick	1

all his other films , tarkovsky true author stalker . this film loosely based arkady boris strugatsky road side picnic , tarkovsky tried , he solaris ( 1972 ) , downplay science fiction aspect stalker . except brief explanation beginning film , tarkovsky chooses ignore speculations what could created zone , changes within it . he changed strugastsky brother characters events almost unrecognizably , he previously characters events lem solaris , he shifted philosophical implications story more pleasant direction . nevertheless , many original details novel remain . stalker definitely science fiction film , but its style unlike pulp high-tech films , such star wars trilogy ( 1977 - 1983 ) . it very demanding sometimes inaccessible viewing experience . this magnificent film almost not see light day . exteriors shot ( some three half months tallinn , estonia , beginning may 1977 , tarkovsky encountered number problems , starting some serious disagreements key members his crew , but mostly bad processing apparently out-of-date film stock . these events led serious financial problem , which somehow , almost miraculously , got resolved . eventually , june 1978 , second shooting tallinn took place , interiors shot moscow , premiere took place may , 1979 , total official disapproval . film met some recognition ussr , toward 1981 , following its success cannes festival 1980 , where it awarded prize ecumenical jury . stalker , tarkovsky marks shift toward his later style , long takes throughout film averaging one minute length , many which four minutes or longer . scene " telephone room " lasts almost seven minutes . these long scenes turn rely heavily talent actors sustain mood , like writer long monologue sand mogul room . even succession single shots , director wants give impression long take , such ride into zone flatbed car , which lasts three half minutes actually consists five shots . stalker , tarkovsky definitely more systematic his use black-and-white ( sepia ) color stocks than he his previous works . sickly black-and-sepia reserved polluted sterile reality world future , while color represents escape this world provided zone . swamp scene " stalker "' dream , tarkovsky reverts more usual convention , where dreams shown black-and-sepia-tones , reality color . however , last scene color , implying leakage powers zone into outside reality . always tarkovsky films , natural world present . water , which used source life , redemptive force center regeneration , now mostly symbol decay pollution . often , men wade through stagnant water , when clear water flows , it flows over rusting , decaying remnants props civilization : coins , weapons , religious images , hypodermic needles . only exception dream scene swamp , where water somewhat restored its positive , life-affirming symbols . last scene zone , men , resigned their limitations weakness , sit outside room rain falls inside , gently blocking them entering . wind , often associated spiritual aspects life , ominously rises when writer walks directly toward room , he told stop . earth positive force , upon arriving zone , " stalker "' first act lie down embrace it , swamp , all three men lie upon it . like miracle , there luxuriant , if dangerous , nature ever-present zone , contrast polluted outside world , where it totally absent . birds part this nature : call cuckoo bird heard numerous times zone . there also mysterious dog , which first appears swamp scene , when all three men lying down , becoming intimately close earth . up this point , men felt totally alienated their environment , outside inside zone , it very moment when they start meditate remember , dog appears : zone its territory . but end film , dog followed " stalker " outside zone , showing even there , hope men looking inside zone must somehow also exist here , outside , dog establishes its own space even though he becomes domesticated process . although tarkovsky usually favors classics such composers bach , pergolesi , or purcell , musical score stalker consists almost exclusively eduard artemiev electronic music mixed some folk melodies , contributing efficiently eerie atmosphere film . there also few distorted musical fragments wagner , ravel , beethoven . two tarkovsky favorite actors nikolia grinko anatoly solonitsyn . they appear five ( grinko ) four ( solonitsyn ) tarkovsky russian films , including stalker . their performances two lost souls search answer convincing . aleksandr kajdanovsky outstanding his role tormented somewhat pathetic " stalker " . although alisa frejndlikh appearance film restricted only few scenes , she powerful presence , especially her monologue end film . stalker , tarkovsky juxtaposes world decline , polluted sterile , verdant zone , which overtaken all human enterprises , shown remnants rusting cars tanks , dilapidated buildings , which taken over luxuriant vegetation . he portrays society which severed all links nature , its own past , , result , lost its spiritual moral bearings . stalker explores conflict science , rationalism , materialism , cynicism versus spirituality , faith , art , love . three men embody different philosophical principles . beginning film , professor justifies his going into zone pure scientific curiosity , probably also reassure himself room so-called " miracles " , if they ever happened , examined through scientific method explained logical , reasonable way . professor rational who tries understand world according law physics . however , when he arrives room , professor divulges his ulterior motive , which destroy it bomb he carrying all his knapsack . doing so , he would remove incentive people visit room irrational hopes , because " this place obviously won't bring anybody happiness . " blowing up room , professor stop gangsters , tyrants , megalomaniacs , all " self-appointed benefactors human race " misusing room power . but his main reason blow up room he not understand it . writer belongs those people who cannot accept world it . he well aware humanity decay his own well , but he abhors science , which he not understand , would rather look answers supernatural . writer believes redemptive power art , but he lost his inspiration . he would like believe potential room restore it , but because his cynicism self-loathing , he cannot sure . he lost faith himself his writing capacity help other people . besides , he hates writing , which him torture . " stalker " alone showing inclination toward faith , his comments regarding nature his prayer his companions " become helpless like children . " " stalker " knows zone , he total faith zone . he speaks it if it living . " stalker " simultaneously respects fears zone , he recognizes its potential provide comfort wretched ones who , like himself , lost all hope , but same time it punishes whoever transgresses its rules . this , course , how most religious people see their own gods . film contains many christian images biblical references , but it would mistake take them christian context : they stand general framework faith spirituality . redemptive power love personified " stalker "' wife . her love devotion final miracle which opposes cynicism emptiness modern world . all these ideas clearly expressed film end , she addresses audience her heartfelt monologue , while same time asking her husband remember love she feels him . three characters reach room , they ask their dearest wishes granted , but this would require painful searching self-examination , realization what they thought they wanted not exactly what they now really want . " you dream one thing but you get quite , " observes writer . film began question , " three men enter room ? " it ends , " why won't three men enter room ? " professor true aim destroy room , which beyond his scientific understanding . now he forced consider there may mystery his cartesian mind cannot account . he shows some humility acknowledges it not up him save humanity itself . writer said purpose his journey regain his genius , his inspiration . however , threshold room , he realizes he may not worthy accepting room gift . while he previously expressed his unworthiness , he now first time truly feels it . result their journey , both men changed -- some would say better -- although they not enter room , they nevertheless receive its gifts , something quite different than what they expected . " stalker " , however , asks nothing room because he stalker , stalkers not enter room . however , " stalker " faith zone , not need reassurances . he touch his " self , " aware his own wretchedness , his only purpose making trip guide faith hope those more wretched than he . musical fragments beethoven " ode joy , " last sequence , struggling heard over rumble passing train , imply society decay unsettled nature film resolution . this ending film typically tarkovskian , so far it open-ended , deliberately ambiguous , leaving viewer create his or her own meaning film .	1

this my first exposure penn teller wit , it wild - like sticking your head out car window into tornado . pennteller use humor , righteous outrage sarcasm attack some truly soft-headed people whose ideas continue pulsate national psyche . whether they 9/11 conspiracy nuts , people who see jesus their bathroom door or supposedly-scientific ghost trackers , pt go after them mercilessly called them out charlatans , frauds or fools . actually , they don't this exactly , since they'd trouble slander police . order demolish reputations those they dislike , they call them ( loudly ) * ssh*oles f*ck*rs . if this kind vituperative name-calling not your cup tea , least you warned . i like work pt . there far too many people making buck expense truth . whether you're peddling book claiming moon landing hoax , or selling tickets dallas , texas jfk conspiracy museum , or ( dalai lama ) trying get support re-establish priestly autocracy , you idiot or scammer deserve pt come after you hammer tong . some criticize pt using same techniques their targets use . i more bothered pt attacks humble people genuine faith . poor woman who sees jesus eyes her bathroom door may wrong , but least she doesn't appear profiting monetarily . that unlike woman who found image virgin mary her grilled cheese sandwich , who made few bucks when she sold sandwich casino . audrey santo family may faking " oils " drip statues their brain-damaged daughters ' room , but they living real family tragedy deserve some measure restraint . pt use these examples unfairly attack religion whole . they spout atheism if they want , but they could less abusive those genuine faith . who say god * doesn't * speak through sandwiches , bathroom doors tacos ? he limited whirlwinds burning bushes ? said , bs season 3 fun challenging . even when pt go over top , they provide plenty ponder	1

i first saw this drive-in my family when it released ; it billed second double feature ( remember them ? ) tell you truth , my memory main attraction -- probably something disney , given my age -- escaped me years . i immediately loved this film , however , seen it many times since tv . i finally bit bullet bought it dvd when it turned up really cheap amazon . not unsurprisingly , technicolor print stunning ( it looks better than any print quiet man -- which won oscar its technicolor cinematography--i've ever seen ); surprisingly , so trailer , which comprises only extra . there french english mono tracks addition dolby digital track , optional english subtitles . cheesy menus only interactive menus few options , there no hard-copy insert ( immediate minus my book ) , hence my one-star demerit . it could worse -- least it anamorphic , its list price accurately reflects paramount budget treatmen t.t he film itself delightful ; it one john ford last , complete joy ( i especially got kick out his using dorothy lamour south seas role ... second time 26 years , first hurricane ) . i second previous reviewer , however , noting there seem some gaps continuity , especially end . jack warden elizabeth allen , least , still around time this released dvd -- might it not nice commentary ? this wasn't one ford major works , but i can't imagine most fans wouldn't like hear what it like work him , not mention lee marvin immortal duke . alas . romance male bonding island paradise--what not like ? " pappy " gave us helluva good romp days before political correctness ( i'm still wondering how " oriental " came pejorative ) that not without poignancy , if it doesn't make you want beg , borrow , or steal fare polynesia asap , i respectfully submit you're probably somehow deficient	1

unlike probably most " john malkovich " fans , i actually saw later kaufman-jonze collaboration " adaptation " first . i thought , think , movie brilliant , but i little disappointed " john malkovich " first time i saw it . it very good , yes , but i hoping bit more , since most reviewers seem think it good or better than later film . well , yesterday i got through watching " john malkovich " third time , 2 years after i first saw it , it grown me quite bit . i still don't think it quite good " adaptation " , but it pretty close . " john malkovich " one those movies seems take place real world , except there bunch odd details aren't right . ex : puppeteering major artform ; everyone world total oddball ; there building 7 1/2 floor which contains portal into john malkovich brain . this movie so massively yet still so unobtrusively weird i'm sure it requires very specific taste fully get into it . you definitely need taste odd . story centers around craig schwartz , ( john cusack ) failed street-puppeteer who lives depression his strange but good-natured wife lotte ( cameron diaz ) their 100 or so pets . lotte suggests craig get job , real job , he so , becoming filing clerk small business 7 1/2 floor large office building . ( ceiling all 4 1/2 feet high , they emergency-stop elevator get floor . ) craig immediately smitten fellow 7 1/2 floor-dweller maxine ( catherine keener ) . maxine cruel cold-hearted individual , but craig can't help himself continues pursue her spite her utter contempt him . his efforts appear going nowhere until one day when he finds small door hidden behind filing cabinet . he crawls it discover this portal into john malkovich brain , where you watch what malkovich sees 15 minutes , after which you dumped ditch road then things really get weird , craig uses this portal way connect maxine , but lotte others get drawn malkovich finds out what going we learn real purpose portal . i don't want go , cause inexplicable , labyrinthine plot much appeal film . ( though it isn't just crazy crazy sake , actually comes together well . ) beyond this , kaufman tons clever , intelligent dialogue support wacky plo t.t his movie damn hard review , cause it so strange , yet much appeal humor character-driven . unbelievable , oddball characters all interesting , usually funny often endearing . cusack our main character sort straight man film . still , he not quite normal -- he , after all , want famous puppeteer . he typical " tortured artist " scruffy beard ponytail , but you can't help but like him . he just so hapless , john cusack always average man thing well . orson bean great dr. lester , craig boss 125 year old lech . ( craig says , " it pretty funny once you get past how disgusting it . ) catherine keener fantastic maxine , one most black-hearted characters i've ever seen . yeah , she doesn't physically hurt anyway , but her relentless verbal abuse unbelievable , she responds anything craig says her vicious , personal barb . finally , john malkovich wonderful himself ( sort ) , he hits great range notes isn't afraid make himself look bad . ( no one half brain would think this really anything who malkovich really , but lotsa people don't half brain ... ) though " john malkovich " comedy , it rather thoughtful ultimately very sad one . it touches themes isolation , desire someone else ultimate absurdity uncontrollability human life . this absurdity encapsulated central conflict , craig unrequited love maxine ; there no reason why he should love her , she , craig himself says , evil , but he can't help himself ; man capable reason , but emotion rules us emotion only sporadically makes sense . ( applying reason emotion never helps , not my experience , anyway . ) though i can't help but see kaufman primary author film , jonze deserves ton credit bringing vision fruition . making film this wacky seem real must damn near impossible , but jonze pulls it off aplomb spectacular technical proficiency . film moves near conventional scenes first-person perspective , dream sequences flat out surrealism . yet , all technique displayed film , it rarely seems extraneous . jonze doesn't seem showing off , flash all just necessary navigate inexplicable plot . score also fantastic , truly beautiful often-moving , it allows lot emotional impact film , particularly brilliantly conceived heartbreaking final scene . man , this review no good , but you can't justice movie this good this odd review . you'll just watch it . grade :	1
if you've never seen blob theatre , you're missing something ... color crisp photography great counterpoint steve mcqueen dedicated , earnest performance thankless role ,... remarkable effects . years , i mean years , no one knew how effects . it added charm film ... gelatinous mass creeps , rolls , wavers , oozes its way through effects scenes . well , numerous production photos included this criterion collection release finally explain technical innovation which brought blob life . photos alone worth half retail price . okay , okay , enough technical geek celebration . story unfolds pretty swiftly , landing meteorite , hapless old guy who pokes stick where it doesn't belong , doctor office ,.... despite campy subject , there some very serious scares this film , suspense hysteria grow thrilling climax . pop popcorn , dim lights , get ready opening featuring hilarious theme song , early work burt bacharach . what blob outer space ? who knows ... but b-l-o-b spells fun . enjoy	1

so it falls me review this first ? this june 1977 concert london rainbow theater captures recently reconfigured wailers ending european tour promote masterful ' exodus ' album . rare videotaped performances ' trenchtown rock ' ' rebel music ' , ' crazy baldhead ' , dating earlier wailers repertoire , performed wonderfully well here , treasures this collection , however . missed notes some songs , including beginning ' exodus ' , guitarist junior marvin failure notice his boss bob start singing ' lively up yourself ' , minor annoyances , loss aston barrett famous distinctive bass line ' no more trouble ' , jettisoned favor ' new ' , harder sound ( surely reaction exciting energy london ' new wave ' summer 1977 ) . way , it always annoyed me front cover picture vhs now dvd editions most definitely not this 1977 show , but rather same photo graces 1975 live lyceum album . i wish those responsible would show some responsibility well some historical accuracy . dvd sound picture good , considering age videotape source . now if they would only release 1980 dortmund , germany performance dvd . accompanying dvd ' carribbean nights ' informative enjoyable , provides good look marley life times . while it contains no full-length performances , it contain several exciting if brief film clips various performances such leeds , uk 1973 show peter tosh . hopefully these early performances someday make it onto dvd well .	1
una historia veridica llevada al cine magistralmente . todos los actores realizan unas actuaciones tan maravillosas que en realidad uno cree estar viviendo en el 1848 ... imanol arias ( ladislao gutierrez ) transmite tanta pasion , amor deseos prohibidos que es comprensible el por que camila , sacrifica todo por el . aparte de ser un actor increiblemente guapo , se adentra tanto en su personaje , que te hace llorar , amar , rezar sufrir con el . mi escena favorita es cuando camila le confiesa su amor le dice que se esta muriendo de amor , el le dice que eso es natural su edad , como queriendo ignorar que es de el que ella esta hablando . su amor ya en ese momento es mutuo el enferma de amor . lucha entre su amor por dios su amor por ella . definitivamente una pelicula que merece la pena ver , maravillosamente actuada , con unos efectos de luces tenuesque le dan un toque de romanticismo , una musica fabulosa , unos dialogos en susurros entre los enamorados llenos de pasion , la lucha carnal entre el amor humano el amor dios yun tragico final . mi pelicula favorita se la recomiendo todos ...	1
when i saw this dvd video store , i knew i would rent it , i thing mountains , despite feeling it would not very good movie . well , my expectations met . movie , although mildly enjoyable times its mountain views , pretty much stinker . it definitely not keeper . plot simple . scientific data indicates particular mountain urals eastern europe going undergo massive avalanche bring down half snow mountain onto ski resort . course , person who brings this information village mayor met derision . no one wants believe her . like john baptist , she voice crying alone wilderness . meanwhile , two mountain bad boys , brothers who run snowmobile tours mountains , their own troubles . younger one bad break-up resort owner daughter . other one his hands full keeping his wilder , younger brother check . resort owner daughter her own issues , her father his business partner . when inevitable happens disaster strikes , let games begin . over all , special effects repetitive , which expected , given fact this obviously low budget film . plot loosey-goosey , number silly sub-plots nowhere , script just plain bad . directing laughable ham-handed . acting , most part , dreadful , exception resort owner , who gives evidence some acting ability . no one this film should give up their day job just yet . bottom line viewers should take pass this film , unless , like me , you sucker mountains or disaster films . even then , viewers should proceed their own risk .	-1

what heck taking this series so damn long reach dvd nice box set , it one most treasured series among " gi joe/transformers/thundercats " generations , yet amazingly well , well written , well animated , it , there never toy line , or serious merchandising there could`ve ( even adult , i`d still love set dd action figures main characters ) ... but there dvds every other cartoon series this generation except this one ( well amazingly well " legend prince valiant " , which also deserves box set dvds ... easily ... ) simply inexcusable ...!!!! what shocks me actually , producer this series marvel entertainment , who well known whore-out just everything every little penny they get , so it actually comes quite bit shock indeed ... what they waiting ? haven`t they seen popularity every other dvd set so far best saturday morning shows sales no-brainer look sales " battle planets , land lost , gi joe , thundercats , transformers , etc etc etc ... ) . c`mon guys , wake up smell money .... i`ll first line ... i saw actual boxed set record store other day " complete series " , but it made " outside usa dvd players " ... it looked like professional release , not cheap bootleg , so i really pissed ... i want box set good `ol usa ... anybody else any thoughts	1

ah , those bygone days when british studios like ealing shepperton churned out little classics like this regular basis . stalwarts era all here , including wilfred hyde-white , bernard cribbins , course , sellers . those who know sellers his later , american period find this character little unusual ; he more sharp tough guy who runs operation than he bumbling fool he later perfected . plot simple ; sellers co . want break out prison , commit heist , then break back into prison so they perfect alibi . it all sounds quite masterful but , course , things go terribly awry . fans sellers and/or golden era british comedy , this definitely one check out	1

like other reviewers , i think sequel better than original . one only hopes 3rd installment issued even better footage than first two , especially if more 35mm films found . color adds lot drama presentation , mixing horror war death camps pompous nazi celebrations . seeing these period films , it hard believe nazis members human race . nowadays , top college football players drafted national football league take test basic intelligence , wonderlic test . score 30 , out possible 50 , considered good score . hitler other top nazis would lucky score 10 this test , because they simply couldn't count . what else could possibly explain attacking russia declaring war america ? same time , leaving great britain unconquered , available later western front . nazis outnumbered no chance win , long run . all their self-proclaimed superiority , these guys simply not smart . thing strikes me , especially seeing atomic bombs exploding over japan , how incredibly lucky germans . hitler launched his last western counteroffensive december , 1944 . this " battle bulge , " american terms . if he succeeded , world war ii could stretched out 3 months or more . if happened , atomic bombs may probably would used nazi germany . thank heaven didn't happen but it could . excellent dvd like this one should make us all appreciate what we today , despite current happenings middle east elsewhere . there lot kindness decency seen around us , things short supply 60-70 years ago . 1940-45 , world stood brink total destruction we found way out . let hope believe good triumph over evil again	1
okay , i admit it ; linda abba schmuck . after 30 years , they still getting massive airplay all over world , lot people who would never admitted they into this group years ago now acknowledging what we collectively always knew : most everyone loves abba , except some us never admit it . that okay , though , because i went through my later teens up until my late 30 . all you closet fans out there , this dvd great purchase , because you finally realize it not these four incredibly talented people fault they chemistry public reacted . even their manager stig andersson , who propelled them fame , doesn't know why they took off way they . let me ask all you naysayers all-important question : if this group so disposable , how it their music still so popular after 3 decades , they not only enjoyed revival , but music made great stage production ? it true : benny andersson bjorn ulveus very good songwriters their sesibilities them all times . agnetha faltskog anni-frid lyngstad , their former wives partners , beautiful vocalists together , what they them something very special while it lasted . also , they never reunion since their breakup 1982 , they don't intend . heartless hit machine rep they've suffered not only joke , but this dvd show you just how human talented they really . one thing i struck this particular dvd how warm , intelligent , humble bjorn ulveus , how much more likable full life frida , rather than pretty blond pinup girl agnetha , actually . this dvd full lots surprises naysayers lots treats those us who knew these swedes talented , personable beings who simply disliked touring all reasons anyone who never toured could understand . interviews fun , footage priceless , music rich melodious . most all , you pull this dvd out your player smile your face realize you never dress like you any time group together again ! this 90 minutes pure , poppy fun .	1
what fast turning out one biggest years ever cinematic retreads ( doesn`t anybody out hollywood any new ideas anymore ? ) , " longest yard " second remake robert aldrich film hit theaters past six months . first , " flight phoenix , " released last december . now all we ask , " new improved " version " whatever happened baby jane ?, " starring jane fonda sissy spacek , far behind ?. this new edition `70`s hit , adam sandler plays paul crewe , ex-quarterback pittsburgh steelers who banished league six years earlier allegedly shaving points off game . when he arrested stealing his girlfriend car , crewe sent texas prison run diabolical warden his cadre sadistic guards . warden , football fan way back , enlists crewe expertise putting together team convicts take guards " friendly little game " intramural football . caveat this ragtag team must good enough make decent show things but not good enough beat their opponent or there hell pay . thus , game becomes inverted , high stakes encounter pitting forces good ( prisoners ) against forces evil ( penal authorities ) . thirty years elapsed since i saw original version this film , so i don't feel particularly qualified evaluate how this new one stacks up against old . i say , however , this " yard " faces some serious problems get-go casting sandler lead role . burt reynolds , who played protagonist original film who gets fairly good-sized role this one well , least credible man who might professional football player . but adam sandler !? come think it , sandler probably more believable nfl legend than he hot underwear spokes-model , absurdity we also asked swallow - but less said better . there isn't much recommend this latest edition " longest yard . " plotting predictable , characters mere two-dimensional stereotypes humor obvious lowbrow . final showdown - i.e. big game - goes so long most tension inherent material simply drains away long before closing credits . perhaps saddest aspect this movie watching cloris leachman making complete utter fool herself playing grotesque , beehive-coiffured sex maniac obsessed seducing young mr. crewe . some sights we should just not asked face this lifetime .	-1

kaufman adaptation michael crichton japan-bashing potboiler realtively light approach , simple buddy-cop movie featuring pair entertaining star performances . spite fact novel alarmism dangers dominant japan would soon undercovered mellow script confers much more importance opposite views eastern western worlds around lot issues , director muted xenophobic material made book so terrific brutal , transforming it into interesting film , whose plot nourished great visual effects stunning differences both cultures , sean connery working out common link two ways life great doses suggested violence alarming use technology create unexpeceted accusations . yet sean connery makes very credible performance , detective , script seems uncapable surmount anecdothic character good guys bad guys , ominous presence japanese mob pretensions noir film , picture leaves us bitter taste , because even if there good sequences , whole material promised best best major intentions .	1

i still don't understand love crash , recent film centering racism issue . it seemed like film couple good ideas but they featured bad movie which makes its win best picture all more confusing . film some reason reminded me traffic which centers important issue ; this one drug war its effects addicts non-addicts . while you obviously tell traffic important film it indeed good one , it also slightly marred erratic pacing bit uninteresting characters . film , unlike let say , magnolia or short cuts , 3 separate storylines one thing common : drug trade . one story set ohio , robert wakefield newly-appointed " drug czar " crusading against decreasing amount drugs country . however , he daughter that quickly starting get addicted . san diego , helena sees her husband arrested while she unaware he key player drug trade captured dea agents who going testify . finally mexico , highway patrol cop gets involved corruption drug cartels want control drugs going out mexico us . help audience differentiate different places , color code given each segment . wakefield story looks so unbelievably blue you wouldn't surprised if character blood looked blue too . san diego looks more traditional but bit overexposed making it more brighter while mexico looks like indie movie very gritty raw feel jittery looking camera . it helps keep track where you but like i said , you've never seen skin tones look so blue before ; they really overdid it some cases . best storyline most likely mexico since it anchored benicio del toro who certainly deserved his oscar . it also got more interesting story better look it despite its intentional amateurishness . one isn't great probably wakefield story since it never gripped me all much . san diego alright but nothing special . ultimately problem film film just felt slow . ever watch one those movies where it feels like you've watching longer than movie ? not mention sometimes one storyline starting get interesting then whoosh ! off somewhere else . similar problem plagued babel since chieko story ultimately more emotional gripping than others . some probably disagree say all stories traffic good but i always groaned slightly when we moved away mexico . it certainly ambitious film so not going argue there it great film times but i wouldn't say it my favorite film 2000	1
i've skiing now nearly 10 years during this time i've many ski instructors different styles teaching but nothing compares information prodived this dvd . lito goes straight point tells you exactly what you need know early weight shift correct body position various runs easy blues serious off piste . within day or two practicing his techniques i found myself carving more arcs more control my skis . which face it , real reason we all wanted ski first place . not only am i more control but once i feel like i am progressing out intermediate rut . this dvd gives lots freeze frames easy understand instruction which you practice minute you hit slopes . i found dvd so useful i ended up buying his book well which gives you even more insight into different techniques small radius arcs mogul runs . thus i go ski holiday which i've just returned boy this book complement dvd . i'm more visual learner myself reckoned book wouldn't add any more additional information but i safely say i wrong . total running time this dvd just under 60 mins he repeat himself alot but this just proves concrete how important some core aspects his ski technique . anyway i highly recommend this dvd believe me you won't dissappointed	1
this film unlike any documentary i've ever seen before . it combines various cinematic styles -- albert maysles ' uncut , " direct cinema " approach , michael moore " guerilla documentary " approach . characters all nuanced , complex personalities , filmmakers startingly good job not passing judgment allowing us see characters who they really . rather than simplistic anti-bush doc , film meditation how media , money , politics combine reak havoc life already troubled man . i highly , highly recommend this film , not only those who interested intersection media , money , politics , but those who interested experiencing great filmmaking	1
all reviews i've read this movie , they're pretty mixed opinion . some people ranging how movie sucked how " scantly dressed " female characters ( i.e. , jill valentine alice ) ect . but really , reviews --- most part --- could not more far truth than miami dolphins lost baltimore . " resident evil : apocalypse " coolest movie late summer 2004 , only second " spider-man ii .

if you like comic antics ben stiller jack black , you'll find this winning combination . when friendship neighbors co-workers tested after one them becomes very wealthy , hilarity begins . invention leads black wealth bit silly , but inventive . my opinion , this very enjoyable comedy lots laughs . chrissy . mcvay - autho	1
some interesting dialogue sprinkled within mostly nonsensical , dull , slow plot . also , whole thing swedish hard read english subtitles . blah . film critics love this one because it gives them bizarre , convoluted material upon which ponder self-importantly . it really not worth pondering , though .	-1
it difficult review this film without including spoilers . best see it yourself . acting , one would expect , super . it " sleuth " " rope " school but better than either my opinion .	1
one those cases where everything goes wrong making movie : low budget , unispired performances ( alexis denisof particularly bad here ) , lack decent screenplay actors work upon , bad direction , despisable characters , cliched situations ... how kinski chose act this one ?	-1
maybe i loved original one too much , but this version story not work me . i especially dissapointed music oompa loompas . stick first one . it perfect	1

this film starts out so promising . it could punchy dramatic piece nature belief , legitimacy concept free . instead , characters dribble into infantile sexuality , film becomes travelog . i can't believe this film found financing ... real waste obvious talent . effect ending trivialise opening premise , hence film winds up exercise meaninglessness unpleasant aftertaste	-1
i love speilberg films , i really , but fact he good director no excuse this crap . i just not like it , its not my thing . i can't belive richard dreyfuss turned down reprising his role jaws 2 because he filming this nonsense . if you want watch it , then go ahead , we all different tastes . however , if you want see real speilberg film , watch ones like duel , jaws , et , schindler list , jurassic park , lost world : jurassic park , indiana jones trilogy	-1
well , i just got watching this movie actually went out my way write this review . truthfully , i didn't catch last 20 or so minutes because i found myself doing other things around house could care less what happend . trailers dvd cover this movie very misleading . one would think they going see something great genre horror movies zombies group people doing whatever it takes survive . i'm big fan romero movies loved 28 days later so i thought this movie would cool australian take-off . i couldn't more wrong . nothing movie makes sense start . entire movie over top starting actors . everybody entirely too much dialogue except main character who hardly says two words during entire movie . she looks lost , confused , out her league . other characters include local pilot his pregnant girlfriend , " wacky " police sgt his asthmatic partner , bait tackle clerk who never screams during entire movie , our heroin character who won local beauty contes t.t he movie takes place small town austrialia somewhere . when meteors strike earth ( slam into people ) , it unleashes germ which causes people become zombies . our main characters all meet up try survive . however , aliens involved so story goes survival story beams light dressed capes floating around right middle big battle . viewer left wonder what going first , but dialogue story become unbearably bad , you find yourself not caring minutes tick . i honestly couldn't tell you much else because it just so terrible i just simply couldn't take minute more . bad acting , bad dialogue , over top effects , some worst camera work i've ever seen . this movie apparently took two years make ... imagine if they only one ??? portion this movie makes me ill bait tackle charater . he shows up out nowhere saves heroin life like bad clint eastwood impression ( big hat covering his eyes boot ) . then , he walks away . when he appears again , he able these matrix style backflips ( digging his " spurs " into wall/ceiling ) making two pistols jump over his back land directly into his hands . this guy ever miss ? what you think ? he manages kill 50 zombies his two pistols while hanging wall upside down . not bad bait tackle salesman living backwoods australia ! if you dig gore , this one ok ... but again , wayyyy over top . i no idea one bullet . 45 could blow someone half . our characters so clueless it actually takes them 3/4 movie figure out how shoot them head . i personally counted several scenes where character shooting police revolver somehow manages get 13 shots out 6 shooter . someone get nasa phone explain how you because i just don't get it . absolutely worst part this movie , without doubt , music . it never stops ! there never scene without music some reason ! it just makes what you're watching seem absolutely cheesy ! it reminded me 1950 serial/pirate swashbuckling kind thing guys swinging ropes jumping across gorge kind thing . soundtrack truly worst i've ever heard extra cheese included . they use up their budget effects ? probably ! i found myself wishing i could mute music during film ! if you're fan good monster / zombie movies , i beg you pass this one keep moving . it doesn't make sense , story amazingly weak , plot ... well , there isn't one ... you'll wish you could your 2 hours back . i know i !!!	-1
francis ford coppola apocalypse now pure example method filmmaking . it true craftmanship essential filmmaker . art direction , editing sound effects partially small fragment which makes this film classical memorable . what drives integrity semblance film storyline , acting inner message . inner message evidently enough war hell , or other words , hell war . not many directors ambition or true courage establish such well-defined piece art . european filmmakers wouldn't slightest problem directing film or throw their personal feelings war . what most interesting american filmmaker spoke his style style film collaborators through continuance film . plot fairly simple brief , adapted joseph conrad heart darkness . martin sheen plays role captain willard , war-torn character who not see any hope life or humanity anymore . he mission it capture presumed colonel kurtz ( marlon brando ) who fabricated army existensial soldiers outskirts cambodian jungle . throughout film we encounter astonishing sequences . most unforgettable dawn helicopter attacks . robert duvall character colonel kilgore steady firm example basic american army brain : search destroy then destroy some more if it includes yourself . children walk playground , oblivious any danger . helicopters come into view dawning sea ; millions sprinkle reflect water , we hear helicopter engines roar horizon soon enough we stuck messy attack . throughout sequence we hear wagner ' ride valkyries ' . it method filmmaking . starting sequence fascinating rest movie ; beautiful scene palm trees blowing ragged wind seconds away inflamed carpet bombing . let not forget scene where soldiers boat which sheen travels , stop innocent upcoming boat , suspecting them vietcongs carrying artilleries . then they spark off heavy scene shooting which all passengers boat pulverised pieces their crops food savaged atrocity . this film its famous moment , some better kept quiet until they come through screen . it doesn't require any intellectual understanding , although film intellectually remarkable . american soldiers vietnam war jumped into land fresh governmental country , aiming protect themselves end only received death chaos their troops majority country they fighting against . it war gone mad , like all other wars , without purpose or dignity . it pure act humanity : destroy restore their own greedy needs . this film which there no saviour , where it hardly possible find hope gloomiest corners where all surroundings plagued infatuations greed , anger , foolishness egoism . coppola once said film : ' this film isn't vietnam . this film vietnam ' . he right date . during current situations world , where they trying protect their own skin , world should try analyse this film much possible wonder what it trying represent . it film which not ask applause or damnation . it asks realism . enjoy	1

absolute best hitman hart : wrestling shadows . however , if you want newest interviews bret some best footage you see him his early stampede days wcw , this dvd get ! i'm so glad finally some excellent matches his dvd . my only complaint audio hart vs . austin match wrestlemania 13 off 2 seconds which doesn't sound like much but very noticeable when someone hits mat there no sound until few seconds later . but it not enough drop it down 4 stars . tributes his brothers owen dean well other fallen commrades including brother law davey boy smith , curt hennig , big boss man , rick rude , miss elizabeth others touching . they excellent job this dvd despite fact mcmahon give bs statement beginning bret " putting their differences aside " sake dvd . it very obviously dig unscrupulous shyster . if you're looking " montreal screwjob " match its entirety this dvd , you won't find it . it cut time ( bret said he wanted " de-emphasize " it this project ) but featured bits pieces documentary itself . thankfully bret hocking mcmahon shown several times which made me smile after opening statement mcmahon . highly recommended	1

there very few shows my lifetime i fiercely loyal , but now defunct `once again ' without question , topped short list . i admit my lifelong crush actress sela ward my main interest this series , originally . single , no kids , my late 20s during oa debut , i far out abc target demographic this show . i didn't expect like show very much , but i got sucked not because sela , but because show nothing less than fantastic . superbly acted superbly written , abc never gave this show chance find its audience , it bounced around time slot time slot until it all too early demise . even best shows need pitched correctly viewing audiences chance . premise story rick samler lily manning , two fortysomething single parents who re-enter adult dating scene after their divorces . they fall head over heels one , find life love ( then ) late 1990s far different than what they remember . adding children , careers , parents , ex-spouses mix just adds different layers complications challenges rick lily . most shows `jump shark ' some point during their lifetimes . while some could argue hostage episode s2 point oa , i disagree . once again always presented two kinds television : good , better . stories characters could fill you hope , heartbreak , or both every week almost without fail . best all - everything this show real . very little , if any , suspension disbelief required . perhaps best thing i say oa it only show i so passionate saving , i sat down wrote letter abc , asking them reconsider their canceling it ( part organized campaign other fans ) . while campaign wasn't successful , release ( finally ) series dvd allow those who loved this show then enjoy it forever , well allow those who didn't get view oa during its run discover it , they too , might find out why we who followed this show beginning understood this just beautiful story	1

" hell " meticulously produced some best cinematography i've ever seen horror movie . although story who jack ripper little contrived times , general plot interesting . all actors involved excellent movie grisly moments you'd expect , considering subject-matter . it keeps you interested involved whole two hours , not mention it looks beautiful . heather graham gang prostitutes put great touching performance , showing human side women unfortunate enough this profession victorian era , johnny depp amazing , usual , although ( others pointed out ) his english accent may little off , which i wouldn't know since i'm american . this film great entertainment i would highly recommend buying dvd ( if you rent it you'll more than likely end up buying it anyway , it good ) . " hell " makes great addition any movie collection .	1

upon seeing previews theater good company , my first instinct avoid it like plague . based apparent target demographic this film , it marketed horribly . trite title kitchy manner which preview clips edited reminded me too much those shallow adoloescent throwaway disney films - type hollywood routinely pukes out 14 year old girls . knowing dennis quaid penchant appearing such films , i assumed good company one those . recently however , i stumbled across movie opening credits hbo . " i'll stay long enough make fun it . " , i thought myself . but matter minutes , i completely sucked . writing intelligent tone often dark . this movie , surface appears natural born comedy , yet it resists obvious cornball pitfalls every turn . characters not 1 dimesnional buffoons , but written very believable people real problems . every time i smelled cliche or overly sentimental twist coming , film continued surprise me not taking easy way out . it perfect film ? no . good company not without its flaws . but they very few very forgivable . this one proof you can't judge dvd its cover	1

well folks , looks like we may most over praised movie current millennium right here . ( " crash " comes close , but film lot more detractors than this one , many those who liked it seemed so because they imagined , somehow , it would " change world " . ) my beefs not same most those who don't like film : i don't much care it may show unrealistic picture drug abuse , nor i find it overly depressing . fact , it isn't depressing all cause i didn't care . it just boring annoying , sometimes different moments , sometimes simultaneously . this not good combination . all right , here plot summary : jared leto , marlon wayans , jennifer connelly ellen burstyn all drugs , this really messes up their lives . i hate give it all away like , but there it . fundamental flaw this : i don't like any these people , so their pain doesn't mean anything , since all there this movie it absolutely fails any sort effect . maybe if aronofsky put more time characterization it would've worked , but now there just isn't anything there . far what actually movie , we've got jared leto stupid chunkhead who inane conversations his equally chunkheaded girlfriend jennifer connelly , who wants fashion designer , or something . beyond this we've got jared mother , ellen burstyn , who weird old woman marlon wayans leto friend who deals drugs him times appears headed towards big leagues . i particularly love how there no real attempt make wayans into person . he got one flashback how he wanted make his mom proud that it . doubly sad fact he most likable three . he least displays little life . connelly leto apparently just wandered here bergman film so dull slow it wonder smack doesn't cause them cease exist entirely . ( well , connelly actually coke , i think , but it fails liven her up any . also , i actually * like * bergman films i've seen , so that not really fair comparison . ) they love each other , apparently , but since i don't even like either them i'm not much interested . finally , burstyn mostly just creepy though her performance take turn hilarious she goes off deep end . perhaps it wouldn't funny if i cared her , but we've over ... i want you people know i'm not utterly heartless when it comes movies . i care characters , but none these people anything me , so movie dead water . good counter examples watch " trainspotting " , which drug-addict characters enough humor life likable interesting " bubba ho-tep " , film which displays plight lonely elderly 50 times better than this film despite silly horror-comedy mummy cowboy outfit it . other hand , neither those movies nearly pretentious " requiem dream " , so watching them nothing stroke your ego . still , if that all you want kinda find plenty films better than this one purpose . " requiem dream " isn't helped any darren aronofsky repetitive , derivative over-direction . trouble , this movie hasn't got any plot distract you how redundant visual style . there nothing inherently wrong any his tactics , but they're hopelessly driven ground , we see fast-motion thousand times , quick-cut montages million times plenty wonky camera-attached-to-the-actor junk , they , again , impossible not notice cause plot sure ain't drawing me . i imagine overdone , repeating visual style meant representation endless cycle found drug use , but doesn't make it any more pleasant or entertaining watch . score suffers same problem they use same handful themes over over . truth told , i thought this movie pretty okay first half , but then it really started grate me . it became evident no , aronofsky wasn't going introduce any new visual tricks no , these characters weren't going get any more interesting . i looked timer continuously last 40 minutes film , so uninvolved supposedly horrifying conclusion where all characters really get it bad utterly ineffective . it kind uplifting , really : now these tedious characters finally hit rock bottom i go something else . now that good ending . grade : d+ ps this 500 reviews . i doubt if i write 500 more , but who knows	1
captains courageous begins harvey ( freddie bartholomew ) , spoiled rich kid who uses bribes cheats his way getting what he wants . when his father ( melvyn douglas ) finds out what his son up , he plans vacation together so his son learn how decent human so two bond . however , harvey falls off boat way salvaged portuguese fisherman named manuel ( spencer tracy ) who brings him aboard his fishing boat teaches his how proper man . film filled sentiment , wonderful acting , good pacing . it never gets boring ; there always something happening even if set ( fishing boat ) limited . cast wonderful . outside bartholomew , douglas , tracy , lionel barrymore mickey rooney grace cast lis t.t he film slightly dated . there scenes bartholomew tracy pull one heart-strings , but sometimes they come off too close slightly creepy , especially modern world child molesters . however , taking time period which film made sincerity actors , these cultural differences overlooked	1

[ ... ] this dvd version video same title , which longer couple songs 7 minutes . karen singing brilliant usual she again demonstrates she could sing anything put front her her brother , master arrangements production - who could play piano absolute best . they supported excellent band musicians sum amounted truly fantastic sound . carpenters my all-time favourites should there whole musical journey . however , karen untimely death complications caused anorexia nervosa which , it seems , resulted her suffering heart failure , meant journey ended all too prematurely . karen main focus attention any carpenters recording . here no different ; but videos stem 1970s when carpenters , me , suffered awkwardness self-consciousness front camera so , occasions , lip-synching doesn't always seem work karen facial head movements seem affected contrived . strangely , some earlier videos look better , probably because she behind drum kit or microphone her hand , also , point some it painful watch , later videos show karen looking terribly thin , particularly , penultimate video ( " when i fall love " ) , she reminds me nancy reagan , gaunt looks hair style which very uncomplimentary - she looks more like 80 than 30 ! said , only other things wrong this there no extras this dvd it all over only 37 minutes , which seems desperate waste disk space . onto good things - it got all ingredients carpenters fans would expect , but " reason believe " " bless beasts children " lovely surprise inclusions video " calling occupants ....

david milch modern retelling black hills gold rush compelling it raw realistic . hbo , not censored any way it would commercial television , it provides us more honest rendering how human beings live act . this first season you'll shaking your head wondering if crazed gold rush days could so outrageous . right off i compared it gunsmoke , similar tale written produced television nearly half century ago . i think we're seeing things more clearly today . i think our artists more leeway their audiences won't sit still kitschification human experience	1
this film unbelievably good . i dvr'd it free speech tv , i watched parts it again again . every turn you blown away revelations this film , if you , like me , never thought much who controls mainstream media . first time i watched it i kept stop tape just cringe , letting import facts sink . talking heads people you may never encountered , but whom you unlikely forget . write their names down . check into their books . even if you don't buy film look list people it get their books . particularly incisive inquiries into most recent presidential elections . you there , i there , but lewis shows us ugly underside media can't afford let us see . this scary , take-to-the-streets stuff . finally , pappas deserves more well-known documentarian . if you put off michael moore whininess slightly embarassing approach , you may find new friend robert kane pappas .	1

menace ii society debut film directing duo hughes brothers , released 1993 height popularity " hood movies " . most other reviewers stated film extemely powerful look growing up l.a early 90 . movie grabs your attention straight away robbery liquor store controversial shooting korean owners , pace never lets up throughout . caine ( tyrin turner ) basically bystander opening scene o-dog ( larenz tate ) goes rampage , this continues throughout film , caine good person but very much victim his circumstances , whereas o-dog just " doesn't give f**k " . without going into plot details events film all conspire against caine it all catches up him inevitable ending . there also good performances jada pinkett mc eiht small role start samuel jackson caine father . while film very powerful sad realistic take ghetto life , it not without it faults , main one lack depth some characters . they never really explain caine relationship parnell , though he regularly refers him " like dad " throughout film . also several other characters hard sympathise their background never really explained ( something i felt better boyz hood ) , i find it hard believe parnell would cool caine relationship his girl . despite these minor faults film still great though ending particular tragic inevitable . one better hood movies early 90 , if your into them you should definetely check this out	1

' spun ' follows lives several methamphetamine addicts through their wasted , roller coaster days , but this not your ordinary ' drug ' film . ambience atmosphere so in-tuned this degenerated culture you smell illegal drugs cooking . giving plot away would moot , since it portrayal everyday life people this particular scene . so , what separates ' spun ' rest drug flicks ? gritty realism , hilariously bizarre scenes , atmosphere , some great acting , complete lack fear part creator director dive into nastiest behaviors expose them pathetic comical . sets what you see real life meth houses . dress behavior characters very realistic . my only real problem movie some jerk/flash camera work gets little annoying , but still serves its purpose bringing " tweak " screen . interspersed film some ridiculous cartoon scenes riot , two cops parody tv shows like " cops " " bounty hunters " , flash stills hilarious action music . i am going haunted forever spider mike ( john leguizamo ) scene where he jumping up down bed sock his unit while abusing himself . you'll see what i mean , leguizamo brilliant his role . mickey rourke proven himself quite actor , chameleon who adapt any role .

favorite steve mcqueen vehicle , sprawling western stretches bit too far . me , this just hip take western melodramas 50 . early scenes , mcqueen could helped cedibility great bit letting actor play himself adolescent . i believe this early harold robbins novel toned down into lengthy story . mcqueen character moves across land hunt those responsible killing his family , there wonderful life-changing moments . brian keith gun lore rapport mcqueen worth whole viewing . mini-scene within this adventure under-utilized , suzanne pleshette , swamplands louisiana . love nearly conquered , slowing story until mcqueen catches up karl malden his thugs . malden strong his scenes , but there too much horseplay end makes revenge bit silly wrong-headed , since any red-blooded man would run off pleshette anyway . right when you want mcqueen kill thugs , there some nonsense mission priest slows finish even more . cut-up shown tv , it tighter , more fluid story . like malden " left-handed gun , " film uneven crawls spots . we forgive this movie when sum mini-scenes not add up successful whole , fact editor not what best . i don't even remember what revenge mcqueen character end . 30 years later i watch movie see pleshette , keith mcqueen what casts 10 or so tv sitcoms never approach . kudos casting , thumbs down pacing .	1

this film gives insight into interwoven lives mike watt . boon more than overlook into band itself .

i must disagree , i love any all b/w programs or movies now beautiful colorization process . i only wish superman , honeymooners i love lucy color . blind closed minded ones who refuse accept current facts , it not your father colorized movies anymore . today coloring process advanced point where each every item picture assigned separate accurate color . you seen beautiful job sherlock holmes movies , woman green , terror night , secret weapon dressed kill ? excellent , fantastic , you couldn't ask more beautiful picture . not one false note frame , great . colorizing today truly advanced wonderful looking . i'll choose my beautiful colorized " casablanca " anytime over dull drab b/w world standard issue b/w image . i even bought 3 copies colorized casablanca , it such dream come true . films tv shows shot b/w old days because it most economical way shoot . it " standard " day , just color standard today . they didn't shoot b/w because they wanted show beauty b/w picture anymore than movies today shot color simply because they want exhibit wonders color . it standard , not artistic hoity toity vision b/w pureness . folks who only want b/w , fine enjoy , but please not take away pleasue color rest us . you may pretend like b/w over color all you want , but if you could get off your high prentious horse just politically incorrect moment you would admit color natural way more interesting way look image monochrome . if b/w highly attractive you pretend , then why it all b/w movies sold dvd or vhs always color picture front represent movie it contains ? why not honest put typical b/w drab uninteresting picture b/w movie cover dvd ? why not use b/w cover picture ? because no one would buy it , b/w not attractive , it implys old , out date . color image today , present , not look like ancient relic past . i love watching laurel hardy color . i all their talkie shorts roach movies color it just like watching new video , not ancient relic by-gone day . color makes laurel hardy seem present happening now . it wonderful thing . go this amason website below see yourself beauty newly colorized movie . this great listing all beautiful colorized movies made today . i've bought just every one them , i've not disappointed yet . all spoil-sports who refuse everyone freedom choose themselves , color or b/w , back my hand you . these discs even contain both versions , dull , drab , boring b/w beautiful wonderfully illustrious colorful artful masterpiece lovely colorized version . so you elitist snobs still put your blinders continue pretend only liking b/w buy this disc , because b/w version there addition perfect color version . but i'm not believing politically correct crowd one minute , all their false indignation , i just know they secretly basking glorious color version , while course , denying ever watching it . you just know , given choice , anyone any taste all naturally choose watch color version , who wants see ugly b/w picture when wonderful color one right there beside it . i love colorization love even more calling bluffs all so-called members good-taste society who pretend not like colorization , but watch hungily any all color movies , well they should . too bad they just can't admit colorization superiortiy over sleep-inducing b/w image . buy this all colorized movies , you won't disappointed , they look great today . colorization come long long way when it first started . bravoisimo , more colorized movies please , i can't wait buty next one ! perfect world ? when all b/w movies tv shows colorized , then we'll paradise	1

there lots passion wide sargasso sea book , but it mostly emotional . it extremely multi-layered novel work true master . film other hand just your classic , bad 1990s film , beautiful look , lots skin , languid copulation , heaving bosoms , bodice-ripping nonsense , etc next no substance . it no artistic integrity whatsoever , its shameless makers must surely know they lifted their middle finger spirit jean rhys novel when choosing make film way they . i unable feel empathy both lead character . much touted erotic scenes not developed what they lead believe , it also lacked much enthusiasm . they incomplete contributed little , if anything , plot . viewer only gets glimpse passion supposedly exists edward antoinette . therefore , they should either gone all way , tastefully ( no pun intended ) , or left those scenes out entirely . now regards plot this film there enormous holes , which perhaps could rectified reading book . but those who haven't read book , there should enough information film itself keep reader afloat . start it unclear what really going this family ( despite narration ) . why ex-slaves keep laughing ? ( something vaguely explained movie , though apparently fully explained book ) . why didn't parrot fly away ? what made mother go nuts ? no point movie mr. rochester " issues " , it , fully explained . man gets letter exposing his wife creole dumps her like hot potato , after ( christophene explains ) he one who came crawling her first place . what hypocrite . again , maybe this ultimate point , mr. rochester snob archetypical victorian englishman antoinette victim both his prejudice jamaicans . but none exonerates appallingly abrupt conclusion film . so , despite beautiful cinematography , this movie hopeless muddle . i'd highly recommend novel way : book you don't forget hurry . needless say i think you should give this insulting ( memory jean rhys ) film miss , especially if you've read novel : it'll just frustrate you , no matter how keen bit easy titillation you may feeling time .	1

curiosity entertainment kids teens given today , i happened watch this film tv few days ago . i could biased say movies aren't what they use kids , but this movie went beyond . this film depressing example how horribly some today youth growing up . i would not recommend this film anyway ( unless laughs its stupidity ) . film starts off our four ' rich girl ' characters strutting down street arrogance beyond words . arrogance , perhaps normal thing some teenagers . however , these girls appear filthy rich which very few kids could relate leaving them wonder why can't they rich little kids too ? goal these girls course - become famous pop-singers . unrealistic dream most but it seems moral film : " good life , you need become famous " . plot moral , not great one . characters little lessons , appalling . ' raven ' so caught up ' becoming pop-star ' experience she becomes completely self-absorbed . this probably one few morals presented well . don't become self-absorbed idiot . moving . our second character fails entirely bringing any good ideals . after some time working ' cheetah girls ' upcoming career she comes home throw tantrum her mother not there ( rather , she out boyfriend ) . real-estate agent rings her mother interest selling house , daughter picks up phone , rudely yelling agent how this house not sale ' because i say so ' pure teen angst . now she decides go out abuse her mother credit card all money it worth because this small episode . course when mum comes home , she not happy . but apparently it all ok when daughter cries out how her mother should there more her . perhaps if this real case child-neglect , this may ok . but this kid just selfish brat who needs find better ways get over minor issues . i really hope kids won't think its ok throw hissy fit next time they discover their parents go ou t.t he next character perhaps most insulting ' real world ' . raven makes occasional comment this character how trashy their fashion looks ( yes , their fashion looks perfectly fine actually ) . later film we realise our ' trashy ' girl actually orphan living poor foster home . it good idea ; however , this girl looks nothing like real ' poor ' girl . perhaps ' money isn't everything ' moral would fitted nicely here , but instead we're handed perfect fix : get your rich friends buy your clothes . forth character i won't comment i can't remember anything significant her . process becoming pop-stars course , very unrealistic , aside sell-out factor lip-syncing . ' cheetah girls ' torn following their original dream or selling-out just get exposure . their friendship hangs line because this raven refuses compromise . we given few inspiring quotes other characters which road raven should take this matter , then its all up wonderful climax res t.t he climax . toto fallen hole got dirty ( horrifying experience dog bearing perly white coat)poor raven so frantic , this obviously worst kind tragedy could happen life . god forbid we learn anything realistic like death family member or even this poor little pooch . perhaps case we'd even president united states turning up comfort raven , but no , it just dirty dog stuck hole , it only calls whole neighbourhood , police , fire fights local television news crew . such tragedy only resolve reconciled friendship ' cheetah girls ' . there we it . entertainment ... maybe . any benefits otherwise , i would personally hope not , they're not kind things i would like see kids teenagers these days . normally , if this film aimed higher audience ( ha ) i wouldn't see much problem it . but this disney film ... you know , ones meant inspiring kids , or least teach them some values life ? this just gave us insight disney own greedy mind .	-1

though i bought movie because i'm huge alan rickman fan , i found movie thoroughly enjoyable . kevin kine course wonderful , very amusing . alan rickman his best usual , mary elizabeth mastrantonio portrays fairly brave , courageous character willing assist kline character catch killer risk her life . touch suspense , this movie moves comfortable pace , i must say my favorite scene " stairwell scene " . absolutely hilarious ! if you haven't seen january man i thoroughly recommend it . only flaw ? not enough alan ! ( but , any movie he ever enough him ? not bloody likely ! ) . ok . after read other reviews this movie their thorough dislike it because it " overacted , bad , etc . " , i must state this movie not supposed serious . it comedy . semi-stupid comedy , but comedy nonetheless . i found what type movie it supposed , it works very well . it good cast ( lots stars ) , it doesn't take itself overly seriously , it just plain funny ! those found it disappointing ? perhaps you miss point . it not supposed thriller it not supposed taken seriously thriller . my opinion , " bad acting " cast perhaps supposed way . i said previously , i enjoyed film quite bit , i still recommend it alan fans anyone looking comedy semi-stupid satiristic ( sp ? ) " serious suspense movies " . take " bad acting " grain salt while watching this movie , lol . actors certainly	1
" four brothers " successful action film because it accepts its role action film . too many `entertainment ' movies lately trying something more process end up substantially less . i no problem experimentation within genre , but when so much experimentation fails it becomes films stick basics them justice become rewarding . " four brothers " just such film . it not perfect any means , times falls hopelessly into traps i mentioned , but when it sticks what it best it works better than any action films i seen while . john singleton finds pace tone drives heightens story characters doing so helps film could so drearily standard become something substantially more . rather than mere dull formula or misguided wandering , film achieves level lively entertainment , something which hollywood late trouble delivering . so what makes " four brothers " different ? first all story simple enough it more often then not bog down pace film . this not always true there certainly mid-film lull when various uninteresting plot twists revelations hold back good old-fashioned a@# kickings , but majority movie plot used progress , rather than hold back action . plus , nothing works better unapologetically violent exuberant action movie than story vengeance , " four brothers " best when not trying make any claims contrary . acting suits film also , especially mark wahlberg , who i often enjoy who here obviously enjoying himself , playing character boisterous aggressive enough suit wahlberg mischievous grin tough-guy looks . terrence howard icy cool always playing cop streets , barring overwrought performance chiwetel ejiofor victor sweet , mobbed-up head baddy , all actors fit their roles well . ejiofor certainly meant over-the-top , but just all scenes feature him , he just doesn't quite fit more street-level tone rest film . singleton often looks though he still trying direct music videos , which approach often works , often not . opening scenes " four brothers " great , singelton aptly sets tone action follow . scenes snow-covered detroit brotherly bonding played songs marvin gaye motown set real slick tone film works well . there stumbles , such heavy-handed thanksgiving dinner scene , but most part these sequences succinct enough establish genuine interest character , therefore , vest interest story follow . film picks up so pace , sometimes thrillingly , basketball game or various action sequences , sometime disappointingly , film insistence ill-fated blacksploitation sub-plot , but way which never boring . this ultimately true success film . it may reflection current state hollywood movies , but " four brothers " , all its faults misguided straying , particularly successful movie because it least never fails entertain . i fear i praised film too much here . don't get me wrong , i certainly rolled my eyes once or twice while watching ( especially very last scene ) disappointed more than few aspects film , but parts i critical disappointed mainly because parts work worked so well . wahlberg one reason , singleton astute eye slick entertainment , but main reason film worked because it content what : unabashedly shallow , lively , entertaining action film .	1

i searched reviews this movie before i saw it , didn't find any . people i talked not seen it , but heard it good . so i finally sat down watched it . acting top notch . it tightly scripted chick flick two friendships . one nursing home , one friendship retold cleo threadgoode during those visits . down side it very feministic , point portraying men general evil ogres . women would up arms any similar one sided portrayal women . kathy bates ' character went trampled everyone woman " don't push me " type . while much this funny , this one extreme other rather than middle ground . spite this i enjoyed first part movie . until surprise ending . while this gives away bit plot spoiler , ending involved unwitting cannibalism . this made me sick , i felt sick long time after watching it . i known how sour ending would , i never would watched this movie	-1
i am so glad i bought this survivor season ! i needed something watch i lay bed recovering back surgery , this perfect !! it definitely far better than first far i'm concerned . major players much more interesting than first- colby , tina , jerri , elizabeth , etc ., plus they endure much more hardship than first- fires , flooding , running out food , mike falling fire , etc . it much more fun watch survivor second go it , challenges harder , players smarter , outback terrain rougher than beach first season . great buy	1

" killing me softly " one those scripts just don't give audience break - not only it set up improbable situation , but big " twist " end also mind-numbingly predictable ( unless perhaps you haven't seen thriller before your life ) . chemistry two leads also lacking ; fiennes brings some physical magnetism his role but far his acting concerned , he inexpressive bloke , while heather graham all too expressive - she overemphasizes every emotion her character supposed feeling making faces camera . besides , she not even attractive ; even her co-star this particular film , natascha mcelhone , blows her out water department . ending like when you ' jawbreaker ' candy your mouth , sweet good beginning but when you get inside its bitter sour . it obvious towards end movie it would turn out like it , i seen quite number bad movies figure it out so quicklyin spite all , chen kaige direction good , he creates some suspenseful moments . so i give film generous " ** out 5 " rating . but if you're heather graham fan you like this movie since she nude many scenes ; joseph fiennes fans you'll receive half naked perks .	1
excellent collection rascalism . we tandem teacher pet school out . these two films introduce miss crabtree ( june marlowe pretty teacher ) cycle . first one jackie cooper gang trying scare away their teacher potential sweetheart ( " she mean teampature " ! )-or so they think . school out features classic history exam-miss crabtee- " buddy o'donald , what paul revere say his midnight ride ? " buddy- " he said whoa ! " then we what amounts two very anti-racist gang comedies . pooch ( 1932 ) , white rascals band together help their black pal matthew " stymie " beard keep dogcatcher killing his cannine pal pete . dogs dogs ( 1931 ) , sherwood his mena mama won't let stymie come play dorothy wheezer , but guess who helps save day ? spooky hooky ( 1936 ) later generation rascals ( spanky , alfalfa , buckwheat , porky ) trying retrieve phony note their teacher . gang ( janitor dudley dickerson ) gets scared out their wits skeleton dark . even my nephews , who don't usually take well black white films , enjoyed this one . dog heaven ( 1927 ) not so hot . not one better silent our gangs ( which i usually treasure ) , this rather crude entry beloved pete trying hang himself ( rather graphically , i might add ) after his master joe deserts him yonug girl . comedic canine also shown using his paws hold up bottles bootleg liquor get drunk despondency . yuck ! keep kiddies away this one ! other than , typically great collection	1

i guess i understand why this movie so savagely criticized during it year release , 1986 . prince still enjoying huge popularity based largely success " purple rain , " both film soundtrack . critics love knock someone off pedestal , which what they prince those days . many claimed movie nothing more than ego trip . they couldn't believe prince nerve fire director then assume role himself . it all way too harsh criticism movie isn't trying anything more than fun romantic comedy . course , poor critical response alone doesn't usually keep public making movie popular . yet " under cherry moon " bomb he box office . probably main reason this movie , although shot color , released black-and-white . some unfathomable reason , general movie-going public more often than not horrified prospect seeing black-and-white movie . now don't get me wrong , i'm not claiming movie released color people would flocked it droves . i'm only saying it would attracted more audience if it color . i acknowledge this movie target audience prince fans . since i am one myself , most my life , i'm not most entirely objective viewer . but i make no apologies my love this movie . it not " guilty pleasure " me , because i proudly hold this one my favorites . i only seen it couple times before dvd release - unfotunately i missed it theaters ( i couldn't get anyone take me , i only 12 none my friends into certainly not my parents - though my dad went me few years later see " grafitti bridge " opening night , but that review ) . but since it dvd release 2004 , this become one my most-watched discs my collection . soundtrack killer , tunes make up one best prince albums ever . there even some great stuff heard movie didn't make album ( some which issued 12 " vinyl ) . plus , i think movie looks great - cinematographer michael ballhaus , who multiple academy award nominations his credit ( dp numerous martin scorsese classics ) . i wonder how movie would feel color , but i think black-and-white right way go . even though movie set then-contemporary times , it feel something ' 30s . there so many classic moments this movie , i won't try list them all . but here few ... christopher tracy ( prince ) giving his " bela lugosi eyes " ... tricky ( jerome benton ) tossing rose petals into tub while christopher takes bath ... christopher freaking out when he sees bats eatery ... " wreka stow " scene ... car race christopher mary sharon ( kristen scott thomas ) . acting , i've heard lot people saying prince performance no good . i don't see much truth claim . after so serious " purple rain , " it nice contrast see him so loose funny this . jerome benton proved he could just fine even without morris day his side ( " purple rain " ) - i'm surprised jerome hasn't much additional acting outside prince movies . obviously kristen scott thomas moved this , her first major role , become oscar-nominated , highly repected leading lady . how dvd presentation ? pretty good , such largely overlooked movie . widescreen transfer 2.0 stereo mix aren't anything phenomenal , but get job nonetheless ; movie looks sounds fine . features , anyone expecting full-blown special edition like 2-disc " purple rain " disappointed . but least it not completely bare-bones release - four music videos included , though unfortunately not presented optimal audio/visual quality ( though they passable , i would've preferred 5.1 mixes ) . highlight live performance " anotherlover " which taken never-released ( least not domestically , not sure if it saw light day anywhere outside u . . ) concert video documenting parade tour . mtv held interesting ( i . . - very weird ) contest determine where " under cherry moon " would it world premiere . ten-thousandth caller mtv hotline would accompany prince premiere , which would held their hometown . mtv ran special covered premiere party - unlike premiere " purple rain " unfortunately this program not found " under cherry moon "' dvd release . lisa barber contest winner , movie indeed premiere her hometown sheridan , wyoming - very unusual place big movie premiere . when asked what he thought town sheridan , prince summed it up single word : " purple .

i am not fan reality tv shows but i am huge fan lisa kudrow . there cool distinction her performance/presentation i seen most her work . i dying see this dvd since i didn't chance see it tv . i am not sure what could inspiration creators producers make show like this . i think it incredibly original show . it written perfectly every scene worked out detail . but definitely not show massive audience . when i watched show very first time , i million mixed feelings . i completely confused . i didn't know what think valerie or rest characters . after i seen it more than once , i able pick up more details written into show . it truly unique show many levels . lisa acting absolutely amazing . she nailed completely every single line scene . my favorite moments show valerie " personal video diary " moments . there so much irony those . i cracked up every one them . references she makes pop-culture past very refreshing appropriate . music used show plus . i love character valerie cherish . she lots qualities great moral values . actress i think valerie fans similar lisa kudrow fans . valerie bit outsider , uniquely beautiful best sense humor . i love her comebacks - i think they hysterical . her facial expressions so funny way makes her every scene original . valerie definitely someone , real life , i would love around me . i don't think valerie character " anti-phoebe role " any way . valerie just not phoebe . thing threw me off little , michael patrick king comment ( his commentary very last episode season ) , madonna " stole valerie look her last tour " . i guess he meant madonna red-hair look cover coad which legendary madonna/steven klein collaboration . i don't know what think comment ... so , sum everything up , this show takes tv level . it pushing envelope ... essentially , it positive message . it would " thrilling " if comeback comes back tv .	1
set 1986 , ballad tells tale ailing wealthy counterculture environmentalist ( jack ) his teenage daughter ( rose ) living abandoned commune . years ago it prospering but all members left , including jack wife , only jack rose remained . they spend their days quiet contentment , gardening , farming -- launching two-man guerilla attacks housing development other side island . living near isolation , jack rose develop incredibly close bond , one threatens become incestuous . terrified this development , jack asks his secret mainland girlfriend her two teenage sons live them . new ' guests ' unwelcome development rose life . she incredibly possessive her father retaliation this intrusion , she tries seduce two boys kill kathleen ( girlfriend ) . jack wit end eventually , things cannot go they nor they continue coexist new situation . he two choices neither which idyll . this where movie goes awry . movie keeps everything very natural level , no overwrought music , overreactions . this works most movie yet these events too alarming characters ignore . after rose tries shoot kathleen , all characters choose ignore rose unhealthy jealousy . they blame her behavior wild child-ism , result isolated society too long . while this case , it also annoying . rose character too much petulant child instead wild child . her acts became increaingly dangerous , more i wanted someone finally tell her enough enough . character jack equally unlikable . he chooses ignore his daughter unhealthy attachment when he fully accept it , he continues encourage it . this may fully organic development characters their relationship , but doesn't mean it entertaining . despite controversial relationship , movie vacillates smug boring . performances good , my favorite those paul dano , ryan macdonald , catherine keener girlfriend her two sons , there naturalness their acting oddly lacking depictions jack rose . perhaps intentional . jack rose not much real people they idealized environmentalist versions fairytale king his daughter , living grand isolation until advent evil stepmother , kathleen . only this case stepmother isn't evil new family more entertaining then main characters . there extraneous subplot beau bridges housing developer serves metaphorical commentary jack rose reltionship , but like rest movie it too smug meaningful .	1

there reason why they talk " voice angel " -- it because charlotte church certainly doesn't acting presence one . her acting debut " i'll there " proof enough -- only presence its star got this tepid little drama into theatres , where it rapidly dropped out sight . rightly so . seventeen years ago , paul kerr ( craig ferguson ) love rats fling groupie concert . fast forward present : kerr discovers unknown him , his ex rebecca ( jemma redgrave ) gave birth daughter , olivia ( charlotte church ) , who now well-adjusted paper girl . problem , olivia kept secret her dad . rebecca embittered , but kerr wants get know his daughter , similarly olivia wants get know her father . music seems thing bring angel-voiced girl burned-out rocker together , but rebecca doesn't want her child follow her father footsteps . " i'll there " hyped months advance inspired life actress liv tyler , who , despite only her twenties , immensely interesting life . well , maybe someday she get biopic , because " i'll there " only similar one way : it involves rock star his daughter . otherwise , it boring every way tyler life interesting . forgettable script , not much humor goofy premise , movie doesn't lot going it -- it reads like disgruntled teenager absurdist fantasy , scripted church act out . not terribly interesting teenager , either . it gets increasingly ridiculous when olivia decides pursue music bond daddy dearest ; it obvious ploy show off church vocal skills . best said church performance times she looks sweet . acting talent , she bland best , but she perform some good songs , her voice pretty ever . just watch songs fast-forward her actual scenes . redgrave good job she , ferguson wrings some pathos his performance aging rocker . his only memorable role film , it shame movie didn't focus him rather than dull miss church . miss church appears chosen role glorifies her middle atrocious film -- also known britney spears approach .

i just saw dawn dead first time . i actually saw remake first , which i liked . , course , i've seen terrifying night living dead many , many times probably see it again this halloween . so going , dawn dead little behind eight ball , so speak . but considering large number preconceived notions i regarding film , i enjoy it would recommend it . con pro : con : i truly believe greatest horror films black white . dracula , frankenstein , mummy , diabolique , psycho , course , night living dead , me , masterpieces just wouldn't same if shot color . shadows darker , deeper more sinister . danger menace seem lurk around every corner . night seems fall over proceedings like shroud , waiting swallow up everything . perhaps it part director george romero satire consumer culture prompted him shoot film bright colors . however , i kept thinking spooky quality grainy black white photography first film dawn dead suffered little bit comparison . color especially jarring when blood shown . romero wanted bright , unrealistic quality blood -- sort like comic book . however , effect this make blood look like spilled raspberry smoothie . film very scary , but might more so romero shot it black white . however , romero wisely stuck philosophy original when it came casting . probably because budgetary constraints , he cast unknowns pittsburgh area film . remake dawn dead released 2003 good , but it big studio film recognizable actors like ving rhames . when actors people audience knows , there separation takes place . i thought several times during remake , example , there no way ving rhames could killed off early film he most recognizable star ( i right ) . part what made night living dead so terrifying we didn't know actors . anyone could killed any time . nothing sacred ( johnny gets killed off immediately , tom judy burn death become zombie food , karen dies kills her mother , etc . ) . romero continues this tradition dawn dead . we no history these actors , so it becomes easier think them their characters . most us no safety net knowing actors previous work , so we no idea who going live who going die . it adds level horror missing remake . overall , dawn dead worthy follow-up night living dead . like most sequels , it doesn't quite match up , but unlike most sequels , drop-off isn't much . romero jazzed up formula satire dark humor , but he still manages scare hell out audience	1
i state all my south park reviews , i love this show personally colorado i take great pride this show comes my home state , season 6 great many fashions my personal favorite professor chaos , ( butters trying supervillain but just doesnt quote get it right , simpsons it episode just name few great episodes . sputh park great its own aspect , i just hope they keep up all these new great shows time grows ..	1
this movie so touching magical . once i've started watching it ( can't even count number times i've watched it ) , i find it hard press stop button . buy it you won't regret plus , i think charmed " stole " gist this movie , if u catch my drift * wink	1
" tristram shandy : cock bull story " reminded me bit altman film--it story within story novel filmed -- but it really chaos life . it bit amateur film feel it , draws one into middle making film . film opens vignette vanity actors -- my teeth too yellow ? i look good big nose ? should i get chin tuck ? am i too short ? characters move out , it not always clear who who -- agent , nosy journalist , moneymen ( women ) , history expert , girlfriend , pretty assistant , babies . some scenes truly hysterical -- all you need know almost all sterne novel happens before narrator born , filming birth hilarious . this film not linear plot types , or those who bothered heavy british accents or mumbled dialog . it sly , quirky -- but i liked it much more than i expected	1
tender story strong charectors tradegy beauty love , must see	1
one best movies i've ever seen . it takes you one completely twisted moment next - astonishing ending makes you think . definitely not faint-hearted or closed-minded	1
eagle landed may seen two movies , out synch each other . first very fine move driven ensemble cast just right touch wwii era characters . donald pleasance scary powerful , pathological himler , duvall trapped , brilliant intellegence colonel german high command , sutherland brilliant charming , ruthless ira spy . even minor characters well drawn not give off false notes . jenny agutter convincingly plays local young women who dragged her heart into events jean marsh troubling nazi spy who insinuates herself into english country life . " other " movie burdened almost impossible believe framework fantastic details plot , which two-squad group crack german commandoes kidnap churchill seaside report disguised polish troops , help ira spy who there less than week . course , armed only phony letter hitler urging himler , intellegence colonel going set this whole thing motion provide command , control liason . , germans going wear their real uniforms under fake polish ones , some reason honor escaped my understanding . anyone any undertanding hitler war machine , british homeland defense or wartime bunkering churchill , all this too much suffer gladly . so , fine cast moves , driven reacting events logical within framework plot , which incredible . end , personal stories characters win out , quite memorable , while plot line seems , narrator-like figure says secrecy portrayed event , like it " ever happened .	1

those who haven't seen this film , above line spoken william bendix refers constant japanese naval air bombardment wake island u.s. marines civilians endured base . i always fascinated " famous last stands " american military history , story wake island one most famous . this classic war movie , while over 60 years old , still very meaningful entertaining today . yes , some historical details missing , but brave determination wake island garrison wonderfully captured . brian donlevy , who usually stuck supporting roles , gets top billing this time great job . william bendix , one my favorite actors this period , steals every scene he his typical tough-guy-without-a-brain role ! many view movie portrayel japanese unfair racist , but remember this movie released only months after attack pearl harbor . special effects obviously dated , but they quite possibly best any 1940s war movie i've seen . director good job using authentic combat footage , except footage showing bi-planes (?!?) . course , war movie this old usual cliches present , but this movie aimed america cried revenge . there many scenes showing americans dying , yet eventual american defeat especially surrender wake island downplayed ( surrender isn't even included film ) . if you want know full story wake island , there several great books available . if you love classic war films , add this gem your collection	1

my wife i throughly enjoyed all six dvds this collection . we enjoyed it so much we both next set four dvds . while it not necessarily follow scripture exactly it very close . i am sure some things left out it would hard film . if you intersted historical background hebrews their daily lives struggles this great resource .	1

- reviewone way or , we people relate jersey folks " clerks . " me , i may not lived nj , or work crappy job , or girlfriend who gave oral-sex 37 guys ( 38 if i included ) , but i understand one key perspective one main characters : life full disappointments . " clerks " not disappointment , but it reminding tale how disappointments lead resentment , or least lead whining . i find it impossible give lengthy opinion film like this without hinting any repetition . what else this film hasn't said already ? some acknowledge effort kevin smith put this project , through sacrifice selling everything he , result leads this certifiable piece indie . i one constructive criticism " clerks " , i'm sure that irked many times , but still that one thing which hold film back what i think would truly awesome : acting . i don't mean obvious-amateur audacity flaw , it script . script smart cleverly-written , but when people actually reading lines , dialogue bit farfetched . some characters alright their acts , but others act like they're just reading script only hastened their performance just hide fact . randall sadly one others , though his role natural , his cohesive monologues anything but . seriously , no one ever talks like . then again , i'm criticizing people who no cinematic experience whatsoever . other than , " clerks " likable film likable characters , if you handle harsh obscenity , which it ... lot . i certainly like randall , despite my issue him , mostly because his outrageous personality . he say whatever he want whatever he likes , he doesn't give damn anyone , except dante ; he free-spirited crass manner very unapologetic . he a-hole fans rooting . dante not so bad other half , his " i'm not suppose here " mentality makes him relatable character . this film just taste " snootch-to-the-nooch-ness " things come , which created insane iconic duo jay silent bob : say what you them , these two won't stop . " clerks " dealt not only star wars references made geeks nerdgasms , but it dealt most thought-provoking subjects ever discussed , like ' not sucking your own ****' . no wonder movie cult hit mid 90s ; course , i only elementary school back then , so i didn't know much it . but watching movie proves this day , it still fresh , absurdly funny , insightful handle new generation . this del keyes , saying " they might not like us , but we like them .	1
this show great . i think this become my favorite show tv . i love everything this show . actors , storylines , scenery , special effects , everything great this show . i don't see how anyone would not like it . i think jensen jared really give you feeling they truly brothers . very well acted their part . i hope this show doesn't get canceled or stars decide quit . i think i'll watching rewatching this show it good	1
just i said volumes 1 2 : batman animated series . boy i wait long time it finally grace dvd . but it out it great . same applies volume 3 . it introduces one my favorite villains : ra al ghul . all episodes ra all interesting ( maybe showdown least , because it not much batman - or him matter - little ra ) , plus i love ra ' voice . it introduces new hero too : batgirl ( shadow bat ) . you even get know some backstory alfred lion unicorn . i really like fire olympus - guy gets so confused running business , he considers himself greek god ( zeus ) he thinks batman his dark brother , hades . wait till you see ending . bullet bullock hilarious episode , not just because batman working guy hates him most ( though i doubt batman likes bullock ) . even more fun joker harley quinn ( judge joker trial ) . now essence batman ( my opinion ): his silicon soul , one greatest episodes entire series . i just can't describe it - see yourself . i like lock-up lot too - guy goal similar batman , only different methods . unfortunately , volume 3 episode i dislike most well - terrible trio . i also found bane pretty weak ( not physical sense ) compared comics . this dvd similar number commentaries ( even single video commentary ) , though only one featurette . so it bit weaker than volumes 1 2 . nearly same conclusion before : i watched batman animated series kid tv i loved it then i love it now . it something special , because this cartoon far cartoony ( unfortunately new batman adventures heading there , some episodes quite so ) . they just this great mood , producers series call them " minimovies " , that what they truly . believe me , many waaaaay better than actual movies ( not only batman ones ) . only exception this one gets 4 stars , because it less special features	1

long-time fan corrs owner all their dvds ( including " live london " , " live royal albert hall " " unplugged " ) , i must agree previous reviewers this creme de la creme set ( all them excellent ) . what sets this one apart energy level emotions brought out homecoming dublin crowd . clearly , this more than just concert corrs . though i wish set included couple more covers interspersed their popular hits ( i really get kick out their concert very unique covers hits such little wing , everybody hurts , ruby tuesday , summer wine , et . al ) , group top form here . highlights include previously mentioned " runaway " , sharon caroline beautiful duet " no frontiers " ( performed much more emotion than unplugged dvd ) , rare performance ( hard rocking , , least them ) " secret life " , extended version traditional " lough erin shore " . i only wish vh1 live dublin performance would come out dvd	1

producing successful sequel such truly new unusual ( not mention highly successful ) film ring daunting task . you can't just tell same story over again , yet any moves new direction apt decried loyal fans original . i usually try review film immediately after watching it , but case ring two , i allowed several days go - thankfully so because my appreciation this film grown over time . certainly , this film not good original - how could it ? after all , we've already seen samara all her glory , we've even spent some time well . shock value ring two just can't compare original . believability also rears its ugly head here , samara unreal powers grown , real sense , taken flight sequel . this no longer people watching tape dying seven days later ; remember , rachel freed samara well end first movie . she more dangerous than ever now , her desires changed - she wants more than vengeance now . i think it quite coup get hideo nakata , director ringu ringu 2 , direct here , but i think vision he brings this film also explains part disconnect we've seen some fans ring . japanese approach horror quite different our own . american audiences used shown things , oftentimes explicitly , while japanese horror much more subtle , symbolic , spiritual . it this cultural divide , i believe , leads some ring fans label this film poor sequel . adapting japanese horror american audience quite challenge - just look grudge , film even i felt just didn't work . ring , all symbolic clues , especially those videotape , basically led something - namely , samara story location her body . ring two not lay out such clear pathway hero or viewer ; symbology much deeper abstract this time around . it not this causes confusion part viewer ; it just much story plays out level many viewers not culturally suited experience . that why i would recommend watching all bonus features this dvd - they certainly helped hone my appreciation what i just seen . story , you rachel keller ( naomi watts ) her son aidan ( david dorman ) leaving seattle moving astoria , oregon shortly after events first movie played out ( it supposedly six months later , but hideo nakata says two years production notes ) . rachel still suffering somewhat sense guilt ( over passing tape other innocents order save her son ) , but she aidan both trying start their lives anew forget samara . that all well good , but samara not forgotten them . that obvious after local youth dies horrible death under mysterious circumstances - rachel quickly left no doubt whatsoever samara found them . we quickly move beyond cursed videotape , however , samara works exploit her unique connection aidan . this time around , rachel cannot save her son through anything approaching conventional means , nor she rely help anyone else , now including her son . increasingly desperate , she decides trace samara history before her adoption morgans , eventually finding speaking girl actual birth mother ( sissy spacek quite memorable cameo ) . it looks like all drama leading up fairly predictable ending - but just remember film never over until it over . naomi watts basically carries this movie her back , she filter through which we view everything happens . up until now , i never really appreciated watts actress , but i now . david dorman story me , though . while he able deliver some very effective scenes , times i can't help but think he attended hayden christensen school acting . sure , he little creepy , but now it televangelistic way - me , he looks like combination jim bakker young macaulay culkin . i love samara , though ; thankfully , nakata chose not go cgi route her all ( even still , she not half creepy her original japanese counterpart ) , which would made mockery whole creep factor . cgi used , unfortunately , deer dominate one memorable scene . i understand how real deer could not used , but this particular scene , after starting out very effectively indeed , ultimately ruined ridiculous obviousness cgi animation . unlike ring , ring two packed special features ( although we still don't get commentary , unfortunately ) . easily best bunch short film called rings , which sort prequel rings two . i really liked idea played over these 15-20 minutes - underground network teens who watched videotape , recorded their increasingly disturbing experiences long they could stand it , then passed it fellow newbie before their seven days up . this impressive short film , you get series excellent making-of featurettes featuring surprisingly lengthy set production notes , information cast crew , some nineteen minutes deleted scenes . altogether , it impressive package truly excellent , some degree , misunderstood motion picture	1
i really enjoyed this tv series when i younger seen every episode , so finally getting them dvd special treat me . seasons 1-3 great ! i looked up john amos ' character " james " . me , james what i needed growing up without dad home . so kid , when i first saw episode where he dies since i really looked up james , i felt florida evans family i even went into bathroom cried after episode because i didn't want any my family members see me crying . my understanding , john amos constantly frustrated voicing his opinion writing wanted see more positive situations written into show . i guess people cbs thought they knew enough african-americans who watched show assumed we could never relate anyone us getting our lives together actually moving up world . so they gave " good times " ultimate change : what could worse thing could happen poor black family both parents struggling make ends meet keep family together ? one parents dies or gets killed !!!! this exactly what cbs when they fired john amos , they killed off his " james " character insuring he never returned . now florida single mother taking whole load herself without strong pillar james hold her up . but like my mother , she remained strong somehow even more strength than she knew she . when i'm watching these episodes , it if i'm receiving motherly advice i watch listen florida advise j.j. , thelma michael . overall , i enjoy watching these old episodes many times i like . thank you esther , may you rest peace	1

superb casting dark , realistic character storyline make this one best crime dramas ever . deniro character really deep inside not want live anymore since life he knew it basically over ( life crime drives him ) . he also love not understand not know how deal it . he makes stupid mistake end letting his emotions cloud his decision making , but it really mistake or death wish disguise ? pacino fulfills his wish . pacino character just driven but opposite direction . two sides same coin , same coin , different face . just deniro cannot let go what killing him neither pacino . it takes deniro life leaves pacino alive but missing best life , thus he also dead , walking dead .	1

i very impressed this story . i saw it theater , also this version dvd . this one most intense , longest , fulfilling movies available topic pornography industry 70 80 . very stylistic ( un)believable . ( c)ockumentary superior proportions . but it wasn't really documentary , just hollywood movie , based time , when porn coveted raincoat crowd . when i say ( un)believable , i mean story truely unbelievable , porn industry not man actor world , but clearly belongs female actor . she star this industry . so , when i see movie like this , i worry young men out there , who think they next " dirk diggler . " while , i'm probably over worrying concept , i still hope my words reach some man out there . this not reality . this fantasy , conceptualized hollywood director ; nothing more . reality , this could easily story written female actress , such rollergirl ? interesting enough , director fell into cliche , making rollergirl , victim . chastised her highschool classmates , ran out school . but reality , we know , know it jenna jameson tera patrick who real starts . i give this one 5 stars though , it really over top effort director . i quite impressed . two hard ones up ! this movie rocks ! mc white said : check it out !!	1

i finally got view tadpole --- few days after most recent presidential election . film nothing directly politics , but inadvertently it reminds one why democrats crushed last tuesday . aaron stanford aptly portrays fifteen year old oscar grubman , son columbia university historian ( late john ritter ) stepson heart disease researcher ( signourney weaver ) . this liberal elitist family living manhattan . needless add , their nonchalant attitudes toward sexuality , especially pertaining older adults enjoying sex young teenagers considered disgraceful majority citizens living red states . we observe precocious oscar wrestling ( often french ) his existential romantic challenges . eventually he beds woman her forties ( bebe neuwrath ) . this event not reported police . contrary , nobody wishes judgmental . teenage boy supposedly nature enough enter into such relationships . united states indeed split apart cultural war . red blue staters barely able comprehend world view each other . tadpole remind you just how serious differences . this movie ironically important manner which would likely surprise director gary winick . you need see it . this especially true if you wish take peek our national political future .	1

friend once who snickered my enthusiasm this movie . brainless cretin described it " chick flick " i give him long winded explanation why he once more way off beam . " goodwill hunting " classic guy movie guys who guy things . above all other story elements , this movie boyhood friends uncompromising loyalty those friendships . there scenes here should make you miss buddies you turned age , those great friends who there when you your first drink , chased your first skirt got into your first bar brawl . hunting genius becomes crux film . he genius , yes . but mostly , he young man typical frustrations misgivings come age . he issues girls , issues law , issues his own place world . this quickly became one my all-time favorites because it movie endless depth substance . story young punk criminal record outshining rest mathematical minds compelling start . so attempt bedraggled but committed psychiatrist reach boy weird friendship forms them . south boston serves beautiful shabby backdrop hunting feels himself drifting away his buddies his genius gets more attention world universities prestige he unfamiliar . he wants continue working construction hanging out seedy bars his friends , rather than his fluke ability exploited men greedy ambitions concerns over petty things like tenure . matt damon stellar streetwise hunting , orphan attitude . robin williams leaves his goofiness behind plays aging psychiatrist who once tough young man just like kid he trying help . while praising pair , no one should overlook talents ben affleck , who credible actor before he started landing tabloid covers . relationship damon affleck powerful . latter knows his childhood friend bound great things prods him achieve silent , macho way good friends . " if you're still here ten years , i'll kill you . that not threat , it fact . i'll freakin ' kill you , " affleck says , two take time beer during lunch break work . because how good friends talk each other when crucial matters hand . watching hunting battle himself he ponders idea flying away tough but familiar streets he grew up only half allure this film . each character comes into hunting world rich dynamic , somehow vital decisions young genius needs make . this one never far off my top five list all-time movie greats . not just because it great see tough southy intellectually thrashing silver spoon college kid , either	1

it took me while get around it but i finally gave it chance . trailers clips made fight club look like film glorifying silly wwe-style backyard brawls . opening credits zoom out ed norton body up pistol held tyler durden ( pitt ) . norton narrates story bring viewer up speed . his character firmly enmeshed dull , desensitized slave toiling claims adjuster , easy , well-paid desk job . he rents high-rise apartment bloated designer furniture , name brand clothes , name brand food ... he addicted comforted male support groups . then , one day , woman ( helena bonham carter ) ups decides sit . chance meeting soap salesman tyler durden ( brad pitt ) prods norton character blow up his safe , materialistic life take residence dump edge town . he tyler ( pitt ) form support group called fight club . therapy sessions include gladiator tournaments designed amp up aggression . participants emerge pulpy but there no losers . they hirelings chumps outside world . brutish matches empower them . groups prior fight club reinforced their weakness , like e.d ( erectile dysfunction . ironically , member this group , steroid abuser , breasts ) . finally they club no woman would join , real men club . fight club stunning ultra-violent open interpretation including society addiction icons . tyler durden ( pitt character ) says : " things you own end up owning you .

political/histories student studied rwandan genocide some detail , let me start just saying i impressed relatively historically accurate depictions various parties genocide(french , belgian , u.s. , u.n. , interahamwe , tutsi positions ) chronoglical events take place during movie itself . nick nolte portrayal u.n. colonel shackled bureaucracy politics ( instigated belgians who among few willing join u.n. mission but 10 peacekeepers murderered initial days genocide others withdrew support due domestic public opinion ) strikingly realistic appears draw obvious connections actions romeo dallaire who held similar post during u . . ' limited mandate rwanda events began unfold . unlike many contemporary movies which draw upon label " based true story " feature many embellishments , movie remains remarkably free dramatic flourishes or moral sermonising . person , i found it difficult not moved vivid portrayal horrors became known among worst atrocities human history ; 1 million killed less than 3 months - faster rate killing death than holocaust . indictment human indifference plight others , movie stands testament not just human suffering continues draw its historical roots european colonialism ( german belgian this instance ) but also remarkable stories survival which emerged subsequent killings . don cheadle unforgettable hotel manager who genocide brought into his home , work family chooses respond plight others around him ( hutu tutsi alike ); risking everything protect powerless voiceless . soundtrack equally brilliant ; incorporating african influences intermeshing perfectly into various scenes ( million voices ) . truly memorable touching , hotel rwanda provides insight into traditional contemporary attitude west towards africans . this perfectly captured two particular statements : one jack ( joaquin phoenix ) other colonel oliver ( nick nolte ) . it also triumphs role individual ; actions even one man help change world around him . never again	1

let me start saying first movie series absolutely fantastic . regardless fact it didn't stick few key plotlines book , everyone still great job adapting original jurassic park . then came this piece trash ... whereas first movie least attempted loosely base itself book , this one just takes brilliant writing michael chrichton throws it directly out window . first off , john hammond supposed dead . he dies end first novel . secondly ian malcome supposedly dead , or least mia end first book , we join him costarican hospital opening 2nd . there no bratty daughter , entire premise much more it . most importantly ... entire ending san diego t-rex ... which possibly worst conceived plot line history movies ... not exist book ! i went into this movie expecting tightly woven plot , huge concentration conspiracy such island exist , anticipation some good dino-scenes top it off . what i ended up getting writing equivalent monkey typewriter drooling page . not only ... but because lack plot , dino scenes complete over-kill . when you see so much it , you lose awe wonder first film . when you see brachiosaur first 20 mins original film , wonderment difficult rival . there no such moments this film . if you're looking quick fix decent looking dino fx , go nuts . however , if you're looking something more substantial actual plotline , flick off dvd player pick up book . oh one more thing ... don't go near 3rd movie . they didn't even book untrue . i can't imagine how much more long-winded rambling my review would one	-1
" finding neverland " easily one my top twenty favorite films all time , my top ten favorite films 2004 . story " finding neverland " inspired life author/playwright james . barrie who played talented johnny depp . while i wasn't convinced his scottish accent , johnny makes up it moving performance child trapped man body . stuck loveless marriage trying recover failed play , james barrie meets widow sylvia llewelyn davies ( played lovely kate winslet ) her four boys immediately strikes up genuine platonic friendship widow her boys . james ' friendship davies brothers quickly inspire him create what would eventually evolve into story peter pan . there few changes made james . barrie story but this film never claimed actual documentary or docudrama barrie life . aside , " finding neverland " truly moving film . gorgeous orchestral film score jan a.p kaczmarek helped film emotional impact especially last fifteen minutes film . all actors involved film gave wonderful performances especially kate winslet freddie highmore . dvd some excellent bonus features like outtakes which hilarious behind scene footage . after almost two years since it released , i still love watching " finding neverland " . i still get verklempt whenever i see ending which actually makes me shed tear or two	1

first , we need little truth-in-advertising here : these dvds not uncensored . " mostly uncensored " would more like it . fact , there one scene where racial " " word visually censored while same time its verbal use not . while this explained away limitation production process , it just odd makes you wonder if scene wouldn't worked better if it censored altogether . additionally , some first episodes this season almost seemed written or improvised around fact cast knew their speech not going censored , so they set throwing expletives around dizzying display adolescent-like freedom . use profanity not offensive itself , but sophomoric atmosphere it creates way below talents these gifted comic actors . taken whole , this second season downplays its parody cops which writers successfully delivered us season one . it still there , sure , but here we find ourselves more entrenched familiar arena sketch comedy . it takes ball awhile get truly rolling , first i beginning feel disappointed think i going disappointed time i got season end . but , fear not , because especially thanks efforts bad-guy minor characters , lieutenant dangle crew definitely leave us laughing . season ending double-episode works just well any other sitcom-classic season end , it we treated cameo appearances martin mull , wayne brady some missing minor characters season one we witness comedic display who " meet new boss , same old boss . " all all , just season one , these people who just fun . these season two disks highly recommended all students comedy , well others who just need good laugh . niecy nash charm thomas lennon gum-chewing , dead-pan delivery worth price admission all themselves . if you ever go " traffic school " because you've received traffic ticket , i'll bet you " stick time " you'll never class like ones administered deputies reno911 . season one , there no laugh track , bonus material commentary thrown well	1

" winnie pooh abc " original winnie pooh story designed teach rhyming , words letters . rather than straight , rote learning , this presented form half-hour adventure . things all get started when christopher robin introduces pooh book rhymes characters hundred acre woods . christopher robin lets pooh borrow book soon pooh all his friends learning rhymes , words , reading alphabet , some help wise old owl . one major complaints this movie seems it only introduces few letters . if this concern you or your child , then i recommend making sure you get dvd version not video . it wonderful special feature goes through alphabet thoroughly , characters teach each letter both upper lower-case associated words . adults probably get bored this pretty quickly , but it'll dead useful your kid(s ) . there also abc song scenes " new adventures winnie pooh " that quite worthwhile . overall , if you want your kids learn alphabet , or just wanna see good pooh story , i'd say you can't go wrong this , especially if you get dvd version . also included dvd version fast-play option previews movies such " mulan ii " " pooh heffalump movie , " well original trailer both this 123s video / dvd . there anything else i wanted say ? oh , bother . think , think , think ..	1

since " ringu " japanese horror movies all rage here us , but mind you , not all them actually any good , what works japanese audiences not necessarily translate well american moviegoers . reason hollywood studios occasionally remake japanese horror hits give them western feel , case " ring . " same happened " grudge , " movie whose original played very well japan . unlike " ring " which hwas completely westernized , " grudge " columbia pictures took more restrained route . hiring same director who created original film , leaving its location tokyo cast consisting mostly japanese actors , filmmakers added only few hollywood actors create american feel . i curious find out if they succeeded well " ring " . i found " grudge " thoroughly enjoyable tense film hat kept me edge throughout . sinister undertones film , sound effects , strong visuals course stingers , all make first rate horror film , much better than most hollywood fare recent years , though you open somewhat different eastern sensibilities film plays upon .	1
well i just finished book christine last week . i determined find movie . after searching last week , i finally bout it . i seen it few years ago when i 10 or 11 . somehow i remember it much better . but nonetheless , it great . i few problems though . generally i dont mind things rearranged or changed , but they cut out wayyy too much , completly changed ending . they practically swtiched roland lebays role george lebays role , but only partically , i quite confused when i got scene . they also completely cut out lebay possession sub-plot , thus changing arnies character . i dissapointed micheal cunninghams role this movie , first off , he didnt look like thing like i pictured him , his whole sub-plot arnie dennis completely cut , he only 10 lines entire movie . biggest dissapointment me cutting dennis/leigh subplot . ending changed totally , also disappointment . however , i like rearranging certain things , it helps flow movie much better , actors arnie dennis perfect , too bad dennis role minimized much it . effects amazing ! even now , i cant imagine them any better , this if way back 83 . music wonderful perfectly fitting , regina cunningham just i imagined her , her role isnt cut down too much though . overall , i stil recommened movie , one better movies based stephen king novel , i only say read novel first . btw , their 20 deleted scenes i am go check out right now , therefore , their should good chunck missing footage it	1
it 1961 ; ussr finally finished its nuclear powered submarine ready deploy it off east coast united states purpose ... brinksmanship ? but hold , there problem ; soviet union staffed incompetents !! (one communism most odious flaws it not inspire common man excel ) . menacing black submarine doomed get-go . it leaks , it cobbled together substandard parts . after heading out sea , there problem nuclear reactor several men must go repairs wearing only chemical suits because warehouse out radiation suits . men receive lethal doses radiation , but unfortunately doctor doesn't know anything radiation sickness ... he only giving them aspirin . before long radiation begins permeate ship . entire crew danger . officers two minds - some want save crew expense letting submarine fall into hands americans , while others want save face soviet union even if it means lot men fall sick or die . submarine becomes more more disabled , men stumble reactor room vomitting shaking , commanding officer repeatedly refuses help nearby american destroyer , submarines food supply deemed too contaminated eat , dread crew really palpable . this movie very suspenseful because i no idea how it would end . definitely worth your time	1

if you loved back future trilogy , generally speaking , time traveling extravaganzas silver screen ... simply forget buying this dvd . all well it would make you feel like total idiot first half movie , while you try figure out all " time-traveling science " you've taught so far , then space you out close end , leaving you totally speechless . this not good , simply because producers writers probably went crazy themselves trying emulate real time-traveling pros , while winding up some abrubt , nonsense end movie , absolutely no sci-fi logic all : they simply eventually stop shooting , so they just thought any happy ending would trick , no matter time differences numberless loose ends still untied plot . not sci-fi movie not romantic story either : look elsewhere any these two types movie	-1
i never bought vhs tape , but when i notified this would coming out dvd , i ordered it . while i'm not amateur , i am professional , eric guitarist guitarist . anyone who thinks he don't need learnin ' fool only famous his own little world , small it may . i'm not arrogant . danny gatton known humbler , eric johnson could rightly called inspiration . what he not so much difficult it epitome finesse transparency technique . after viewing this , you understand what i mean . i already know much what eric teaches this session , what it , private session ( much like you might get git ) , master top his craft . but there always something learn even after repeated viewings . i even scanned booklet comes this so i break lessons down blow up individual charts more easy reading . if you serious improving player , if you're looking real professional , you need get this , if only see what true professionalism looks sounds like . lessons clear focused . booklet new ability slow down examples , you really learn play these things . but don't expect sound like eric ( just those who tried , but could never sound like jimi hendrix ) . you different so always sound different , that plus . but techniques all included here part " must learn " program you need create follow if you want least make good living playing music . learn master melody technique , where technique doesn't get way melody , but lives service song -- way it should . i teach , too . i recommend any student who wants grow they should get this dvd . if you get no other , this would serve whatever style you choose pursue , ultimately , because there so much here applied virtually any style , whether it jazz , country , blues , rock or even acoustic ( which i wish he would included segment , my only kvetch )	1

i bought this dvd my third-grade twins who difficulty memorizing math facts , don't quite understand relation these math facts real world . i thought this dvd would perfect , explaining basic math facts humor real life examples . but their explanations way over heads this age group . explaining concept " carrying over " while adding , instance , here what said written out screen : " carrying over means you take digit tensplace digit place sum , carry over digit next digit place left your addition problem . you this whenever sum amount digit place greater than nine .

" munich " not one steven spielberg best films , but it still worth watching due mainly brilliant cast . eric bana , geoffrey rush , daniel craig especially outstanding . film also impressive physical production haunting john williams score . but there problems . one thing , it too long . seems problem many directors today . why all today big movies run nearly three hours ? spielberg could cut half hour , film would much better . but biggest problem spielberg , kushner , roth really stacked deck israel here . story entirely one-sided . there excellent scene where araband israeli agents confront each other , three filmmakers would wise pursue angle . instead , no explanation given arabs'side or why they seized athletes first place . result decidedly unbalalnced story . ending ambiguous . still , " munich " ambitious film worth watching	1

many say books always far better then movies . i agree this . i read whole entire series ; anne green gables rilla ingleside . i devoured every single one , enjoyed all characters sad when i finished reading them . but i say movie very , very good ! megan follows superb job portraying anne , jonathan crombie so good gilbert . every single actor beautiful job made their personalities come alive . i heard myself say , " they shouldnt made movie book , they ruined everything doing so . " but when i watch anne green gables , i say this differen t.t hey only brought more story different way . anne avonlea continuation story , i loved one just much . i say though , anne green gables continuing story disapointed me very much . they changed plot , characters still what you loved but joy you usually felt when you watched first two isn't felt when you watch this one . it so different book it made me mad . part i like it though , when anne gilbert get married , its bittersweet yet lovely part movie . end when anne finally finds gilbert , its beautiful moment too . so my opinion this : buy anne green gables , anne avonlea , story told beautiful way . but only rent anne green gables continuing story , don't buy it	1

manchurian candidate sluggish remake updating 1962 classic starring frank sinatra . this film case study why some movies should never redone . this film takes globalized issues reduces them personal jealousies . afraid assert viewpoint , script meanders . denzel washington plays sinatra role ben markoe . he seems dazed camera though he struggling remember his lines . washington , normally gifted actor , plays part without any conviction whatsoever uncharacteristically brings zero charisma role . markoe discovers his gulf war comrade-in-arms , raymond shaw , soon next vice-president united states , subject mind control experimentation manchurian global , vast multinational conglomerate . raymond handler his senator mother ( meryl streep role ice queen ) . diluting threat communism capitalism , producers lose sight most powerful elements story . after all , it no great achievement convince major american political candidate back big business , so grotesqueries shaw brainwashing get lost against backdrop , seeming less heinous than merely greedy , even when shaw becomes programmed murderer hands his avaricious , amoral , possibly incestuous mother . why film created unlikely manchurian global corporation demon day shied away any real political controversy indicative manchurian global mindset gripped hollywood . god forbid we should point finger mainland china ( or anyplace else ); it might reduce bottom line . this film says more its creators than threat it attempts portray . yourself huge favor stick original .	1
i am appalled greed disney must milk out classic like " absent minded professer " . i found this one worst if not worst remake any movie . i found plot too embelished it made relationship characters played robin williams marsha gay-hayden one where it either tried remake safe easy happy ending that throughout all disney movies , or it showed one where parties wear their hearts out their sleeves . i also feel character " flubber " it waste time considering i don't remember any merchandising character . they should've stayed bouncing rubber balls original . i also feel promotion flubber substance it all shallow , commericial where original it going put good use military , here it make buck . i feel there some movies best just left original state , not remade , this one them .	-1

this movie deals unhappiness mainly . none it characters particulary content their lives some them end up some rather bizarre escapades circumstances . anthony perkins gives great performance this one crazed street preacher . perkins underrated actor who turned some great performances . his norman bates so spot perfect most all he would ever . this great character he delivers equally well . kathllen turner superb this , she her prime here before she faded view . original eye grabber movie .	1
i heard it said norman maclean classic novella " river runs through it " finest piece american literature ever written . i don't understand how things like literature ranked such simple terms . i say , however , it one my personal favorites . spare , poetic spellbinding . perhaps one reasons i love this novella so because i grew up farm near rocky mountains , spent so much time when i younger fishing tracking through wood field . maclean tale speaks me my youth authentic familiar terms . i generally approach cinematic adaptations literature , particularly literature which i hold such high esteem , certain amount reluctance , even dread . who could possibly capture beautiful , simple craftmanship maclean profound prose celluloid ? evidently , robert redford . he it grace apparent ease . many maclean efficeintly magnificent words provided through narration . while i generally find device voiceover narration distasteful ( primarily because it so often used " coach " viewer ) , this case , viewer drawn into ( eased out ) macleans world macleans own prose , nothing could more appropriate or satisfying . also , cinematography nothing short spectacular , capturing magnificent , rugged expanse montana " big sky " wilderness one moment , golden intimacy afternoon river next . i dare say redford captured essence maclean abiding love his childhood wilderness this film , we , viewers , richer it . river runs through it close perfection i seen translating beloved work letters onto cinematic screen . it its flaws ? i'm sure it , there other reviews here point them out you if you care . my part , i wish only say this story love , crafted maclean love , now adapted screen redford care speaks love - love subject matter written words . macleans last words novella ( movie ) " i am haunted waters . " thanks his words , redfords faithful adaptation them , i too am haunted	1

" charlie chaplin marathon " inexpensive way seeing variety silent comedies chaplin . it includes versions trio chaplin two-reelers down mutual , including what arguably best this shorts , film distinction first attempt full-length comedy ( albeit not chaplin ): " rink " ( released december 4 , 1916 ) , eighth mutual comedy , based karno company sketch called " skating " written charlie brother , syd chaplin . chaplin often inspired business serving food here he ends up waiter who ends up rollers kating rink trying keep upright . course , if you already seen " modern times " you know chaplin virtuoso wheels when it comes roller skating . this time around edna purviance girl , while eric campell one her admirers , mr. stout , henry bergman plays both mrs. stout angry diner ( you imagine what charlie make diner angry ) . terms slapstick , " rink " most creative mutual two-reelers . " immigrant " ( released june 17 , 1917 ) best chaplin shorts far i am concerned . chaplin filmed 24 hours footage over two months produce 21-minute film when most two-reelers shot two days . when chaplin began , filming restaurant scene ( campbell head waiter ) , film going bohemian life , but scene too short he decided make tramp young girl immigrants , creating opening sequence boat happy ending . starting simple gag tramp leaning over ship railing turning out something other than what we think , " immigrant " classic chaplin , mixing comedy , romance , pathos . " tillie punctured romance " ( released november 14 , 1914 ) notable film not because presence chaplin , who essentially out character playing heartless sharper instead loveable tramp , but it product max sennet desire produce first feature-length comedy film history . sennett signed famous stage comedienne marie dressler film version her big success , " tillie nightmare . " massive legal entanglement resulted film sold arco $ 100,000 released " tillie punctured romance " whole bunch different lengths different soundtracks . essentially this burlesque burlesque which city slicker ( chaplin ) leads pretty country heiress ( dressler ) astray . sennett throws every trick he knows into directing this 1914 film anyone familiar work chaplin or dressler after this point dismayed their performances here . chaplin extremely deadpan dressler overly mannered ( way too much makeup ) . fortunately even his facial hair different enough us convince ourselves this not tramp therefore not real chaplin . " vagabond " ( released july 10 , 1916 ) , third two-reeler mutual , chaplin street violinist who starts off passing hat some other street musicians but takes donations goes country . there he rescues girl ( purviance ) who kidnapped band gypsies . they meet artist ( lloyd bacon ) who paints girl portrait . girl falls love artist his painting seen girl real mother . campbell plays gypsy chieftain leo white both old jew gypsy woman . this average chaplin comedy slightly lower level than other two mutuals included this dvd	1

these short films starring w.c. fields , their own right , classic comedies . uneven , some pointed out , but classic their own right . i believe problem some people fields ' sense humor it too dark and/or too adult them . fields spokesman common man , especially during depression . his comedy subversive sneaky . his complaining voice recognized voice ordinary guy under thumb everyone everything his wife mother-in-law , dogs children , rulers land very business he . kid i not " get " fields all . i didn't understand what he doing , i didn't think he funny . i much preferred laurel hardy ( whom i still adore ) charlie chase whose humor more obvious accessible me . i annoyed fields ' whining complaining , didn't get sarcastic asides , just not like him all . i grew older i began understand what it fields doing . he original , pioneer . late sam kinnison larry david seinfeld , there isn't comic writer or performer who doesn't owe something w.c. fields . all bitching moaning you hear , especially stand-ups , nothing more than fields brought into modern era . he ( mark twain before him ) spawned sly sarcastic wit american comic dialogue long before it commonly accepted or widely appreciated . make no mistake : fields ' humor masks real pain . what we hear his whiny voice suffering man who can't catch break save himself . he championing all losers , little guys , nobodies , if it sounds bitter times , well ... it . i agree some other reviewers here when they say one must grow up go through certain amount real-life experiences before fields truly grasped ultimately - if you're lucky - embraced . otherwise you better off three stooges marx brothers . their worlds completely unreal whereas fields ' world all too real . it place escape * * not into , what you hear fields ' beaten-down characters sound man dragged through knothole backwards . ekw	1

aaron russo very brave man his production this outspoken film . he should commended his efforts regardless some minor inaccuracies , such , " there no law .

this great movie . several reasons some guys questioning fact this movie too bloody . but here it noble purpose . ( this not sin city or reservoir dogs ) read gospels . our saviour didn't come here pleasure , or chatting herod , drink some wine , wonderful feasts marry beautiful girl ( some fools say he married mary magdalene)and eternally happy hollywood wants us believe . no . he came here redeem us . he came here show us how christian should face suffering above this , he came here show us real face father , our father love . seeing this movie seeing how much jesus loves us . meditation passion christ devotion devotions . lot conversions occurred after people started meditating these sufferings our lord . all saints meditated them profound devotion them . even more , they recommended this devotion order obtain real sanctity life , because real love ( only somebody willing suffer like this die you , really loves you ! ) attracts lovers . regarding accusations " antisemitism " , i just one recommendation . it not secret jews hate jesus his church . this movie only describes what really happened according gospels . sympathetic sanhedrin would lie . they wanted jesus dead that what mel shows us this movie . what wrong ??? but if you're christian you'll understand devil who doesn't want people watch this movie because jesus ' victory against him cross . buy this movie !!!!	1

this easily one worst movies i've ever seen mostly because it most unoriginal movie i've ever seen . most scenes ripping off stuff cannibal holocaust , zombie , or george romero " dead " movies ( sometimes even stealing lines night living dead ) , not mention entire soundtrack lifted dawn dead . course there also horrible overracting , inane storyline , but those pale comparision blatet unoriginality movie . now good : gore . if you're one those types check out horror movies see some sweet gore effects genuinely disgusted , then you might want see this movie because gore pretty top notch , especially facial dismemberment final scene . what it comes down you should really avoid this movie unless you're absolutely obsessed gore . if you really must see this movie , i recommend you buy it part " walking dead fright pack " anchor bay released because this movie you'll actually get some good ones like some lucio fulci later work criminally cheesey " dead heat .	1
this second season mission : impossible we see peter gravesintroduced head impossible missions force , roleof jim phelps , replacing steven hill dan briggs . dan briggscharacter more cerebral , jim phelps character more physical . both characters their supporters , although i tend preferjim phelps . it noteworthy i don't believe there anyother television series could replace its lead actor nothave it affect shows quality or popularity . this becausemi " plot driven " rather than " character driven " . indeed , two morecentral characters would leave after season 3 ( rollin cinammon ) andyet series would go several more seasons , indicatingthe outstanding quality plots , direction production . general , i feel overall quality series improved thesecond third seasons . there episodes first season thatare good any ever produced ( e.g. operation rogosz , carriers , frame well pilot episode ) , but there good numberof weaker stories . second season sees overall stronger effort . whereas first season still some 1960's-staple car chases , shootouts fist fights , these pretty much disappear second season emphasis outwitting enemy clever plots ingenious gadgets . especially noteworthy " trial fury " which especially intensestory , masterfully directed leonard horn who also equally intense " operationrogosz " , " photographer " great performance anthony zerbe who plays son convicted atomic scientist out revenge , unusual episode called " town " where jim drugged held prisonerby evil enemy agent played otherwise grandfatherly geer . seeing masterpiece television series like this made 40 years ago only make us lament dismal state art today	1

effective ghost story should air mystery it : why there ghost ? what purpose ghost haunting particular place or person ? modicum pathos also important truly emotional turn screw , ghost cannot only vindictive or vengeful , but must sadness it ; something we empathize make haunting all more tragic , well spooky . gore also must kept minimum , effective ghost story relies creating sustaining balanced mood tension . too much gore balance shifts into rapid moments revulsion anxiety , whereas good ghost story relies impression subtlety , implying more than actually shown . whispering corridors ghost story expertly balances social commentary regarding south korean girls ' school ( why ) , pathos duality ghost it moves normalcy ( daylight ) vengeance spirit ( night ) , symbolic use blood tell moving tale loss , redemption , continued loss . it opens our ghost prowling girl school grounds dark stormy night ( i know , but it dark stormy ) , ready exact vengeance teacher mistreated her . teacher discovered ghost secret , thus seals her fate . discovery murdered teacher cinematic style ; first showing face student she reacts seeing mrs. parks ' hanging body walkway , then showing back student she views body , her head blocking our view , finally , camera ' steps ' left student , show hanging body farground , back student foreground , side side . other student reactions then shown still shots they come upon body . muted colors throughout film lend stark , rather cold aspect events unfold girl school , putting more emphasis callous indifference mistreatment students their emotional needs . male teachers school come off chauvinistic condenscending all-girl classroom , become violent toward students little provocation . one teacher particular , mr. oh ( mad dog , students call him ) , his stick sarcastic unstable temperament , reminded me math teacher i suffered through one semester . he also carried stick whacked students little provocation . learning intimidation threat , whether south korean all-girls school , or north american all-boys school , not conducive true learning environment . it this restrictive , competitive , uncreative classroom environment our ghost born haunts day night ; day , one students attended class years without any teacher noticing her , night , vengeance spirit , murdering those teachers mistreated her any other girl . pathos brought into story ghost need normal , relive her classroom life again again hopes getting it right . she not want hurt anyone , but those annoyingly vindictive sadistic teachers keep mistreating students , thus bring vengeance spirit night , exact revenge . while vengeance ghost appears only three times film , each occurrence filled supernatural events build into violent attack bloodily carried out , but not gorily so . blood used symbolically here , not shock value , especially end , when classroom becomes inundated blood ghost finds release stops her haunting . i should point out there sequelization-antic ( aka ' not over yet folks ' ) used end film , but this case , it fits perfectly within logic story , serves heighten tragedy film social commentary focusing : how south korean girls school system repressive , demoralizing , , some , downright fatal . how sad this commentary also said our own school system	1

recent films covering lives and/or careers artists , basquiat among best . while spanning less than 10 years life this musician cum artists cum celebrity , it all one needs comprehend how this prodigy became overwhelmed fame fortune . juxtaposed against warhol , who profoundly understood dimensions celebrity , we see basquiat quite opposite -- naive point charming , overwhelmed times , utimately seduced all nefarious world which booze , drugs , sex all there taking . but this all seen before lives people such belushi , joplin , hendrix , slew others ; so much early death young star seems become almost archetype . yet it still intrigues us multiple reasons , , pointed out early movie , death artist seem mystify both work person . would basquiat nearly famous now , he cleaned up continued painting ? we might guess if case there would probably not movie him . this serves illuminate other burning questions indirectly offered film : basquiat really good artist , or he right place right time when new york art market eighties bullish way probably never seen again ? , schnabel canonizing basquiat into league mythical artist ? whatever answers may , i honestly say my interest thoroghly piqued , so i equally curious basquiat i his place time . perhaps it schnabel artist shines through much film , moreso than schabel writer/director . basquiat movie replete symbolism , both overt covert . give example each , narrative film enhanced several occasions sub-narrative surfing -- hopefully all you need know . otherwise , direction cinematography seems follow basquiat life career , where choppy editing eccentric montage play almost sub-character . it should noted many characters movie fact compounds various people throughout his life during this time . course , andy andy , rene rene , largely , his art dealers his dealers , but beyond his friends girlfriends movie generally cover multiple personages . end , tale basquiat tragic but compelling , it movie deserves multiple viewings , especially those interested art world , or who like good bio-pic . some fiction , some fact , but otherwise contextually acurate	1
i'm fan reality television even though contestants survivor big brother completely artificial situation , far reality . yet nobody writing their script ; they writing themselves . these comments also relevant this excellent documentary young bob dylan tour england 1965 . i don't like spotlight reviews this site . they too " expert " don't get everything right . they too full themselves . one main impressions i get this documentary concerns clash beautiful brilliant dylan , who actually doing something good world , reporters/critics . true , dylan very confrontational them , but they lucky his attention all . it seems like these nothings , these cogs wheels employ them , don't get point all . point hattie carroll , murdered rich apathetic white s.o.b. getting away it . point bob dylan coming out saying something needs said . point bob dylan believes right wrong , therefore mouthpiece god , cutting through all our crap . very few others doing this time . not too many doing it now either . put radio . what you hear ? you hear personal lyrics , i love you , i find you attractive , i'm mad you , whatever . one genre you hear you worthless except degree you turn me , singer worth more than you because he fancier car more expensive jewelry , blow you away shotgun . what bunch baloney . what kind values we offering young people who listen this idiocy think it cool ? then you dylan . justice . poetry . intelligence . how often you hear lyric radio intelligent ? contrast dylan this documentary some more recent dylans . you know song union sundown ? that one ripping globalization shreds , decade before everyone else realized it needed stopped , way maximize profits paying pennies labor , firing american workers replacing them slave labor overseas . contrast dylan this younger one . more modern one , older one , isn't physically beautiful anymore , isn't pixyish darling anymore , but he just target , just sharp penetrating . one highlights this video live performance beginning it all over now baby blue special request donovan . first , donovan sings perfectly nice song , then dylan sings freaking masterpiece . i like way dylan smiles he sings " yonder stands your orphan " . think line . your orphan ? means you dead , doesn't it . i like dylan smile he sings line , smile saying hey , listen lyric , get it ? it one really interesting lines it all over now , baby blue . albert hall , dylan alone his guitar harmonica , no band behind him , he mesmerizing world most elite audience , beatles among them . he doing it just himself , his brilliant self . i like most commentary . this one few videos where i played film second time listen whole commentary . it funny way one commentators gives all his reasons pleased hattie carroll cut off before its climactic ending thunderous applause , then other commentator , who obviously right , completely disagrees what we've listening , perfectly non-confrontational way , says one song should shown its entirety . far detracting effectiveness film , this song would made entire point film , dylan powerhouse . real people , worth watchin	1

this really fun movie . funny , too , but also fun . i great time watching this , unlike many other drama / comedies , every point where it could easily become tear-jerker , writers broke it up some comedy . they pull it off well , entire movie comes together very smoothly . addition great story , chemistry jolie pitt absolutely evident ~ perfect way add fire already great story . if you like love stories but frequently find them too sappy , or if you like action flicks but frequently get bored gratuitous violence , you'll probably like this movie , which strikes nice balance both . i highly recommend it	1

here one word sums up this film : beauty . plot " house flying daggers " ( original title : " shi mian mai fu " ) lacking , but way it made up intoxicating sets , costumes , exquisite love story . zhang yimou backs away grandeur " hero " favor more intimate story . it 859 a.d. , near end corrupt tang dynasty . guerilla rebellion called house flying daggers ( who able throw knives great distances ) sprung up against government . despite loss their leader , rebels thriving . deputy jin ( takeshi kaneshiro ) decides go undercover infiltrate house , he tries get trust blind courtesan mei ( zhang ziyi ) , daughter house dead leader . but soon he begins fall love mei , jeopardizing his loyalties , while mei herself experiencing confusion . but government officials want mei dead because her sympathies -- even worse , they don't realize jin undercover . make things worse , jin not only rival mei love -- his best friend well . director zhang yimou apparently said " hero " warm-up " house flying daggers . " it seem more polished fully realized , without " rashomon " storytelling . instead war movie , it mixture fairy-tale romance beauty , spies guerilla warfare . final half-hour stumbling block , where some plot threads come unravelled . things get pretty confusing . zhang doesn't drop ball far stylism goes -- color exquisite details every frame . they almost intoxicating effect , so action sequences . one most memorable scenes ziyi performing " echo game , " where she strikes drums particular rhythm her flowing clothing . not mention balletic , dreamlike fight bamboo forest , participants soaring dipping like cirque de soleil dancers . it all completely unreal , but there lies its beauty , like painting sky focuses sun not clouds . this entirely zhang ziyi picture -- since her debut " road home , " ziyi proved herself wonderful actress . " house flying daggers " focuses mostly ziyi , she gives truly exquisite performance , particularly when she pretends blind woman -- watch her face . two supporting actors , andy lau takeshi kaneshiro , solid job their roles , particularly kaneshiro , who brings plenty life what could cliched bad-cop-turned-lover . " house flying daggers " worth seeing just see -- it visual ecstacy packed around fairly typical love triangle plot slightly disappointing final half hour . but sights alone this intimate love story exquisite	1

this film loosely based upon robert ludlum book " bourne identity " . it not faithful adaptation nor it intended . book just springboard something little different . read book loved it , i also really enjoyed this movie . they both excellent . each forges its own path entertains its own way . plot simple , or so it seems . man found ocean two bullets his back . he rescued trawler italian fishermen . when he regains total consciousness , he no idea who he or what he doing caused him floating ocean condition which he . he shortly discovers his name jason bourne , it appears great many people trying kill him , though what purpose he no idea . jason bourne ( matt damon ) also discovers he some unusual gifts automatic , instinctive responses certain situations . it turns out he natural " bourne " killer ( pun intended ) . jason teams up german expatriate named maria ( franka potente ) , together they run into some heavy duty action , they run their lives . meanwhile , team cia trained assassins , dispatched bourne boss , cia honcho named conklin ( chris cooper ) , hot plucky couple trail . there number stunts action scenes guaranteed make one palms start sweat . matt damon , looking very buff , portrays bourne intelligent , resourceful character core goodness imbedded his assassin psyche . he simply terrific . franka potente good free spirited maria , who also resourceful jason love interest film , though , quite frankly , very few sparks fly them . chris cooper excellent bourne boss , conklin . he coldly efficient brutal his mop-up operation . unlike bourne , he lacks core goodness . this action packed , inventive , spy thriller hold viewer its thrall . this film revives genre film beginning get little stale . kudos damon giving viewer something fresh entertaining this genre . this film well worth one personal collection	1

i enjoyed agatha christie novels dvd - they restore television its primary mission : entertainment . this twisting plot no exception ! land irag , filled sun science archeology , expedition runs into trouble when murder rears its head . fortunately , indomitable poirot scene ! he unravels deep complexities murder(s ) , entangling alliances , takes axe root bitterness jealousy . all all , story thoroughly entertaining mystery unfolds marvelous way . like following breadcrumbs expected end , director leads us inexorably , but logically , conclusion . so , put fire , micro popcorn , sit back relax enjoy pure entertainment .... again	1

epic telling epic historical events . feel extent roman slavery given scenes mines gladiatorial training centers horizon filled crosses end . one great themes this film integrity bravery some " lowliest " slaves reminding us it these qualities make us human not our station life . readiness rebels end stand up counted leader culmination theme ; ending scene still brings chills every time i see it . even such moving serious themes , however , film sprinkled places humor wit , especially slave-trader character mr. ustinov . deleted scenes , such one tony curtis bathhouse , build what only hinted original release making widespread treatment such slaves more apparent . some ways , i think i prefer hint rather than more direct portrayal but it still tasteful manner convey types abuse brought rebellion . gladiator fights battle scenes still some best ever made . i still enjoy them even more than more recent movie similar genre , " gladiator . " all actors portray spartacus since continue difficulty living up standard set gritty yet compassionate kirk douglas portrayal . his portrayal noble slave challenging innequities superpower churn memories similar times similar men women who chafed manacles slavery injustice throughout history . time time , it necessary challenge inconsistencies society considers itself enlightened yet continues oppress few deemed unimportant . thomas jefferson once said , " little rebellion now then ... medicine necessary sound health government .

entertaining double creature -- er , , double feature inspired tv tales crypt ( which itself inspired identically titled , delightfully decadent ec comics 1950s ) . first bill demon knight ( 1995 ) . surface , this one typical tale good-versus-evil , noble agent heaven working protect mankind evil demon who , help his minions , seeks throw veil darkness over universe oppress mankind process . trite , yes , but good script , talented cast ( including billy zane wonderfully smarmy demon ) , high production values raise this one notch or two above average morality play . weakest element film crypt-keeper wraparound , which too much tv show cheesy feel ( though it feature uncredited cameo john larroquette , whom hardcore genre fans know opening narrator 1974 original texas chain saw massacre ) . story proper drawn script originally written independently tv series -- which probably why it rises head shoulders above it -- many its elements read like homage george romero classic night living dead ( 1968 ) more than offspring series or comics inspired i t.t he second feature bordello blood ( 1996 ) . many fans critics panned this one bromidic therefore unworthy follow-up demon knight , while it true many story elements worn vampire-movie clich�s , film certainly delivers what tales crypt title promises genre fans . plot involves beautiful redheaded super-vampiress who manipulated smug , ingratiating christian evangelist into running vampire brothel serves lure society undesirables their doom . chris sarandon riotously chews scenery perverse proselytizer , snl alum dennis miller delivers lots laughs cynical pi hired locate teenage victim whoring vamps . film biggest fault probably gratuitous ta misogynistic undertones , but considering 50% mainstream film industry target audience horny teenage males , such elements hardly surprising . other words , bordello blood admittedly not high cinema , but there loads things keep genre fans interested , its overall tone more line tv show spawned it than its predecessor , demon knigh t.t he digital transfers both films clear crisp , while short extras , each film paired its original theatrical trailer . all all , this dvd duo well worth reasonable asking price	1

i first saw orson welles artsy adaptation franz kafka masterpiece some twenty years ago . stark images this black white film stuck me ever since . very young anthony perkins ( he made this film couple years after psycho ) stars joseph ., ordinary insurance clerk who wakes up one morning find himself under arrest . despite his best efforts , . cannot find anyone who or tell him crime which he charged . after series distressing conversations , respectively , closed-mouth arresting authorities , his narrow-minded landlady his paranoid fellow boarder ( exotic dancer ) , he frantically searches throughout his unnamed city , progressively more disturbing encounters ( beautiful seductive young woman webbed fingers , mass children hysterically playing maze-like building , etc . ) . movie director makes appearance advocate who may or may not answers . ' questions . virtually everything this movie symbolic meaning -- every sideways glance , every slip tongue ( listen closely during unnerving initial interrogation where perkins nails two freudian slips one after other ) . much film set bombed out , abandoned railway station , which only adds viewer uneasiness . also much movie filmed dark , certainly symbolic movie theme . film score arrangement adagio albiononi concerto minor . its slow , dark sad melody fits tone movie perfectly . this not entertaining or ' feel good ' movie . it -- like classic novel upon which it based -- intriguing , horrifying unforgetable . orson welles believed this his finest film . it certainly most intellectually-satisfying horror film i've ever seen .	1

derek jarman ' sebastiane ' momentous painting which simply brushed film rather than canvas . this master work should any serious film buff cabinet . ( i should very much like see it running continuously upon smooth stone wall monumental pillared vestibule - perhaps like four seasons new york . it visual beauty should constantly view . not one element could added or deleted . if i may continue painting analogy , each stroke , whether finished or raw melds this work into composition which i think flawless . men beautiful , but tangible human manner . settings , whether diocletian startling lurid palace or rough bare terrain sardinia evoke both pagan christian motifs flawlessly . good evil ( all shades ) found both places ; irony world it always . homoerotic nature film vicseral , candid rather than overtly condescending - it might well set modrn iraq 21st century troops . i felt each character longings , whether god carnal flesh or human love companionship or spiritual other worldly deity . recognituion each these forms eros may entertwine meld genious . it everyman . it scrupulus portrait easily duplicit qualities beauty , deceipt , brutality even truth . powerful stuff .	1
those us who went through " josie grossie " stage , this movie welcome comedy , sort revenge nerds meets princess diaries . josie gellar ( drew barrymore ) , 25-year-old copy editor/reporter , never quite gotten over her traumatic high school years , replete bad hair days insensitive classmates . understandably , she mixed emotions when her boss , noticing how young she looks , decides josie go undercover give " sun " readers latest scoop high school life . so back fast times ridgemont high ... not only josie anxious this assignment , but she worried her personal life . 25 , josie never even kissed guy ( or rather , kissed guy) -- but she doesn't just want kiss any guy , but someone really special . while researching this high school expose , josie painful flashbacks she witnesses how kids treat each other . ( woman pretty drew barrymore would willing look bad she possibly sheer dedication her art ! ) through her brother influence popular kids ( he earns coolness points local baseball phenomenon ) , josie gets inducted alpha crowd unwittingly slights her " uncool " ( second-time around ) high school friends . josie enjoys her english class surprises her teacher , uber-handsome sam coulson , her love words knowledge subject . meanwhile , sun eavesdrops josie her high school adventures . sam ( michael vartan ) , noplussed josie maturity yet apparent youth . when he learns josie undercover reporter , he becomes hurt angry . josie tries apologize through very tabloid brought her trouble -- readers anxiously await see if sam meet josie baseball stadium deliver her first kiss before appointed time . ( let me interject my own two cents here : michael vartan hot ... he my ideal body type , sigh ... i writhing jealousy during kissing scene ! )this movie hilarious well-written . it accused formulaic , but so what ? it good message very funny . my friends i never tire watching this movie , expression , " josie grossie " taken life its own . when we show pictures our childhood each other , we often qualify them , " this picture taken my josie grosie years . " ( you know , glasses , braces , bad hair , works ... ) or , even our grown-up years , we'll tell each other if we're feeling particularly josie grossie given day .	1
i thoroughly enjoyed animals would liked more info given them . movie pure entertainment wonderful color [ except coloring tiger black ] weird ! they leave off technical jargon - i want hear animals how some scenes shot - how actors played their parts etc . what rigors actors go through ? set making interesting oh , yeah , didn't they know anything horses ? definitely fun movie	1
i find it odd when reviewing reviews this film people seem either give it perfect or abysmal scores . dichotomy opinion probably direct result skill immense power leconte images , ( especially those his chosen actress affords us ) . leconte master quite possibly greatest living auteur currently making films . his movies often contain refreshing difficulty gives one hope images still mean something , film still worthy explicated , someone still cares enough think much without overly clever such coens anderson . i shouldn't say still . i should say , leconte different level than any who ever worked including kieslowski ( master images ) . i enjoy how leconte said although it his second period piece he approached film if nothing it , learning " ridicule " . i should point out i no problem " ridicule " fact it period piece great deal presentation , but i see what he meant . like i said , i enjoy statement , but i should also point out i'm jerk . binoche auteuil two my favorite actors this film shows them their virtuosic best . they deliver amazing performances truly passionate couple who both hold unconditional love other which itself contains ultimate trust decision character . possibly more auteuil binoche but sympathy generated his character fuels her equally sharing partner , making any difference negligible . there third character , neel , but he there only accentuate relationship other two . movie , quite simply unconditional love what it means love unconditionally . there subplot equal merits ( mainly concerning neel ) belief redemption , what it truly means believe redemption . short it consequences action through belief , more so out love than those moral ground or stance . some people not willing accept belief actions or should occur solely out sympathy . some people never allow themselves love unconditionally . some people not understand or even like this film . binoche deserves prize doesn't yet exist her most exquisite performance . leconte deserves recognition what he what he given us this film , certainly one best i ever seen .	1

great show series " masters horror " . this episode ellen ( bree turner ) driving through mountains when she accident . she goes check other car when she runs into psycho freak moonface ( john de santis ) . there subsequent babe chased through woods killer , but twist ; she trained survivalist who set up neat rambo-like booby traps forest . she finally taken obligatory house horrors . you tell there much this story than first meets eye . production value top notch , it looks great , even if it kind " friday 13th " knock-off . horror favorite angus scrimm here , this time he plays much more animated character than tall man . he guy knows what going explains it . really stand out feature woman ellen , who much stronger than usual scream-queen ; more like buffy vampire slayer . if there one complaint it this ; don coscarelli notorious his quirky horror fantasy " phantasm " , but there little quirky wit here , it just straight stalk slash slasher . other wise great entry wonderful series .	1

my grandmother introduced me danny kaye movies starting white christmas court jester . later i found movies like secret life walter mitty just funny . i hooked danny kaye actor/comedian . this not one his outrageously hilarious movies . it sad beautiful wonderful plotline . wonderful cast compliments danny kaye musical score fantastic -- very jazzy rag . louis armstrong duets danny kaye voice well trumpet ( coronet ) . my favorite song lullabye ragtime , though . they manage meld two different melodies perfectly . movie focuses life red nichol ( danny kaye ) small-town coronet player trying make it big music industry . he falls love gets married , but just he starting make it big-time his wife gets pregnant . they take baby road them long they but it no life child . eventually she sent boarding school where she contracts polio . red so overcome guilt he gives up everything he music industry help his daughter get well walk again . time she grown up able stand again she forgotten her father ever music industry . red wife all his old band buddies want him happy get back into music , but red keeps falling into depression punishing himself his daughter polio . it ends beautifully all his band buddies turning out hear him play his daughter walking towards him without her cane them dancing together . it makes me cry every time . i would highly recommend this anyone feel good , slice-of-life movie both it joyous highs rock-bottom lows .	1
i think i like this season much more than than season 2 . only thing time i truly find out sort fact they didn't format episodes chronilogical order . episode el viejo placed second disc ( i believe second disc ) which comes after episode showing how crockett lost his black car ( before he gets testerosa ) . all honest i believe episode accidently left out season 2 . but spite little minor detail i believe anyone who buys seasons 3 4 won't sorry .	1

i mark points off because weirdness nick bottom wife , but i don't really mind all much change scene ( although characters might better named things like lorenzo antonio , but i don't like quibble over these things . much . ) otherwise , it all very fun . rustic players my favorite part . michelle pfeiffer okay titania , but rupert everett better oberon . calista flockhart appropriately befuddled " painted maypole . " she appear tall ! other reviewer who posted eyebrow-raising range accents right . sheeeesh . actress who played ' ermia worst , but thankfully , cockney twang sort faded end movie . all all , very enjoyable	1

i first saw this when i like 6 years old . i remember renting this my mom cousin . like lot people , my mom no idea who david cronenberg . well , she known , i'm sure she would not let her 6 year old son watch flick . main thing i remember this guy getting his arm torn off baboon getting pulverised . those pretty gross scenes . however , i buy this recently , realized , yes it still gross , it not age extremely well . but , i must say , jeff goldblum pretty good . he bit too quirky first , but i figured they wanted him this geeky guy so when his fly-like abilities started kicking , it would show extreme opposite what his original character . this would also cause sympathy towards end even though he became , basically dick middle movie . i suggest buying this , especially cronenberg fans	1
love story all , great acting , great script , great music , great cinematography , great directing . i appreciate this film	1
i originally purchased this 2 dvd set 1959 lana turner /juanita moore second screen version which it includes . i captivated emotional storyline , especially juanita moore presence . highlight film mahalia jackson singing " trouble world . " after viewing 1959 version , i pleasently surprised find 1934 claudette colbert / louise beavers version included this set even more captivating . while basic plotline same , characters bit more down earth , therefore more relatable most people . there also better love story this version . it easy see why it acadamy award nominated best picture . both these films choose wonderful option dvd viewing . reason i docked it star , because i initialy found it difficult decipher which film which side dvd , since it written such tiny print around center ring , so i flip dvd first couple times i watched it , until i figured it out . course , could just me	1

whilst i find comedy greats series personally more enjoyable , you cant go past interviews like brando or welles . cavett somethingn naturally accessible because i think he very close " average " person this position . or rather , he makes it look way . brando interview astounding : he arrogant , genius , mad ? make up your own mind but you wont able turn it off ! welles comes across like no other alive today : he spent time greats , lived among them dont miss his anecdotes churchill . better than run mill rubbish tv today , i assure you . oh yes , groucho makes yet appearance . cant get enough him neither could cavett it seemed	1

grand-daddy all vampire movies - there may earlier ones , but murnau 1922 nosferatu one we all remember - still pretty effective . count orlok ( max schreck ) wants buy house bremen , na�ve ambitious real estate agent hutter travels his gloomy castle deal . while there hutter spills little blood ( those red marks his neck aren't , he believes , pesky mosquitoes ) , worse , he drops cameo portrait his `pure ' wife ellen (`nice neck ' ) under , er , robust nose contract-signing count . if you've seen any vampire movie made since then , there thousands them , you pretty much connect dots set-up end . nosferatu least frightening , yet most disturbing , movie i've seen . set against deserted barren landscapes cragged castles enveloping arches , populated characters who flow one extreme pose , shadowed freudian debris blistered imagination bram stoker , framed focused through expressionist lens german director f.w. murnau , nosferatu filmed nightmare . today standards acting broadly melodramatic resoundingly bad , ham upon ham . orlok , dracula character , taloned pointy-toothed grotesque . poor hutter bouncing halfwit . nobody nothing reflects reality this picture , least waking reality . honest , nosferatu didn't begin work me right away . i saw it years ago bad vhs tape wasn't very impressed . image print clean , many delicately tinted sequences ( original , i believe ) good commentary track . still , after first viewing i something close my original reaction . i watched it couple other times after , once commentary track , found acting increasingly less distracting images more insinuating disturbing . it certainly movie grows each viewing . highly recommended .	1

i bought this movie because manson it i appreciate his artistic ability . also , prior buying movie i read description thought plot sounded interesting . movie , though not terrible , not excel any criteria . acting seems forced , special effects poor , plot starts get repetitive uninteresting . manson , most stars , only movie very brief periods time . movie revolves around screwed up mother who retrieves her son his foster parents after 6 years . mother addicted drugs neglects her child while exposing him evil outside world . many scenes no relevance actual movie end movie there no apparent moral or lesson . if you want see " dark " movie such this one fantastic acting actual plot i would recommend requiem dream	1
i loved this movie just much first one which just much critics hated it . i don't know why i still read what they say because they led me astray way too many times . especially when it comes movie like this where i know before hand i probably like it . i loved fact they continued this movie damn near right after ending first one , i enjoyed graphic nature series . who cares special effects if story keeps you engaged all way through , least enough get over any possible crappy fx scenerios . if you want great special effects , but crappy plot , go watch van helsing . that one movie i consider terrible	1

early going , i thought choice four five stars . movie progressed , my rating dropped somewhere three four , so clearly first half movie better than second . ending so disappointing i drop my rating two stars . it polish man france who marries french girl but divorced her because he unable make love her . he returns poland without her , manages get rich , comes up plot get revenge his beloved dominique . problem this writing he loves her , so why he plotting revenge against her ? it senseless . ending utterly surreal . she should hate him what he her , but she smiling him . he looking her crying . he betrayed her cruel way . he doesn't right crying her . like hitler crying jews . he still position help her out , but he won't . it really pretty sickening . story becomes unclear enough it , without adding some fantasy scenes or memories wedding kiss . it left me angrily saying " what hell going ? " i really hate it when director becomes unclear plays audience . i don't find cute all . tell damn story tell it clearly . besides , ending sucks	1

no doubt " world war " probably best documentary ever made second world war but since beginning i problems playing this dvd set various dvd players . i consider myself serious dvd collector trying keep every disc clean possible following every instruction avoid scratches dirt . i know very first dvds this series sold public problematic but i thought mine weren't . yet , almost three years purchase , 3 out 5 discs completely unplayable althought none them no noticeable scratch . needless say i tested them many computer dvds stand-alone players various brands without success . i not know if this problem related fact these only dual-layered double-sided discs ( dvd 18 ) i ever seen because vast majority dvds sold around single-sided single-layered ( dvd5 ) or single sided double-layered ( dvd9 ) none them brought me such headaches . i wasted us$ 99 , 99 something i expected last much much longer .	1
begin , i am not big fan cary grant , except his hitchcock movies , where he excellent . i enjoy him much katharine hepburn bringing up baby . he very good eagle hawk fredric march . he tolerable philadelphia story talk town . friend mine loaned me this dvd ; she just bought it . i wanted see what cary would this film , i wanted see him dress . start , movie slow boring , all jokes so lame not all funny . i also don't go films where man woman yell each other dislike each other , then some point realize it really love they feel each other . come ! i just can't understand sort romance situation . i felt cary showed " mean streak " he show some his films , romance situation this story . i rate this one star because it one those films you get bored right beginning it sort torture waiting it finally end . all while i kept saying , " let move , let end this thing , when he put dress ?... " but they dragged it out boring , corny jokes . part we wanted see , cary dress , very end not very much . overall , this film real disappointment letdown . only consolation i saw it free ; i didn't buy it or rent it . still , i wasted good time i could used more profitable enjoyable way . i would even enjoyed washing kitchen full dirty dishes more than watching this movie ! sum it up , very very boring dumb movie , not waste your time .	-1
volume 5 far my favorite volume my-hime series ! this volume explores not only main characters , but other hime well little more than previous ones . now hime must fight one , everyone struggles seem come surface plot grows darker . there none those annoying filler episodes either , so you won't need worry entertained ! if you pay attention , you catch certain hints dropped throughout volume further explored connected volume 6 .	1

1984 pop-rock opera cult classic streets fire , eddie cruisers ( 1983 ) marks high-water mark michael pare less-than-stellar acting career . pare , late-blooming denizen clenched jaw school acting , eddie , iconoclastic leader north jersey 1950s doo-wop band , one-hit wonder , cruisers , whose 1963 hit , " dark side " rediscovered , circa 1983 , leading popular cruisers revival . two decades later , maggie ( ellen barkin ) music reporter who indefatigable hunting down surviving band members , most whom leading exceptionally colorless lives . she driven rumors " lost " cruisers album , " season hell , " which reputedly earth-shattering . story unfolds through series flashbacks , we meet eddie , egotistical greaser , archetypal leader pack . his band rounded out his eye-candy girlfriend , joanne ( singing vocals ) , his clarence clemons-inspired jazz-sax friend wendell , sal amato , marginally talented guitarist old neighborhood , kenny drummer , doc manager , frank ridgway ( tom berenger ) , lyricist " word man .

i love , love , love this movie . every time i watch this movie i am enthralled great acting beautiful yet haunting music . this movie very little dialogue , however , it very memorable piece art . thandie newton plays woman who lost her husband cruel injustices her african country moves rome study medicine . she supports herself live maid pianist . very early movie we learn her employer fallen love her . when she laughs his advances he begs her let him prove his love her . she eventually tells him only way he prove his love free her husband his african prison . he realizes then she married but he made promise prove his love goes selling his art furniture free her husband . haunting beauty this film up close shots thandie newton face she expresses joy , sadness , fear remorse . she expresses all her emotions without speaking words draws audience inside her we experience her inner turmoil . she realizes what her employer doing her her husband she slowly begins realize she some feelings him . yet , because lack dialogue we never sure whether her feelings result her gratefulness or true desire . my only sore point ending this film leaves you hanging . you want beautiful african maid her white lovestruck employer together , but we not get american style finished ending . we left make our own interpretations . i am actually going purchase this movie soundtrack . that how wonderful i think it	1
yes , some acting bad . yes , story isn't plausible . yes , special effects should better . but , hey this movie . i gave it 4 stars because casper van dien movie . i like see him movies but i little disappointed because he didn't even his shirt off . ok , unless you casper van dien fan or movie fan you probably not enjoy this movie . but , if you realize it movie it some good acting it , you may just enjoy it	1
you tell this movie released 1998 because you still see new york twin towers standing , because groveling incantations " islam religion peace , " repeated often enough ( casting good guy arab cop , tony shalhoub ) offset any pc-incorrect image portraying islamofascist terrorism . measure how silly this movie appears rearview mirror 2006 all ghastly islamofascist atrocities since 9/11 first terrorist scene movie , where denzel washington fbi agent tries , via megaphone , talk terrorists down hostage situation . he succeeds getting terrorists let children exit bus . jihadis conscience -- now where we ever seen this actually happen - beslan ( 186 children killed) ? london ? madrid ? mumbai ? only old people start exit bus second appeal denzel bus blow up . after series bombings new york supermarkets , movie theaters , restaurants , etc ., pressure builds call u.s. army under martial law . bruce willis , army commander who take this task , warns time again this isn't proper role army , but then , one president advisors explains movie , if this just one those political things , " president wants appear presidential . " remember , this 1998 , though critics movie , such new yorker , refer willis character " fascist u.s. army general " , decision grant him martial law authority would , ahem , none other than bill clinton . movie slides little detail , however , make it look like willis , all his own , rounding up all able-bodied men muslim persuasion ( less draconian , way , than rounding up all japanese-americans west coast fdr , where threat less real imminent than this movie , but let not talk , either ; we're still 1998 , after all ) . course , cia comes its usual whipping hollywood , where cia agent annette bening kept crucial facts herself because she personal scores settle -- you see , she one who trained armed some these terrorists who now running amok . oh , yeah , sure , women-hating al-qaeda types would allow somebody like pretty annette train them ! but best nonsense comes end : denzel washington handful fbi agents rush into army combat hq somehow surround bruce willis pull their guns , saying he under arrest " violating constitution " ( hey , why aren't they arresting guy who ordered martial law , bill clinton ? ) . general clueless security detail also draws its guns , there mexican standoff . denzel , using same powers persuasion freed least kiddies islamofascist murder bus , appears succeeding talking army soldiers out using their guns protect willis . so willis accepts situation , allows himself arrested , credits roll we see all these army vehicles leaving brooklyn shame -- all it took bust " fascist " general . ta-dah ! so movie , heap literary license , proves least one point end : back 1990s , it didn't take much bill clinton wuss out avoid taking terrorists . meanwhile , some day , sooner or later , idea pre-emptive internment jihad-age muslim men defensive measure indeed catch , if not here , then perhaps france , netherlands , russia , israel -- it interesting see who goes first . because it not just newtonian laws physics decree every action there equal opposite reaction . when they sequel this preposterous movie new york sans world trade center , willis play part hero , whoever gets stuck fbi agent role fool . i give movie two stars instead one , because i would hate discourage making such sequel , two , because any movie annette bening it automatically gets extra star my book	1
man , some my all-time favorite skits this wonderful compilation here . some reason , monty python crew decided re-do skits , so instead their original form , skits slightly different sets costuming , but ( thankfully ) masterful dialogue not altered any way . i guess crew felt original skits weren't 100% true their vision , so they made few changes match their original intent . one many stand-outs dirty hungarian phrasebook , where poor hungarian man thinks he asking cigarettes when he says , " drop your panties sir william . " marriage counselor who flirts man wife because man sissy anything it . still accountant who wants liontamer , provided lions aren't much different anteaters . course you'd expect classics like dead parrot sketch , nudge , nudge , lumberjack song , last but not least upper-class twit-of-the-year , which happens appropriate finale . my personal favorite sketch expedition mt . kilamarjaro , where john cleese sees two everything unless he covers up one his eyes . i also get kick out sketch where people fall out high buildings . this movie here contains best writing some best comedians ever walk earth . it real treasure every sense word	1

director : denzel washingtoncast : denzel washington , derek luke , joy bryant , salli richardson , malcolm david kelley , cody hodges , leonard earl howze , novella nelson . running time : 120 minutesrated pg-13 violence , language mature thematic material involving child abuse . based true story , screenplay written eponymous hero his own book , " antwone fisher " heart study psychological disturbance , laced reasonable amounts hollywood sugar optimism human spirit . it peculiarly american medicine , swallowed less willingly some markets than others , which probably explains why criticism film often confused denzel washington directorial talents ( which generally good ) various workings his film plot , which argued . antwone fisher story starts navy , where after particularly vivid nightmare he slugs fellow shipmate , hauled up before captain . sent navy psychiatrist jerome davenport ( washington ) , he begins work out issues anger , it turns out , stem abused childhood which added guilt complex over dead friend . same time fisher ( played exceptionally well newcomer derek luke ) , struggles establish first adult romantic relationship inviting cheryl ( joy bryant ) . parallel plot thread , washington character , ever-reasonable dr. davenport , marital problems . due course we discover he things learn communicating too fisher catalyst his own change . fisher screenplay reached cameras somewhat circuitous route : after his stint navy little writing experience , he hired sony executive write his own story - process which apparently underwent over 40 drafts before it acceptable . most weaknesses film traced uncertainties he brings his new craft , although washington direction papers reasonably well over many cracks . most unconvincing elements those subplots revolve around main character . these include psychiatrist ironic domestic problems , well fisher tentative love life . one tempted see these narrative distractions rather manipulative bolt-on elements , leavening appeal central , harrowing , personal history . fisher - cheryl romance instance , while context necessarily clumsy , also ultimately gauche . once consummated , it left languish without further comment , if further exploration this side fisher maturing unnecessary . perhaps sensing this central weakness , fisher script introduces element into young african-american tortured life foster child . during flashbacks he deal ' slave-nation ' justifications mrs. tate ( novella nelson ) , suggesting link hurt individual presumably whole black race - reasoning which frankly unconvincing none too interesting . significantly , such issues given short shrift psychiatrist himself , soon disappear view . plus side central performance derek luke hero , perfectly judged acting job , neatly balances inner rage confusion - " i don't know what " - lack self-pity . washington role also well . given difficulty actor-director role , he applauded carrying off both so effectively without fuss , either front or behind camera . this washington directorial debut he admirable job painting thorough picture antwone even though film could benefited some tighter editing , it still film delivers all emotional goods . arguably most impressive thing this film casting luke who total unknown actor mere handful television credits his resume obviously washington knew he possessed right goods pull off role . despite its flaws , " antwone fisher " intriguing look into real life estranged , enigmatic individual ; it film stimulate heart make you wish small children didn't endure such horrors .	1
performance footage alone would worth price this 1 hour documentary focuses music life john coltrane . clips included his work miles davis also his classic quartet extended version my favorite things . addition there clip flashes back forth southern church tradition coltrane soloing clearly links two demonstrates roots his art tangible way . interviews alice coltrane , wayne shorter others illuminating show how influential coltrane other musicians . any fan coltrane music never chance see him perform this dvd offers great opportunity get glimpse man behind all wonderful music . i absolutely loved it	1

guy who gave three stars some good points . he quite justified his three star review . however , way i see it , this one few films ( battle sounds only one i think right off bat ) really attempts explore art scratching deliver it wide audience . it true many dj left out scratch , but i think overall goal achieved . first all , film extremely well made . it artful , excellent soundtrack , good flow it some excellent interviews . there many dj weren't included partially because it 92 minute film can't possibly encompass all influential scratch dj . i respect this film immensely due fact it really opening people eyes what art scratching all . i mean eddie def right when he talks burger king dj etc . image djing kind position that easily filled any dumbass turntables " fresh " sample ridiculous . i'll admit , this film introduced me scratching . i've scratching two years now it become my obsession . i thank this film introducing me artform . course i can't review this film point view veteran scratch dj , but i review it scratch dj . if you want learn more scratching , or if you already scratch , then i highly suggest this film or battle sounds . if no other reason , some interviews ( especially some left out final cut ) worth buying this movie .	1
french new wave justifiably famous cinema circles , schools , etc .. it still talked today . when they mention filmmakers came school filmmaking , they mention jean-luc godard , eric rohmer , francois truffault . rarely , if ever , they mention jacques rivette . when friend mine asked me my favorite french directors , i said robert bresson , jean-luc godard , jacques rivette . my friend said " rivette ? " jacques rivette films stand out any other french filmmaker his time . other french new wave filmmakers prolific , whereas rivette would make film every few years . rivette films generally very long ( most extreme example film out 1 , which runs 12 1/2 hours , his other films run average 3-4 hours ) , concern themselves artistic process . this 4 hour film ( slightly longer than most rivette films , but not longest ) , but it unfolds magisterially beautifully . i saw it theater ( intermission ) , i entralled . it one rivette best films , one really shows agony artistic creation . creating art long arduous process . kubrick compared his art , filmmaking , trying write war peace bumpy car ride , but when you've finished , it amazing feeling . its pacing very slow leisurely , but there isn't anything wrong . i didn't feel bored , i didn't feel film needed cut . it perfect way it . title translated " pretty nuisance " , those who curious . this film really captures . completely unrelated sidenote , i remember seeing this film 2 couples front me . women liked it , but men bored out their minds . one kept shifting his head back forth throughout whole thing . men probably just hoping get laid afterwards , so that why they went see it . you should really only see this film if you're committed art cinema person . luckily , i am . this one rivette best films , he filmmaker deserves better known .	1

ok , this movie hilarious . i saw it when it test-screened last year la . back then i thought it so funny totally original it would theatres . i guess big studio bought it but didn't put it out theatrically . it so clever sarcastic you remember it lot more than your normal popcorn studio comedy . first all , " asexual " photographers gunther gerd off hook . they dress identically these ridiculous outfits , one mute while other read his mind . they point out they're not gay , they only spoon . they're always fighting over who gonna inner or outer spoon . lol . movie this magazine editor who organizes photo shoot world greatest supermodels . jaime pressly so funny editor . she obsessed supermodels , their posters all over her room fantasizes supermodels want make her one them . main supermodel played brooke burns , bruce willis ' old girlfriend . i thought she'd just eye candy , but she funniest playing german supermodel . guys dig movie because hot supermodels bikinis like entire movie , but we like it because we get see these vain creatures killed off symbolic really funny ways . it really smart comedy .	1
i first found out this movie you tube . i watch montage all best parts set some gorgeous music . after those 5:15 minutes i sold ... i went straight amazon , read reviews promptly placed my order . next 10 days longest my life , when it finally arrived i tore it open i wasn't dissappointed !! keely hawes personal favourite james murray now definately new favourite !! i somewhat dissappointed first length film , because i am accustomed my great period dramas ( ie our mutual friend , wives daughters ) anything 4-8 hours long !! so 1 half hours seemed mere preview first . but second time round i admit story fit perfectly into time frame . all all wonderful movie , wil leave you warm , mushy feeling we know so well !! making featurette quite interesting , although always , not enough time time given stars show !!! my recommendation : buy it now !! its lovely addition your bbc library	1

this film robert bresson beautiful sad . made same ambience tone his ' au hazard bathasar ' but not exciting it . i don't know where you coming , but if you interested intimistic basically plotless cinema , found foreign ( old ) movies , bresson good choice . but if your reason making spiritual journey , or or widening your faith , then , you must warned . ' diary ...

there many good reviews this odd little film already fellow imdb users . one note interest however , very unfortunately new crisp release ' night caller ' omitted fantastic opening ( uk)score film . " image " recorded alan haven ; superb musician who specialised hammond organ , opening scenes tracking shot over london night music original u.k. release , perfectly captures essence mid-sixties britain . piece spooky organ mix set mod ( ish ) orchestral background , it become bit ' northern soul ' classic uk released britain february 1965 ! great shame then , usa release totally inappropriate male vocalist-romantic-lounge piece singing title track ! those who haven't heard uk original you'd very pleasantly surprised ..	1

when i first saw round midnight young man , i thought dale turner real jazz musician wondered what he made him avoid america , like roman polanski . that tribute good acting dexter gordon direction bertrand tavernier , who i understand swiss . tight close-ups 1959 blue note reverberate sweat reality . recently i chance watch this film tandem michael curtiz young man horn i saw some similarities way gordon photographed john alton shadows stripes across his handsome face , just juano hernandez given almost noir treatment earlier film , heated nightclubs where everyone wears cigarette out side their mouth smoke makes feverish patterns across whitewashed walls .. i wish dvd included some memories film makers , including some testimony tavernier see if he really studied earlier american jazz films or not . young french jazz buff grows close dale who then becomes his idol , shares acting duties film , just dale sweats out his addiction liquor but what he can't shake his love/hate affair new york city america whole . ambivalence factor young frenchman just can't understand ; it goes way over his head leaves him standing far shores love even banks east river . i suppose if this movie made usa this character ( francis ) would played woman ( like doris day ) young man weith horn , usa men aren't allowed give each other adoring looks francois gives dale this one . given time period ( 1986 ) perhaps part would offered robin givens or lisa bonet ? it we get incandescent lonette mckee her finest , singing beautifully too . film goes great lengths prove francis solidly heterosexual , pro-family , his parents cute little daughter . david rayfiel , who wrote this paean black-white relationships , years favorite screenwriter sydney pollack , also wrote amazing rape revenge picture lipstick . he true journeyman here he gave dexter gordon part should won him oscar .	1

i would disagree statement scary movie 3 best movie ever made . movie complete mesh other famous flicks , such ring signs . i wouldn't suggest people would buy this movie because it just humor thrown into odd places . i've seen movie five times , although i laugh , it still isn't greatest movie . i'm just relieved there wasn't much language this movie than scary movie 2 . my god - they swore every other minute ! anyway , buy ring or signs if you want see really good movie	1
giallo fans need only apply . giallo fans know what expect this one . there akilla loose he hinting there five murders . what connection victims ? like i'm gonna tell you , you'd just better see it . man hot killer trail alcoholic reporter franco nero ! there eight billion giallos around this time , fifth cord stands above many them . it got great look very good performance nero . nero very good actor , probably one best come out italy , because this he gives his character more depth than average giallo hero . not much gore , but this film really doesn't need it . yet again , blue underground us all favor releasing this film cleaning it up good possible . they also give us 16 minute interview both nero director , luigi bazzoni , who apparently really cool guy . giallo fans should pleased	1

i love this movie ! it so incredibly stupid funny . it absolutely ridiculous slightly crass . grinch whos look like bunch clowns . film predictable completely ripped off animated tv special . this isn't stupid barney , because least makers this film actually tried funny , rather than just childish retarded . this film gotten lot mixed reviews amazon.com, so sure rent it before you buy it .	1
three things save this dvd fom trashcan - one selection kqed-tv black white performances ( although whole show available vhs ) . two very interesting films band recording " summertime " studio cheap thrills album . three course janis . she shines . those who only know her visually still photos monterey pop film , you may find yourself surprised how very attractive she every way . still photos never her justice . unfortunately , beyond these three saving graces this hour long documentary lackluster , managing make this incredibly exciting period american rock roll just plain boring , social revolution which fed it . most band performances within documentary nothing short embarrassing , profoundly bad , bad guitar , bad bass , bad backing vocals , just sloppy timing . when this accompanied lifeless modern interviews band , it tough find pleasure this disc . it comes across , i'm sad say , grown men whining incessantly how nobody liked them everyone liked janis more . even though i've always regarded band live playing cheap thrills alternate evening performance which out there someplace cd brilliant , my opinion big brother abilities ( personal character ) shrunk mightily after watching 900 nights . all bands bad nights , bad recordings out there circulation - most airplane live recordings pretty scary , but nothing like what we here . one would look very hard performance clips made band sound worse . black cherry sour whipped cream found extras , where each band member asked how he heard janis ' death . peter albin james gurley responses bloodless shameful . honest perhaps , but show little class guys . remember you're part legendary band one reason one reason alone . if it wasn't one particular lady , no one would know your names . stop whining . get over it . you got fired because you pretty lousy band who couldn't keep time or play decent solos . cheap thrills album sounds like band , frankly	1

it great series , i watch it over again again . sales people miserable salary divided into ' seniors ' ' juniors ' it unbelivable how desperately ' seniors ' try humilate ' juniors ' just prove themselves they better than their wage implies . some jokes easily predictable , like those mr. hamphries ' other way ' or ms. sloucomb she-cat , nevertheless they superb humor . technical note : i cannot comprehend why dvd should close-captioned ( useless feature ) instead sub-titled english ( importand feature movie many british idioms	1

i wish there - rating system , i would rate this - 10 stars , only good thing this movie john digweed ( he shows up end movie 2 minutes ) bedrocks heaven scent . it such burden watch this whole movie , first all acting horrible waaaaaaay overdone ; pretentious word . acting like watching those kids candy commercials there all these skateboarders " extreme " sports figures doing tricks advertise candy product . then theres all these gay love scenes , which i found very unnecessary . if this movie shows what rave scene really , i feel sorry ravers , fortunately this not what raving all . this story shows corporate-underground ( hmmm those two words shouldnt together , should they ? well they this movie ) rave , you party planner sending e-mails all these yuppys let them know where party , then theres " going party " thing , wharehouse blah blah blah . trying look like real rave , but last i knew raves werent sponsored levis or starbucks !! then you all these horrible actors trying act like there all high ecstasy , they just over it , its like watching your granny trying act like she drunk . then theirs dj who act like their mixing grabbing records , putting them turntable cranking up crossfader , any dj knows its not simple . i'm not trying disrespect dj , i bet john digweed tiny part this movie because he probably got ditched club owner didnt pay him gig he needed money get back home . part movie this " raver-couple " who met each other like 2 days ago getting married , their " love " completely influenced after using ecstasy ( love drug ) dudes brother who complete pretentious nerd . raver dude all sudden kissing dude who supposed official rave massage guy !! i mean wtf ?!!! then his brother ( pret . nerd ) gets hold some , course he never any kind narcotics or substance before , he starts tripping turns into complete fool , he meets chick who supposed veteran raver she tries guide him around his trip , then party he invites everyone breakfest his house , course doesnt happen because he didnt really like people , he just happy . thank god theres end movie , end you get see digweed playing heaven scent , thats only good part movie it lasts like 2 minutes . oh i forgto mention " police bust " . police arrive party party organizer talks his way gets sngle cop leave without checking any paper work or permit party , then later copps arrive shut party down raid like fashion , but guess what ? no one gets arrested sound equipment doesnt get confiscated , cops just run warehouse run everybody out . course nature this movie wouldnt just let people go home stop filming this atrocity , nooooooooooooooooo , people go back warehouse , break police lock continue party where they left off . totally unreal . raver-couple chick see her boyfriend kissing massage guy runs bathroom cry , her boyfriend follows her tells her he not gay , course they get back together go back dancing , then when partys raver-couple dude sees massage guy tells him " i'm not gay " massage dude replies " nah , me neither " . i hope you got idea how bad movie this review , i got headache writing it .	-1

faith hathaway just graduated high school one week away going into army . she full hope life . robert willie ( man this movie based ) , his accomplice raped murdered her . she raped , stabbed 17 times , raped after she died . director this movie denied requests made faith mother , gave all attention only person who deserved die . where mercy faith ? where compassion faith ? where people protesting faith life ? finally where story mercy which denied faith ? what her suffering her family ? barely foot note this movie . ohh sister prejean discovered lie when it suits her case .	-1

i wanted give movie version end all wars 5 stars but ... there trend lately faith-based entertainment use elements such swearing " keep it real " . perhaps this effort reach broader audience . ... or out defiance what typical faith-based entertainment . but once you've read ernest gordon firsthand account ( published under few different names ) you proof same moving powerful story told without language . others concerned like we which words used - it basically word said repeatedly one character 13+ times row moment anger then one time shortly after character . there other words well but never god name used swearing ( which where we would've drawn line ) . other than , movie really gripping . there some tense scenes violence , but there many excellent performances actors . hope this review helpful	1

ok first , if you politicaly correct person who wants nothing offends any one , don " buy this movie !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! now if you except world full offending things laugh them best way deal them , come seat watch this wonderful , trashy satire violance way we become numb it what it . oh yes brothers sisters feel healing powers this tacky road race movie future where war no more only outlet our aggresion sport " deathrace " where besides speed you must earn points running over people race way . david carridine frankenstien worlds greatest driver sport , but he begining think maybe this race no longer what world needs . all kidding aside(sorry if i sounded like preacher , but really i ment ) this satire very funny reminds us politicaly correctness isn't great if it stops us think , not bad message little drive-in movie 70 	1
i never seen queen damned until last night , when i just finished anne rice novel queen damned . knowing i would soon novel , i curious see movie so i went out moviestop picked up cheap , used dvd copy , despite hearing this movie very bad . turns out , word bad understatement . let me get point , there several changes story , i understand some this needs movies screen time reasons , etc . but i found after reading novel , while basic premise story same novel , pretty much everything gave novel plotline it depth intrigue removed story film adaptation , this movie simply falls flat . i shaking my head end movie such disappointment so much story hacked away . vampires this movie not portrayed amount love feeling intended anne rice , akasha included . maharet , perhaps foremost character novel , basically doesn't show up until end movie simply take part disappointing final showdown . again , all backstory should present here missing . i won't spoil it any those who still plan read novel , but akasha motives what she planning actually logical ( her own evil misguided way ) , but there reason it she saw legitemate , where movie it simply " everybody must die ! " . period . that your motive everything movie building up . i can't stress this enough - depth book gone movie . like i said , i understand things need trimmed/skipped sake screen time , etc ., but this movie barely over 1 1/2 hours long , so much plot development could still included here give this movie depth it lacked . what wrong adding even 30-45 minutes screen time fill story make it 120 or 135 minute film ? heck , i sat theatres all three lord rings movies which all ran over 3 hours . or this movie directed punk kids 10 minute attention spans , rather than fans anne rice vampire chronicles ? such shame , because this movie really potential equal , if not better , adaptation interview vampire . i could go other things this movie i thought just stupid , silly , etc . etc . kind like how other vampires pissed lestat revealing himself world vampire giving away vampiric secrets , yet they decide fly up stage during middle concert , front tens thousands people start fighting , essence " revealing " themselves well , which totally inconsistent why these vampires angry first place . i won't go into all details , because it would take too much writing tell you everything bugged me . bottom line , i guess if you're into cheesy vampire action flicks korn , etc . movie score , then you may still see some value here , but anne rice diehards most certainly find this movie waste their time . but don't let this movie scare you out reading novel , because book much much much better than this movie	-1
i love daria this movie very fitting sign off series . however , some unknown reason , mtv found reason make numerous small cuts throughout movie original version it appeared its original broadcast . jokes deleted , natural conversations characters reduced " just facts , ma'am . " least one scene , which daria decides not go date tom favor staying home , totally cut out movie . ??? original soundtrack also replaced generic music backdrop avoid obtaining video distribution rights original music . i recommend buying dvd if you no other way see broadcast version . i just hope someday mtv someday see fit release it uncensored , well complete unedited season releases .

back when this show originally aired , i didn't watch it until i saw extremely effective commericals it . theory #12 " dwarf " it would say average joe offering his thoughts show . i hooked loved first season . unforturnately , i missed episodes here there season 2 i found myself lost if i missed episode . dvd come cardboard case 3 thin plastic dvd cases holding two dvd each . special features minimal log lady intros some staff interviews which i found enlightening . david lynch not specials i didn't expect him anyway . menus simple which i prefer . i not like highly produced menus elaborately slow transitions . they clean , quick nea t.t he audio 5.1 digital spanish portuguese language track . there not dts track like 1st season , but that no big deal . 5.1 track exceptional . video presented its original 4:3 aspect . picture sharp colors vibrant . i no complaints over clarity picture . tv show dvd all episodes . this set 22 episodes compared only 7 first season without pilot . it well worth price . i cannot recommend this show enough . this show good coffee . " damn good ! " . there huge ensemble cast intrigue protaganists antangonists . when people talk show , some people dismiss it because they've heard it too bizarre or strange . it true show quirky moments eccentric characters , but it only adds color depth overall show . watching episodes order , storyline easily followed . i never seen show so many layers twin peaks . drama , humor , terror , suspense , romance , violence , etc ., each episode . even though twin peaks only lasted two seasons , it one best shows ever tv . many shows now owe their creation twin peaks . thanks david lynch , mark frost , writers , directors , cast crew .	1
years after its release i find myself writting what i consider completely biast review this film ( somewhat star wars fan made it difficult look it any negative light before ) . let me first start saying my two daughters love film . me , i grew up watching original star wars ( now titled episode iv , new hope ) . when original star wars came out , it changed way people looked sci-fi . i saw it several times just able focus different aspects sets , props , costumes , etc . it best eye-candy its time far . substance became less important factor if movie couple " holes " story we forgave it watched-on mesmerized its visual splendor likability its characters . almost thirty years later panorama completely different . star wars movies still hold bar special effects but computer-generated world , amazing visuals ocurr within any television comercial , even lowest budget sci-fi television show special effects somewhat convincing or least cool look . effects not make movie " attack clones " more effects than story or even acting matter . awfully silly dialogue doesn't help it neither . retrospect , i wish george lucas would come up two completely different droids than c3po r2d2 ( latter even flies ! imagine , more capabilities than future ) . this premise even absurd world star wars . according story , luke skywalker his uncle owen episode four bought two droids thirty forty years old . i'm typing this review i imagine myself typing it royal ribbon typewriter , just wouldn't happen . it scary find things even too far-fetched world lucas created but movie full them . he doesn't really give any explanation whole trilogy ( i , ii , iii ) why future ships not cool or look act clunkier , or why everything looks dated thirty years now . his world technology goes backwards not other way around . i , however solution all these . george lucas should keep meddling original trilogy until all left original films faces protagonists . everything else should computer re-generated order keep pace future more sync its past . then , you could buy all versions original trilogy ( iv , , vi ) . originally shot , revised version we all saw re-release theaters , " ultimate enhanced version " better match second trilogy ( i , ii , iii ) . maybe he could even re-edited where actors look if they no personalities change dialog sound more confusing . then , you would whole set six films look fantastic but lack every other aspect story telling ( ie ., compelling characters , continuity , interesting plotlines , etc ) . only reason i give movie two stars because wonderful effects created ilm still makes film worth watching least once . otherwise , i rather watch " serenity " which more star wars feel it than this star wars film . nickname " mannequin " " annakin " well-deserved it any negatives regarding characters this poorly told story	1
what it 70 ... decade begged parodied -- almost while we still living it ? watching " seven ups " , just released dvd , its pretty obvious what so " strange " 70 . everything so extreme . clothing extreme ; poverty extreme ; automobiles extreme ; everything either " suede " or " broken glass " . all " schlock " 70 produced , there group incredible crime/cop films came out era . sort 70 " noir " . " seven ups " roy scheider plays leader " special squad " police dealing offenders whose crimes wil guarantee them prison sentence " 7 years or up " hence rather misleading title film . i hadn't seen this film over 25 years when i recently purchased it , watching it time capsule gritty urban 70 . what really surprised me , rewatching it , though , how much subsequent movie tv crime shows " ripped off " this film . that not say this film didn't its own larceny ... there car chase designed out-do " french connection " " bullitt " . but it plot character construction this film , some its contemporaries , set style shows 30 years later still emulating . its character driven ; plot driven ; action filled . watching this movie , i could almost smell diesel fumes transit buses i used ride downtown baltimore 1970s . watch it historical curiosity ; watch it parody ; but you'll also realize you're watching fine example tight story telling still influencing tony soprano his competition today	1

this quite corny adventure film , one least significant movies hitchcock ever made . it deserves two stars maltin . yes , charles laughton good major villain , although his makeup could used some work times , especially during closeups . yes , 19-year-old maureen o'hara beautiful , even if her clothes never stay wet after swimming her makeup never gets smeared . yes , young robert newton okay , even if his commission bearing his police credentials remain dry clear after ocean . but whole , this melodrama one live without . young people especially guffaw hammy ending . worse problem print . it inferior . one point there jump eliminates five or ten minutes story . there no excuse putting this sort print dvd	1
made during horror movie heyday late 1930s early 1940s , this classic suspenseful thriller introduced audiences one most well-known movie monsters ; lon chaney jr. ' " wolf man " . chaney plays larry talbot , who returning his home wales after spending eighteen years united states . larry brother recently killed hunting accident . claude rains stars larry father , sir john talbot . upon returning home , larry helps his father install new lens his telescope . while peering through lens , larry discovers beautiful girl window across street . her name gwen conliffe ( evelyn ankers ) . larry goes over introduces himself , two agree go walk together evening . gwen invites her friend jenny williams come . three decide go their fortunes told group gypsies who set up camp town . jenny goes first . gypsy bela ( bela lugosi ) reads jenny fortune . he immediately disturbed when he sees shape pentagram appear jenny palm . he immediately tells jenny leave . meanwhile , gwen larry walked off their own . minutes later , they hear blood-curdling scream . larry runs investigate finds large wolf attacking jenny . larry manages kill wolf his silver-handled cane , but he bitten process . gypsy maleva ( maria ouspenskaya ) tells larry legend werewolf , if person bitten werewolf survives , they too become werewolf . maleva gives larry charm wear around his neck protect himself , but he gives charm gwen . night full moon , maleva predictions come true , larry talbot transformed into werewolf . charm protect gwen , or she suffer same fate her friend jenny ? this movie remained classic over sixty years , it takes viewer back time before blood-and-guts horror films popular , movie producers relied psychological terror scare audiences . there no blood this movie , but viewer still scared unique movie sets , fog rolling through trees , haunting musical score . lon chaney jr. made his role wolf man famous , he only actor ever played wolf man . although character originally designed boris karloff , chaney made this his signature role . he always remembered wolf man . other actors , especially maria ouspenskaya claude rains , give good performances well . i give this movie my highest recommendation . this film takes me back when i young child , i used stay up late weekends watching scary movies television . remember , " even man who pure heart says his prayers night , may become wolf when wolf bane blooms , autumn moon bright "	1
lovers foreign films find this movie gem . unlike most american offerings , foreign productions rely human relationships emotions drive plot rather than sterotypical situations characters . this film no exception . movie , which more family bonds time crisis then it homosexuality horror aids , candid enthralling beginning end . relationships family members touching , times inadvertently strange , especially if you're american family . love they one comes across very strong actions like cuddling while sleeping same bed incidental nudity among brothers ( things considered inappropriate other cultures ) not any way sexual but simply natural part family life . my opinion good movie allows you think bigger issues . while watching " close leo " i couldn't help but wonder how much stronger stable people , turn societies , would if most families like this . maybe cultures general too quick demonize think such activities suspect or improperly sexual . even family questionable decision keep plight marcel favorite brother secret made out concern compassion not selfishness or malice . climax film contains graphic sexuality nudity leo hostel keeper , but it very realistic poignant way . it here where audience able see how leo deep familial love enables him make final unselfish choice . deciding change his previous wanton behavior send marcel back home alone paris , he makes decision take possession his own pain over his death refuse allow anyone family take it upon themselves . definitely " must see " if you get opportunity	1

fan nick park style claymation , i gave this product four stars . but second season creature comforts not universally accessible first . starters , there greater use harder understand british accents ( yorkshire , urban youth talk , heavy scottish , etc ) , which fine bbc afficiandos such myself , but others , especially children , may find it bit difficult sort through sounds hear what interviewees saying . keeping mind this series made uk , references pop culture side ocean may more obscure humor more elusive neophytes . material well seems bit mature younger audiences . parents may wish screen episodes before watching them their children . it strictly pg+ , not quite racy enough pg13 , but bit more advanced than some may feel comfortable ( think juicier bits " rabbit " ) . but quality animation remains strong . little details which we all love - background characters moving response what interviewees saying - up standard excellence which we expect ardman product . humor still there , enjoyable those who appreciate british style wit . previously noted , this set contains separately sold christmas special - which very fun episode , indeed , but not worth buying twice . so , if you're nick park fan , this you . but newbie may put off difficult accents unfamiliar subjects	1

o.k. , except old farts who don't like profanity , wheezer who only thought 20 minutes it entertaining chick who thought intro lame ( bill murry send-up reservation theme genius ) , this very funny dvd . there definitely some lame moments ( david spade trying too hard `cooler than everyone else room ' shtick ) , some painful moments ( adam sandler piece embarrassingly horrible ) yet one more intensely boring musical piece lately ubiquitous prince , whose own shtick sexual ambivalence , wimpy voice imminently forgettable tunes only rival his/her movie exploits tedium . anyhow , although i think madtv folks occasionally find finer honed edge than snl crowd ( first two seasons consistently funnier ) , they also taped would hard time doing it live consistent basis . like ebb flow sun-spot activity , snl good bad casts , strong weak seasons , but always something going makes it worth while watching , almost always pulls off one immensely funny skit during evening . this collection those efforts . don't miss it . i just wish they would release 15th anniversary taping . it hilarious .	1

child i pen pals one swarm stars : christian juttner . christian came up through disney farm team system ( creating child actors ) . he only good thing this miserable dreck . don't get me wrong - he over acting , but he isn't chewing up scenery like so many others this long , drawn out pot boiler/action film . irwin allen produced swarm . he also created " towering inferno , " " earthquake , " " posiedon adventure " among vast list low grade science fiction/action television series . allen used formula each his films/television series . he doesn't stray it here . michael caine his most painfully horrible , overacting so badly he verges manic personality . olivia dehaviland embarrasses herself god-awful southern accent overacts so badly she seems doing skit impression herself acting class how not act . fred mcmurray saddled dismal dialogue but doesn't actually embarrass himself . allen throws us bevy a-list actors silver screen era , only squander waste them . script absolutely painfully bad . nothing quite makes sense ( not this silliness could ever really make sense . apparently , swarms african killer bees sitting around procreating mustering up nerve declare war all texas ( although only idiot would not realize sets used hollywood hills backlots everywhere hollywood ) . what if these swarms get together create one huge swarm ? what indeed ?! opening film : large group men orange mechanics overalls orange motorcycle helmets wander around military facility without uttering word - this takes place over twenty minutes . apparently we understand these boys orange scientists military personnel assigned investigate disaster : military installation decimated something .... but what ? lab quite obviously allen television series : 20000 leagues under sea lost space . when they speak , you wish they just shut up instead uttering such drivel . now , we believe these bees kill quickly efficiently leaving no tell tale signs what killed victims . first all there would huge welts victims secondly there would some dead bees ( they tell us they've only discovered one bee carcass - i got news you - if i'm getting stung swarm bees , i'm still going get few good slaps take out more than zero bees ) . christian juttner character part first onscreen attack . his parents killed they set up picnic ( thank heavens , because neither them act)- juttner mercifully spared because he sent car thermos ... he drives car(covered bees ) into backlot ... um , i mean nearby town whisked off hospital treatment his bites . he later sneaks out some friends antagonizes swarm bees picnic area where his parents died . then he runs around talking michael caine promises watch over some woman caine taken liking . next we see juttner bed hospital sick , dying , dead ! wow ! where this come ? dehavilland agonizes only high school freshman acting student would over deaths dozens school children playground ( however never we actually see bee any these kids ) . no where film we see any indication bees actually stung any victims . there no welts , no marks , no redness . they're just .... dead .

alfred hitchcock my favorite director ! it impossible me pick favorite film there too many i love cannot live without . however , one i seem come back more so than others " rope " . plot ( based off leopold/loeb murder 1924 ) pure hitchcock . two grad students/roommates strangle fellow student hide his body inside trunk . trunk then covered tablecloth , candles food used party entertain ( who else ) victim family friends . i love fact this first movie shot real time . hitch makes his cuts every ten minutes ( length film camera could hold 1948 ) closing out character back , trunk or wall . thing i always pay attention how fake backdrop outside large livingroom window looks amazingly real film carries sun sets . kudos property master lighting department ! hitchcock also loved anything taboo perverse . he went great lengths let us know these two roommates not only killers but they lovers well ! overtones unmistakeable i can't believe it got past censors . john dall farley granger play it up nines ! i won't spoil ending or tell you why two men decided murder their victim first place . i tell you this definitely hitchcock first masterpiece ! pure suspense ! go buy or rent it right now ! you won't sorry	1
why ? because if you're here , you probably already saw movie just curious this release version . so i'll tell you it . first , good : - comes official movie soundtrack . i mean full soundtrack , it separate disc . - video transfer lot better than original dvd release . - case designed lot more appealing than standard black blue . - audio better encoded easier hear lower volumes . - lots extras , including some fluff , but hey . - better aspect ratio , picture fills widescreen displays more evenly without stretching . now , bad : - soundtrack ... it so irritating listen , because they managed true movie version " nothing but love " some other songs , fresh movie , but yet " nights like this " after 7 version . i don't mind after 7 version , it not bad , but i wanted hear movie version . this especially troublesome when they even managed byrd song fresh movie . - some footage never made it movie should . like scene where duck explaining all members sing all different levels . it would explain later scene when choirboy offers sing eddie place - when i watched first version i confused . soprano singing baritone parts ? also , there some slight comedy pieces there should included . - some extras just flat out pointless - or if they wanted include them least include characters people cared . there one extra where actors kayfabe giving their thoughts before accepting ' awards ' . totally corny , but it might entertaining if eddie kang jr. jt there . there only 3 five present . - general movie negative ... they never explain what happened bobby , beginning movie . i hoping deleted scene would explain this , but alas ... so , would i recommend getting this ? absolutely , because i almost guarantee it won't released hd-dvd or bluray	1

d.o.a. ( 1950 ) one those films i try watch once year ( lot easier since purchasing it dvd ) it classic american film-noir mystery/drama quite bit going it , few , minor flaws ( minor flaws tend stand out little more here because most other aspects so strong ) . directed rudolph mat� ( when worlds collide , violent men ) , accomplished cinematographer prior moving into realm directing , feature stars oscar winning character actor edmond o'brien ( hitch-hiker , barefoot contessa , wild bunch ) . also appearing pamela britton ( " blondie " , " my favorite martian " ) , lynn baggett ( time their lives ) , luther adler ( voyage damned ) , beverly garland ( alligator people ) , william ching ( lonely place ) , laurette luez ( prehistoric women ) , neville brand ( halls montezuma , stalag 17 ) , his first credited feature film role . fans television show " green acres " , keep eye peeled frank `sam drucker ' cady , he got bit part early bartender . film opens we see man entering large , metropolitan police station head towards homicide division . upon arriving , we learn he there report murder ... his own ! turns out man name frank bigelow ( o'brien ) , he accountant small , californian town , which we move into lengthy flashback he relates his tale . frank works small , podunk town secretary/girlfriend paula ( britton ) , it seems paula little put out fact frank announced , very short notice , he taking trip san francisco get little time himself . frank arrives his hotel , joint jumping conventioneers , group them frank ends up hooking up ... after night out town frank returns hotel wakes next morning feeling rather poorly , enough so cause him see doctor , which he then informed he poisoned ! not only , but poison fatal , he got perhaps week , most , live . some vacation ... anyway , frank eventually discovers his predicament deliberately caused , sets out discover whos whys . trail leads frank minor business dealing he some time ago character named renoylds , one involving sale some precious metals . frank delves deeper into mystery he stirs up hornet nest trouble , mainly himself , there those who don't appreciate his sudden interest their affairs , runs afoul some thugs , result if poison coursing through his system doesn't kill him , various bullets thrown his way might ... i think one more interesting aspects this film me how o ' brien character just wasn't entirely likeable fellow beginning , one i found myself rooting end ( albeit halfheartedly ) . you see , scenes near beginning , frank portrayed sort philanderer , especially once he hits san francisco . , itself wouldn't mean much me , except fact he stringing swell dame paula ( ms. britton looked incredibly beautiful here , but not inaccessible ) who completely devoted him , so much so she willing put up his peccadilloes . sure she gets miffed , but she always ends up coming around , , one point , she basically tells frank there isn't anything he would cause her feelings him falter ... probably not something you should relate someone wandering eye . once frank accepts his predicament ( whole dying thing ) , he eventually come around , realizing what important , so there strong , moral element involved . element i enjoyed character chester thug , played neville brand , who appears later story . it always fun when they throw sadistic , wild-eyed psychotic mix , especially one who tends refer himself third person call his handgun `baby ' . there couple really great lines dialogue present , one which i used title this review . it occurs once frank begins unraveling mystery his murder , he gets terse femme fatale whom he believes involved ( she ) , which she tells him " if you man i'd punch your dirty face . " . good one comes just prior this , he strong arming tight-lipped secretary , played beverly garland , into spilling her guts telling her she " this right up your pretty , little neck ! " . i thought performances , direction , writing , cinematography all very strong , complimented wonderfully dimitri tiomkin vibrant musical score . pacing quick leads up exciting engaging climax , one definitely worth sticking around ... there one aspect i find annoying , it wasn't fact so many fabulous babes seemed willing throw themselves slightly paunchy edmond o'brien . it involved usage slide whistle . o'brien character arrives his hotel san francisco early , every time he sees babe there simulated wolf call sound effect created slide whistle . now this something i'd expect screwball comedy starring jerry lewis , but not something fits material here , especially given rather dramatic opening sequence . i'm unsure who decided throw particular sound effect , but they didn't picture any favors . it certainly doesn't ruin film , but i thought i should warn those interesting see it , it may draw you out feature it me , eliciting " what fudge ? " response . despite minor point , rest gold , especially if you're fan noir . it looks if this film release onto dvd various times , few , different companies , but version i own released image entertainment , part wade williams collection . dvd case states source material used restored producer negative . picture , presented full screen ( 1.33 : 1 ) look clean sharp , but there minor imperfection throughout ( no frames seem missing , though ) . far dolby digital mono audio , it seemed me levels weren't entirely consistent , i found myself regularly adjusting volume ( maybe my ears going bad , i don't know ) . there aren't any extras included , but there chapter stops . i haven't seen other dvd releases so i can't compare this them , but i'm familiar enough image entertainment dvd releases feel comfortable saying overall quality here probably better than some less expensive releases . i notice roan release available , i've found their releases solid , so if your looking less expensive version but still better than average quality , might way go . cookieman108by way , i've seen 1988 remake featuring dennis quaid meg ryan ... it not bad , but comes up lacking when compared original , my opinion .	1
this movie decent movie lot gore but plot weak acting horrible . kim myers good actor but she not fit this roll like she bloodline . freddy still psycotic killer but he changed into more jokester which really killing series . also mark patton character whines cries through out movie like little baby it really kills movie . this movie just hardcore fans or people collecting entire series . this only gets two stars because violence gore .	1
perhaps i love this movie so much simply beacuse i just now happened upon it . i hadn't heard it , now i see it came out 2002 . wow , where i ? this one twisted chick one twisted film . thing obviously attracts us female character her beauty , brains . no one could this evil still men chasing her without " something . " " something " she sexy -- real knock-out . scene bar where she checks out berg equipment under table can't beat . sort outdoing " sally met harry " 2002 . berg plays it cool , great " secret " his life finally revealed toward end movie . if you enjoy movies where you don't know how things going turn out , check out last seduction it fill all your needs	1
i getting tired watching this movie probably because i didn't really like charactor franklin he just getting my nerves he just felt like bagage girl friend ( i forget charactors name ) i got mad when franklin wasn't doing his part relationship , even if he couldn't get job , he could least helped out baby more so mother child didn't lose out her dream becoming singer . perhaps if she didn't meet him she might made it . all fairness franklin there times when girlfriend provoked franklin insecurities . example when he brought tickets concert them her birthday she traded them better seats . thats no no you don't take gift back front person who brought you gift , would hurt anybody make them feel unappreciated . all all i thought it somewhat realistic story relationship man woman trying keep it togetherarguments breakup all . ending kind leaves you hanging but you assume they try get back together	1

this film awful ! it got one worst remakes recent memory . acting awful ( nicolas cage short cash or drunk when he read this script agreed this film ? ) it lacks just everything original , inhabitants island suddenly become some sort celtic feminist fundamentalists , nicolas cage so anoying throughout film end it you almost siding locals him burned stake . this film awful every way . yourself favour buy/rent original , block this one out your mind pretend it never made	1
glass cage piece work should not overlooked . when i saw film apt pupil , i thought it decent film some superb acting , but sadly i felt hollywood watered movie down when it came portraying nazi mentality , decadence , cycle abuse , cruelty . after viewing glass cage , i finally seen what other film could become if it not hollywood politics , since then i kept ever closer eye foreign cinema . glass cage both tale mental decay revenge . this story revolves around german family relocated isolation spain after fall 3rd reich , young man(angelo ) , who child abused patriarch family , klaus ; former ss officer . angelo tracked klaus down , catches him committing brutal act against youth . klaus ' brutal act sends klaus over mental edge , fit despair , he makes failed suicide bid , confining him iron lung glass windows(the glass cage ) . angelo , gathered some sensitive journals depicting klaus ' crimes , uses this his past klaus coerce klaus into allowing angelo into household " care " paralyzed helpless klaus . angelo quickly begins corrupting family , gaining daughter affections simultaneously gaining abhorance family matriarch , while keeping klaus edge making him relive atrocities he tried escape . first angelo this through reading journals atrocities klaus , eventually angelo descends deeper into madness , begins committing atrocities his own . starting matriarch house , angelo begins kill , he quickly moves children like described journals he reads . torture klaus who both adores despises himself very things he now forced watch come full circle . his wife dead , his daughter controlled angelo , he forced relive himself . this where uncompromising nature piece really takes hold . children put death this film , viewer not spared agony this implications , or off-camera violence . this happens your face , even very first scene klaus youth . it places bitter slice nazi cruelty right your mouth you taste . eventually this cruelty aimed klaus himself , eerie aid daughter , mental schism becomes complete , angelo assuming role klaus glass cage . i found this film more dramatic shocker than art-house film , but story solid acting top notch , especially when approaching subject matter . glass cage not shock simply degrade viewer , rather presents violencce " this how it went down " fashion . nothing glamorized no character particularly likeable , they simply they programmed better or worse , which right point context naziism . if visually-presented subject nazi cruelty regarding homosexuality , petiphilia , grotesque murder children would get you leave room , then this film not you . but those you seeking uncompromising cinema ...	1
2-disc , director cut , my expectations perhaps too high this dvd . nevertheless , i appalled poor quality transfer . colors dull throughout , focus frequently not beginning scenes . movie itself , i don't agree it holding up well over time . 25 years old , movie just limited entertainment value people who aren't waiting their beloved canceled tv series big screen . there no question ii iv best series , but comparing it other star trek original cast movies isn't putting bar very high . my interest watching this again just finished melville moby dick , final scenes which khan repeats liberally during final space battle . said , i think montalban fantastic revenged-obsessed khan very evocative ahab . however , shatner pretentious kirk just becomes more grating time goes . original cast schtick just doesn't make compelling drama	1
" midnight cowboy " classic film directed john schlesinger . dustin hoffman jon voight excellent .	1

quiet deliberate movie ultimately suffers too much star power . no matter how scruffy wain filmmakers try make nicole kidman look , she still nicole kidman . her portrayal janitor really pushes limits " suspension disbelief " her delicate features legs go forever . anthony hopkins also miscast jewish professor hard knock , secret past . while he remains one my favorite actors , he cannot escape his " britishness " which even more unbelievable once you discover what his character past ! real discovery this film wentworth miller absolutely astonishing turn teenage anthony hopkins . ultimately , film worth seeing wentworth miller alone . but casting two megawatt hollywood actors hurts believability this film end	1
you like zombie movies ? course you , otherwise you wouldn't here . but you like piss-poor make-up design , god-awful special effects horrendous lighting ? probably no t.t he best thing i say this flick it comes 2 discs . first ( plaga zombie)is almost certainly college project . ( so i won't comment further one . but second disc ( plaga zombie : mutant zone ) should better since it follow-up bigger ( i assume ) budget . anyways ; music little over-exaggerated seemed like it trying make this flick more serious than it really . ( except " john west " song , which i still find myself singing . fact whole scene best part movie . ) when it comes zombie comedies , you alot better than this one . ( ie : dead-alive , return living dead part 2 , shaun dead ) don't get me wrong , directors potential . but potential would better geared toward slap-stick comedies , not horror comedies . just side note : main attraction any zombie flick undeads prosthetic make-up . ( peeling flesh/half-eaten lips/severed limbs disembodied torsos/ etc . ) suffice say , absolutely none these zombies even so much resembled zombies . ( or acted like zombies matter ) . they look more like college kids after halloween night . moral story : time money precious commodities . waste them this flick unethical .	-1
i love americanization makico , blind faith , disco inferno , portroit triotan , good night , dear heart episodes	1
this movie just wonderful . first movie great movie well , but i believe this better . i understand many people felt differently . but when you look 2001 version it just plain better . overall . acting , effects , story-line . 1971 version , well 70s . they best they could what they . but this version concentrates more friendship two athletes well family chicago bears provided it players since it beginnings 1920 . pfeifer maher performances wonderful ! coach halas played excellently too ! huge chicago bears fan chicago bears history buff , i'd say this movie almost perfect . oh your tissues ready almost this whole movie because it sadder than first . granted stories same , but they focus more illness not race issue . i believe more important this story than anything else .	1
i am really picky critical what i watch , but i consider wire season 1 masterpiece . give you idea my tastes , one my favorite movies insomnia al pacino . this show even better than , you get enjoy it whole season , not just 2 hours ! everything rings true . dialogue , plot -- everything . plot dialogue remind me movie crash times , only this less over-the-top . it lots philosophical symbolism , but unlike crash it presented subtly rather than beating you over head it . suspenseful moments most suspenseful i've seen anything screen . because it serial , there time complex plot complex characters developed . you get hear bona fide dialect spoken many african-americans dc-baltimore area where i live , vocabulary not dumbed down general audience you would find most movies . you get real thing . lastly , director something i wish more directors would : he dispenses music most part . many directors use music crutch making audience feel emotions they supposed feel particular scene . here , emotional reactions induced good acting alone , it works . watch this show . you won't regret it	1
great video . i've looking this one quite some time . three sets brothers plays three sets brothers days james gang right after civil war . i'm glad add this my collection western classics	1
this sequel viewers sidestitches laughing their heads off ! regina hall anna faris return play their hilarious characters wayans brothers bring laughs two fold . if you into classic horror movies than this best movie ! there ia lot more tongue cheek moments crude sometimes political humor . now lot people bag tori spelling but i thought she hilarious this movie . watching classics such " exorcist " , " haunting " " house haunted hill " mercilessly spoofed make this purchase worth it . this may not funny people enjoy slasher flicks but those enjoy classics , then this movie ! however i'd warn against eating or drinking while watching this movie unless viewer doesn't mind spewing said items out their nose	1
rabbitproof fence based true story three young aboriginal girls who ran away government relocation program 1930 australia . " half-caste " ( half-white ) aboriginal children forcibly removed their parents government , placed schools taught white way life , placed white families . many children never saw their parents again . against such tragic backdrop , rabbitproof fence impossibly exhilarating , not because happy ending , but just because someone tried fight racist program against impossible odds . three young girls seek walk fifteen hundred miles back their family , they chased trackers . extras - making-of documentary film commentary director truly enhance film make it experience you never forget , not entertainment few hours . highly , highly recommended	1

this series bawdy tongue cheek way totally not pc , i think what makes watching it so much fun . mike hammer old school private eye living digital era , but least he still solve crimes catch " bad guys " . it campy full puns , if you enjoy blood elaborate chase scenes this not you . but if you just want chuckle don't take things you see television shows seriously this could choice you . never saw original however .	1
what great movie ! i remember watching it kid see it again ! just gets better time ! all star cast such theatrical acting ! if you've never seen movie before , you'd never guess who dunn it ! they just don't make movies like this today . this stimulates mind without all gore . very comical , too . highly recommended	1
although not my favorite jim carrey movie , me , myself irene moments pure hilarity . i'm big fan carrey i'm also nice person who stepped one too many times my life . so when charlie ( carrey ) finally snaps grocery store , i feel like i relate only wish i nerve act like his alter-ego , hank , who soon starts taking over . much like me , charlie wasn't always this way . he got married his wife wound up affair black midget limo driver their wedding day . she triplets although it quite obvious charlie not father , he embraces them anyway . then , she leaves him boys . that when charlie starts chipping away . he buries all his anger sadness inside until lo behold , he cannot take it anymore . his first outburst far my favorite . his fellow troopers rhode island force worried him he now take pills keep hank coming out . his boss gives him time off asks him drop off woman named irene upstate new york . epa wants talk her her involvement golf course scam , but irene doesn't know anything it ... her ex before she figure it out , he got everyone coming her . when his guys kill agents charlie left her , irene runs get charlie 2 must leave immediately . course , they hit road , charlie forgets bring his pills soon , irene gets meet hank . but " 3 " them ( charlie , hank irene ) survive lam ? ah , it certainly not carrey best film , but if you're fan , you'll certainly laugh out loud wonderful time . he really great job . if you mute movie , you still clearly tell when he charlie or hank . me , myself irene fun funny , if you've ever felt like you one second away snapping yourself , this one definitely you . enjoy	1
i didn't want start my review this way but , once while there comes movie extraordinary vision independence it must set apart others paradigm follow . pan labyrinth just such movie . far best work fantasy genre come out i'd say since legend . this movie not copy paste version novel little men , nor it poorly adapted screenplay novel written 15 year old . this movie delves deep into nature fantasy itself . what more fantastic than what within human mind ? possibilities , both wonderful horrific , endless . poor little ofelia our guide through human psyche we revel her wonderful fantasies revolted viscious clarity her reality . elements all classic fairytales interspersed within , carefully woven together form new unique tale . some say this movie brutality war , child imagination escapist fancy . i disagree . though movie set time revolution there few , stress few , graphically violent scenes , movie this sharp contrasts hazy , beautiful fantasy scenes . focus more emotion unimaginative reality life . ofelia encounters many monsters , both real mythical , worst captain , her stepfather . this serves strengthen fact some people lives worse than anything we imagine . far cinematography goes , movie shot perfectly . reality dark gritty , dirty yet vividly clear . ofelia fantasy world moments clarity , but overall hazy , like memory sunny summer day long , long ago . mood captured perfectly really brings viewer into picture . soundtrack subtle , enabling viewer visually astounded , yet powerful enough it startle you out your dream when you least expect it . one my favorite things movie narration . narrator voice melodic deep . when narration starts , it just fits so perfectly you couldn't imagine movie without it . watching this movie spanish real treat , even if you don't speak language . so much feeling context gained watching it natural language it completely negates any bad things subtitles . overall , huge recommendation anyone who tired boring , unimaginative complacent productions hollywood . this stimulate mind leave you sad but same time happy	1
movie such this , i pleasantly surprised realistic qualities it held . first i skeptical david duchovny talk over if he doing narritive . really wasn't what it though . it just exerpts things he putting tape later use . once i got my head , movie started flowing pretty nicely . brad pitt excellent job role he played white trash killer who really doesn't understand what he doing even though he knows fact he killed . absolutely no remorse . usual , juliette lewis plays dumb innocent girl astounding accuaracy . either she really good actress she just typecasted , or she just dumb they hire her those types roles just reason . this movie overall great anyone who likes take peek life serial killer . even though it based fiction , brad pitt such good job sticking role gave movie realistic quality . check it out if you into those types movies	1
i really enjoyed this movie . i thought story excellent . i expected frankenstein your classic , everyday , lame horror film which you only watch get some cheap thrills , see some horrible overacting . i didn't find it so all . this movie beautifully - powerful , dynamic story how man attempts achieve greatness , but ends up ruining their lives lives others result . i not read mary shelley book , but if it half emotional effect this movie , i'll consider it time well spent ! kenneth branagh brought this movie together wonderfully , both his directing powerful , memorable acting tormented dr. victor frankenstein . this film quite simply spectacular ! it goes same category hell , they both too sophisticated beautiful just horror films . cleverness this film its sheer radiance must throw some people off . robert de niro creature ! de niro gives foul beast soul his own . well worth look , photography alone makes it worth owning dvd .	1

my second favorite three darin/dee comedies , last one they filmed . obviously not shakespear , but cute premise good supporting cast , great chemistry two leads . esp good donald o'connor , one darin real life heros . it great see them work together . it also demonstrates darin considerable songwriting talent peaked when he commissioned write song specific context , occured many his movies . resulting theme song here , funny feeling , really wonderful infectious . recommended fans darin , dee , or just fans goofy romantic comedies general .	1

tos finally comes end we get volume worthy trek lore . mediocre 3rd season me praying someone put this puppy out its misery but least we get two episodes , second which even more so , worthy inclusion among very best episodes across all 3 seasons here . first episode little silly times but huge redeeming factor me introduction explanation very key characters pivotal future trek series like ds9 e.g. kahless founding father vulcans . also , moral pursuit science knowledge noble worthy causes themselves but not cost misery suffering innocent others i found very relevant even today . second episode one my all-time favourites i even liked it better than " city ... forever . " just episode , there number inconsistencies strange events here like how completely different planet similar history ours musketeers boot ! ignoring this though , side-story spock mccoy simply brilliant . nimoy very good acting job here he shows emotions jealousy anger then reverts his usual self end . very good time-travel episode very easily best episode final season . if you deciding which volumes keep , this one falls under " must " category . recommended	1
following up their success 1974 uptown saturday night , sidney poitier ( raisin sun , guess who coming dinner ) bill cosby ( " i spy " , california suite ) paired up again this film aptly titled let it again ( 1975 ) , which followed their third outing titled piece action ( 1977 ) . directed poitier , let it again featured particularly strong supporting cast calvin lockhart ( uptown saturday night ) , john amos ( " good times " , die hard 2 ) , ossie davis ( right thing ) , denise nicholas ( piece action ) , lee chamberlin ( " electric company " ) , julius harris ( live let die ) , mel stewart ( hammer , trick baby ) , jimmie walker , who top world time his role character james ' . . ' evans , jr hit television series " good times " , his first silver screen appearance . also , keep eye out former heavyweight boxing champion george foreman , sans his foreman grill , jayne kennedy ( muthers ) , former miss ohio one first women land nfl announcing gig , bit parts near beginning ( miss kennedy `legs ' scenes worth watching more than once ) . poitier cosby play couple atlanta working class stiffs clyde williams billy foster , respectively , both who members lodge need new home , city planning tearing down their current location . lodge raised some monies , but not nearly enough fund new building , but billy plan ... one involves clyde using his ability hypnotize . men , their wives , played nicholas chamberlin , leave atlanta weekend getaway new orleans ( billy his wife celebrating their anniversary ) , lodge money hand , intent taking funds betting extreme underdog bootney farnsworth ( walker ) , upcoming boxing match . it sucker bet sure , one local big time criminals kansas city mack ( amos ) biggie smalls ( lockhart ) only too happy take , until they lose because clyde put whammy bootney , making him believe he greatest fighter there ever ... after bootney slaughters his opponent , clyde billy collect winnings , remove whammy bootney , return home , but kansas city mack figures out what happened , finds boys , now wants put them work fixing fight not only get his money back , but also put his rival , smalls , out business same time . boys little choice but participate mack scheme , but they develop their own double-cross , one score their lodge funds necessary new nursery while getting both kansas city mack biggie smalls off their backs good , if things go planned , that big if ... three films poitier cosby together early mid 1970s , this one probably my favorite , uptown saturday night ( 1974 ) piece action ( 1977 ) coming close second third , respectively ... regardless , all three films just whole lot fun , poitier cosby played off so well against each other , assisted wonderful supporting cast each time . what so interesting these movies they originally presented alternative black audiences cinema , time , inundated blaxpoitation films , but ended up appealing wide range audiences due fact they just so entertaining . perhaps funniest bit this film , besides cosby character flashy wardrobe when he disguised his underworld alter ego mongo slade , sequence after jimmy walker character hypnotized confidence up waz . after knocking put his sparring partner , bootney subsequently tears up gym , knocking punching bag through wall speed bag out window amazement everyone ( most all his trainer ) attendance . some aspects feature terribly dated , i.e. wardrobe sported some characters , gangsters seemed particularly goofy ( i found it difficult believe times kansas city mack or biggie smalls could hold down large , criminal operations due ineptness themselves their respective crews ) , but this all good natured fun , so we weren't meant take any it too seriously . cosby character just whole lot fun watch , whether he sticking script , or improvising his own bits . aspect really helped make this film soundtrack legendary curtis mayfield , featuring staple singers their smooth tune " let it again " . his best work , my opinion , 1972 film superfly , but his efforts here certainly outstanding . i think feature ran bit long ( pushing two hour mark ) , poitier could shaved ten minutes off still strong film , but he keep things moving well . story get slightly convoluted during latter half feature poitier cosby characters get their wives involved effort not only score some much needed funds , but also shake criminals off their tails , but given this comedy , more outlandish situations better . perhaps it also important note characters within three films , while very similar , not same so films followed uptown saturday night aren't sequels , but basically follow ups . if you're looking some lighthearted fun featuring some crazy characters even crazier situations , then i'd recommend checking out this film , uptown saturday night ( 1974 ) piece action ( 1977 ) , all certainly fit bill ( again , since let it again piece action aren't actually sequels , order which they're seen doesn't really matter ) . picture , provided anamorphic widescreen ( 1.85 : 1 ) , looks sharp dolby digital mono audio comes through clean . only extras included dvd subtitles ( available english , spanish , french ) , feature length commentary track screenwriter richard wesley new york press film critic armond white . too bad warner couldn't pull together some principal players commentary track i would really enjoyed hearing both but poitier cosby comment their film , but oh well ... cookieman108	1

( although i might stretch point name " bad guy " deputy director stagg , supervisory us marshal who , upon seeing weaver name front page newspaper , demands stakes raised armed tactical units brought . this particular character gets all 30 seconds ' screen time , but i think it far say , if stagg ego hadn't so badly bruised thought weaver not arrested 18 months , situation could stayed under control . ) working script lionel chetwind , which developed book " every knee shall bow " jess walter , young frankly amazing job portraying weavers ' early life together , dropping hints racism , separatism , some decidedly unorthodox religious viewpoints way -- but none it condemning manner . yes , vicki randy almost certainly not sort folks you'd want associate much , but all character flaws , nothing justifies what their situation came . truth , triumphant scene which family finally " discovers " spot land become their home should end story . i've always something laura dern fan , but my admiration this actress talent professionalism definitely raised couple notches her portrayal vicki . you see her eyes fervent belief complete assurances , while perhaps misguided , certainly not out cause trouble or violence -- indeed , end it vicki who asks randy stop associating skinheads , he more than happy so , clearly not very comfortable association all . disintegrating lines communication vicki rest her family especially well performed particularly hard watch . quaid , he manages deliver soul truly conflicted man , even behind exhausted eyes someone who finds himself number-one subject discussion across america when all he truly ever wanted left alone raise his family . bradley pierce puts across absorbing combination childhood innocence hard-hearted bigotry into role 14 year-old sammy weaver , who , together jacob davis younger version sammy , turn character into audience favorite time marshals open fire . it when family starts associating area neo-nazis aryan nations members kirsten dunst really starts shine story , absorbing hateful propaganda neatly tying it into religious views which her mother diligently raised her . end result both compelling disturbing . darren burrows also delivers first-rate performance weaver family friend kevin harris , who manages anchor weaver reality even he lies bleeding delirious . particularly compelling performance brought life bruce locke , who plays fbi sniper lon horiuchi , who killed vicki even she held her baby . locke injects sense anger naked revenge into eyes sniper -- this man who chosen interpret already badly-explained revised rules engagement himself , all he think getting even evil bastards who killed us marshal william degan . also worth look joe don baker legal living legend gerry spence " silkwood " notoriety , who manages switch some desperately-welcomed humorous moments movie coda . few points trivia : works hal lindsey ( " late great planet earth " ) referenced early story catalyst shaping vicki weaver beliefs . longtime independent journalist . orlin grabbe , one first publicly denounce fbi domestic terrorists , appears extra several scenes . short , movie not flinch : weaver loving dad devoted husband , but also bigot petty thief . feds framed him , botched case , overstepped their authority . there no excuses . nobody comes out this story completely innocent not single tenet hollywood-style political correctness observed . no single scene truly emerges pivotal " here where it all went wrong " moment . gary graham performance reluctant us marshal particularly convincing -- here law enforcement figure obviously doesn't want follow up this case would happily let him , but orders he getting above . movie takes us one sequence bad decisions next , ultimately revealing real " villain " piece miscommunication . marshals aren't listening local residents , weaver not listening his neighbors , vicki isn't listening her parents ( nor they listening her ) , press isn't listening marshals , us attorney isn't listening atf case agent , course fbi isn't listening anyone . it only end action when bo gritz ( excellently played bob gunton ) delivers horrifying news agitated crowd " villain " reveals itself -- one deft move , gritz defuses miscommunication , states simple truth , even calms down unruly ready-for-blood mob . federal government learn its lesson tragedy ruby ridge ? well , course . you just imagine internal memos flying around : " next time , punch holes walls tanks , flood place flammable gas , then shoot anyone who tries escape fire .

whole " women prison " drama where they sexual realtionships quite nauseating watch . i guess it becasue i've worked prisons this kind show so ridiculous , usa male version ( oz or prison break ) . least male prison shows , there agenda escape , or some attempt everyday life prison ; whereas this show depicting healthy relationships . what makes this show more ridiculous love affairs women . not there aren't those female facilities . they just aren't like how they depcited this show . they create these soap box love stories don't ring true . more than likely affairs women prison manipulative , controlling , always volatile , never romantic . there usally so much dysfunction chaos created around female inmate relationships . it never positive experience , dysfunction real female inmate vs tv inmate makes latter unbelievable . reality , women prison isn't healthy environment where healthy relationships evolve . it place where women offenders various crimes grouped together , egoes , violent behaviors , battered scars , addiction patterns really surface create nauseating work environment officers staff . anyone who ever worked prisons any length time would view this cringe . it insulting women prison staff media comes out these show	-1

watching 1972 " poseidon adventure " again , after seeing 2006 remake , shown no amount bombastic digital effects reduce impact original " poseidon adventure . " " poseidon adventure " all heart character development , it makes you laugh , cry your heart race-especially during tidal wave sequence . scene still gets me much now , it when i first saw movie little kid . movie simply brilliant all levels , acting , special effects , atmosphere . believe me , i don't throw word ' brilliant ' around loosely . thing always felt most chilling me film few seconds dead silence ballroom soon ship finished turning over . it might've unintentional dialogue earnest borgnine , but during scene where he helping move christmas tree , you make him out saying : " holy --- it heavy .

first , commentor erronously stated happy days owes its inspiration american graffiti when actually pilot ron howard shot 1971 ( eventually shown love american style episode 1972 ) then shelved garry marshall . it said lucas even asked look footage ascertain whether howard would suitable steve bolander . course excitement project reivigorated success american graffiti , but no way owes inspiration it . movie , it nearly perfect . even though it half-generation before my own , it still evokes sense nostalgia . there ache soul when one contemplates cusp change , losing something special , knowing best days slipped into past . this movie captures this concept magnificently . acting superior , editing great , direction pitch perfect ( why star wars i-vi inhabited wooden cut-outs mystery me ) . movie doesn't overstay its welcome almost 2 hours it flies , if anything seems too short , not characters underdeveloped , you just want see more what soon memory . movie treat you just want it even bigger . it nice level it ron howard richard dreyfus before they became ron howard richard dreyfus . relative unknowns performances generally free pretensions . all around must see movie my top 10	1
i read several reviews series , devoted viewer during series ' run , i think uproar lack original soundtrack music laced each episode tempest teapot . producers these dvd faulted , however , not printing disks correct markings so we know which episodes disks . they mysteriously blank making it real guessing game which disk play , especially if you trying stay original sequence . other than , this show writing its best creative direction , faultless photography location , fine ensemble cast . filmed fictional alaska town cicily without laugh track or live audience sound stage , each script stood test time multiple stories taking place each episode . one particular episode one my favorites . character , ed , gave storekeeper ruth ann mason jar dirt her birthday . it grave site he bought her . end episode pays off ed heart-felt gift he drives ruth ann site overlooking magnificent river valley . she then askes ed first " dance grave " her . tears viewer guarenteed . so , my fellow devotees , give up your angst over original soundtrack remember scripts , dialogue performances what they : unforgotable collectable	1
her comic teaming rock hudson tony randall 1959 mega hit " pillow talk " , produced ross hunter doris day , ten years successful film work already behind her entered into her most successful period film stardom where her teamings likes hudson , james garner cary grant made her most popular female star her time . less well known this period this once only pairing she david niven 1960 " please don't eat daisies " . despite not high profile like day/hudson teamings this effort went become huge hit mgm ended up studio biggest money earner year after " butterfield 8 " , starring elizabeth taylor . while not hilarious comedy vein this effort provides interesting balance drama comedy its story theatre critic rise heights his profession who then discovers he loses everything real value including his family way . chief joy " please don't eat daisies " , my belief most pleasing very compatiable chemistry two very different lead performers . doris day david niven work off each others very different personality surprisingly effective way which makes them appear like they indeed real married couple trying cope change their personal professional crcumstances resulting husband getting his big break theatre critics circle . although doris day most fondly remembered comedies late 1950 early 1960 " sex comedies " , rock hudson james garner , this quietly amusing family comedy something every doris day fan should include their film collections . film one those early 1960 efforts successful it spawned mid ' 60 television series same name lasted couple seasons but which course not doris day david niven leads . different type leading man englishman david niven , doris proves herself just adept working him she american leading men she her more famous collaborations . while not funny or memorable day/hudson teamings such films " pillow talk " , " lover come back " , i strongly recommend you take time sit down enjoy this often quite serious little domestic comedy some themes just timely today they 1960 . doris day always highly entertaining any her films whether they drama or comedy mgm 1960 hit " please dont eat daisies " , no exception . enjoy	1

i'd waiting pick up all five seasons babylon 5 every since they released dvd few years ago . i finally able over this past holiday season . i often look major purchase comparison number hours i enjoy product against number hours i must work pay it . so far , babylon 5 worth every second well penny . i watched majority show when it aired live late 90s . i recall very sad while watching final episode , knowing one my favorite shows leaving air . through this dvd set , i now remember why it one my favorites . writing babylon 5 crew , jms particular , very few peers , if any . i can't count number times i've taken quote episodes shown it my friends , some whom no interest sci-fi shows , just because it somehow applies our current lives . pick this up , it worth every second your time	1
excellent . it going pass long time before fantasy movie even come close this productio	1
nicely reproducted copy film . i wanted it basically music , but enjoyed seeing film again , too . ( it certainly suited " " rating - which seems somewhat rare these days !	1
this just nice , feel good romantic comedy . very cute , kind funny . i like lead guy , even though i can't remember his name right now . i also liked they not typical hollywood-type couple . they look normal .	1
i afraid even before watching this movie degree realism going par days thunder ( cars slamming into each other constantly , wrecked cars winning races , etc ) it only took few minutes viewing me realize this movie far , far worse . aside fact none actors could perform their way out old paper bags , movie moves such rapid pace it almost makes you dizzy . now degree realism . i understand not all car races electrifying , but i see no reason there spectacular crash every single race . i never 18 years watching indycar races seen car go flying off track into water hazard . that why barriers there . also , those indycars aerodynamically designed so if track turned upside-down , cars would stay glued course , yet they fly off ground this movie like they made out tissue paper . good lord , joyride through chicago stupidest scene whole movie . it would interesting scene aside fact indycars can't start themselves . even worse , neither one drivers even gets trouble it ...... don't get it . this movie makes days thunder look like masterpiece cinema . if you want watch racing movie , rent . not driven . absolutely not driven	-1
this movie kept me edge my seat whole 90 minutes ... especially when ending movie came around . all i say expect big twist . when movie over , i sit 5 minutes think ending .... then i realized i idiot not noticing all clues showed up during movie lol . anyway , this movie deserves 5 star rating just ending itself	1
this astounding film so prescient regarding our current plight it could considered prophetic . andy griffith astonishing his role lifelong failure screw-up who discovered groomed into folksy demagogue svengali-like character ( portrayed movie patricia neal life karl rove ) . fronting sinister group conservative wealthy big-business-types , larry " lonesome " rhodes manages get one them elected president talking him up stints joking , banjo-playing " jes ' folks " radio ( here fiction present reality diverge somewhat ) . familiar me his work " andy griffith show " , i not seen such remarkably successful casting against type since avuncular fred mac murray 60 tv show " my three sons " played weaselly , self-serving navy officer " caine mutiny " . you might say this movie happy ending : just when " lonesome " rhodes zenith his power popularity , patricia neal decides leave microphone open after one his broadcasts ends so public learn what he really thinks them . instead folksy patter , country stupefied they overhear venomous contempt them stream their radio speakers . , rhodes finished . concluding half-hour which follows harrowing scene rhodes returns his luxurious home proceeds emotionally disintegrate before eyes skeptical unsympathetic walter matthau . ( people who made " network " get their ideas peter finch character breakdown this scene ? ) standpoint story whole , movie could ended soon after scene open mike , but sight ol ' " lonesome " raving , bawling , wallowing self-pity one viewer not likely forge t.t he most disturbing thing this film evident faith elia kazan-a patriot who endured much vilification testifying against stalinist communists movie industry-that people , though mislead , would eventually catch would right thing . no means clear moment . instead , there plenty evidence public turned away serious news ( it may tell them things they not want hear ) towards infotainment plays their fears , hates , vanities , delusions ignorance . contrast , they shown themselves appallingly credulous towards official assurances prevarications sort usually seen only nazi or soviet propaganda . indeed totalitarian propaganda , even " lonesome " rhodes ' pseudo-populist cornpone seem hopelessly primitive compared today state art . even so , worst lies always ones told one self . when country reacts officially condoned torture murder prisoners something like `they would never ! besides , what wrong it anyway ? ' , then reality finally trumped any possible satire-even satire brilliant this film 	1

i gave my daughter this 2 disc edition christmas now gotten see extras included second disc . movie itself looks great what i think improvements stage production ( switching cool gee officer krupke ; swapping america tonight ; adding boys america ) but i wish they not omitted ballet sequence . get cast recording carol lawrence larry kert hear how great ballet sequence sounds . this musical deserves seen big screen ( or least big screen tv killer sound system ) appreciated wonderful score . everything could said songs bernstein sondheim wrote said so i can't add anything there . forget idea natalie wood playing puerto rican enjoy great movie . see stage production if it ever comes your town	1
start out , i won't even comment your inability , ( or rigid unwillingness i can't conceive anyone thick enough not ability , ) grasp concept synergy , i.e. buckminster fuller , i.e. sum whole greater than , or capable transforming definition seperate parts , but , i think your bent mind you obscured clouds narrow perception . you even know meaning word obtuse ? i don't think so . this film extremely existential anthropomorphic but quite reverse obtuse . so , risk truly obtuse , look word up dictionary . then try using it proper context . but then , if you weren't so obtuse you would already know . but i digress , review : this film , ( while admittedly bit afield novel , well extremely toned down sexual angle ) , fairly brilliant scene where ' agent ' conversation ' agent ' while walking down street , mouthing conversation while we hear each person private thoughts , while not original concept , quite original style . ( woody allen same thing you recall ' annie hall ' but subtitles . using actual ' thought dialogue ' voices cronenberg raised device kitchiness surreallism . cool !	1
cheech chong already bunch albums under their belts since 1971 , so they weren't exactly new when up smoke hit theaters september , 1978 . i often seen this movie network tv , unfortunately , it so drastically butchered because they censor lot , not mention all commercials . but course i get this movie vhs or dvd . i ended up dvd , which some bonus features , including bunch unused clips , even audio commentary lou adler cheech marin movie , i actually got some useful info them movie , some trivia it ( like vw beetle tommy chong driving rolls royce radiator strapped front near beginning film actually belonged jack nicholson ) . it seemed only natural lou adler would direct this film , after all , cheech chong albums produced adler ( released his ode label , which included various music acts like carole king psychedelic band spirit ) . it fantastic film full laughs . much what i want say i can't say here because it won't get posted ( because content ) , but it basically two hippies trying escape law , get deported mexico , return america van made marijuana , enter rock band contest . speaking which , there this scene during " rock fight " ( where these punk rock bands play ) there this one singer who so badly wanted mick jagger , it hurts , audience started throwing beer cans him ( music sounded like stones ripoff ) . but course , end cheech chong performing " earache my eye " ( alice bowie this movie ) . this cut originally appeared their wedding album ( 1974 ) , but course it only musical part included this film . speaking music , while saturday night fever capitilized disco craze , up smoke seemed pick up punk rock craze . both styles music came out around same time ( though disco much more popular america because it moneymaker ) pretty much brought end prog rock psychedelia came before it . what really strange cheech marin tommy chong quite bit older than real musicians involved punk rock scene . up smoke truly great movie , so its following , cheech chong next movie , so make sure you get both	1
this yet wonderful offerring clint eastwood . this movie clint plays red , aspiring guitarist singer who dreams performing memphis . we see red deterioration through tuberculosis movie progresses . his final cry lost love more believable than anything i seen or read so called " master vulnerable sentimental nostalgia " tennessee williams . i give this movie 5 stars because mr. eastwood can't sing which means he something common most country music stars today	1

i didn't even see this movie i know it sucks . all i see bon jovi i threw video ground hard i could muster video store where i promptly kicked out . it worth it though , it actually offensive such thing could exist . vampire genre could so awesome yet very few films live up its potential . i guess it also lends itself complete drivle such " vampires - los muertos "	-1

almodovar making quite name himself recently , it easy see why . his films called daring while still engaging topics particular focus interest society today . his characters willing silent when needed , which good independent film motif some odd reason lot filmmakers don't seem fully understand power . he uses somewhat hitchcockian style his movies , which always good way boost favor amongst critics film snobs . furthermore , this film features none other than gael garcia bernal , strongest actor working spanish-language films one strongest actors around today . short , this film would fail marvelously any less than good , thus it very damn good . storyline itself sort approach could only around today , but which lot stylistic roots we've come accept past , mainly film noir . when two characters exit film noir festival movie say , " it like they us , " it not just almodovar paying homage greats past , it him recognizing expressing exactly what his film . i like it because it several layers narrative narrative-within-a-narrative force me question how much it actually " true " some it may based real life experiences almodovar . however , i don't know because i don't know anything almodovar biography ... i don't care . but point film narrative style forces us question it biographical sources , kind like movie like matrix or existenz forces us question our own reality presenting multiple levels virtual realms . r-rated version : really , my suggestion you see nc-17 version . r-rated version poor job hiding its imagery it badly produced censorship ( including pixellations ... ugh ... ) make it seem more pornographic than scenes actually . -- polarisdi	1

this great film true spirit basic plot dickens . songs melodically wonderful choreography original , fresh keeps your eyes constantly screen . movie very well cast ron moody wonderful fagin . he " nicer " than book ( maybe it pet owl they gave him ) but his basic motivations actions remain same albeit he happier more ambiguous ending film . oliver reed probably more physically attractive bill sikes than one most people imagine reading dickens ' work but he certainly menacing scary . nancy , also , much lovelier ( well older ) than novel describes but part excellently acted sung shani wallis . child actors all engaging not smugness ( well artful charlie supposed " cheeky " ) too many times seen young kids movies . plot simplified book few characters like rose oliver evil half brother monks left out time sake but it not hurt story since it could argued original too many complicated subplots . some " exciting " scenes added action loving moviegoer rather disturbingly innocent oliver present scenes both nancy bill demise . mr. mrs. bumble not larger , very comic , parts they play both novel originial musical though mr. bumble " law then sir bachelor ... may he learn experience " speech included almost word word dicken original writing many other critical speeches throughout film . oliver wonderful gem whole family enjoy . dvd flipped over there not many extras but these minor quibbles such great viewing experience .	1

after reading reviews synopsis here amazon ( which same back dvd ) , i thought this looked like it would very good movie promising plot . within first fifteen minutes , however , it not all i expected . first , summary stated anna manni ( police investigator played asia argento , daughter director one only redeeming features this movie ) hot trail serial killer/rapist would captured because attack stendhal syndrome . this misleading because this actually happens early movie ( before any her tracking him down shown ) . other words , if you expecting see movie beautiful , strong-willed police detective trying capture serial killer , this not movie you . instead it [ mostly ] journey into mind greatly disturbed ( possibly psychotic ) rape victim . overall quality this movie also not nearly great it director reputation . this my first dario argento movie , it grave disappointment . after hearing " argento genius , " i really expected movie great editing , dialogue least decent horror movie style soundtrack . this movie instead opposite all counts . finally , style presented leaves lot desired . it basically mashing together sci-fi , horror , drama , even romance doesn't quite work ( some parts so outlandish i could not help but laugh ) . short , save your money worthier movie not follow flawed script begin , not attempt such " stylistic " filmmaking .	1
this movie amazing ! i love how scenery changes mood , while most directors just change lighting background music . akira kurosawa takes art movie making takes it up whole other level brilliance	1

truly one most off wall movies ever . john cusack girlfriend dumps him . this would pretty hard most people except he literally thousands pictures up her . everything this movie extreme . cusack sicko best friend amazingly funny watch , sure see him snort snow wonderul scene . cusack girlfriend new preppy boyfriend who head ski team . cusack decides defeat him . there way too much talk there no way i could give anythign away one funniest movies ever . i mean you chinese guy who learned english listening howard cosell forces cusack race cars everyday while announcing race his car , insane paper boy who wants his $2 , you never see van halen same way again . cause everybody wants some , baby how bout you ? obviously it goes without saying this movie needs special edition .	1
i intrigued see this film again after " remake " popped up 2005 . scanning all video stores shops cape town try find copy . unfortunately no avail . until " lock-down " special edition popped up - obviously remind us all before adam sandlers version , or vinnie jones ... it burt " deliverance/the bandit " reynolds who delivered blows one all time great prison football movies . i very impressed film made 31 years ago still some kick !!! lets honest , you not going get " matrix " style footage , no overly impressive slow-mo or thumping music - but take it what robert aldrich hoped we would . cleverly made action-comedy offers great way escape 2 hours . film under-tones dirty dozen coming through - recruiting bunch misfits all out spectacular mission . this case , turning tables guards delivering some punishment inflicted them full duration their sentences . all all - still magnificent film . 31 years ago - it must epic . burt - well he always great watch !!! let hear it : " mean machine " , " mean machine " , " mean machine " !!! small footnote those wanting buy it : transfer great . colours good , offered widescreen , but sound mono , not 5.1 ! ( this may just copy offered south africa - but i doubt it ) there also one scene where voice/picture overlay doesn't quite fit ... but flick made 31 years ago ... it all accepted !!! worth shelf watch lazy sunday afternoon !!!	1

you don't appreciate stephen king works like this great movie based one king better stories . not only outstanding performances main supporting cast makes dead zone standout it own , fine direction , camerawork , editing atmosphere makes it all worth while , also . first few minutes after beautiful opening sequence which title becomes visible piece piece , you could amazed honest close real life acting qualities christopher walken . further movie , other performances believable his i think this makes tdz again , great movie . still , you see yourself it make your own observations get your own opinion . if you see tdz years ago when it came out , liked it , want buy copy dvd ( again , maybe ) , than this version you'd want . extra fine nice , but : picture quality well sound quality greatly improved . i should emphasise ' improved ' because it major enhancement . it looks like it put disc yesterday - , today technologies mastering equipment just after it shot , almost , high definition camera equipmen t.t he picture quality really very impressive sound stage like you're there . it all you could want , especially movie this age . get it enjoy , like i . highly recommended	1

controversial french director catherine breillat " brief crossing " ( 2001 ) mesmerizing 80-minute knockout follows two very different travelers they meet overnight ferry cruise enter into steamy one-night affair . twist here odd couple thirtysomething englishwoman 16-year-old french schoolboy . breillat obviously inspired david lean classic " brief encounter . " however , similarities end there . anyone who seen any breillat previous features ( including [ hot ] " romance " " fat girl " ) know , director isn't interested telling conventional love story so much chronicling psychological fallout sex . this film no exception . breillat herself says revealing interview accompanies film , she made film simply because she wanted explore loss young male virginity . this case , it young thomas ( gilles guillan ) , who meets alice ( sarah pratt ) while ordering dinner , then begins mutual flirtation amused woman after she invites him share table her . over course next hour , they share much revealing conversation , then eventually fall into bed together . what happens next best left viewer experience . obviously centerpiece this film sexual encounter , let just say it beautifully handled director her two actors . perhaps because tender age her young star , breillat doesn't push envelope far she " romance , " leaving it up viewer decide just how real encounter . ( rest assured , young guillan 19 when he made film , but still virgin according director . ) still , it eye-opening moment . so , if you're one easily offended on-screen sexuality , pass this one up . acting pratt guillan perfect . dinner scene particular brilliantly handled . it fascinating watch older woman trying act younger while young boy puffs cigarette vainly tries impress older woman acting much older than he . last fifteen minutes especially ring true , last-minute twist ends film exactly right note . all , " brief crossing " minor film which sacrifices plot tell simple story two disparate souls who make once-in-a-lifetime connection . ending sad but honest , leaves viewer make his own judgments woman behavior . ( it helps take into account differing attitudes sex separates us american puritans european sensibilities : american film would end woman thrown jail statutory rape . ) least film honest it intentions provide erotic experience audience , unlike today american coming-of-age films which disguise their intentions dumb comedy irresponsible filmmaking . ( irresponsible filmmaking , i mean american film would romanticize encounter make it appear beautiful rite-of-passage boy satisfying woman . breillat world , sex raw , clumsy , unmutually satisfying , almost violent even somewhat sad watch . quite difference . ) all , " brief crossing " small gem controversial director who delights polarizing her audiences . viewer enjoyment hinge just how hung-up he/she in-your-face eroticism . enter your own risk . **** ( out *****	1
