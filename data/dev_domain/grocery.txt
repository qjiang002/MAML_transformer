maybe i'm daft , but i can't make decent espresso these pods my machine . i've tried tamping them , which doesn't work well i've tried just placing them filter . both cases i get watery dribble but no espresso . other european products ( think ikea ) there no printed instructions english , just line art drawings . perhaps i'm just doing something wrong . i like concept pods , but i'll stick beans instead	-1
they kindof bland side , i'd rather spend my calories elsewhere ! but they low-carb side . 150 calories , 7g total fat ( 2g saturated ) , 8g sugar , 5g fiber , 1g sugar alcohol , 10g protein	-1
i am really disappointed this beand they marketing this kids . 4% iron no other vitamins ?? childhood obesity epidemic proportions , why would anyone feed their children all these empty calories ?? it like giving them coke or pepsi breakfast !! ok organic coke but still coke !! i am sad because i heard great things this brand really like what they doing endangered species !! but they not thinking their target consumer children	-1
i ordered teriyaki , original black pepper flavored ones . other two flovors quite good but this one , teriyaki , really sub-standard . it sandy texture quality very uneven compared others .	-1
i'm sorry give this poor review , but tea taste good order me drink it . i often drink large variety bedtime teas never tasted any tea this awful . i can't speak how well it works because i couldn't drink whole cup even though i attempted force myself . yogi makes some good teas , but this i just couldn't stomach .	-1

i wouldn't buy it again . i like try new things i never this before , but it wasn't good . yes , my crew ate it , they eat almost anything this isn't moving	-1
ok so pretzels supposed salty , but these tad too salty . they also burnt flavor . you could say this distinctive smokey flavor , but 12 bags ahead you prospects unsatisfied pallett mighty tall order . other hand subtle sweet flavors good . this not your ordinary pretzel try them safety first ( instead buying 12 bags ) . also note grocery items cannot returned amazon	-1
there no doubt this tea it job , but smell it awful . i normally don't any problems eating or drinking mildly offensive things , but i such aversion smell this tea . it top note moldy , dank earth base note acrid peppers gone bad . box says it contains " delicious sasparilla " . i don't taste anything like sasparilla or rootbeer it all . if you bear smell aftertaste then go it	-1

flavored coffee creamers guilty pleasure mine long time now , but even if you buy sugar-free kind , you're ingesting whopping 1 gram fat per tablespoon creamer . if weren't bad enough , it partially hydrogenated ! splenda flavor blends wonderful alternative if you're like me just can't face black coffee . please note this not creamer . it sweetens/flavors coffee . if you find you just creamer " tame " down your coffee you add splenda flavor blend splash skim milk or if you like things more creamy , buy some powdered non-fat milk add splenda flavor blends . lots times , i find products splenda already them too sweet but i didn't think case this . all three available flavors ( hazelnut , mocha , vanilla ) taste great without overpowering . finally , now i kick fatty creamer bad habit !	1
i not like store-bought cookies , especially oreos ( too dry greasy me ) . but upon recommendation several people , i tried ginger o pleasantly surprised . they excellent flavor cream not greasiness it . if you like ginger cookies , don't hesitate try these	1

i use cups all time- work , home , etc . there handful good cup brands out there . this one best . both decaf regular timothy columbian smooth rich flavor . add some creamer sweetener , goodbye any other coffee !! you won't disappointed . believe it or not , home brewing cup machine(keurig ) gives better cup coffee versus commercial cup machine(also keurig ) , because hot water not blast too quickly through it . fyi	1
this * awesome * soup !! i little iffy it ( any soup coming or bag ! ) but ordered it anyway , it sounded so good . my hubby , toddler i * love * it could eat it every week if we more money buy it ! we took some camping trip shared all our friends we , everyone agreed how great it . not good home-made , but really really good ! i'm not sure taste buds reviewer gave it 1 star , but we all thought it worth getting again ..!	1
great flavor , light fluffy , good texture . only down side bread tends dissolve much moisture , tendency little dry but great sandwiches . unlike other gluten-free breads tend so heavy they over power anything you put middle .	-1

i love pod idea ... makes cleaning so much easier . this perfect quick shot espresso after dinner . excellent	1
i disagree other review this tea unbearable scent . i would say jasmine scent strong , but not overpoweringly so . if you brew it according producer recommendation ( steep it 60-90 seconds ) , result good great . tea very soothing jasmine taste very comforting . only knock perhaps it leaves little bit aftertaste , especially when tea cold . i not understand other reviewer fascination packaging , bag tea bag tea bag tea . who really cares what printed tab ? anyways , i drinking this tea daily i am ready shop when this one runs out . recommended : people looking decent tasting white tea . not recommended : people particularly sensitive scent taste jasmine .	-1
these wonderful cookies ! however , reason i couldn't give full 5 stars because so many boxes case lot crumbled cookies . boxes not damaged any way , so i am guessing they could packaged way . not cool ! otherwise , they much better tasting than oreos my opinion . i'll never go back those	-1
my family my healthfood store lady all say this one best betty lou nut butter balls . i not any problems all taste , fact , it beats heck out coconut ones which extremely sweet . yes , they look green middle , but we found taste rather " clean " refreshing ... not overbearing . you also enjoy " lift " your energy level these spirulina/ginseng balls provide . now i know these little guys , i am getting ready buy tons christmas gifts ! we would not without them anymore . : -	1

these cookies unbelievably good . perfect cup coffee or tea ; perfect alone . i stopped buying them because i just could not stop eating them . if i could buy them packs three or four , then i could them house again .	1
this great granola both nutritious delicious . although it called " cranberry pecan , " i find pecan taste predominate mix , while cranberries quite chewy weaker than some other cereals . this traditional cereal , great way start day . it relatively high calories , but appropriate breakfast suggested quantities . texture very crunchy , while i prefer bear naked texture which softer , this still wonderful product . six-pack cereal very reasonably priced , given quality product excellent value . i recommend this cereal anyone , especially people who love pecans	1
this granola very good - it very chewy .... takes long time chew - dried cranberries very chewy . i think it would taste great salad or mixed other cereal . i wonder if cooking it like hot oatmeal would soften it .	-1

i really got hooked great taste superior creama it produces , but i find it bit overpriced compared other pods . i now buy pods boyd coffee substantial savings . wish amazon would put it sale so i could stock up	1
yes , these pods slightly larger than regular ones , but you make two cups ( 2x4oz or 1x8oz ) out 1 pod price right . i use 1-cup insert , squeeze pod little so coffee gets loose inside , when i close senseo lid , i push lever lid same time	1
if you've ever bahlsen hit cookies ( normally plain cookie chocolate filling ) you'll know these good . creamy center easily eaten separatly nibbling off cookie top bottom . dry cookie isn't too sweet but full flavor . great mid-day snack . i always roll my desk draw work . very very tasty	1

i loved this product i can't find it my local stores . i careful not eat too much :)	1
earl grey my favorite blend tea far - no competition there . biggest secret this tea once given earl grey hoswick hall ( british prime minister 1830 - 1834 ) chinese manadarin , reportedly gratitude after earl saved his life , get just right doseage bergamot oil , rather intense , tangy scent derived bergamot orange ( which turn cross pear lemon sour orange ; latter native south vietnam , its oil probably recipe original ingredient ) . using too much bergamot oil easily obscure black tea natural flavor - but twinings you just can't go wrong , because original earl grey turned this very company match quickly dwindling supply he received his chinese friend . ( twinings website : " when mandarin tasty gift began run out , earl grey asked his tea merchants , twinings , match it him . twinings unique blend grey family long-standing favourite . when guests inquired it , they directed twinings strand , where they would ask earl grey tea name . " ) unless you insist * all * your tea cream or milk , i recommend this one without any kind milk products : not only original recipe not call such addition ; my mind it just plain ruins blend particular flavor . ( but that just me , course . ) whichever way you it , though , if scented teas your kind thing , twinings earl grey should right up your alley	1

i love original vanilla creme newman o , so when i saw wheat-free/dairy-free sale one day i picked one up . i figured it would basically same original . chocolate vanilla tastes great , but i found cookies themselves rock hard . so unless you issue wheat or dairy products , i would recommend original vanilla creme , not wheat-free/dairy-free variety	-1
these greatest . light , not too sweet , delicious . high fiber . who could ask anything more ? problem , amazon seems always limited stock so they go fast . they should even out supply : demand ratio also offer other 2 flavors more regular basis	1

last time i order this sort thing online . i realize ' raisins ' first ingredient , but they weren't even * good * raisins , raisins outnumber everything else good margin . it basically raisin banana few other things thrown . coconut afterthought completely tasteless . sunflower seeds settled bottom . it edible , but it doesn't taste especially good ' tropical ' definitely misleading	-1
may expresso grind , but if you expecting lovely dark aromatic coffee your espresso maker : think again . bitter when drunk own . marginally better when combined milk cappuchino . i shoulda known betta	-1
it odd my taste buds reported me opposite reviews here . i'm disappointed , i paid this premium price based 5 star reviews . i'm old enough remember " old time " licorice sold 1 cent ( even 5 penny ) flavor consistancy i looking forward when i purchased this licorice . i some anise spice my cupboard baking , i just tasted it make sure i didn't my spices mixed up . based comparison ; my verdict this licorice tastes strongly anise ( not licorice ) . i thought it much too soft . there no " chew " it . it mushy . only thing i think compare it soft cheese , such havarti . it even softer than mild chedder . sorry ... only 2 stars me	-1
these apples coated sugar other gunk ( like sunflower oil ) which gives them strange taste . i very disappointed when i tried them . i wanting nice dried apples taste like apples instead oil , sugar preservatives . now i'm stuck two bags product not very good . i also got stuck dried strawberries which even worse . i not trying any more stoneridge orchard products . aware !!, these products cannot returned amazon so sure before you order	-1
my own fault not reading ingredients - but marketing info this product extremely misleading . basically , it $10 bag blueberry candy . high fructose corn syrup second ingredient - oil flavoring also added . i don't anything against candy but this stuff left my teeth tingling hours after i ate it - i actually brush my teeth twice . this product should not natural organic category - don't waste your money	-1
these far best tasting spirulina bars market . whole line more desert like concept , so course they sweet chewy . people ibs probably should not eat finely chopped raw nuts should read ingredients before buying !! food safe celiac , most food allergens ( again read label based your dietary situation ! )the bars travel very well although they may bend mush , because they naturally moist chewey , melting ? never . all bars this line travel great sit months hot or cold . these particularly good athletes people run . oh , price , come , there nothing else even comes close size quality	1

i got into various oolong teas great new york importer . they really know their teas ! but this year , numi ti kuan yin available quality price bests experienced importer . i dunno , maybe they got lucky auction or somthing . but we've enjoying this tea ! you spend 3 times much get better tea . but then it too expensive drink every day . buy this	1
we first bought these crackers local store , loved them . nutritionwise they really good , great flavor oh so crunchy . never attempt conversation while partaking , you'll never hear other person :-) after our first purchase we bought directly dr kracker . then they told us great deal we'd get buying them thru amazon . that what we've doing ever since . aways good meals snack butter or peanut butter . then we'll something more substantial them our lunch time time	1
very nice wooden tea box . make nice present . i not tried teas , though	1
so these basically ritz bits , but three differences : 1 . crackers better ; they taste more buttery flavorful . 2 . cheese better ; it actually tastes like something that met cheese passing , maybe even shaken its hand . 3 . they're all organic ' ' stuff , so make you feel ever so slightly virtuous , less like slave big food . if you're packing lunches kids ( or snacks yourself ) , these great	1
i really like these they lot less sweet than other brands	1
mocha java almost good going starbucks cup coffee . i recommend it anyone who likes mocha flavor coffee	1
you can't tell this rice nooles . it tast just like regular pasta !! my celiac husband loves it he doens't feel like his missng out .	1

i recently decided give these diedrich k-cups whirl . years , i've dedicated green mountain coffee roaster customer , their k-cup varieties excellent ; however , even their " cafe express " discount rate , their coffees more expensive several dollars per 25 count pack than current price amazon offering diedrich blends . i'd traveling southern california few months ago tried some diedrich coffees then . although coffees i tried tended exhibit starbucks/west coast tendency roast beans too darkly -- point effacing some original regional characteristics beans -- they fine dark roasts preferable what i've starbucks . coupled keurig brewer , this makes decent cup medium-to-dark " west coast " style coffee	1

some products better dozen , but i think i would rather opted variety pack if i buy 12-pack zataran . if you reading this review , then you probably already tried dirty rice , since you buy dozen packets it . so you already know it decent mix ( we add our own spices it give it even more kick ) .	1
i bought this add variety my diet , tried teff pudding recipe back - delicious , i think . my family didn't agree , but they like bread i made teff flour . hmm ... perhaps if i soaked grain overnight first , would make smoother pudding . try pudding , or add grain mix breakfast or side dish - it healthy it tastes good .	1
taste good spiced well , but it really dry hard .	1
these 1 " squares low fat sugar , so parents feel good serving them their kids . i wouldn't say they deep chocolately taste , but healthy snack they're pretty good	1
i just received my box sun crystals i not rave enough this product . i never tasted low calorie sweetener close flavor sugar my life . i am big time splenda fan , but this smoother taste it ... although not quite powerful splenda . i use 2 packets coffee normally it perfect amount sweetness without overpowering . using one packet tea just enough sweetness take bite off stronger teas , but not ruin flavor high end teas . all natural , i feel like it must healthier me my family than other low calories sweeteners . this only one i actually feel ok giving my children . i recommend this product highly anyone who uses low calories sweetener . don't forget type $5 discount code	1
spelt pretzels fiber hard come . organic boot ! my family used eat vita spelt until i realized there no fiber them they weren't organic . much cheaper amazon than whole foods	1
this cereal absolutely delicious ! it even tastes good if you eating it chips ! multibran high fiber content good your health , too	1
my search non-bitter ( stevia ) , non-artificial , non-refined sugar sweetner over last ! i hesitated buy this because requirement buy 12 . boy , am i glad i buy whole box ! we use this everything , including baking , find it really good taste . most sweetners ruin taste our fine coffees , but agave simply supplies sweetness . we'll trying amber agave next hopes heartier sweetness winter baked goods	1
after illy espresso bars italy , well , no other espresso tasted good me ! illy tastes great made good pump espresso machine . it also tastes great made steam espresso machine ( e.g. , low end krups ) moka ( italian poor-man espresso maker ) . rich flavor isn't burnt tasting like many espresso roasts . everyone i've made illy espresso raves over flavor compard espresso chain coffee stores . tip when brewing espresso using steam espresso machine : shut off valve before any steaem comes through coffee . high temperature steam leach unwanted flavors into coffee . i used buy illy local stores , but prices over $11 per , sometimes $12 . i happy see amazon start carrying it even lower price . if you can't find illy good runner-up lavazza , however , its flavor isn't intense illy	1
we love these crackers . my kids all eat them , i keep bunch my backpack emergencies . they crunchy nice aftertaste . they smell really good too	1
great product --- what else i say ? while i lived caribbean , i ordered food since it too expensive buy good quality food there	1
weird after taste but over all it good way better than even diet soda no sodium . i'm not sure what previous rater talking i read all ingredients soda my book usally mean it all natural ingredents . already bought couple different flavors tr	1
this best jerky world !!! sooo good . juicy flavor . i eat it all one day . all gone !! spices kinda hert comin out though	1
i order several bags this hot spicy . it grit texture like it sand it . i wrote company found out some bags manufactured larger grain sugar than they intended . this caused grit texture . they sent me replacement bags , replacements wonderful . excellent flavor texture . give them second chance	1
my all-time favorite flavor pop-tart , but no stores my area it . thank you amazon !!!	1
baxters soups usually very nice , but lobster bisque especially good . it tastes authentic , it good flavour , creamy , just enough lobster bits make it interesting . add some fresh black pepper dash brandy or sherry it rivals soup served very good restaurant . it also surprisingly low calorie . though nutrition info here says 130 calories 8oz , label actually says 120 calories , so even if you ate whole lunch you would consume only 220 calories	1
unlike other reviewers , i not like fruit rollups or leathery fruit bars any kind . these bars soft chewy very satisfying . they great snack keep handy . i would highly recommend , especially if you person who doesn't usually like other types fruit leathers , sticks , rollups , etc	1
i like way this tastes , but it not fantastic . it fills you up ( fiber expands ) keeps you regular . honestly 2/3 cup your set breakfast . i don't know what wrong last guy who posted . i'm pretty sure he some dude who thought it would funny write post some old guy unfortunate run bran . nothing goes through you fast . bran not laxative . its bulk forming fiber . i wouldn't really care except this good product	1
this keeper . best i found , so far . light airy . make peanut butter jelly sandwiches .. doesn't need toasted like others ... makes " mean " french toast ... my daughter ( who pretty picky ) eats this bread lot .	1
i loved blueberries raspberries , but not cherries . i thought fruit ( all types ) bit too sweet . they added lot sugar it . otherwise , it healty snack	1
love these granola bars . they healthy you don't force your children eat them . these two very good reasons buy them	1
not most economical way buy this , but packets convenient cheesy garlic delicious without overpowering	1
if you like peppermint then you love this tea . it one celestial seasoning superb products . very warming relaxing	1
ok , i'm eating this stuff , i don't eat cereal . what tell you ? it tells you it pretty good . it organic , so i tell myself i am helping out my body eating it ( which probably not true . ) $3 per box delivered , i don't think i'd buy this , but amazon deal i got them $2 each , now i am considering loading bazillion ' em . this prime member find . maybe i'll mix rest flavors , 6 boxes time . comes $ . 40 per bowl , not counting milk half banana	1
they great , my groom huge cashew fan my mom both more than pleased . they not heavily salted all , we pleasantly surprised , salt more fine powder than what you would expect salted product . they always live upto best peanuts va , we send them people all over country they all hooked	1
my kids(3 4 years old ) just got finished this lunch , i say it instant hit ! they loved rolling their own sushi . i few rolls too , it very tasty . i ordered this whim when it " gold box " special , i am so glad i	1

i wasn't sure this tea first because i tried several other teas contained licorice just too sweet me . however , i'm pleasantly surprized light , tangy flavor this tea . sweetness there , but it not overwhelming . i'm not certain it much me relation " detox , " but i certainly like taste , especially after lunch . it seems settle my stomach help me digest	1
these crackers bes t-t asting saltines we've ever . we love them ! they light , not too salty , delicate smattering olive oil . ingredient list short -- only four items ! i buy them case our family four they don't stick around long enough get stale . they great take party if you're serving crackers cheese . i strongly recommend them .	1
if you judge this snack packaging , you might never try them . baked pea pods don't exactly sound like most appetizing ( or satisfying ) snack , but these guys really deliver . one other reviewers said , they crunchy light , texture similar cheetos , possibly little more dense . they taste lightly salted snow peas , only light airy . while they might not healthy raw or steamed vegetable , they're good alternative if you don't want all chemicals sugars most packaged snacks . these guys no sugar all ingredient list wholly recognizable . i usually buy two bags time because they tend go so fast . both flavors delicious , though i prefer original . since it appears amazon no longer carrying them , you might try wild oats , trader joes or whole foods , if any those nearby	1
" cubicle commando " pringles often find their way into my bottom left drawer . they staple food this environment . i suspect dibert would derive almost 30% his nutrients these ! i love pringles ! however , i've come conclusion i need buy them traditional tube because whenever i buy them " convenient " snak pack , i'm lucky get half them aren't broken or crumbled . what point pringles if you can't eat then whole ? packaging makes difference . maybe you'll better luck than me , but my take it	1
wow ! i use pacific foods beef chicken stock all time i guess i expected more ! convenience isn't worth it if soup super salty tastes processed !!!! hardly any barley or beef ! i cooked up one bag i'm throwing rest out	-1
i want let you know i received my order today mail , im unhappy say this but taste this coffee terrible , i would better off if i thrown my 37.00 out my car window . these coffee selections should pulled off your web site . i know you guys not refund my money this order , but i am going write products manufactorer let them know how i feel their coffee products . taste coffee makes you sick your stomach . if i you i would post this commit under your customer reveiws let other buyers beware this terrible tasting coffee	-1
i am sensitive wheat gluten i swear this product gluten . everytime i eat bowl it i get sick . i bought tons this cereal because it taste good but now i don't know what it because i can't eat it . i think they must process this stuff same equipment other wheat cerel . somehow it getting contaminated . i wish i could send it back . it too bad because it good product , it just not gluten free	-1
this second batch i ordered . i contact representatives brucepac both times complain quality product they kindly send me replacement jerky . i enjoyed same world kitchen jerky other vendors so i cannot understand why order amazon such disappointment .	-1
i tossed it out . texture aweful brittle . only few pieces over 2 inches long there some sand like grit making it completely unedible . gross ! you get what you pay .	-1
there bugs tea bags . now , these aren't ' organic ' bugs you find your garden when you plant veggies . these bugs dig into expired produce . there 4-5 bugs each bag . if you want some protein boost while relaxing before you go bed , this product buy . also , tea bags aren't made organdy . it some sort plastic/polyester . i burnt bag it melted , turned black , glued onto itself . horrible , unethical company	-1
this peanut butter tastes even worse than regular creamy skippy . lack flavor dry texture makes me wonder if " palm oil " they meant write " socks " . thoroughly disappointing , i only finished one jar i bought because peanut butter staple my diet i wasn't waste it . buy real all natural peanut butters or even cheap store brand which contains fully hydrogenated oils which fine you unlike partially hydrogenated ones	1
these excellent graham crackers . we love ' em , kids too , it not often we agree . but you'll sorry if you order graham crackers -- or any other food damaged shipping -- amazon . our recent order arrived original box factory , containing 12 boxes new morning honey grahams . it . no packing material . nothing shield crackers drops shocks shipped us . so we didn't get graham crackers . we got graham crumbs , few graham cracker fragments . all means , order these crackers . just don't order them amazon . instead , find retailer knows how it right , or buy them your local grocery . unless you really want graham cracker crumbs ..	-1
title wrong , this item contains twelve . 5-grams ( 0.0175 ounce ) packets , not twelve . 5-ounce packets .	-1
soft , chewy , little grainy but good flavor . mine expired week after i bought whole 12 pack :( don't expect whole berries . basically everything ground together . odwalla bar much better . definitely try spirelina balls , though little bit green flavor energy/ginsing one well worth cost here- not almost expired ..	1
beyond glaring fact most their products aren't tomatoes , this one blight just tomatoes ethos . " just . " but it two ingredients . it not " just " anything if it includes both bananas strawberries . they don't call cracker jack " just peanuts , popcorn , high fructose corn syrup . " nor it " just " something when it comes package 2 . they don't call variety pack cereal " just grains high fructose corn syrup . " just tomatoes folks deserve credit their aspirations purity but this just goes beyond it . it goes against mimalist reductive concept absolutely roccoco . it just not right	1
i love granola cereal general , but i say this very best granola i ever . people bear naked philosophy i love , which back every bag : " we believe food should hand-made wholesome natural ingredients you actually pronounce . " although i eat processed food , i appreciate appeal more traditionally prepared foods , this granola tops list nutrition taste . like most granola , it high calories fat , but take note fat comes largely nuts contained ( it also contains expeller pressed canola oil ) , it no trans fat , only 1.5 saturated fat per serving . this cereal softer than most granola , though not soft enough me consider it chewy . it large chunks nuts also contains cranberries flax seed , optimal nutritional digestive health . six-pack sold amazon makes price per package reasonable ( ingredients quite expensive ) , so value proposition , i think this not only great product , but great buy . delicious nutritious : great combination i recommend highly	1
i'm vegetarian although my husband isn't , he enjoys this soup just much . tofu mix creates creamy texture . if you're expecting " potato au gratin " flavor , you disappointed ... however , if you've made homemade miso soup scratch like taste , this product makes excellent time-saving substitute . tofu serves source protein seaweed provides medicinal minerals . this soup excellent drink when sick remarkably soothes sour stomach . my local health food store charges $5.30 per box 4 packets . amazon sells it $2.66 box . substantial savings	1
my wife i slightly different tasates coffee , i like mine darker she like milder coffee . this one however just right both us . i drink it daily without cream or sugar ( which i only when i actually enjoy flavor coffee ) . we our second 5 pound bag ! i wish we found this coffee sooner , it great	1

this 100% organic , unrefined coconut oil . yes , it tastes like coconut , but it supose . food should taste like what it ! nutritional value this food outstanding . it contains lot lauric acid which also found mothers milk both antifungal antimicrobial . it stable room temperature not become rancid quickly like other popular cooking oils . it requires very high heat release free radicals ( i prefer red palm oil high heat cooking options because it not release free radicals all ) . my suggested uses : smoothies , slow cooked baked goods , sauteed foods , mixed maple syrup over popcorn , homemade cosmetics , occasional conditioner dry ends long hair .	1
tried senseo pods , millstone , etc . i surprised good old folgers just good some cases better than senseo newer flavors . while made home cafe these fit senseo coffee makers give you good cup lot less than more upscale brands	1

hearty , grea t-t asting cereal . whole grain flavor . originally looked it because lower carbs than other cereals ( which better my reduced carb diet ) . but it quickly become favorite cereal buying six boxes time through amazon.com nets out lower cost per box than buying it local grocery stores .	1
my kids love their macaroni cheese but one day all we generic brand . they didn't eat it all well ( kraft really best ) so i decided try make it little better them . follow recipe box couple exceptions . put one slice velveeta chees while melting butter ( i melt butter while noodles draining so melt butter velveeta faster ) add 1/3 cup milk . what you'll less expensive version really creamy macaroni cheese kraft sells lot more money . adding extra milk cheese they're even getting more calcium . my kids love it when i throw hot dogs even peas so feel free throw other things since it so cheesy ( extra cheesy sauce take things like peas kids don't normally eat make them taste good ) . give it try see what you and/or your kids think	1
this " optimum power " breakfast cereal contains wheat , oats , barley , soy , flaxseeds something nature path calls " kamut " which look like puffed oats . also there freeze-dried blueberries , few anyway , delightful subtle cinnamon flavor hits you . ingredient list contains few other things probably good you . now third ingredient 16-ingredient list - these lists supposed order according percentage largest first - something called " organic evaporated cane juice " . now what but organic sugar ? this probably accounts cereal somewhat sweet , reviewer noted . but it nowhere near sweet those tooth-decaying , empty-caloried , mass-marketed cereals most americans feeding their children . no , this cereal well within tolerance us " granolas " who don't dowse everything sugar , ketchup supermarket mayonnaise . ( no , i don't mean cereal . just making point . ) so when you pour this out box , you see lot extruded , elongated brown rod-shaped thingies , quite few healthy-looking chubby flakes , some those exploded oat-looking morsels probably kamuts here there desiccated blueberry . gawd , when i get started writing like this , i can't stop , i just get more so . better not review anything else tonight . you'll never want eat this . actually , my description thingies could far more graphic devilish . you'll see . please try this cereal , you'll like heartiness , cinnamoniness ( new word ? ) relatively light sweetness . i give it five stars , didn't i	1

this very high quality snack which combines hearty , solid granola irresistable double chocolate . i really love this product -- chocolate lover dream . yet , it surprisingly healthy not too sweet . fat/sugar content comparable most other granolas . i've tried numerous granola over years , this one special . probably not most nutritious granola overall , but it definitely treat tastebuds welcome relief ordinary granolas . i would not this my exclusive source granola , but i buy this many more times future satisfy my chocoholic cravings . fact , i probably always keep this product handy because it highly satisfying . great breakfast , snack or dessert . yummy	1
first things first , you not treated classic ' cooking ' smell . fact , your appetite better off not catching whiff magnesium-salt concoction heats your meal . think happy thoughts , oblivious . why ? because meal itself actually pretty good ( airtight separation ' oven ' ) . package also includes plastic spork , knife , napkin . basically , ingredients on-par what you would typically find canned stew ( similarly need not refrigerated ) . however , meal loses one star because serving size fairly small . 210 calories isn't whole lot go , particularly if you must engage strenuous physical activity under low-temperature conditions . pros : lightweight , keeps well , cooks itself , easy disposal , tastes good . cons : cost storage space per calorie somewhat high . if you creative , you might able figure way cook something else using box oven	1
since i love kellogg fruit harvest strawberries blueberries ithought i would try this one . it good but not flavorable kellogg . it also nice mix berries which includes raspberries well strawberries blueberries . you can't beat prices forboth kellogg golden temple supermarkets . amazon wayto go best prices	1

i bought these because i corn allergy wanted substitute them la weightloss bars list corn syrup first ingredient . i pleasantly surprised they pretty tasty ! my favorites actually fudgie filberts taste similar little debbie brownie if little debbie diet . following i would say almond coconut tied second . third peanut butter which highest protein but not good others . my husband didn't like any them but could tolerate one i liked least , peanut butter . over all i think these great healthy snack people food allergies or other dietary restrictions . i think i would picked different name than betty lou nut butter balls . nut butter balls doesn't sound appetizing what they actually !! nut butter balls ..... mmmmmm	1

" ~ box these definitely natural snack crackers bounce around . i mean , it so rare find even natural foods without hydrogenated oils . i can't count times i've read labels only disappointed find " natural " not always mean healthy . ingredients : certified organic wheat flour , expeller pressed safflower oil , aged cheddar cheese ( contains milk , salt , enzymes , cheese culture ) , salt , yeast extract , paprika , annatto extract ( color ) , ground celery seed , onion powder , yeast . i've made my own cheese crackers these really taste homemade . 24 tiny crackers satisfy any cheese cracker craving 70 calories . these crackers bernie bunny ( annie beloved mascot ) approved . they also made only vegetarian ingredients . each cracker cutest bunny shape . ~ rebecca review	1

i am especially pleased this rice . i can't imagine how any food item could more convenient store or prepare . , most importantly , it taste quit good . but taste always very subjective . recent reviewer didn't like taste , i personally think it great . it also worth mentioning it delivered only 3 days . i placed my order online monday night , ups actually delivered it into my hands thursday morning . - highly recommended	1
this probably one best granolas i've tasted . what i like most it texture . too many granolas just break your teeth when you eat them - but this one firm ( ie . not mushy ) but pliable texture . next thing i enjoyed this cereal taste - not too sweet nor too bland - just perfect balance . too often sweetened cereals much too sweet - or , flip side , " healthy " cereals too bland . finally - this cereal just plain healthy !! what great combo - flax pumkin seeds !! we ate up this cereal record time ordering more today !	1
