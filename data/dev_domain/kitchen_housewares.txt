sometimes it sprays when she barks , most time it doesn't . so i would say its effectiveness rather low . it not battery or fill level - maybe it just depends dog . i bark into it myself it sprays just fine . ( my children found this amusing .	-1
design using dc adapter led booklight extremely poor . it possible i missed warning tells you remove batteries before using dc adapter . but , it must not very big . i combined two ended up batteries leaked all over inside battery case . these brand new batteries . there not seem anything protecting batteries dc adapter so power goes right into them . this bad . modern devices expected work either battery or adapter without remove batteries . i assumed i could leave batteries so when i home i could use adapter , but traveling i would use batteries . don't make this mistake	-1
somewhat insomniac i read well into hours night book light essential me . i therefore purchased itty bitty booklight . if you use this light it essential purchase power supply two reasons . firstly , there no auto shut-off so if you fall asleep reading your batteries wear down very quickly . secondly , when using batteries , they start dimming rather quickly making it hard eyes difficult read resulting constant need new batteries . this light also extremely fragile . over couple years i went through 7 these ! i would not recommend this light - amount you spend never-ending purchasing batteries or expensive power supply , constant new purchases after it breaks , you might well splurge buy decent book light . i now tri lite capstone enterprises ( available barnes nobel - come get it stock amazon ! ) it terrific ! it clock alarm timer . you set it stay any period time once it reaches time light flashes . time you extend minutes . if you don't so , example you're sleeping , it automatically shut off . it also produces much more light much brighter than itty bitty book light	-1

i bought this hoping wow my family some 30 minute meals but this doesn't work great my electric stove . if you leave it up too high longer than minute grill side griddle coating burns off stinks up place . if you can't leave it up high you don't get good grill marks . i end up putting high few minutes then back down . doesn't cook thick meat chicken breast through well . you better off finishing them real pan oven . coating chips easily . i am thinking going cast iron it more work begining but i think it worth it long run	-1

if i could give this product 0 stars , i would . read negative reviews , folks , forewarned . i believed positive reviews ignored negative ones , much my exasperation . when i plugged my handsome new oven , little red digital display numbers came right away ... hmmm ... so far so good . but , according instructions , you supposed run oven door open 15 minutes get rid new oven smell . sooo ... owner manual says push " bake " button dashboard , which turn lights pilot lid light display , after which you set " time " " temp " . so i push " bake " button nothing happens , no lid light comes . nothing . zilch . zippo . so i then push " temp " " time " lights try get gerbils wake up . still nothing . i unplugged it plugged it again , thinking maybe somehow i screwed up , while listening " beep " owner manual said should happen whence unit plugged . zilch . zippo . nothing . no " beep " . no " bake " lid light . tried pusing " temp " " time " buttons again . nada . tried unpugging it again doing whole shebang all over again . still nothing . it just sat there grinned me . this time , i figured out my unit also " dead arrival " . least you get parcel paid bill lading printed off amazon website defective product return , saving yourself annoyance prepaying return dead product you already paid now must wait weeks get refund . amazon should take remainder their stock this awful product out back lot their warehouse run them over forklift	-1

hoover past , i excited find this one this price . i've it only year am now vacuum shopping once again - not looking hoovers . parts plastic cheap break easily . it advertised power hand tool . it not . it works air when you put it any material it stops spinning . upright power tool carpets also stopped working after six months . hard wood floor tool worked fine - suction strong enough - but again plastic pieces break attachments don't stay like they should , so i spend most my time vacuum re-attaching pieces . i would recommend looking elsewhere if you want vacuum last	-1
we owned this machine little over two years . first 6 months it worked expected clothes coming out slightly damp due condensation method drying . however , since then , it stopped drying , such 5 hours drying ( yes , 5 hours ) yields wet clothes . this persisted , despite 4 repairs , replacing almost every part machine except control board , which i assume next . prior this machine we owned equator brand washer/dryer combo which disaster : broke after 3 years . unfortunately , lg probably best bunch mediocre machines ( equator , asko , maber other brands ) available us .. all shortcomings dryers all use ventless-condensation method which take much longer dry almost all 115v . bosch combos available europe , but unfortunately not available us , 220v thus , dry more quickly . this not machine family , but rather ideal apartment or condo 1 or 2 people most . when it worked , it worked well . however , no one should invest $1300 it break such short time . no one should spend over 5 hours 1 load laundry . if you must purchase one these machines ( reasons space ) , buy extended warranty	-1

i ordered this machine my wife after reading dozens reviews positive feedback . we followed instructions explicitly created one cup coffee . after machine said " ventilate " . we followed proceedures ventilating machine it seemed correct itself . went make cup coffee it said " ventilate " . this time it would not fix itself . i tried perform ventilate process it would simply spray hot water out into tray . turn off knob " ventilate " comes back up screen . turn machine off turn it back , " ventilate " came up screen . we called amazon they sent us replacement few days later ( thank you amazon ) . unfortunately , this one i not get cup one out machine . it read " ventilate " soon i turned it . difference this one no water would come out all . gaggia provides no customer support so you your own this unit	-1
none other nonsticks hold candle this stuff ! i bought this 8 " fry pan 2 months ago , except bottoms , still looks brand new despite used nearly every day . i even used bacon press ( cast iron ) it every time i cooked bacon couple times i accidently scraped inside side pan no marks left . hubby stacked knives forks inside , then topped it off 6 dinner plates . i thought it -- scratches nicks everywhere , but no , not single mark . my calphalon commercial nonstick ( which hit trash already ) looked like it through war when my 18 yr . old . i must admit , though , i not use metal utensils it , nor i put dishwasher since i won't one til kitchen remodeled . overall , though , just what abuse it gotten , i'm very impressed buy more . my advice ? don't mess rest -- buy best this it . going try wok next . wish they sold electric griddle this stuff it	1

cuts like samurai blade quality , doesn't need steel frequent henckels/ wusthof knives . it excellent weight medium sized hand . however , handles get quite slippery when wet , so keep your hands clean dry while using this knife safety . also , if you plan saving money getting cheaper steel , don't , because this global blade much harder than henckels/wusthof blades ; qood quality diamond coated or ceramic steel must , or if you really like steel design , get global steel which cost quite bit . overall , this good quality knife proper care attention needed , just like samurai would get use his sword	-1

some reviews make it sounds like every ec701 defective out box . so far , i've made 40 shots espresso 10 steamed ciders , i've very pleased product . i've working improving my technique now i think espresso excellent . i prefer my homemade shots stuff i buy starbucks most other cafes , though this could due delusional pride my own amateur baristaship . also , i may over-excited because i'd wanted espresso machine so long . negatives ( so far ) it looks like there fair amount ongoing maintenance cleaning machine , though i doubt this unique this brand . also , others mentioned , espresso spout low , so i drink my coffee out ceramic ramikins ( although aren't low spouts authentic ? ) . also , i haven't gotten steamer working quite right i always end up cappuccinos ( all foam ) even if i'm trying make latte . hopefully i'll get better time . reliability , i've only made 40 shots , so i can't speak long-term quality , but so far , so good . heck , 40 espresso drinks starbucks would've cost me over $120 now , although making it home still isn't free -- if you use convenient pods , it still 50 cents shot , illy beans expensive ( right now , i'm using unground dark-roasted kona , which deep very smooth )	-1
person who loathes cheap , clutter , infomercial widgets i bought this out or sheer curiosity imagining it would returned same day . this opener large , requires electric plug takes up counter space . but my surprise it works amazingly well . there foil cutter stored base . screw enters cleanly seems eliminate broken shredded corks which frustrating . hold button again cork emerges device drops out . i always liked my sturdy simple stainless steel opener . but this turned out keeper . it design contemporary clean , although it looks like it should something more profound than just pull cork . it also conversation piece provoking smiles guests . pleasant surprise , highly recommended especially so person who lacks hand or wrist strength .	1

i baught my 8 " global chef knife 5 years ago . it great use kitchen remains one my favorite knives market . molybdenum/vanadium steel global knives holds edge far longer than its henkles/wustolf counterparts . my only complaint handle design which not suit my gripping style , nor my large hands . i don't mind steel handles , although they contribute slippage some loss grip . my main problem tapered bolster , which almost lack bolster altogether . coupled thin spine heal knife , extended use uncomfortable hand . i highly recommend globals , but i might suggest 8 1/4 " heavyweight model , which appears more standard handle design less tapering bolster . more info knife handling care you might check out cia book titled " professional chef knife kit " . one last comment . although all knife companies like claim their knives dishwasher safe , please , please , don't put your knives dishwasher .	-1

so , espresso machine great . it solidly built very simple design it . i recommend this machine anyone who wants make espresso home would like their machine last more than couple years . it moderately priced -- moderate i mean kind high home system , but definitely not 12 thousand dollars -- it also pretty cool looking . which always bonus . issues i've few number , but i'll give some hints getting your new machine work your liking -- your liking i mean my liking . first , make sure thing stays clean . this especially important when it comes steaming milk . wand needs cleaned quickly , thoroughly , often . try clean machine every 2-3 weeks ( heavy use ) 4-6 weeks ( light use ) espresso machine cleaner . this make steaming milk much easier faster , since you've removed obstacles steam . second , making espresso takes some tinkering . usually , espresso coffee shop run around 140 degrees ( ) . machine , espresso set run around 80-100 degrees , while steaming milk set 140 degrees . simply set machine steam milk , load your shot , steam your milk , run your shot 140 degrees . start counting when espresso starts dropping 17-22 seconds . if you're not content rate or quantity , adjust espresso grind -- more coarse or fine -- increase or decrease rate sho t.t hird , this all aesthetic , but i find i get best espresso vienna or french roast coffee . personally , i love sumatran coffee , but costa rica , papua new guinea , ethiopia , kona ( hawai'i ) close seconds . buy fair trade organic coffee . then enjoy some wicked good espresso . happy coffee drinking ! --	1

i agree daigo others brikka ( i only 2-cup model ) makes really nice caf� , while technically not espresso , very , very tasty . 2-cup model produce crema . david results , it puzzling . if coffee boiling upper chamber , i'd guess not enough pressure building . i would speculate seal chambers not complete . check see if there any grounds breaking seal before you screw them together . if there nothing blocking perfect seal , i'd suspect defect . even if 2-cup model superior 4-cup , i can't imagine functioning 4-cup produce results you're getting	1

okay , so it hard get excited things like hepa filters - or vacuum cleaners other devices they used . when my wife concluded her extensive search replacement our old canister vacuum anointed miele winner , i slightly less enthusiastic than she . it vacuum cleaner . it just tool keeping things trim . after very short while i began understand her admiration design build quality this particular tool . hepa filters bags used no less part this than vacuum itself . if you tire vacuums constantly gritty dust they stir-up but don't quite capture , get miele . if you distain smell emanating your vacuum exhaust , get miele . if you long simple , easy use maintain system even your husband use , get miele . use genuine miele bags , change your hepa filter recommended . difference cost minor , but you amazed difference results	1

i capresso just 2 years ( see my earlier rating . ) it worth it weight gold . coffee terrific .... i no desire stop starbucks way home work my usual evening caffiene fix . customer service terrific . last week steam knob stuck not turn open . since warranty period 1 year over , i concerned spend huge amount get it fixed . i tried cleaning knob(thinking maybe some milk splatters grunge crusted underneath ) , i also tried wd 40 ..... no avail . when i called customer service , i spoke ' gunther ' , who kindly walked me through prying off knob replacing it .... now it works perfectly ! machine operated my 10 12 year olds well my cleaning lady sitter ..... it never failed . reproducible cup coffee .... pretty much each time . rare occasion , coffee luke warm discarded . i learnt machines little nuances tweak settings make perfect cup . i always use whole beans . i found when i use ground coffee i put tremendous amount per cup brewed . i also only used non flavored coffee beans . frother get pretty crusted , so i usually take it apart soak it warm soapy water every other day . occasion , if it not reattached well it pop off while steaming make bit mess , possible scald you .... so careful . happened once or twice , probably why steam knob got stuck dried milk . any rate , jura capresso f7 gets 5 stars me 2 year mark	1
i what you're doing now , read these reviews . my perspective , this single greatest travel mug market . one reviewer mentioned it doesn't stay warm long enough , however my coffee/tea stays respectably warm least hour . usually more . there something truly satisfying tossing full travel mug coffee onto floor your car if you're hurry ... or placing it your backpack classes --- neeever worrying it spilling . pure genius ! my only complaint handle isn't conducive cupholder my mazda 6 . handle extends too far down which causes it get way my center console ... i only stabilize it cupholder if both cupholes empty . but since it leak proof , i no problem setting it seat next me	1

my entire kitchen kitchenaid . i bought this opener three years ago . it awful ... difficult use , shredded paper top can label , very difficult get started . because i love kitchenaid products so much , i assumed this just defective opener , threw it away , bought . second one even worse ! it worked okay first couple times , but now it barely cuts all . it grinds top , making dents , but won't actually make cut . once i get it started , i cannot finish it because it " messes up " pretty badly . this one going garbage well . :	-1
this product seemed like good idea . i mix my own cereal , add lots nuts seeds . so it lot heavier than fruit loops always shown pictures . way holder fits into base not all secure , when full heavy cereal , disaster assured . also , neither top or bottom cover really secure seal , so tipping holder caused top fly off me , some interesting times my dogs cleaning up floor . i hard time taking bottom seal off when my cereal bowl position . if you take it off first , then some cereal leaks out , causing problem i trying solve - namely no cereal laying around my counter inviting unwelcome guests . i tried this product awhile , but threw it trash pretty fast . went back big tupperware container not convenient this could , but no awful spills either	-1

let me describe my floors ... i turn 30 tomorrow . i'm bachelor dog cat . i'm also avid ( messy ) cook i bought hoover my kitchen . floor lightly textured vinyl . my main hobby brewing beer which tends leave lots sticky wort beer floor . side-effect lots drunken people parade through my kitchen which my bar bathroom . it also winter time i've putting sand salt mix walkways . summary , my floors disgusting !! i read instructions today work i couldn't wait get home try my floor mate . it assembled quickly easily . i used dry setting first it actually impressed me . i planning using my normal vacuum , but i too lazy get it out . it also lot quieter than my vacuum ( kenmore model)i set hoover up wet mode . it what it promised- it put down liquid , scrubbed , sucked it up . first , i didn't think it sucking up wetness much i would hoped ; but i rinsing out floor mate ( which quick easy ) , i turned around find 90% floor already bone dry . i cleaning out wet container- wow ! water jet black dirt . well , it taken me few minutes write this , so let me check results ... floor 99.99% dry immaculate ! it hasn't clean , since ... well , ever ! i one complaint- container you put solution could bigger . i ran out just before finishing kitchen ( it pretty small ) . luckily brushes wet enough finish job . i love my floor mate ! thank you hoover ! all writers bad reviews- i think you need read your manual .	1

buy something else . first all , it started out fine - good suction , etc . there only one flaw dusting wand didn't work . it supposed charge clean itself , but only happens if you keep thing together , i bet you can't . it doesn't take long power paw stop working . mine rotates so slowly if it touches anything it stops . cleaner itself loses suction over time . dust catcher easy empty , but don't forget buy all filters it needs . this poor choice	-1
i've wanted dyson long time , but me spending over $400 vacuum seemed little extreme . well , not anymore . i finally took plunge ordered dyson dc07 all floors last week ( . . penny ) . it arrived today it only took me ten minutes assemble it . i don't know what other posters referring when they say it complicated assemble . all i put hose together pull off few pieces tape . then i put dyson test . i 400 square foot apartment bathroom downstairs . most my apartment thick shag carpet except kitchen which tiled floor . bathroom floor cement thin pile carpet over top it . dyson handled it all without making sound . i've read reviews here say vacuum make terrible racket thick carpets it suck up lot carpet fiber . my dyson neither . i stairs leading down bathroom which also carpeted . i sat dyson downstairs bathroom ( per instructions which say put dyson lowest floor when vacuuming stairs ) i used floor/carpet attachment end wand stairs . not only i able vacuum entire stairs , but because length wand i able turn entire apparatus around vacuum risers well . this something i could never my former vacuum , least not very well . i bit worried using hose dyson quick pick ups dusting , because there other reviewers here who say suction diminishes when using hose and/or attachments . let me just say not case all . top my kitchen cabinets i old bottles , baskets , assorted antiques sitting up there since i moved four years ago . i only tried vacuuming up there couple occasions two vacuums i used failed miserably two regards - 1 ) their hoses could never reach , 2 ) they could not adequately remove dust ( which kind resembles grizzly bear fur ) . dyson excelled this task . i no problem reaching hose up there ( brush attachment ) one pass vacuum sucked up layers dust like finger scooping frosting off cake . length this hose stretch astounds me , i tell while using it it made extremely well last long time . gone days using cheap vacuums equally cheap hoses . hoo-rah ! now far emptying canister keeping it clean this not daunting task some claimed . i able remove canister dump dirt one simple move . also , if you gently tap side shroud while it over trash you dislodge lot dirt debris caught up inside it . i not taken dust bin assembly apart yet any thorough cleaning , but i reckon it no more difficult than cleaning out my sewing machine after every project . i found lot complaints here could rectified simply reading manual . it very detailed ( pictures even ) there even 800 number dyson support . all all i'm giving this vacuum five stars it stellar performance . it handled all cleaning tasks ease filters solid construction chassis hose i don't think i'll ever need buy vacuum again . my final word ; there should picture this vacuum next word phenomenal dictionary	1
my life , i used lot syrup dispensers , most which poorly designed leaked . this one neither . i really love way this dispenser works . top nicely designed executed out brushed stainless , gasket seals tightly . no-drip spout indeed no-drip us . even our 10 year old can't make it drip , that saying something . glass container larger than it looks since glass goes all way top handle , inside lid . my only wish they made one bit bigger could hold full bottle real maple syrup .	-1

just note , you get this book free when you sign up take wilton cake class course 1 ( least you michael arts crafts where i took mine ) book easy understand , pictures literally step step include instruction such " offhand , " meaning it tell you something should resemble ice cream cone or look like behive , swirl here , or lightly brush here , sweeping motion , etc . i found it very refreshing not all spoken terms only people who attended culinary school would understand . it also shows you pictures suggested supplies you need beginning book so your not running back store each time you start new segment . i would suggest just taking class because top getting book free , you get lot more tips advice instructor you jot down ample space imbetween pictures notes book . but if you too busy or there isn't class scheduled near you , this book would certainly suffice helping you get started	1
i gone through several deep fryers over past few years my quest find perfect deep fryer . t-fal fr7008002 ultimate ez clean hands down best i found date . pros : so easy clean ! most unit dishwasher safe , which great plus me . thing i hated deep fryers before cleaning oil system . either inner pot would not removable ( days when deep fryers first came out started become popular ) , or pot would full junk food it would hard pour out filter oil . also , where store oil ? this unit makes it so easy clean reuse oil . it great job filtering out junk floated into oil frying neatly storing it into storage container . it time someone came out product like this ! cons : it use lot oil , so you buy big gallons costco or warehouse type place . good thing , though , ease reusing oil , so it doesn't make it seem too bad use amount oil . also , i wish oil would heat higher than 378 degrees . i didn't get out cooking thermometer actually see if oil heated temp , but it would nice if oil got hotter . i understand it home use not professional , so there safety factor , but frying higher temperature fries ensures crispy-on-the-outside-and-tender-on-the-inside-not-oily fry . overall , i love this deep fryer , so i gave it five , even though it few things it could improve upon	1

we drinkwell fountain more than two years after recent birth our first child cross-country move , found we become overly lax giving it thorough cleaning . primary reason this cleaning very difficult -- it almost impossible get every little nook cranny . plus plastic drinkwell made out seemed get grungy very easily almost absorb minerals thanks hard water our new home . i little apprehensive catit fountain after reading few reviews , but thought we would give it try . first thing we noticed while assembling we really liked water filtered * before * it returns pump ( drinkwell , it filtered after going through pump , which leads gunkier pump ) . it also very quiet , so you don't get " running water " sound ( drinkwell ) occasionally led us search open tap before we realized it fountain . some people mentioned difficulty seating reservoir so water flows over dome properly . we experience this after cleaning fountain , but quickly discovered we just needed move pump bit one side allow secure fit . large reservoir , we also enjoy able go approximately week refills two thirsty cats , instead refilling daily ( we not purchase drinkwell optional reservoir ) . it also very easy see if water level getting low . one note : i haven't observed either cat actually licking water dome i sure our little female would love this since she drink faucet . overall , i like this fountain better . it looks kind cool , it takes up smaller footprint , quieter , easier fill easier clean than our old fountain . we not purchase mat , zero problems spilling or splashing . we give drinkwell fountain my sister-in-law since it still working order her kitty enjoying it thus far	1

i semi-skeptical this would work but i am sucker red kitchen items . i didn't actually buy this until i saw it person local kitchen store because i wasn't sure how it worked . you soften two sticks butter , put them into top part pot which like upside-down cup , then invert place bottom part . course you need little bit water bottom create seal keeps your butter fresh . then place anywhere unrefrigerated butter soft spreadable whenever you want it . no more hard butter toast ! realy important part change water every couple days -- i make it part my morning routine when i am kitchen making coffee -- takes only 5 seconds . your butter not stay fresh indefinetely , however . after month even fresh water i got some mold pot . pot nearly empty time what left fell out into water . not big deal since i typically go through all butter faster than month time , so i've only seen this happen once . after butter used up , i wash butter pot ( it dishwasher safe ) fill up again . wish i this years ago ! red great shade , it matches my cherry red le creuset poterie dishes nicely	1

starting positive : this thing well-made holds plenty whatever you intend put into it . very strong , it doesn't even begin show strain even while forcing through even toughest doughs . most my tubes fit fine , except smallest largest them . only real negative , outside fact it doesn't work all my tubes , fatty or oily things leak through canvas , i wind up hands covered grease can't grip anything properly . it would nice see plastic lining inside bag , which would prevented this problem . so , really , good product , but not good enough 5 stars	-1

i used amazon.com search feature night light uses led instead conventional incandescent bulb because like all incandescents , they prone burning out relatively short time . i also liked idea leds generate far less heat consume less power than incandescent bulb.amazon.com search results listed maxxima mln-10 i ordered four them . i'm very satisfied appearance , quality , features , light output . i like adjustability able rotate two lenses light output also reversing base when night light plugged orient daylight sensor either up or down socket sensitivity . nice ! only advertised feature i think differs slightly product description light output only slightest bluish tint mostly white light . it still subdued enough so not too bright so this fine me	1

i bought this item when i replace my microwave i hoping reduce ' microwave smell ' - funky tomato sauce smell blows out microwaves after too many spatters . you clean out microwave , but you can't clean behind vent grids , where splatters go live forever , pungent biomass . so i figured food would blow out vent hole cover splat roof my oven , but reduce problem . we use oven mostly reheating melting . this cover exceeded my expectations . 1 . it fits my tiny sharp r-209kk 800 watt oven - bit overhang but it never fallen off platter . 2 . no discernable splatters even roof my oven , which i wipe out every day ! steam vent ( not finger hole ) top releases pressure top where steam rises . even pyrex casseroles glass lids not good because pressure builds , lid lifts steam , they shoot hot liquid all directions . 3 . food cooks better . we used use paper towel , or dish cover food . here food cooks moist environment doesn't ' explode ' much because steam regulation clever top vent . paper towel would always slide off or sink into food cook into food let food blast out edges . 4 . cover doesn't get very dirty . i guess because food explodes less it easy clean dunking my dishpan rinsing . nothing baked onto this lid . 5 . food keeps better . if it cooking , i leave food microwave because lid keeps it drying out . 6 . it works great taller containers still fit under circle . i rubbermaid microwave containers 5 inchers tall 5x5 inches base . i set this lid top container . vent hole keeps contents blowing protects oven . hole top not finger hole . use pot holders remove anything microwave . defensive . it only takes one mishap land surprise burn . never assume spot safe touch . i note comments breakage . i wonder if dishwasher heat ? i find rigid plastic dishes cannot take hot water treatment without becoming brittle , often become opaque crack , so i am hand washing which easy because it hardly gets dirty . dunk , swipe , rinse . i saw cheap chinese imitations . i stick american made plastics food prep save job too . nordic ware great innovative companyand hey , if your food piled higher than cover you need something else .	1

this must rank one greatest kitchen " appliances " ever invented . idea so simple , it wonder it not used more . essentially , this crock-pot cooks food it own . you boil stuff stove 10 minutes , then you remove pot flame set it insulated sleeve ; when you get back office , voila , dinner ready . we've cooked ratatouille , lentil soup , curry , vegetable stew , many other items . fact , many ways , this pot produces better food than if you left it stove few hours : 1 : - potatoes other vegetables don't disintegrate even after hours sitting , because there no constant boiling 2 : - vitamins not boiled out food ( apparently ) , certainly flavor better preserved 3 : - color retained 4 : - time you're ready eat , temperature just right , not scalding . top this , it much safer : you " cook " leave house . we also use thermal sleeve ice bucket wine cooler . whole unit perfect " pot luck " dinners ; we brought over thanksgiving veggies this way last year . finally , course , this product wonder saving energy ! inner pot deep , thick bottom , holds lot ; it not flimsy so not scald places directly under flame . it seems made special stainless steel retains heat much more than average . this product deserves 10 stars -	1

this coffee maker just what i looking , but considerably more money i wanted spend coffee pot , after reading all reviews here amazon , i convienced go ahead pull trigger . all i really say $300 i really expected more . if i paid $30 walmart it , it would trash now , but after blowing half truck payment it i am stuck least trying make it work . first , grinder seems keep getting plugged up . while grinder runs alloted amount time , beans not fall hopper into grinder so less than enough beans end up ground into basket , you get watered down coffee . second , basket supposed swing over grinding station brewing station after grinding complete . it just doesn't enough spring power make trip stops just short which means hot brewed coffee split pot , counter . i am what i consider good consumer . i compare prices extent , but quality what i am after if i find good product , i spend $$ get best . i say i caught off gaurd this time . if i hadn't already discarded box packing i would sending it back . after rereading above reviews i must really doing something wrong . good luck	-1

i purchased this espresso maker 2-1/2 months ago . i used it 2-3 times per week . my first disappoinment frothing wand . not only it placed place which it difficult get mug milk or water cleaning without first sloshing some counter . second , shape style wand all frothing itself . if i wanted automatic frother i'd bought something cheaper . this allows no proper room style . someone who not operated professional barista this may fine , but i prefer more control over how much what type foam i create , thus i purchased " nicer machine " or so i thought . most part i am pleased espresso itself . i most often get healthy creme , when i don't i'm sure it operator error ( improper tamping or whatever ) . one week ago i made latte left run some errands . i returned find all my incoming outgoing mail sopping wet . perplexed i took good look around counter , noticed water carafe my espresso maker empty . i always fill it after making last latte remembered doing so before i left . i absolutely no idea how this managed get cracked . i called customer service delonghi requested replacement . i not asked many questions item shipped no charge , however - they tell me it won't arrive 5-8 weeks . meantime , i am only able put enough water tank make one latte . i thought this machine last me years , but now i am wondering how long it really hold out .	-1
preliminary review : i just used aeropress second time am very happy it . i've read reviews here [ ... ] effusive they , i one over-riding concern : would coffee too bland not strong enough ( slight bitter kick ) my taste ? i like coffee black strong ; always always . , good espresso heavenly . therefore all reviews how " smooth " aeropress coffee made me wary . i like touch bitterness distrusted . 170 degree recommended water temperature . anyways , espresso came out nice thick , very full-bodied rich . there also very nice combination enough acid heavy , rich taste experience . complexity some good beans came through , perhaps even enhanced over my good french press . i'm delighted . i'll come back expand when i've used this bit more , but now i highly recommend aeropress assure those who may similar concern hand-press won't deliver " real espresso " : it . one more word : there real crema if one firmly pumps down inch or two air top grounds . quality crema just so-so , ( light , no distinction ) but it there . professional espresso machine works 130psi ( 9-10 bars/atmospheres ) get crema everyone loves ; one thing , far i tell , only thing , out reach aeropress .	1
i purchased this specifically because i looking small spoon rest reviewer commented this could only hold tablespoon . i slightly dissapointed find this standard sized spoon holder easily holds mixing spoons , wisks , etc . only reason someone would difficulty using this intended if they weren't watching what they doing . large spatula only utensil may not rest snuggly holder ... though it could easily rest top you would most spoon holders . anyone looking holder accomidates any size or shape utensil should search using key word ' spoon rest ' - traditional spoon shaped holders , this also returns holders/rests tend wide flat so utensils placed anywhere it without much thought . this product also quite attractive looks much nicer than run-of-the-mill white ceramic , stainless steel , or country themed holders found most department stores .	-1
i've my electric skillet approximately 2 years . i love way it cooks easy cleanup . i only used it maximum 7 times when i noticed there spot seemed stuck surface pan . i looked more closely discovered there 2 " square area where nonstick coating just rubbed off . i always very careful way i handle this skillet ( no metal utensils , hand wash , no excessive heat . ) i bought it really good sale price , but i think i should able get more than 7 uses before it destroyed cooking surface	-1
this one my best christmas memories , making krumkake my mom . it take while since each cookie made individually . however , it totally worth wait . cookies crisp sweet . i would much rather make them using stove top method not new electric krumkake makers . i remember concentrating getting them just right amount ... my mom watching . we would listen christmas music talk we worked . i guess some memories should not messed	1
i really like this design . it slight raised lip running around outside edge which contains any batters , grease , or other liquids which might run over edge create mess ; grease drain only front edge treated same sturdy non-stick coating rest surface , making easy clean up . indeed , lack plastic attachments make cleanup easy , i really like simple design , very large cooking surface , two plastic handles removable plastic grease catch . only thing keeping me rating it five out five i would liked see thicker aluminum used , base only 2mm thick , though i've unable find anything thicke	-1

so others not make mistake i , i am writing this review . this cookware performed well two years . however , we large family put it dishwasher regularly . it 5 years this cookware not stood up regular use . not mistake kitchen essentials professional cookware . now when we cook mashed potatoes , we not know if potatoes peppered or just flaking teflon . all pieces used daily now un-coated aluminum . outside cookware chalky appearance . i am sure this dishwasher . we used plastic utensils most time , but you know how it when you hurry feed kids . my recommendation spend money high quality stainless steel cookware . we recently purchased calphalon tri-ply so far we really pleased . stainless steel cleans up easily , or least easy kitchen essentials . money , go stainless you never purchase cookware again .	-1

i bought this amazon.com right after holidays . i must say i leary after reading negative reviews . however , it one few push-down button toaster like our old black decker . when i received toaster i carefully thoroughly read through instructions . we burned toast first couple slices , but after we adjusted it good setting good results since then . i also baked some homemade fries it they came out fine . after looking stores numerous models , we turn black decker aside due very loud timer their models . too bad , because we liked their other features , but couldn't stand loud " neverland " ticking timer . we settled oster 6235 because smaller footprint , sleek style , i said before , separate toaster button . yes , it get hot top it should given space around it - any toaster oven should . if you read directions thoroughly before operating , remembering turn rack over toast ( it raises it slightly higher bottom burner element ) turn it back over other cooking you shouldn't any problems . like all toaster ovens , they aren't best toast . if you want great piece toast , buy toaster specific job . however , all-around type 2nd oven , this good job . just make sure you watch it carefully first few times use so you learn adjust its cooking habits . it not toy small children should not able reach it during operation .	-1

while not first come market powered scrubber[as seen tv]this scrubber much more solid feel than its competition without * too * hefty . it geared so there sufficient torque allow some serious scrubbing ability remove any remaining teflon your non-stick pot or pan . if you know difference pot or pan * , this gadget made just you . i would strongly suggest using rechargeable batteries rather then start cycle use refuse ameliorating long term impact environment your wallet[or purse ] . so why not five stars ? two reasons .... first , tired hospital color scheme just attractive today it 50 years ago . yech ! course , if you still any appliances bygone era , you remain completely coordinated satisfying even most severe case ocd . second , only two scrubbing pads ???? yes , they different grades " scratchless ? " , but including least one replacement set wouldn't send bd stock into downward spiral , would it ? i would strongly suggest ordering extra set pads [ no , unlike bd other scrubbers , these pads exclusive this model only ] your purchase . this product even remotely neccesary ? no ! but you know what they say woman her toys . . . er . . . d'oh!i've got this sinking feeling couple months i'll writing review new porter-cable " power sponge " , men finally begin experiencing joy receiving something clean next christmas ! apparently revenge dish best served cleaned . ax ~ *hint : you * handle * it ?	-1

i started out magnalite aluminum pans bride too many years ago . 20 years later those pitted relics went goodwill replaced calphalon anodized aluminum non-stick interiors . they lasted perhaps 10 years before non-stick started flake off . i wanted stainless steel : dishwasher safe , virtually non-destructable , etc . so , search began . revereware , like my mother still uses after almost 60 years , much more flimsy than it used . farberware ? non-stick or not ? one could practically buy house price high end stainless , though it certainly built last long . i would occasionally check houseware stores , amazon other websites looking good , reasonably priced stainless cookware . imagine my extreme good luck when this cookware came sale , there no shipping deal $25 off purchase boot ! i should bought lottery ticket day ! cuisinart chef classic set showed up less than week . i unpacked all pans lids , washed them up put them cupboard . all other pans went way magnalite . although manufacturer says handwashing best , they go into dishwasher come out bright shiny . creature habit , i still use sos scouring pads remove stains polish metal bit . manufacturer not recommend this , nor they recommend use metal utensils . saucepans starting show wisk marks , but shows these pans used loved . lids fit well saucepans i don't boil-overs like i used . plan following instructions relating low heat start-ups ; these pans get hot quickly hold heat very well . i still use my old , reliable cast iron frying pans frying foods , but frying pans saute pan good items pantry . all lids interchangeable according size . i am very pleased . cookware set superior what i before deal through amazon incredible .	1
i'm not fan how enormous wine glasses restaurants these days but these glasses seem like perfect size ( although still larger than glasses we upgrading ! ) . i like they modern shape feel high-quality . although intended white wine , inward curve lid subtle enough i feel comfortable serving red wine them well . major downside they large enough they don't fit upright top rack non-adjustable dishwasher . we quickly broke one trying wash them precarious angle learned our lesson	-1

i'm fan spanish-made henckel int'l classic lines . i bread knife utility knife well . i think major budget concessions ( these not high-end german-made line ) comes size . classic blades , though full-tang thrice-riveted , less steel than comparable brands . this makes them slender light hand . however , less steel not lower-quality steel , these blades incredibly hard reliable . this santoku still large enough use spatula when cutting , delivering onions , mushrooms or other slices or mince pan while cooking speedily . it sharpens easily ( i use small stone under running water ) , responds well steel every few uses . it sharpest blade my collection , easily slicing up my sponges when i clean it . care , it won't same your skin , mostly because sturdiness construction breeds confident handling . it won't slide off most vegetables before slicing , even cleave small poultry bones slow steady pressure downward ( i wouldn't use it hack real cleavers ) . this precision instrument , not blunt tool	-1

i looking crockpot wasn't too large wasn't too expensive . this product fit bill . lid treated glass so , you see food cooking without lifting lid . lid handle stays cool during cooking , so you won't burn your fingers if you touch it . ceramic cooker sturdy alittle heavy . it become slippery when wet , so careful while washing it sink . also careful because handles cooker metal base become very hot during cooking . so keep potholders nearby . cooker accomodate 3.5 -4 pound whole chicken 4 pound roasts . it oval shape enables these foods fit well . it comes small instruction manual includes some recipes . so far , i've cooked whole grain cereal ( barley cracked wheat ) , stews , whole chickens , corned-beef , turkey legs . they've turned out good . however , since i'm new slow-cooking , first attempts abit off because i cooked food too long . but now , i'm better timing so food better . just side note , if you like eating whole grain cereals , slow cooker terrific . you don't need stand over stove stirring pot worrying it boil over . this cooking method allows grains fully absorb water , which makes creamier end result . plus , you toss grains water into cooker bedtime it time your breakfast . i two very minor complaints : 1 . packaging . cooker packaged way you slide it out box . if you aren't careful , you could drop ceramic cooker or glass lid . 2 . handle lid alittle loose , could made tighter 1 turn . but might not design flaw , but way compensate expansion glass during cooking process . so , don't mess it , im o.o therwise this great product	1

i never owned nice pepper mill . i've always used red box , recently plastic low-quality mill constant battle use properly . i enough wanted nice mill . but shopping amazon.com pepper mills difficult task since there literally hundreds choose . after shopping pepper mill month i decided this mill because beautiful wood , competitive pricing . alternatively , i consider few battery-operated mills . but end i preferred warm inviting look natural wood instead cold metallic looking mills . i choose cherry wood over maple thinking cherry more durable would resist dings scratches heavy use . perhaps better point cherry grain ever so slightly darker than maple pictures . i preferred darker grain . after my order , i didn't receive any order tracking information amazon.com . i wrote email brentwood mills , they responded very quickly . my pepper mill arrived week good packaging . let me say short after it few weeks i absolutely love this pepper mill . brentwood mills a+ company . but let me give you details . when mill arrived , i opened inspected it like anyone would . unfortunately , there very small factory defect - chip near bottom inside where ground pepper exists . it not visible exterior very , very small . my best guess boring bit into solid piece wood caused it . i wrote brentwood mills back asking them if this normal or truly defect . they responded quickly indicating it very rare mill leaves their factory less than perfect shape . they mentioned 3 quality checkpoints ensure high quality control . but course , they offered exchange it me their cost if it bothered me . i decided live it week see . wood beautiful even imperfections . integrity , beauty , effectiveness mill a+ despite minor chip . after week though , i decided go ahead exchange because ultimately brentwood qc should caught this unit . i didn't think it unreasonable considering price range . i wrote brentwood back let them know i returning exchange , they very invitingly assured me they would take care me . they then emailed me few days later when they received sent out new mill . replacement mill arrived within week again well packed . inspecting mill showed absolutely no visible defects all . it beautiful example cherry wood . i filled mill peppercorns proceeded use it . it amazing how high quality mill churn out pepper . i tried coarse , finely ground both worked extremely well . grind setting small knob top you manually adjust your liking . crank feels very good my hand , just outstanding . each half-crank mill puts out little less than eighth teaspoon pepper my very unscientific measurement . once you finish mill set it down , no left over ground pepper leaks out . this seems indicate very high quality mill . certainly bonus not pepper crumbs making mess . i absolutely love this mill . fact , my only complaint my wife who says i'm putting too much pepper everything . very minor annoyance filling peppermill peppercorns . because metal spine middle mill must remain centered it somewhat difficult put corns around it . i couple kitchen funnels which made job little easier . but it might nice if brentwood made custom funnel help hold metal spine place during refill . but i think this limitation this type mill you would find anywhere . end i'm extremely satisfied my purchase . wood very lovely my kitchen my table . brentwood mills great company a+ customer service . highly recommend .	1

le creuset manufactures porcelain enameled cast iron cooking vessels well other products . le creuset casts these cooking vessels molten iron poured sand moulds used only once . this reason , one pot may look like , but each unique its own way . cast iron highly efficient material which absorbs distributes heat efficiently . it recommended cooking cast iron low medium heat . there exceptions like boiling water where cooking high heat appropriate okay . remove cast iron heat it not cool off quickly . this helps your food stay warm while serving . beware ; iron tends heavy so these cooking vessels tend heavy well . cast iron effective material cooking so why cover it enamel ? iron tends rust ; iron oxide ( rust ) doesn't add any complimentary flavors your food . if your cast iron cooking vessel not enameled , you would season maintain your cooking vessel . adding porcelain enamel not only looks good , but multiple benefits . enamel , solid coating , one most hygienic surfaces cook , not stain , absorb odors , retain flavors , easy clean . enamel damaged , so limit cooking tools plastic or wood . benefits cooking le creuset cast iron many , but lets get down buffet casserole specifically . 2 1/4 quarts not lot space when it comes casseroles , so consider your recipes when determining size you need . buffet casserole tend best if least 3/4 full . any less you may overwhelm your food heat evenly dispersed pot . large flat bottom curves up this pan resembles curved sided saute pan only thing missing would long handle . tight fitting lid mostly flat curved sides . this lid seals heat , moisture , flavors used hold your meat while you making sauce drippings . its shape design makes this extremely versatile pan . i tend cook large amounts so this pan usually used side dishes desserts . but once you get past basic functionality lends itself recipes such paella , cous cous , basic casseroles , you really open up possibilities . keep mind this 2 1/4 quart pan , 8 inch diameter . this may pan families 2-4 . some possibilities this pan besides casseroles include frittatas , dinner rolls , pepsi chicken wings , mac-n-cheese , baked squash , shrimp scampi , cobblers , pies , pineapple upside down cake , or bread pudding . possibilities almost seem endless . one feature people tend complain cost . cost seem steep compared other pans made other materials . heck , cast iron doesn't seem like it should expensive when comparing old cast iron pan past generations used cornbread camping . however manufacturing process requires making mould each every pan produced . they then go through enameling process before shipping these heavy pans . if you take what goes into making distributing these high quality cast iron products , cost tends make sense . then consider this pan easily last lifetime when taken care . pros : extremely versatileefficient absorption distribution heathygienic enamel cooking surfacedoes not stain , absorb odors , or retain flavorseasy clean when not abused or misusedcan transferred stove top oven tablecan easily last lifetimecons : its heavy , cast iron tends weighing 6 pounds	1

i purchased turquoise sunflower while back just recently ordered cobalt cinnabar . i loved this carafe especially when serving weekend brunches -- even just my family four . we feel fancy using different fiestawares -- really special my 5-year old . i use this water , orange juice , or whatever kind juice you want . it just makes table little more festive . only thing i surprised when i got this i thought it would little bigger . other than , it absolutely beautiful i don't mind it more colors than i already	1

picked this up few weeks ago when it first showed up because my old space heater very noisy fan , no thermostat auto-shutoff . it saw its first use over last few days when i intentionally kept thermostat home heating bit low , turned this specific room occupied . not bad - warms up quickly , oscillates smoothly , accurate sensor ( double checked against oregon sci . homewide system ) changes temperature medium-sized room reasonably quickly . also very quick turn off when it reaches right temperature ( its proximity least , doesn't guarantee it heated entire room set temp , course - compensate setting it degree or two higher ) . forcing it make up around 2-3 degree delta below my comfort zone ( homewide setting kept 2-3 lower than i'd like ) , this stayed barely 20-25% time kept me comfortable 12x18ish room medium-high ( 10 foot ) ceilings . fan noise somewhat noticeable ... since this room my ( above ground ) basement level serves my home theatre/office ... but it isn't too loud me fall asleep . ymmv ! price i got it ( under 40 ) , not bad ! current price , it wash , noise sensitive folks may want consider oil-filled radiator style heaters instead	-1

i put this horrific task -- eliminate stench seven dead mice who suicided themselves en masse full tub stored bath water small bathroom . it worked after day or two ; or their odor dissipated over time , or because i opened window ? i'm not sure which but suspect latter there room fragrance sticks eminated ( until i removed them ) noticeable scent previously pleasing , now forever associated dead mice . just me , but i wouldn't buy , because it really ugly , not unless until someone explain physics it my satisfaction . plus , i don't think it works all odors , dead mice one worst imaginable . burn some incense , or spray water infused fragrance , or open ( but not necessarily light ) some scented candles , or stud orange cloves then sprinkle cinnamon hang , instead . it possible textures area you trying rid odor may affect viability any particular product , well general ventilation . my case , it could inadequately sealed wood walls , lots cloth , minimal cross ventilation . not mention mice ! my hunch this product limited use best -- i am open proven wrong always willing learn . if it works cat boxes , good , but so other things less expensive , candles much prettier	-1

i'm big target shopper , but i've never very impressed their furniture . i couple night stands guest bedroom i regret buying now ( but $60 each i don't know what i expected ) . but lately it seems target starting add more quality furniture their selection . we bought two bookshelves this dresser their shabby chic line i am very impressed detail workmanship . most part , it sturdy beautiful . exception dresser hardware ( drawer pulls ) . mentioned several times other reviews , they break easily . particulary when used rambuctious six-year-old bedroom . also , when my husband first took all pieces out box start putting it together , he realized there two left sides instead one left one right . he'd already put some it together so we didn't want take it back target exchange it , so he called manufacturer . they wouldn't anything it unless he receipt . well , one things i love shopping target whenever i return or exchange , i just give them credit card i used pay it they scan find proof purchase . this way i don't hang bunch receipts . other words , i already thrown away receipt this dresser . my husband called them again few days later explained situation they finally agreed send right side panel . other than this little set back , i guess it came together ok . my husband always puts furniture together i didn't hear lot cuss words or yelling coming my daughter room while he working it . but then , he very patient guy actually enjoys putting stuff together . when all said , after shopping around comparing other pieces other stores their prices similar dressers , this one still worth what we paid it . i eventually replace broken knob ( course , i'll replace them all so they'll match ) - but that no-brainer . i don't even need my hubby .	-1

this little heater works well ! snap-down wheels made it very easy install ( no assembly required ) . thermostatic variable control works well ( unlike some others i tried ) . some reviewers reported smelling oil or paint smell when they first turned it , however , i not issue all . since i only obtained my heater end this years heating season , i haven't yet fully tested high heat setting , but low setting , it kept my 20 14 foot room quite comfortable this spring . it makes no noise i able tell , except very slight click when heater turns thermostat setting	-1
i this almost month now i am very impressed extra comfort cushion this added bed . i little concerned it might flatten out lose its padding but so far it feels same it new . very happy this purchase i ordered second one	1
i bought fiestaware cobalt butter dish while living arizona . butter sold there packaged shorter , wider , higher sized sticks . so , it didn't fit into butter dish unless i trimmed it !! couldn't figure it out , why would they make butter dish stick butter won't fit into ??!! so .... just moved houston area , guess what , butter here sized just right dish . maybe they need make two different sizes west east coast butter ?? crazy ! nice butter dish , though	-1
what say ? this cheap carpet sweeper , it works great ! main sweeper unit well constructed metal it very sturdy indeed . however , handle 4-piece tubular thingee marginal best . handle 4 sections so it shipped smaller box . sweeper works perfectly my office carpet , i stow it away small file cabinet . i recommend this sweeper occasional use , but i would suggest fabricating solid piece tubing better handle if you intend use this more frequent sweeping . otherwise , 4-piece handle keep falling apart your hands .	-1
although it doesn't mention it , these hepa filters also fit hamilton beach air cleaner model 04152 . i email hamilton beach find out , but they very helpful responded right away . when filters arrived amazon , i saw box it says " fits models 04162 , 04163 04152 . " our cat houseful antiques , we always seem dust bunnies floating around . i run this model our office , under table which holds computer . since placing it there i noticed buildup dust around modem almost entirely eliminated . i placed larger model our living room it certainly doing its job . regular settings louder than expected , but i leave them " whisper quiet " setting when we're room i don't even notice them . i would definitely recommend hamilton beach air cleaners	1
absolutely lovely country charming added wonderful factor quot ; oven/microwave table ! quot ; very pleasing	1
i ordered this product amazon last year . so far i am happy this product no problem . its my daily usage baking stuff . i like feature switch broil/oven without flip baking item . love temp control when broil . i gave it 4 star because i hate control knob . they should make it more visible so i know where knob . i consider it good product	-1

i've my popper 10 years rightn now , this thing still works great . pops most kernals , bit sensative first . once you get know your microwave this , works well everytime . i this my dorm room it saved me bundle not buy bags popcorn . highly recommended .	1
i waffling 2 stars 3 stars because this isn't horrible product ... but it could alot better minor modifications . positive side : unit arrived time . it heats up quickly . it produces lots steam . mop window attachments worked particularly well . negative side : i supposed able download product manual but file defunc t.t he soap dispensor attachment not work inititially . ( i disassembled it fixed problem 5 minutes .. but it still pain . product overview included " internal cord storage " it not this feature . ( i assume they refer manually spooling cord around casters caddy storage " internal cord storage " but it misleading best . product overview reported " easy use rotary dial " i still no i dea what refers . there no water level gauge help you know how much water left machine/ or when it close " full " when filling i t.t he shoulder strap system awkward . product lightweight , however carrying product over your shoulder so it constantly hits you thigh annoying ( it would much more convenient able carry it like backpack . this would deman dramatically different design . there no pressure guage or way knowing when unit " safe enough open up ... " ( there just sticker reminds user wait 15 minutes after unplussing machine before opening it refill it .... oh yes ... make sure user " depress hold steam release trigger " make sure tank isnt pressurized before opening tank . -- course unit not steam release trigger ... it electronic switch which only works if unit plugged . this creates saftey hazzard because if you unplug unit wall wait 15 minutes .... there still alot hotwater/steam/ pressure tank . if you click electronic switch open ( nothing happens because unit unplugged ) you may assume unit safe open thus release all pent up steam which puts you risk nasty hand burn . i agree previous reviewers ordering extra supplies mop heads soap inconvenien t.t he machine perform it primary function ( cleaning ) well ... but deficiencies product design , misleading advertising , plus poor documentation/ difficulty reodering supplies all compel me recommend looking other steam cleaning option	-1
love this flannel construction . i concerned since it priced so low , but they wonderful . i love quality construction upon washing there no shift or shrink . buy many , this price you not able replace it ! you also see my review cleopatra this same collection . we ordered both figuring this price , it would worth gamble ! it !!!! there no gamble all .	1

first , i totally agree other reviewers ' raves . i kind spooked so many negative reviews similar products , so i am very happy i bought this brand model . it washable too ! lowest setting perfect overnight after warming bed up higher setting . now i use just light comforter over me instead heavy , constricting blankets . i often overnight hot flashes so periodically throw off covers . this nice warm pad underneath , my bed remains cozy when flash ends i'm cold again . bravo - highly recommended only $60 too . winner !	1
biggest damn spice rack i've ever seen ! no kidding , this thing huge	1

i wasn't certain if she would like this toy or not , but she absolutely loves it . she chases it all over house up walls ( or tries anyway ) . one small problem it , which isn't much problem all , my dogs don't care it all . advertising said dogs like it , but mine couldn't care any less . which actually good thing since cat dogs would fighting over it if they all liked it . short , perfect getting your cat some much needed excercise	1

after reading some reviews here , i concerned buying this cleaner , even though it seemed exactly what i looking replace my expired 1974 model eureka electric broom ( brand loyalty lead me look eureka , but unfortunately , company bought sold several times , they no longer make quality product they when i purchased my electric broom . ) i visited my local independent vacuum dealer i used past keeping my eureka going all these years ; when he informed me he couldn't get parts rebuild motor ; i asked his recommendation , he endorsed hoover flair . when i voiced my concern breaking housing , he showed me how problem area reinforced - i mean plastic tapers 1 " thick this point . hoover now owned maytag , they concerned making quality product . based upon , strength evidenced thickness plastic this area , i laid my fears rest bought machine . vacuum performs excellently both carpet bare floors - i like fact there no metal nozzle scratch my hardwood floors ; it also handles cat hair cat litter ease . summary , i recommend this cleaner wholeheartedly !!	1
problem bachelor if you standard coffee maker own typical 12-cup coffee pot , you make least four cups coffee make decent tasting pot coffee . which means you consume two cups throw out other two . i didn't like idea wasting coffee . while i stopping dunkin cup but i realized approach wasn't frugal solution problem . i've looking ideal single-cup coffee maker solution few years . i decided try this one out after review well-known consumer magazine . most part , it works well . it doesn't take up huge amount counter space . it intitally brewed weak cup coffee . i experiemented amounts coffee discovered if you doubled up amount coffee , it brew flavorful cup coffee . also ( despite what instructions say ) use very warm or hot water tap . contact time heating element not sufficient get water hot enough extract all flavor components your coffee . thus you get weak tasting cup coffee this unit . also if you grind your own coffee , i recommend finer grind this machine it brews too quickly can't extract enough flavor standard drip grind . i'm mostly pleased this coffee maker after some experimentation adjustments water temperature , grind coffee , amount coffee .	-1
i wasn't sure what expect this pan , but it outshined everything i'd anticipated , based price . i got it less than ten bucks friday sale , i've already used it least ten times . it great frying ( i made fried chicken couple times , it came out perfectly , no hot spots . ) i've used it make spaghetti sauce , french toast , taco meat , chili mexican shredded chicken chicken nachos . it heavy enough feel sturdy your hand , they're snap clean , even mexican chicken ( you cook down couple hours . ) i haven't any problems sticking or scratching , it actually inspires me cook . you won't disappointed purchasing this pan ! it great cook uses lot different techniques or methods cooking ( soups , frying , steaming ) .	1

main thing this product it good value dollar . item inexpensive gets job large cooking area adequate features . there couple features could better , but course you going pay more get them . such less hot touch exterior , already mentioned , timer cannot turned stop , but temperature turned off , so not big issue	-1
we pleased purchase this heater . it works well smaller areas ( 10 15 ) but we also using it larger area ( 20 20 ) help small fan circulate heated air around room .	-1
this pillow looks simple enough , but there must lot research put into inventing it ! dogbone ( medium size , 16 " -- i don't remember specific dimensions ) instantly relieved many aches i my neck without forcing me lie down flat position ( which often gives me headache makes it impossible read while lying down ) . i'd doc quite few times back/neck problems i've lately , but no rx worked quite well this delightful cushion . my only issues it cleaning ( stuffing packed very tight , so i'd rather not try it out washer fear mold/mildew ; i spray it disinfectant every once while instead ) outer material ( optional moisture-wicking or allergen-reducing pillowcase would nice ) . however , i bought it based earlier reviews , i don't regret it	-1

i 2 honeywell 50100 air purifiers bought 2 these replacement hepa filter originals . hrf-11 new " permanent " replacement filter good choice . however , i rated this 4-star only despite fitting nicely 50100 . product statement " permanent " misleading , though you clean filter twice year vacum cleaner , manual still recommends you replace filter every 3 5 years under normal usage . i think kaz ( who licenses honeywell brand honeywell ) simply asking sued labeling product like this . i'll use words " extended life " if i them avoid law suits . other than , its great product cheaper than those throw-away type filters	-1

this review intended 4700 series pictured here see-through dustcontainer ! it joy use simplicity every way . engineers used sheer genius its plain simple design . my hard use might tend make automatic shut-off come into play , when years cat hair or whatever clogged filter first use , but i not expect happen again , i no cat . it previous owner years no vacuuming which caused it . if you motor turn off , wait half hour recommended , hey take break read good book amazon , then start her up again . but sure before you rest on/off pedal off position or motor might not realize it recovering not start up again . also unplug then certain plug it back ! notice no-clog hose . i finally give up my beloved eureka hepa filtered after yeaers very hard usage finally made right angle turn where hose hits floor forward brushes constantly blocked . i got tired dismantling tiny hard reach screws prying out collected dirt dust hair such . i must confess : i used abused my former eureka , including potting soil corner , paid price . now i discover very inexpensively elegant simplicity this wonderfully engineered marvel . notice again no-clog hose . rather than hidden right angle turn bottom , hose comes straight out , easily detached bottom clearing , which unnecessary any case . rather than multitude filters replaced great cost every few months , there one , which rinses off water . instead whole bunch attachments falling off main stand , there basics , no more , no less , including generously long wands attach generously long hose . most powerful engine available , full bore , blasting up floor , under this light weight yet poweful tool . check out interesting engineering floor clearance . rather than estimating carpet shag , or whether you pass mainly over bare floor low carpet , thus struggling turn hard reach clearance dial stiff fingers , you just hit engagement foot pedal clearance automatically adjusts present floor conditions , continues so fly you pass condition condition , rug linoleum . when machine ready rest , however unwillingly like young colt ready run some more but put away early stable , restoring it upright condition raises it clearance high enough roll into storage . handle easily effectively lowered reaching under tables even beds , powerful headlight really makes visuals ineluctably bright . engineers eureka really designed effective useful tool this one , elegant simplicity use maintenance . assembly also breeze joy one screwdriver . this one get . never mind those cheapo shop vacs lousy plastic attachments ; never mind those much more expensive rigs seductively bizarrely promising continuous suction . this one . take my advice , freely given . you may even thank me it . or let me come over dump dirt your carpet show you how great machine this . joy use . i can't wait carpet fill up dust again ! makes vacuuming contemplative prayer spiritual cleansing . further strong points this vac , those who not yet believe it , please notice handy handle near base which makes vacuuming up stairs easier , especially considering sturdy yet lightweight this vacuum . also notice ease removing emptying dirtbag ( i know it more canister but dirtbag great word ) rinsing out filter . i few moments puzzle putting dirtbag back but soon become second nature . i also must admit not used staircleaning feature i no stairs here desert .	1

this probably my favorite mug . it easily holds twice much regular coffee cup . it comes plastic splash guard locks into place down inside rim . best thing mug though wide grippy bottom enables me set it just anywhere my car without worrying it tip over . even hard corners don't seem phase it . it also only cup my house withstand my cat efforts tip it over . odd shape also downsides though . it won't fit any cup holder i've ever come across , but doesn't matter much since it won't tip over no matter where you set it . if you don't rinse it out immediately , it difficult clean later , due shape ; if you don't small hands , you may need bottle cleaning brush . also , i imagine if you more than one these mugs , they'd awkward store since this mug tends hog cabinet space . despite this , it still great mug . fact i'm going need since my husband now adopted it his favorite too	1

i'd looking good juicer number months , but shied away because they're expensive . i saw this deal , read analyzed reviews , rolled dice . it arrived yesterday , after easily disassembling it wash parts get know it initially , i ran half dozen carrots through it . omg !! fast delicious carrot juice my own kitchen ! clean-up easy ( well , i old pro now ) quick -- under five minutes . address some negatives you may read , first , size : course it big . they're all big bulky . it their nature . second , residue : my carrot pulp dry . i suppose if i'd put it floor stood it i might gotten maybe teaspoon carrot juice out it . third , it factory reconditioned : me , that plus . consider this : manufacturer rolls out tens thousands these off line , each one eye-balled polished qc before bagging boxing , assuming they all good go . but , factory re-con gone over top bottem , inside out before it released . no assumptions -- last thing manufacturer wants see thing back again , so you know they'll make sure they don't . if it'd returned little cosmetic blem , i certainly live considering discount i'm getting . i'm still not sure why they're virtually giving these away , but waring old trusted brand , juicer not cheaply made . i'll back year ( hopefully not sooner ) give some time perspective this review . soon i finish writing this , i'm ordering two more christmas gifts .	1
somewhat insomniac i read well into hours night book light essential me . i therefore purchased itty bitty booklight . if you use this light it essential purchase power supply two reasons . firstly , there no auto shut-off so if you fall asleep reading your batteries wear down very quickly . secondly , when using batteries , they start dimming rather quickly making it hard eyes difficult read resulting constant need new batteries . this light also extremely fragile . over couple years i went through 7 these ! i would not recommend this light - amount you spend never-ending purchasing batteries or expensive power supply , constant new purchases after it breaks , you might well splurge buy decent book light . i now tri lite capstone enterprises ( available barnes nobel - come get it stock amazon ! ) it terrific ! it clock alarm timer . you set it stay any period time once it reaches time light flashes . time you extend minutes . if you don't so , example you're sleeping , it automatically shut off . it also produces much more light much brighter than itty bitty book light	1
i love bought one my parents well my laws .... great my morning tea . favorite feature auto shut off , i flip switch , get ready work water ready pour . i don't worry running kettle once water boiled . i highly recommend this product	1
easy use , easy clean . two major requirements kitchen appliance me happy . this thing easier clean than my old george foreman grill ( me pain neck ) . only time it little messy when you change oil , which i every 2 3 weeks depending how much i've used it what i've cooked . if i'm doing just veggies , i keep oil . if i meat or seafood , i'll change oil right after . very pleased overall .	1

i'm absolutely thilled this waring ! it definitely changed my opinion juicers . i purchased reconditioned model . it arrived factory ( re ? )-packaged looked brand new . not single mark it , not even fingerprint ! it far easier clean , obviously superior design : parts clean up like new dishwasher . components fit perfectly , despite probably couple hundred uses . it exponentially faster , remainders noticeably dryer . ( reviewer mentioned , this refuse obviously indicates very efficient juicer ! ) looks , sounds functions like very upscale appliance . no spraying , no movement , no juicer " drama " ! :-) absolutely best one i've owned after lots uses , it still going strong it when it arrived .	1

my three year old med-length hair tortiseshell cat adores this brush . she gets persistent dandruff furballs but won't let me touch her any other brush . i tried every kind brush but she hates groomed ! so imagine my surprise when i pull this brush out package she actually lays down me groom her after few strokes ! only downsides this product : 1 . small size - it doesn't hold much fur so either all fur ends up floor or you emptying it every few strokes2 . " front " versus " back " positions - cats not generally stay one place , i three they roll walk around while i groom them . it bit unconvenient constantly switch brush my left right hand get proper angle de-shed my kitties . i don't know how this could improved but it downside product . overall it defineitely worth 10 bucks i spent , my boo-boo never lets me groom her anything else	1
i owned one these little wonders over five years . during time i replaced lightbulb one time , which extent maintenance or repairs light required . people who complaining light feels " flimsy " , you tried tightening series screws allow you adjust tension various parts light ? it designed allow this sort adjustment , but if you never tighten screws they eventually get loose . imagine ! it moving part ! seriously , maybe they've switched different supplier ( although i doubt it ) , but my light joy . it proven durable over countless trips , moves , drops . it provides excellent illumination yet allows your spouse sleep undisturbed beside you . plus , unlike so many designs market , it very lightweight . some designs inexplicably batteries housed unit , so batteries weigh down your book while you read . i just don't understand all negative reviews this product . only thing i suggest : try tightening those screws periodically . it make world difference	1
this kettle amazing . it simple -- you plug it flip switch ( light turns let you know it working ) . it heats very quickly , lt ; 5 minutes full kettle boiling water if you only want cup or two tea , it heats 3 . students dorms , you use it oatmeal , soup , tea . automatically cuts off after boiling minute , so no worries fire hazards . great product , i use it every day .	1

hb 31602 excellent raclette grill price well below most other raclettes market now . this my second grill ; first - swiss-made machine - died after 10 years use . i decided try hb because its features attractive price , well my previous favorable experience amazon event i wanted return item . short , unit functions perfectly . its variable temperature control ( must raclette cooking ) its job well . clean up - frequent gripe among raclette grill reviewers - breeze .... assuming you only use top grill cook normal raclette-type foods such small potatoes , sausages or canadian bacon , not frying eggs , you treat non-stick surface properly . although listing copy doesn't make this clear , unit comes both rectangular pans plastic scrapers . cord length ( often-heard complaint ) quite adequate . only potential shortcoming way item shipped -- its retail box only , way you would pick it up store . means only thing your grill rough world ups trip few pieces egg-carton packing flimsy , non-corrugated box .... recipe disaster . fortunately , my unit arrived ok though box pretty beat up . amazon should require its third party ' partners ' use shipping cartons , like amazon itself always . ( positive side , my one experience amazon re shipping-damaged item very satisfactory .	1
i've my h-b step savor skillet/griddle several months now , i am very happy it . griddle accomodates four medium-sized pancakes , small lip around edge keeps batter off my countertops . skillet gets hot enough brown hamburger meat enough capacity prepare substantial main dish family 4-6 . temperature control temperature markings both griddle skillet , since skillet temperature runs lower than griddle . clean-up easier than traditional electric skillets . you don't need worry immersing electrical components because skillet lifts off base ( which griddle ) washed like any non-stick cookware . griddle wipes clean paper towel or damp sponge . though i'm not much home entertaining , i imagine this electric skillet very handy -- you cook it , then turn temperature down keep food warm long you need . lid adjustable vent it control moisture level inside . i only wish non-stick coating bit tougher . i've careful avoid scratches so far , but i know it only matter time . i just hope h-b keeps making these clever kitchen tools , because when this one becomes unusable , i'll certainly buy one	1
i purchased this item based other reviews i am not sorry i made purchase several reasons . i love lodge cast iron , amazon best prices anywhere free shipping . however , i taken aback size this skillet . it huge ! i tried it my gas range it takes up front back burners but adjustments needed keep sides burning . if it used just front burner ( larger burner ) flame directed middle pan but there so much skillet left over outer edges never get really hot . i would think 13inch skillet ( which i just purchased also ) would make more reasonable purchase becuase it 12 which might too small 15 1/4 which toooooo big	1
we live new york city two cats - younger cats , 18 months year old - needless say , it would really nice if we could rid ourselves litter box forever . we originally purchased cat toile t-t raining system company - it not nearly good this one , fact , it total failure - flimsy plastic , you couldn't punch out insert gradually like you this one . this point we almost there - we punched out half insert , cats acually perching toilet seat aiming hole - just incredible . we very happy ! plastic strong easy clean -	1

this worst vacuum we ever . it doesn't pick up pet hair - what heck ? it doesn't bare floors , it sucks up chews up persian rugs , it self propelled ? you got kidding me ! i push this thing harder than any vacuum ever . i went wal mart lowes get new belt it , this 4th belt we gone through one year neither places it . now what ? it very heavy vacuum . bringing it upstairs nearly kills ya . it far loudest vacuum there , super loud droning sound sends animals wild each time you turn it . small room it absolutely deafening ! i hate it , i not recommend it . if someone here - they lying you ! this worst vacuum we owned . i visibly see dust dirt shoot out back when i vacuum ( even after cleaning it out ) so much hepa filter!!!don't buy this vacuum , you want throw it through window like i even my husband wants !!	-1
this probably sturdiest bottle opener i've ever used . it opens pretty much any bottle ease , leverage easy due its bulk size . you probably won't ever lose it , either , since it so big . it definitely not travel because its weight , so you'll want something else if you plan bring bottle opener picnics or camping trips	1

i some research pans because i wanted some christmas replace old ones . i 10 inch skillet , 4.5 quart sauce 5 quart oval pans they best pans i've ever owned . what i love them ? 1 . mine not any sticking issues what so ever . 2 . they clean extremely easy fast via hand washing ( no hard scrubbing all ) . 3 . since it only takes seconds clean , i reuse cook something else without any flavor previous meal . 4 . handles not get hot they good non-slip grip ( i silicone rubber handles ) . 5 . they apparently put oven up 350 degrees but i not tried yet . 6 . they not heavy some professional ones . i would recommend buying this brand . conif i say anything bad them , only thing i think rivets inside pan attach handle pan get food stuck around them so you really clean around area good . i wish they would just attached handle outside pan	1
this not only peppermill i own , but it only one i'll use . i hate admit it , but i walked into dining room retrieve this baby even though perfectly usable mill right kitchen cupboad front me . i not intend become such peppermill snob but this such well designed tool i no longer settle using old ones . all previous mill suffered similar problems which oxo solved . maryland , humidity always problem peppermills . not this one . through dog days august , when other mills just mashing peppers into gummy paste clogging point where you gladly settle year old ground pepper , this mill produces talc fine powder . i've read other people trouble getting fine grind . you cannot just crank down adjustment nut get fine grind . your turn crank counter clockwise you tighten adjuster . this helps clear mechanism . if you don't this , larger peppercorns block mechanism closing down all way . once you get hang how adjust this mill , it provide copiuous quantities pepper extra cource super fine . easy grip handle eliminates all wasted motion associated tradional mill . i make my own barbeque rub always hated grinding enough pepper recipe . most mills only grind correctly one direction . so , you twist knob , release it reposition your grip twist again . half your motion wasted . now , thanks easy grip handle i crank out tablespoons pepper seconds . when i'm , i set mill back it clip-on base so there no pepper dust my spice cabinet . if you believe form follows function , this beautiful tool . if you need more status you peppermill get solid walnut mill or brushed aluminum mill manufacturer . just don't expect it out perform this classic .	1

this toaster definitely space saver . there few things you need know get great food out it though , toast i turn oven before i get bread out so it good temp when i put slices . if you want bake something or toast baguette sandwich just use bottom burner . i like how shelves come out when you open door , it makes retrieving your food so much easier . all all , it takes few tries adjust this toaster oven , but it makes up initial awkward period so cute small . i'm very happy my purchase .	1
if you're all clad chef , you know quality . accept no substitute splatter screen . i tired wiping up grease splatters all over my stovetop , around dials , floor , etc ... cheap flat screens just don't stay pan . edges all clad screen make it foolproof staying place . handle design saves space storage . one size fits everything up 13 inches . screen high quality design , not window screen gets punctured sooner or later . i tell this screen never bend out shape either . yes , it more expensive than cheap flat ones , but you'll appreciate performance durability advantages	1

i purchased this diamond sharpening steel amazon used it couple days . it really works superb overall performance above all expectations . it not only realigns edge but sharpens it well . i.e. it removes material ( steel ) infinitesimal amount accumulates surface tool extremely fine dust . it takes only few effortless strokes simple edge realignment if knife sharp or few minutes work if knife dull . but any case , result amazing ! once while this diamond sharpening steel should put under running water only few seconds cleaning steel dust residue flushes water . maintenance simple easy . so , whether you cheap knives or expensive ones this tool worth money . only issue i leave open durability this diamond sharpening steel . theoretically it should last forever but reality it remains seen .	1

i adore good china , but too many young children use it often . graduated out plastic plates cups phase needed train my children ( who , course , break lots plates while ) while simultaneously pleasing myself . i thought this impossible , until i found this setting . it not too fancy , but understated simply elegant . this bodes well its power remain pleasing eyes after passage time . i it now one year . i am pleased report it very robust ( not like bone china , but very strong thin stoneware ) . my five children , all whom pre-pubescent , only broken one plate . i continue appreciate its clean , simple elegance . this one enduring flagship patterns mikasa continue make perpetuity , also , so i am confident broken pieces easily replaced foreseeable future . pattern shipped me suffered one broken tea cup serving platter , which promptly replaced without question cost me mikasa . i think you can't go wrong this purchase	1

perhaps like you , i love silicone . this large spatula quite nice . you anything silicone . you fry , poach , make soups , there never worry heat . le crueset makes fine quality silicone utensils , but their wood unfinished , so unless you keep them oiled , they age spilter . these you remove top if you like but wooden handles treated , water resistant . addition these made long hall , their shape unique . i like shape slightly angled , this makes it easier run edges bowl . i so happy my purchase these ! i can't say enough good things them . i would recommend these over other manufactors , they better made , improve others weaker areas . must your kitchen	1

poor folks who complaining " eee " display , i haven't same problems . customer support this really professional prompt 800 number . " eee " problem result people not reading instructions not immersing control panel water . don't it . panel electronic electronics don't work when they're filled water . this unit good , solid fryer which i've no problems . pros : easy use , easy clean up . nothing baked my frier or my friends friers ( death eee ) . even when frying " trouble " items like pastry or breaded items , basket comes clean easilly . controls positive engagement hard accidentally push . unit makes loud beeping when buttons pushed distinctive alarm . you shouldn't leave frier unattended , but you enough peace-of-mind you work other things kitchen while fryer working . bonus suggested cooking tempetures printed right unit so when manual gets lost , you some idea what what . window also lifesaver it lets you see what oil doing just case anything goes wrong . cons : power chord most annoying bit plugged upside down . don't it . it says " this side up " clearly chord , but if you absent minded or limited eyesight , this might issue . only other problem controls ( power button ) faces frying basket . this more pet-peeve then anything but if you need get control unit hurry , you not want reaching through hot oil splatter . my suggestion : keep it it own power strip so you yet button case emergency . sadly , this gripe applies almost all friers . i also wish lid bit better designed , lid drops inevitable condensation water into oil until you get used tipping it out ( towards basket handle ) . once you get hang it , condensation dropping into oil avoided . this frier , despite few minor shortcomings , excellent . one nice features it heats up quickly maintain heat even when adding pulling out food . caution when oil disagreeable , it heats up quickly . sure supervise frier . i managed boneheaded thing chopping up mushrooms , washing them , tossing them without thinking it managed cause quite show kitchen . i actually read manual , there blurb there make sure food completely thawed dried which i not heed . if you respect power here , it great unit	1

riedel o series wine tumblers great value more practical many occasions than traditional wine glasses because they lack potentially fragile stem . these pinot noir/nebbiolo glasses great not only those two varietals , but also beaujolais other wines made gamay grape . i also happen think these could work " general purpose " red wine glasses , if you should so choose use them such . these great all but most formal occasions , should really enhance your wine tasting experience , whether you wine novice or expert taster .	1

my wife i drink more coffee than we probably should . this cuisinart coffee maker brews full pot just few minutes . it taste great . i really like how easy it take everything apart place parts my dishwasher . coffee pot not spill water all over place when filling machine like so many other brands i've experienced past . although i rated this coffee maker 5-star , there one little thing i don't care much . machine stays 2-hours before auto shut-off shuts it off . whereas most others turn off one hour . but very minor . if you like perfect tasting coffee hurry , this machine you . if size scares you , just let you know , it fits perfectly under my upper cabinets when counter top . it little larger than standard 12-cup machine , but not much . it looks real nice also . when i finally wear this coffee maker out , i'll buy just like it . oh , it takes standard #4 cone shaped filters , or you use copper filter it comes . usual , amazon cheapest price i could find	1

heftier inner bowl this particular model people hunting all over place it when sizes smaller larger passed over . rice cooker fine job replaces our humongous panasonic 10 cupper . this one take forever cook . oh , yes : paddle bottom underneath packaging . i thought i missing it especially since i got ripped box ripped manual so i emailed got replacement paddle sanyo before i found original one during recycling . ooops ! unlike all previous panasonics , there not magnetic handle cup place rice paddle . pity . panasonic magnet won't stick this either so i always designated place rice paddle . we own rice cooker make our daily rice because designated machine less stressful . you need rice cooker ? no . steaming rice pyrex bowl certainly faster would require leaving burner low keep rice warm until you ready eat it . but there something compartmentalizing rice cooking part one day removes it constant consideration . p.s. we usually make two cups rice per meal there enough height remaining me place 4-cup round pyrex bowl some savory food warm . two months daily use later , i recommend this product because rice comes out fine but it take 35 (!!!) minutes . if you want faster rice , then steam rice rack pot . made chinai use this all time . this frugal ? no but it much less hassle than pressure cooker it made perfect long grain , short grain basmati rice first gowould i purchased this used cheaper price off craigslist ? nodid i shop around best total price including manufacturer website ? yes so should yo	1

cast iron usually isn't my first choice cookware several reasons : it isn't non-stick ; it heavy ( i tendonitis my hands ); it can't go dishwasher . thankfully , lodge new enamel-coated line takes care most these issues ! i recently got my hands one their two-quart enamel-coated casserole dishes review , apple green . i love wide , shallow design . after all , many casseroles wind up browned , crusty toppings -- which best part ! -- this allows more casserole come out way . i also find this little easier lift , particularly because wide handles , although you definitely need both hands i still let my husband move it out oven most par t.t wo quarts barely enough most casseroles , i find ; i usually prefer dishes two half quarts just because they allow little more room error help avoid spill-overs . however , i think most reasonably-sized casseroles fit this . quality enamel coating part what i love most lodge enamel-coated line . past i've used le creuset enamel-coated cast iron ( bought quite while ago , so if they've improved their coating recent years i can't address ) it definitely inferior . it wasn't slick , so it didn't clean easily nor release food easily . it also didn't stand up all well metal utensils . contrast , it hard imagine this coating wearing down any time soon . we made cornbread it it slid out pan without any help all . i love way this pan heats evenly , holds heat keeps casserole warm until you come back seconds , releases food ease , cleans like charm despite fact you should wash it hand . it elegant , wide shallow design perfect giving you more browned topping that so delicious most casseroles , it makes niftiest oval loaf cornbread . what more could you want ? well okay , i wish it could go dishwasher general principle , i wish they could come up way make cast iron lighter those us hand problems , i wish it held just little bit more . but good conscience i only take half point off those , so consider my rating 4.5	1

i apologize reviewing product i don't own , never owned , won't ever own or need . general , i'm against doing this , but this case i feel really compelled comment what appears gimmick , hopefully dissuade some people wasting their money it . here my take this product -- it pizza stone thermometer backsplash . i can't imagine backsplash any practical use , thermometer , let put it this way : if your grill nice enough it capable generating or containing heat necessary emulate brick oven pizza , it probably one . even if it doesn't , you buy one separately under 10 bucks , free use it anywhere your kitchen or grill area . here what i recommend . go buy bona fide pizza stone , or better yet , few unglazed ceramic tiles home depot few bucks . way , you prepare more than one pizza simultaneously under $99 per pizza . my advice you , should , put rig like this together your own price large pepperoni domino . don't waste your money or your precious kitchen storage space this thing	1
i needed saucepan cook oatmeal would let go bits stick bottom . sounds silly , but i love oatmeal hate cleaning pan afterwards . this cleans up easily cooks evenly . i used it cooking rice , gravies other foods seem stick it always cleans up well . now , lid . there black band inside lid it scrubed off one night recently . i sat down , wrote email company next day , they new lid way . they asked only where send it , nothing else . i like companies stand product they sell . so , if you going buy this line , check black band , it should glass metal , not inside lid . if you problem product , always notify manufacturer , they almost always make it right , like calphalon me	1

i'm going against what many home chefs like all purpose knife . it not heavy , german , or made surgical stainless steel . these light knives , picking them up effortless . if you uses knives often , why get something heavy promotes carpal tunnel syndrome ? they not german . i think german knives overated overpriced . these knives great bargain . you get 2 whole sets cost one henckels or wusthoff knife . i admit cheaper steel they use these knives not hold their edge long nor you dishwash ( always handwash these ) . these knives rust if you throw them machine but they very easy sharpen get ridiculously sharp using those cheap 2 stage knife sharpeners . long you handwash sharpen periodically , you cut best them . secret caring your knife handwash , light oil cloth , sharpen your knives periodically .	1

mario batali lasagna pan best pan i've used . it extra deep so it holds really thick layers all good stuff i make my lasagnas . it weighs ton since it enameled cast iron , but why it cooks so evenly . i recommend adding 15+ minutes extra cooking time your recipes because oven heat heavy mass pan . cleaning easy . just soak it hot sudsy water while then all baked cheese sauce wipe off kitchen scrub pad . only surprises rim pan no enamel . it bare iron . but it cleaned without problem not rust when soaked overnight . this great pan , but it very heavy when empty even heavier when filled lasagna so make sure you've got some stong helpers around put it oven if necessary . :o	1

i used love this kettle . i've this kettle over four years now it developed same problem some people who gave it one-star reviews . electrical contacts degraded over past few months today i couldn't get it turn all no matter how many times i twisted it around its base . i've cleaned contacts twice past few months no avail . maybe improvement all day each time . looking inside base , i see why contacts die -- they don't grip metal ring spike all , but rather ring spike just rest loosely sprung metal . wish i'd thought inspect before buying i t.t here no excuse such bad design . they hoping repeat buy ? not going happen	-1
buying these types things problematical . one can't know how they work until they're tried out one own work space . things consider height width your open shelf areas . this wrap holder get way accessing things shelf below . addition hooks sit shelf above interfere what you put shelf . so keep this mind . holder works okay overall . i got two could only fit one into my main pantry . if i'd space , better solutions would : larger vertical unit installed inside cupboard or pantry door or full depth wire drawer screwed underneath shelf	1
this item " must " !! it light weight , cleans well . i love it	1
i started out liking this machine , despite not so fond our former dirt devil " screamer " ridiculous belt changing routine . problems this machine : try cleaning pleated filter ( good luck ! ) exhaust blowing out sides then slightly downward blows around what you're trying vacuum up . i am really surprised no one else mentioned these two issues ( except one person who mentioned filter ) . after just one use , i knock pleated filter against trash loosen remove dirt -- no go . so what options ? leave dirt there continually clog it , then forced go buy new one $5.99 ? i honestly think this goal dirt devil , just make extra buck . if you're trying vacuum up pet hair , anything light weight , watch it blow around exhaust you go chasing it vacuum ( utterly futile ) . it loud side too . it powerful , but wrong way -- goal vacuum up debris , not blow it around your house	1
pepper casserole very cute , but i prefer wider , shallower shape pumpkin casserole which i also own . small , deep pepper tends cook some dishes unevenly due shape . instance , i used this casserole bake egg custard . end recommended cooking time middle remained liquid . time center firm , edges dry amp ; overcooked . this same dish cooks perfectly pumpkin . i find i use pumpkin far more frequently due superior baking results i've achieved it	1
i bought one these few months ago but unfortunately it spends lot more time my kitchen drawer than my regular garlic press . here what i like it : 1 . idea whacking unpeeled clove garlic order take skin off more easily great , but this any hard , flat object or even side chef knife blade . 2 . unlike garlic press , garlic twist gives you uniform pieces chopped garlic . while garlic press leaves you flattened skin you either discard or chop up hand , garlic twist gives you uniform pieces . unfortunately , this where garlic press wins out my standards , it difficult my lady-like hands " get garlic twist going . " after garlic gone through few destructive twists , it simple enough continue until you reach desired size chunks . however , first few twists quite difficult execute , you press two parts together quite hard , while simultaneously turning them , keep them popping apart jumping over garlic rather than punching through it . this problem occurs even just one clove . interesting idea , but classic garlic press still my favorite . sometimes i grate garlic ginger grater or microplane grater . larger quantities , zyliss chopper might job but i've never tried . garlic twist , however , drawbacks out-weigh advantages	1
this solid , basic stainless pressure cooker , quite bargain $41.45 price ( or $33 something after $25 off $125 kitchen purchases ) . advantages : * easy use flip pressure regulator quick release pressure * only 15 lbs pressure adequate normal pressure cooking * handles both sides makes cooker easy carry stable when full . * stainless won't interact food product such tomatoes . * 8 qt . capacity gives 4 qts capacity when cooking foaming products such beans or lentils . * easier clean than some pressure cookers i used . disadvantages : * only cooks 15 lbs pressure , where some recipes call only 10 lbs would adjusted . * most canning 10 lbs pressure sealevel up 1000 ft elevation * i respectfully disagree this cooker meant canning . it could process 3 or 4 pints pinch , but 23 qt pressure cooker canning workhorse hold 19 pts or 7 qts . manual suggests not canning it , it doesn't canning trivet included . * it much lighter weight than older presto models , so i don't know if it last long old ones . overall , it great pressure cooker most cooking , very good value	1

pros : low price , looks good package , adequately slices dices small pieces meat thin veggies . cons : flexible thin blade , extremely lightweight , air pockets too small effective -- veggies stick blade . conclusion : if you regularly need use santoku knife , spend little more buy something more weight/heft deeper dimples . this more like disposable knife you might take vacation or use pinch .	1

i bought this little wonder , one my niece one me . i lots tile my home . my niece hard wood floors tile kitchen bathrooms , carpet bedrooms . i bought dirt devil swifter rechargable vac , but it won't space rugs you hold down switch keep vacuum working . i bought it because it light . i got tired holding switch . i arthritis . new one swifter hadn't come out yet . so , desperation , i bought flair . it great ! change outlet because cord too short even my kitchen , it big , but that only draw back . i go tile space rugs tile infinitely . it electric not battery powered . i keep roller or turn it off switch right there top handle . i wash filter , don't buy new ones . cup small , but all i empty it . who wants keep cup dust dirt around , anyway--that just plain lazy . it such good strong vacuum , my niece even cleans carpet doorways . she says this little vacuum better than her bigger vacuum(not hoover ) , but i told her this little wonder lighter work areas than heavy carpet . happy cleaning	1
board right size carving up whole chicken " moat " , while modest width/depth , kept counters clean . plus it reasonably light its size . one small surprise me wood so very dry . it soaked up two very generous applications mineral oil very quickly . if it doesn't come oiling instructions , you'll still want oil it soon possible perhaps multiple applications each spaced out day . new comments : after seasoning board , hand washing , 6 months happy use , board split glued joint . this happened after it sitting counter week under weight homemade loaf bread medium-weight glass cake cover . my best guess board become just slightly ( most imperceptively ) warped constant distributed weight provided enough stress crack apart glue overnight -- 6+ " it ! i know nothing woodworking but i doubt seasoning alone strengthen joint or prevent minor warpage . so i'm lowering product 3 star rating	1

like several other reviews , i very dissapointed . we looked several machines francisfrancis !, gaggia ascaso . while these certainly more expensive machines , machine we replacing price parity breville . my observations : pros : solid well built constructionlong steamer wand . this allows you rest your carafe unit steam your milk while you put away dish or toast bagelsimple operate pleasant look atnice ergonomic features like storage compartment accessories under unit , removable foam wand , etc . consit fails horribly its core function , making good expresso steaming/foaming your milk . i use pods machine takes very long pull shot , it splattered all over ( due funky way they try " create " crema ) , ultimate product weak bitterthe steam very weak , took 30% longer warm up my machine than any machine we tested , it very inconsistent how much steam it injected . machine wastes lot water . they proud all priming purging features , but it steams belches it makes quite mess . i found myself reaching sponge towel several times during brewing process . net this great machine architecturally but horrid expresso maker . if this kind coffee acceptable you , there thousand less expensive brands trick . price , performance must better .	1
good quality lamp price . kind dark color but very sleek sophisticated . 3-way lighting also good feature . i'm very satisfied overall	1
my husband thinks small appliances waste counterspace money . i don't always disagree , but we make press pot coffee twice day heating up water stove took 15+ minutes there always floating sediment bottom our kettle ... sounds appetizing ! i researched this kettle liked description water boiled quickly turned off automatically .... i also wanted it retain heat able taken off heating source serving . my husband ( i ) really like this pot . we use it not only coffee ( full pot boiling takes just under 5 minutes ) but boil water pasta other cooking . it saves me time i don't want kitchen all night .... this one small appliance we not want without . only change i would make handle seems bit large average hand so it not comfortable hold i still sediment ... which probably problem my water . least now i get into pot clean through large opening . no weird smells here we using daily 6 months	1

i bought this set my wife christmas , mainly because i stuck ideas what get her . she spends lot time kitchen she using old set chicago cutlery several unbranded cheap giveaway knives several years . none those knives great or sharp i hated trying put edge them even though i'm pretty good sharpening knives . essentially , knives just sharpened pieces steel appear pretty simple , straightforward instruments shouldn't difficult produce . but little experience some poor examples prove this not case . like most seemingly simple things , simplicity illusion . my experience not kitchen knives but it " working " knives . pocket knives fixed blade knives designed hard use nasty jobs i daily removing staples papers office chopping down woody weeds backyard cutting up boxes , rope , cording thin pieces aluminum . i know value blade take good edge hold it through lot abuse . i little research found several brands kitchen knives universal respect . wusthof always or near top everyone list . more often than not , it number one reviews surveys i came across . my wife little apprehensive sharpness knives out box . she quickly realized value really sharp kitchen knife , no time , she commenting how much easier it work wusthof than cheapo knives she using . she really making good use paring knife chef knife days since christmas . my own limited use chef knife this set confirms how well it handles cuts compared clunky chicago cutlery chef knife . after looking over more reviews , i've ordered wusthof 7 " hollow edge santoku go this set . designed thin cuts , it fit well other knives . i'll probably also get serrated edge bread knife no t-t oo-distant future round out wusthof set . this likely lifetime purchase our household makes high price more investment . i'm well pleased so my wife .	1
product stapled together . doesn't seem consistent quality other wusthof products	-1

product not without its flaws , but if your cat likes mindlessly chasing same thing over over this toy them . generally you need set it small shelf , table or desk aim it floor ( it only 2 settings where aim it ) . you're supposed able open it it start up , my unit little " funny " day 1 i open it , let it snap shut hard then it would turn then opening it second time it ready . once you start it up it runs 5-9 minutes . laser spins fast large circle ( depending how high up you place device ) couple seconds , then stops second , then repeats . every time it stops different place , typically few inches previous stopping point . it works out very well cats they try predict where it " land " . i would say this good toy turn right before you leave so cats play wear themselves out sleep while you're gone instead getting into trouble while you're away . it especially popular dumber cats group , because it repetitive .

we bought this stand mixer september 2006 , first time we used it we noticed silvery-gray deposit batter when it scraped bowl ( both bowls ) . thinking it some coating new bowls , we washed scrubbed them thoroughly -- still same thing . we thought it may some oil coming motor escaping where beaters mounted , but doesnt seem case . 4th time we used it center beater jammed cannot removed -- it abiut 1/3 " locked place wont budge . while struggling remove it , some grayish powder came falling out -- maybe that where deposits . anyway , i wish we hadnt bought this product would advise you find option	-1

first let me say this product arrived my home faster then i expected , especially since it right before christmas . product itself great . i just purchased new , very expensive wooden cutting board i wanted sure protect it . someone store where i bought board suggested i get " food grade mineral oil " . i really no idea this type product but once i started searching web info , i found it best thing use keep your wooden boards like new years . i unable locate any this oil stores i go normally so i turned my tried true friend , amazon.com sure enough , they this product . once i began using it , i could tell right away what difference it made how my new cutting board looked . i typically use my board every day using oil once week . board stayed " fresh " looking no lasting cut marks no water damage after wash ups	1

we put these knives our wedding registry after reading cooks illustrated kitchen knife review . they most highly recommended these set high-end wustoff knives . we chose these because they're much better value ( when these go sale , you pick up whole victorinox set same price one good wustoff knife ) . we've very happy our choice ( our friends who bought them us -- gotta love registries ! ) . blades very sharp , knives very well-balanced comfortable hand , everything very easy clean . we've our set few months now blades still sharp day we got ' em . physical design knives very functional . they aren't quite sharp heavier forged metal blades some higher end knives like fancier wustoffs . these stamped sheet metal rather than individually forged . but they're still very good , much better value than their forged competitors . one note : we bit confused difference forschner victorinox versions this knife set . but it turns out they're exact same knives , just distributed under two different labels . forschner brand name they've used years sell professional chefs . they only recently started selling under victorinox name attempt reach home gourmets , under theory people already associate victorinox name quality . but we victorinox version , they're exactly same my friend forschners . so you buy either ( whichever cheaper )	1

this grill comes handy middle michigan winter when we can't fire up our outdoor bbq . it cooks quickly cleans fairly easily . i never dared place it dishwasher , although it sounds like lot people so i might try it . there few downfalls - you get grease splatters countertop no matter how careful you if you like your meat medium-well prepared crack window open because ' burnt ' smell linger days otherwise	1

i agree mr. vasicek review most part , other reviewer below who mentioned problems clock . i got this pot because it would more difficult break than ones glass carafes , lack burner meant no more burnt coffee . i problem filter flopping over getting grinds my coffee , may try permanent filter solution . i definitely recommend pre-heating carafe hot water , regardless time year . otherwise coffee gets tepid fast . coffee not hot it could , most time , but maybe that also amount ( also preheated ) milk i put my cup . i don't like delayed brew function , but only because it time-based , like alarm clock , i'd rather it straight delay , because i don't make coffee same time every morning -- i'd like able set it go off after set time , so i could go outside , or shower , or whatnot , return fresh coffee . but it doesn't really matter , because clock itself seems bit wonky now i've appliance few months . i can't say whether we've bumping it accidentally changing time , or whether there problem clock itself ; anyway , it seems weak point . i've cleaned it few times white vinegar ; i can't get all coffee stains out carafe but i don't really care . i don't drip problem pouring coffee , but i line lid arrow up carefully found it helps steady lid when you pour . if you try pour without lid , it often spill ! but compared pouring out little glass carafes " freebie " type coffee makers , this one great . forget pause function ... if you take carafe out during brew cycle you just asking trouble . all all , i'd say it not " perfect coffee maker " but it most suitable i encountered recent years -- speaking someone who recently ruined percolator running it without water . i would buy this one again	1

this heater works reasonably well , it not too noisy low setting , but it electronic control designed extremely bad . first all it three operational modes : low , high auto . low uses half its heating power runs fan slower quieter speed . high - uses full power noisiest . thermostat setting/operation not available nether under low nor under high mode . auto mode you set desired temperature heater reasonably good job maintaining set temperature , but - when it auto mode heater runs it full power becomes noisy . there no way make use thermostat low heating power . i think most people would actually want use auto mode low power , especially if they use heater bedroom , but some genius delonghi decided save few cents not providing this option . heater also ' forgets ' your last auto temperature setting after you switch it off defaults 75 , so every time you switch it again you adjust temperature - pretty annoying imo . spite fact i got it pretty cheap ( under 40 ) , it going back .	1

i wanted pressure cooker some time , recently received this one gift . i used it number times since getting it , it becoming my favorite cooking utensil . since getting it , i cooked : - beans ( less than 25 minutes perfect texture no presoaking)- chicken ( 25 minutes fall-of-the bone tenderness)- roast ( most tender , juicy best tasting my family eaten)a 10-quart cooker may somewhat larger than many people think they need . i love large size because i cook family or company don't worry not enough room . this simple use , easy clean way delicious food family hurry . taking chiken out refrigerator dinner table often less than 40 minutes . while this also true other pressure cookers , fagor splendid cooker easy use locking mechanisms , it simple design makes it reliable easy clean . couple suggestions : read instructions . while this cooker simple use clean , instructions contain number very useful hints . i read instructions beforehand , my first dish would less hassle than it . second , buy accessories . this pot just pot - no trivet , no basket , no spoons , nothing else . serious pressure cooking , you need some these other utensils . final comment : you won't get better this price . i recommend this any serious cook who limited time	1
this things * * work , although fan doesn't blow heated air very far away unit . it possible adjust thermostat knob so it keeps your room right temperature , but when it reaching temperature you've set , it switches off constantly . ( like 20 times 10 seconds -- seriously . ) i'm not sure this one isn't slightly defective , since most thermostat controls non-switching region where they don't change their state long temperature within certain range . instance , if you set your furnace thermostat 68 , it turns furnace 67 , not 67.992 turns it off 69 , not 68.002 . this apparently doesn't feature -- it literally runs less than 1/10th second regular basis . i wonder how long thermostat relay last constant cycling .	1

i just recently received this odor eliminator . it much bigger than i expected but very easy setup use . filters relatively cheap only need purchased every 2 months . whisper quiet mode well unit just whisper quiet . if you trying get rid particularly bad smell you turn it high speed which moderately noisy fan noise . living dorm sometimes things get bit smelly ( if you know what i mean ) . this device always your back whether it your garbage you don't want take out or your room mate pile smelly clothes . this modern age we don't always time take care these things most sprays simply mask odors . this great hamilton beach product eliminates odors sends them packing	1

this little unit heats two our children rooms ( 10x8 12x14 ) perfectly ! their rooms normally around 63 degrees while house 66 , this unit elevate them 75-80 degrees very little effort . i know because i used electric thermometer measure temperature . don't expect this unit completely heat room without presence central home heating unit . meaning , this unit not heat small cabinet middle wood itself . but if you central heating ( baseboard or central-air ) keep temperature low save gas bills this perfect unit ! it made complement them . only thing i wish it digital thermometer so i set it exact temperature instead doing it feel . but then , it so inexpensive i can't really complain ..	1

first all , let me say i agree reviewer who deducted stars 9 " skillet due non-stick coating . since non-stick coatings chemicals , i refuse use any cooking utensil coating them . original , baked enamel finish this skillet works great . secret using moderate heat adding oil once pan warms up , then adding food items . if meat sticks , it unstick it carmelizes ( this also applies their grilling skillets ) . i find i just wipe mine out keep using it until i make chili or something messy like . then all i fill skillet water let it sit while , then it rinses clean . maximum , i've taken boar bristle brush couple spots once or twice , that all . i beseech this company leave non-stick coating off their skillets even though one reviewer below seems prefer it . or minimum give consumer choice but i'd bet most would prefer original , satin finish . fact , i bought this skillet because fired enamel finish i discovered my well-known name brand stainless steel skillet stew/pasta pot too much nickel them so i can't use them . anyway , i love this skillet . it makes good wok too burner under center pan . i fry up one veggie , push it off side where it stays warm while i fry next one , then push it over until i'm finished . i say i loved this skillet ? i wish they made lid this skillet i buy brand which doesn't match but it works . since most skillets come without lids , this silly , i agree . so then , i highly recommend this skillet both cooking easy clean-up	1

this deepest lasagna pan i able find , why i bought it . i owned it several years , but i don't bake or roast often . it worked adequately . i gotten my money worth . because it stainless steel , it feels lightweight . it not made thick metal , therefore feels just little cheap . gourmet cooks might sneer it . stainless steel , it shows no signs rust , even handles , after soaking kitchen sink . exterior still looks nice . interior not any kind non-stick coating . spatula/turner/flipper utensil , which comes pan , very useful . it thin enough slide under food turned over skillet . it little flexible , but not extremely flexible like some wimpy spatulas . it won't flex , wiggle , collapse while carrying something heavy like say thick pork chop . i use spatula very frequently . it thin enough slide under fresh-baked soft cookies , remove them pan , without making mess cookies . rack put inside pan , fits nicely , use when roasting meat . rack not very high , so it would not adequate roasting something extremely high fat , such goose , would result deep layer melted fat bottom pan . rack also used cooling rack baked goods , although not intended such . wires not spaced close together ideal cooling rack , thus small cookies may fall through .	1

2006 year specialty roombas . their " high end upgrade " this year intellibin option their top line model , scheduler . we 2 schedulers love them , so i intrigued this intelli-bin . however , extra $20 , i actually consider this bad feature , not good feature . here why . essence you get exact same robot scheduler robot , which i love . however , they added one light , which tells you if bin full . theory here you'll clean it when you see light . however this awful theory ! roombas need kept clean run well . even if there only little dirt there , if it hair wrapped around something you leave it there , it going wrap more more tightly start damage parts . you need give it cleaning each day . not thorough , hefty cleaning , but shake dust bin quick glance brushes . if it becomes normal natural part your schedule , it really no big deal all . i definitely think you should not dust bin light - most definitely not use it know when clean your roomba . this would really lead more roomba issues ... which isn't good owners nor good irobot ! roombas run wonderfully when they're kept clean - they break down quickly if allowed fill crud . you might expect any appliance . so letting roombas fill up more crud than they should , irobot going get bad reputation . which shame . we end up getting intellibin when we issues one our regular roombas send it repairs . because roomba such hot item right now , our failure right before 2006 holiday season , it over 2 months we still hadn't gotten replacement roomba back . we called complained , they sent us off intellibin version free upgrade . it works exactly same scheduler , i kept waiting bin full light light up . bin * stuffed * full junk it kept going . eventually after few runs it light up , but i really question how well suction could working then . i really would much rather just empty it after each run - it 20 second job - vs waiting light light up roomba performance suffer result . my verdict - get regular scheduler which * awesome * keeps our home incredibly clean . ignore this improvement . it not worth $20 relying it could actually cause you more trouble . quick comment cost - people easily pay $500-$700 dishwasher , think it essential part life . i certainly know i love my dishwasher . dishwasher , you still certain things hand - fine crystal stemware , large pots . even so , dishwasher makes your daily life easier . i consider roomba far better than dishwasher , especially if you pets . every morning , all pet hair dander just gone . it makes my daily life - since i work home am breathing air every second day - infinitely better healthier . roombas cheaper , too	1

my fiance bought this coffee maker wal-mart sale . it worked flawlessly week or two . then i thought it would good idea put tea bag compartment where coffee goes . my fiance told me later instructions advised against it might damage unit . next day or two unit malfunctioned - it would buzz then two blue lights would blink . sometimes we could unplug it start over it would work but problem seemed become more frequent ( frustrating ) . i noticed lid locks place while unit brewing , so round top part inside apparently rotates locks into bottom part ( where pods go ) . it occurred me buzzing sound sound locking mechanism rotating into place that when problem occurs ( intermittently ) . so we started pressing down lid before clicking brew button it always works fine when we . ( apparently if lid doesn't close snuggly then locking mechanism jams you get blinking lights must then reset it unplugging it . ) i hope this review helps anyone else this problem . i've seen several comments others same issue . other than this one issue which turns out minor if you know workaround , we love this coffee maker ! we also use it just make quick hot water ramen noodles or tea ( but i don't put tea bags machine any more , just cup ! ) . we've it couple months now use it least once day , usually more	1

very practical inexpensive way carry your knives if you're " cook go . " 7 slots should more than enough carry your essential knives , sharpening steel maybe tongs , peeler and/or zester - it also slot accomodate cleaver . henckels roll generous 19 inches long , which could , conceivably , allow you carry even your woodman pal . remember , you'll still need keep your knives protected blade guards , otherwise you'll cut into roll - extra expense which you need take into account . finally , i feel , they included handle , it would made superior product .	1

it seems i've spent years trying find " perfect " teakettle . something would give good honest , audible whistle when boiling , then allow one pour steaming hot water without put hand anywhere near spou t.t hat didn't seem like much ask , but we heck time finding such thing . we found some close , but which you fill only through spout . it seems me one should lid pot like this , able get inside clean it , inspect damage or wear , or whatever . suddenly , we came across this one . amazon there 4-cup version , two 8-cup versions . there one copper bottom resemble traditional revereware look , but after looking pictures , we bought one pure stainless steel top bottom . entire top pot non-shiny plastic some kind -- one those new space-age materials not get hot metal or some other materials . designers revere should commended making total break tradition so they could create pot so practical . lid top not centered beneath handle , which means you reach inside , or fill it , more easily than typical pot where handle gets way . handle very well balanced " trigger " open spout well-positioned . you hold spout partly open , or pull it completely open , which point trigger " locks " it open position . this saves lot finger fatigue when pouring multiple cups tea , or whatever . close it , one simply pushes forward back trigger . you don't need instructions , although they included . when you pick this thing up pour it , it feels totally natural your hand , you figure it out instinctively . it grea t.t he spout slight diagonal " crease " its tip drip-free pouring , which just thoughtful feature overall thoughtful original design . we chose larger size mostly able serve more than couple people time if we should company . we're glad we made choice , because honestly 8-cup version looks small compared our old kettle . other one more rounded perhaps larger capacity . i haven't measured capacity revere model , i'm not obsessed it , i'm sure it suit our needs . i suspect compact appearance most likely function efficient design . this one those purchases , its own small way , makes every day better improving small task one frequently . course it far too early tell how it stand up long use , but we're quite satisfied ours expect it pleasure long time	1

i say , i think mr. walker review these glasses isn't taking into account these hand blown pieces . every piece hand blown glass i've ever owned small bubbles minor imperfections , which i personally think adds charm owning something made human hands rather than stamped out machine . far consistency , four these i own remarkably consistent taking all into account . yes , they not identical , but really , hand blown , you cannot expect . my spanish teacher high school told story shopping mexico one trip . she went glass blower picked out vase she loved . she thought it would fun buy several these her friends gifts when she returned . she asked craftsman make her 10 " just like this " . man balked , started shaking his head , begging , " por favor , poquito diferente " . he simply couldn't make each one identical . these lovely shotglasses , great price	1

my old " dirt devil " died old age i needed replacemen t.t his eureka product better job cleaning than my old one -- even carpet . i only one complaint ; one unexpected problem -- dust bags . they much larger than ones i've used before hold more dirt , i like . problem rubber flange around opening keeps it leaking dust . it works fine , but i am deathy allergic natural rubber even touching it could , other rubber products , send me emergency room -- or worse . like all other manufacturers this planet , other than those who make medical supplies , this information not disclosed product information . this failure annoys me very much , but hardly unique eureka company . thank goodness i not live alone , so i am able get my husband change vacuum bags , but latex allergic peson living alone this would very major drawback	1
i purchased this gift my son who loves anything dipped chocolate . he his eye much larger fountains . i wanted something smaller he could use without making big mess . i also not want 3 pounds chocolate melted once . this little pot perfect reason . you melt 1 1/2 cups chips or whatever type chocolate you want . this allow you dip over 2 pounds strawberries numerous pretzels one batch . because it size ease use it pulled out several times already . i highly reccomend this anyone who looking smaller chocolate fondue pot . think it mini crock pot that what it reminds me most .	1
i love this pan ! it perfect so many things , especially pan meals ! only problem , my opinion , black coating . i know they use this coating frying pans so you fry higher temp , but inside never looks nice . it not non-stick , but i definitely prefer light gray interior . overall , though , this one keeper	1
it soft medium-sized . didn't pay too much them so didn't feel too bad when friends would come over ask if they could take one . now i don't any left , but they're interseting little soft " stuffed animal " kind thing . no real practical purpose probably - i heard it horror if it ever opens/spills its contents . it kind funny - thing itself soft - but it comes huge box tons air pillows ( when you order it amazon least ) . so if you're moving need packing material , then here 2-for-1 special .	1

i got more than i expected . which good , because it seemed over priced when i bought it . but it only one i could find truly variable temp control . now , i think price fair . pro's- variable temprature : this why i picked this product . i wanted full control temp water . - filtered spout : i don't use it . could useful keeping tea or any other particles pot while pouring . - dock station : pot easily removed doc , so there no cord way when pouring . - hidden cord : cord winds up inside dock . makes it easy hide extra cord , if you luxury . see cons :( . - insulated : keeps water hot long time . - auto off : turns when it gets temperature . cons- 4ft cord : i could use 1 more foot :( . wish list : - stay option : keeping water temperature would nice option . rather than letting it slowly cool down . - thermometer : doesn't tell you actual temperature water . not even estimate temperature knob .	1

when i got my fagor pressure cooker i thought it going long relationship . but i learned over past few months it much more trouble than it worth . it may cut cooking time half , but it certainly doubles clean-up time . it hard regulate cooking food that locked inside cooker . regular cooking pot i look inside see how things going , add things right time , make any adjustments i need . i like ease just bringing regular pot boil , reducing simmer , coming back when timer goes off . i hate trying get pressure right , worrying it too much pressure , then waiting it depressurize or depressurizing it manually speed things up . food textures often all wrong . when it ? you can't just open it up , look inside say " ten more minutes " . same price you get some very nice copper-bottom pans last your whole lifetime no gaskets or valves need replacing	1

i use this vacuum supplement my dyson i 2 dogs , 2 cats , 2 children . it works well wood floors even my basement floors where i keep my cats ' litter boxes . however , cord short it not work very well carpet . sometimes i'll vacuum closet spaces or use it our stairs ; however , i would not recommend using this your main source sweeping up after your pets . my dyson miracle worker compared this , customer service department dyson much more efficient . when one my children broke my dyson hose , i called customer service department they sent me hose no charge . shark filter costs nearly $18 replace , because shark small vacuum , it not take long before filter needs replaced if you pets who shed lot . i even rinsed filter , but it still bears replacing . it great sweeping up small jobs , but if you looking something suction up large space or after pets children , keep looking	1

i actually preferred pfaltzgraff mystic pattern but my oldest dd her husband gave me set cappucino christmas . service 4 not enough which why i purchased set through amazon . price right - even shipping - this set cheaper than local department stores . first , i'd like say my order arrived quickly however 2 plates broken . rather than just send replacement plates , amazon sent entire set - which also came broken plate so i sent back set 3 broken plates . what they these ? why not keep unbroken items replacements ? it would definitely cheaper shipping out individual items than entire sets ! dishes - i haven't seen any signs discolorings reported other reviewers . i like set sturdy but after using corelle many years it taken some time get adjusted it . i love size shapes plates , mugs bowls . bowls deep - perfect ice cream or cereal so deep it eliminates spills . mugs easy handle even hottest beverages inside . course , all pieces easy clean . color neutral - goes perfect my kitchen . can't wait add other pieces it	1

i ton research air filters before i purchased this one . this product not reviewed anywhere but here - which strange . said , only review positive one , which other machines reviewed air raid sirens or too expensive keep stocked filters . so , i figured , how bad could this one ? i've it 2 days , so i cant really give long-term review . however , i am pleased already . whether its actually working , or i believe its working so therefore its working , i am already sleeping better . i suffering terrible hay fever waking up stuffy noses , headaches , nose dryness , etc . past two nights , i've slept lot better . noise : low setting sounds like white-noise machine you might put baby room . its low hum , no clicking , constant low noise . it doesnt bother me . higher speeds definitely loud - but not like siren , or anything obtrusive . highest speed sounds like loud air conditioner doesnt shut off --- you turn up your tv slightly . said , i dont find it soo loud i am annoyed . smell : i've read these machines bad rubbery smell . first , this one slight rubber scent . it went away after one day running it one low . i dont smell anything now . cost : pre-filter $7 amazon i've read you dont replace it lot . i not bought hepa replacement , so i wont comment . size : instructions say you need 3 feet around it , so you cant really put it under table . its width nightstand , so i think its perfect corner room , but you it away wall . honestly , i'm so desperate breath , i don't really care it sticks out like sore thumb . if you really into things tucked away , you might want look into " tower " air filter . this one sits corner my bedroom , slightly away wall	1

i several rooms including my kitchen white shiny ceramic tile floors white grout . no matter what i used clean floor i dry it i cleaned most often within day or two it looked hazy or smeary . since using this steam vac i go well over week cleanings floor never looked better . steamer removes surface dirt grout , so if you're buying it primarily clean grout expect still use elbow grease or chemicals . it too messy practical cleaning windows it didn't very well cleaning soap film off shower door . it , however , very well mold . i also love it cleaning my jewelry silk plants my freshwater aquarium ! no more brown spots silk plants . best part all things i've mentioned -- no chemicals inhale or contaminate environment . unit sturdy , heats up quickly includes lot handy attachments .	1

i've used this washer 50 loads since buying jr early october , 2006 . i live studio new york bought this one because ( 1 ) it sink adapter , which front-loading 14.3 -lb model didn't seem include ( 2 ) 17.5 inches wide/deep , it fit through my bathroom door , which front-loading 14.3 -lb model ( 20.5 inches wide ) wouldn't . out box , you install included metal pan bottom . install it so it convex : there reason legs so high . one problems i during installation one screws holding this metal pan body comes very close clamp holding gooseneck drain tube it exits body . clamp fallen out position , end screw close where clamp goes . i don't think i ever danger puncturing drainage tube , but it something watch out . you need place hang drainage tube , 31.5 40 inches high . machine cannot fill tub water height above maximum height drainage path . my first two loads , i made puddle water ground . there two reasons this : first time , water supply hose not tightened sufficiently machine end , water dribbled out behind machine until i figured out what going . tightened ( i used wrench ) , there no leak . my second load , i put too many clothes ( more later ) there water-resistant nylon jacket top . just before very first spin cycle , some water cupped jacket not drain out wash water . when tub started spin , water came out . i never loaded many clothes into washer again , haven't any spills since . during normal wash cycle , machine following steps three times : fill , agitate , agitate , drain , spin , drain , spin , drain , spin . second third iterations called " rinse " cycle . often , water out drain still bubbly after second spin , i suspect i'm using too much detergent . ( i'm using quarter capful or less all no-fragrance 3x liquid concentrate . ) so , i run rinse cycle . if machine detects unbalance condition during spin , it stop , fill tub water , agitate attempt redistribute clothes before draining spinning again . i think machine this two or three times before giving up beeping ten times alert user unbalance condition . during agitation process , this machine tends intertwine long or extended parts clothing into braid-like knots . this includes shirt sleeves socks . example , when i wash four or five long-sleeved shirts together , i always untie separate two or three shirts where sleeves twisted together . i think good washing where wash water touch every surface clothes , tied together prevents this . these problems probably would not happen front-loading washing machine . what capacity this washer ? well , i would say : 2 bath towels ; or2 pairs jeans or pants ; or2 sweatshirts 1 pair sweat pants ; or4-5 long-sleeved oxford shirts ; or6 small-size undershirts ; or8-12 medium-size boxer underwear . that " high " water level . you may able load more than , but i think clothes won't get clean . i once tried wash terrycloth robe . robe fit tub , but machine always got unbalance condition when it tried spin . i think it sort like trying run centrifuge only one tube . sometimes after spin cycle i find sock or shirt stretched across middle tub , instead thrown centrifugally against tub walls . using my dsc-p71 digital camera multi-burst 30 frames-per-second mode light dark shirt washer , i estimate initial spin 450 rpm ( light shirt passed once every 4 frames ) final spin 780 rpm ( light shirt passed 6.5 times 0.5 seconds - once every other frame ) . if i hang clothes my studio ( not bathroom ) , then they dry one day or less , depending humidity . it takes much longer if i hang them bathroom	1

i not good pillow long time . i wouldn't pay upwards fifty dollars pillow . but i gave after reading reviews got this one . it way overpriced my opinion but they onto very good idea . first , i it couple weeks it pretty flat now . coils only very center pillow , times you notice them there , but not bad way , just noticable . problem fluff they add pillow must cheapest possible nothing . i imagine i really strange looking square blob surrounded moat flat fabric pretty soon . first , it really comfy . i think if they either put high quality fluff around it , or better yet put coils through entire thing , higher ones center , this would outstanding , beyond all other pillows ! but it , it not worth price yet . if you tons money burn , go ahead try it . i wouldn't recommend anyone get two sleep once , they would awkward they would falling off sides eachother . you could use regular pillow below this one , but then you back into same pillow finding - switching game we all want avoid . i would given three stars if it lot cheaper , but after going flat after only few weeks , price , i give it two	1

i just replaced my gaggia titanium which after 3 months decided break down . i decided rather than replace same machine go much-praised jura machines . z5 particularly appealed it unique one-touch cappucino function , which avoids clumsy looking " automatic frothing attachments " found so many machines . machine easy set up , almost same footprint titanium , so doesn't take up too much space . it comes classy looking thermal milk container ( 1 litre ) which keeps milk ready chilled up 8 hours . front machine brushed aluminium ( not plastic many jura machines ) which far easier keep clean than titanium brushed stainless steel ( fingerprints ! ) . display prompts clear ( product names such " 1 espresso " changed should you so desire - i personally can't see point this , since name isn't displayed until you press key dispense drink . temperature ( also adjustable ) coffee , hot water also milk fantastic - i mine set " normal " setting it very hot - much more so than titanium many other machines which even set " highest " still could hotter . crema good , taste great . brew group non-removable self-cleaning ( you prompted when run rinse cycle or pop cleaning tablet ) . you program quantity , temperature strength all drinks , choose override these on-the-fly should you wish , which very handy . water container larger than titanium most other domestic machines you use claris water filter cartridges , or alternatively opt use descaling tablets every so often ( again , you prompted when this ) . dump box , drip tray suitably large so not emptied too frequently ( every 20 cups ) . i only 2 grumbles this machine . one central coffee spout ( which illuminates cups during dispensing coffee ) not adjust high enough large mugs . silly thing you also dispense coffee cappuccino spout which offers 2 interchangeable spouts - one small cups one tall mugs . why they couldn't make central coffee spout raise same height shame , but not end world . my second gripe consumables - ie . filters / descaling tablets / cappuccino cleaner / machine cleaning tablets way over-priced . since you use jura-brand ones keep within warranty conditions , you don't much option but pay these high prices . overall though , if you money , then go it - this machine fantastic , looks great , quietest fully automatic far - this doesn't wake up whole house when you make coffee	1
we apricot tree my parents ' house my dad used love make frozen apricots . problem drying them however , they stick dehydrator sugars concentrate fruit . if you dried fruits ( we apples , pears peaches ) you know they stick normal trays . berries fall through . if you into dehydrating your produce , these tray inserts come out so you scrape off dried product wash them easily . i wish these jerky-fruit-leather sheets came dehydrator but they don't . if you grow vegetables fruits , this very useful processing your crop .	1

save yourself lot trouble don't buy this one ! first time i bought it , it worked 2 weeks , then decreased output due black paint flaking off nebulizer ( part makes mist ) . so i returned it bought one ... this one worked off week then never worked right after , despite my careful cleaning disinfecting , just like owners manual instructs . i use it my baby room ( very small room ) , after first week , couldn't get humidity above 20% . it just not dependable , which pain when she wakes up constantly throughout night sniffing fussing due dry air ! i just ordered vornado 2.8 gal cool mist humidifier ... hopefully work much better !	-1

great idea , just what i looking -- salt shaker lets you choose whether it fine shake , big shake , pouring ( recipes ) , or closed ( humid environments ) . great product	1
overall i dont any major complaints - seems great unit what i want it - humidify my house . i plan running it 24/7 during winter addition my furnace humidifier which isnt quite cutting it . this should help reduce filter problems since i wont standing water unit . assembled quickly - wheels not just gravity based like one review - they little rims make them stay bottom . i wouldn't recommend rolling it around like roller coaster but it gets job . based upon everything i read humidifiers some cleaning etc comes territory which i handle no problem . very simple filling water containers - you need deeper sink or tub fill them . i like fact it two so i run it low fan just fill one they easier(lighter ) carry . top removes easily replacement filters/cleaning unit which one nice selling points me(cheaper filters)i consider it run pretty quiet low medium fan settings - high noticable but if you want pump moisture into air over large area .. you it somehow . it blow cool air so keep mind . digital reading/setting humidity nice seems accurate long you dont crowd humidifier . not sure what i think ionizer feature - not like i measure air content see if it works but i it anyway . it make semi frequent gurgling noise it dispenses water into base it runs which one minor complaint it seems like unit could more " snug " when you put tanks but these very minor observations . i'm happy now - good luck	1

i love my dualit ! our old toaster died one sunday morning so monday i started searching new one . we cuisanart - i planned buying same brand toaster maybe just 4 slot version until i read reviews . one sale local department store ( $100)got miserable reviews amazon , so i searched searched searched only toaster got consistantly good reviews dualit . i ended up purchasing refurbished dualit website half price . i'm not one skimp kitchen appliances or gadgets , but spending over $200 toaster seemed bit extreme . now i've received it i've decided it worth every penny . if it breaks tomorrow , i'd definitely run right out spend pay full price replace it . i love fact operates completely different than any other toaster out there . it best preheat it - but once you you put pieces bread one right after consistant results . none problems you w/american toasters when they get heated where first piece perfect , next too light , next comes out more like piece bread so . other thing i love fact you raise lower bread when timer goes off , versus american toasters where you push toast down activate toaster . stupid push button/latch mechanism death every toaster i've ever owned . i playing couple cuisanarts department store both units it broken - just store use , let alone actual use ! now back price again . my sister who doesn't appreciate good kitchenware swears cheap toasters because she " replace them every couple years when something breaks " . i started think back my old cuisanart i loved . i received it shower gift when we married 8 years ago time it $60 . it great toaster if you averaged it out it cost $8 year own . so - given , if i replaced cheap toaster every other year , i doubt i could find $16 toaster even discount store would last more than year . hopefully i haven't cursed my dualit but if so , like i said earlier , i'd replace it full priced non-refurbished any day . buy one , you'll happy you .	1
when these mugs arrived , i surprised see how gorgeous they . color ( cobalt ) , glaze , shape , weight , generous handle - all perfect ! they even fit under spout my senseo coffeemaker . great mugs , i love them !	1
i surprised what poor reviews most crock pots received amazon.com, but i decided buy this little one when i saw it target $9.99 . figured even if it didn't work well , that not much money lose ! well , this my first crock pot i love it . i'm glad there one this small . i usually fill it only half way then leftovers , but it could probably feed family four without leftovers . lot reviews other crock pots said lids often fit poorly , but lid mine perfect . i've used it seven times so far everything wonderful ! i particularly like applesauce recipe comes crock pot , it makes best applesauce ever it nice just peel them night before wake up hot applesauce ( also good over ice cream ) . keep mind crock pot only low heat setting , but i haven't any trouble cooking recipes call high setting here . just takes bit longer . also , it not tough all convert recipes larger crocks fit this one . mine doesn't any problem cooking hot , maybe it just other reviewer crock pot . i would recommend this anyone , it well worth money	1

my wife bought this one best buy without me reviewing it 1st . amazingly , i would bought it after reading reviews here . i'm starting wonder who writes these things ... lg employees ? microwave fine - no complaints . toaster , however , unmitigated disaster . i am opinion you should rarely combine appliances - this appliance poster child this thought . toaster browns extremely unevenly inconsistently ( sometimes you should toast same piece bread 5 sometimes high 10 ! ) . more importantly , toaster broke after 31 days ( coincidently best buy return policy ends same time - best buy unacceptable return policy but guy named " ricky " managing store what you expect ? ) . lg picks up phone quickly they honor warranty . problem they can't think outside box . they me get it repaired but i inconveniently drive it out there pick it up - ok ... no problem . one day later ? it breaks again . it extremely poorly built appliance repair people thought they fixed it not . that how bad it . lg not budge - it repaired again ( great option - costs lg money , me more travel time , it won't job ) or rebate . rebate requires me buy lg or goldstar product . huh ? so you create shoddy product rush it marketplace ( they admitted they don't detailed enough repair history because it too new ) then don't stand behind your product . you backend me into lg or goldstar product i would not otherwise bought . how our government allow these atrocious foreign companies business here ? our we so bad manufacturer we can't top this ? their supervisors very hardlined there no getting around this . " you cal korea but they won't change their policy " they said . i never willingly buy lg or goldstar product i highly recommend you same . shame you lg - you could me appliance buyer next 50 years now your name mud me	-1
this very powerful handheld vacuum cleaner . if you just need clean up loose this like salt or cracker crumbs it perform great . should you actually try use beater brush attachment you very dissappointed . i bought this cleaner purpose cleaning my curtians stairs . i own two cats virtually all my in-laws allergic them . everytime they come , i clean house top bottom . my upright vacuum ( dirt devil vision lite model 008650 ) weighs ton not designed use stairs . i thought this little cleaner might just trick . brush worked great first several times i used it . but after 20 uses it began slow down . i cleaned it very thoroughly but never saw initial performance again . eventually , it stopped working all . i urge you buy something else , if beater brush selling point you	-1

i bought this make meaty stews rice my dogs . it works while then stops working , or just goes warm . they replaced it three times -- everytime it went out . this seems common cheap rice cookers -- see reviews rival rcs 200 , they all go out within days or weeks ! i guess black decker rival used same chinaman design these useless things . i can't understand why amazon et al still selling these when obviously they not work . companies replace them but all replacements go out immediately . frustration i bought aroma 60-cupper $125 -- after two months also went out . any suggestions 20-cup rice cooker longevity would appreciated	-1

first off , this machine looks great . but unfortunately , that where attraction ends . you see , i too used little krups $45 espresso machine years . but it heck lot easier use , made consistently better espresso/cappucinno than this dog . here brief synopsis . reservoir holds enough water just couple days . i'm constantly refilling it . after making espresso , thing leaks out coffee drippings minutes end , making mess whole machine . steamer seems spurt out much water it steam . lever dispenses steam not move fluid fashion . positioning coffee holder pod thingy downright cumbersome . i mention thing leaks ? now you might forgive little bugger if it made amazing capuccino ............... it doesn't	-1

well after reading reviews this vacuum , i decided give it try . i it month now i say i am sorry i bought this behemoth . right out box trying it first time i noticed things i didn't like . i thought i ' give it some time though hoped i could adjust . here what i found : 1 . vacuum very heavy other reviewers stated . 2 . worse than vacuum heavy , darn thing really hard push . even hard smooth surfaces it hard push . i not figured out yet what heck would cause it so much drag . it drag hard surfaces , it must design flaw . 3 . on/off power switch foot operated . not terrible thing but dirt devil decided put darn thing out view hidden accessory carriage . my first time vacuuming i accidentally ran over sock it got caught floor brush . while brush belt smoking i fumbled around damn power switch . i finally reach down press switch hand because i couldn't find it looking down . it must taking me eight ten seconds finally turn thing off . unfortunately , damage . belt snapped . how nice . i really liked . first time out belt snapped . note switch ; there times i repeatedly press switch because it would not lock off . it takes firm steady pressure turn it off . fun part this annoyance you think you it turned off because motor starts winding down soon you let up it motor powers up . couple not able really see darn thing it real challenge . maybe dirt devil thinks we eyes our toes . hey dirt devil here idea . how putting on/off switch push handle . what novel idea . doh ! 4 . vacuum hose detaches really unwieldy . it long plastic handle you hold onto makes it really difficult manipulate hose . main reason hose it too short . it like you fighting hose all time . it gets tiring . 5 . detachable hose really hard re-install it port . you wedge it there really hard get thing seat . 6 . vacuum terrible rugs , any floor height settings . it bunches up rugs starts smoking baby . my old vac not much better but least old one i could lift vac kind drag it over rug it wouldn't get all caught up . i tried same thing dirt devil forget it . it jammed up every time . 7 . vacuum poor getting dirt off hard surface floors . it just moves dirt around or spits it out back . i use hose attachment . 8 . vacuum horrible steps . my old vac i could drag vac across each step whilst vacuum locked upright position . easy deal . dirt devil not work way . when vacuum upright position brush too high off carpet any good . only option disengage lock vacuum back slanted . one little problem . weight vac cause seal base dirt canister open air begins leaking . you don't get good positive suction . so , you play position tilt get proper seal . problem proper position you need so close where vacuum locks into upright position . it often locks so then you try un-lock it while balancing this heavy behemoth . it joke . only half easy way steps if use detachable hose attach power brush . only problem you fighting ill designed hose heavy vacuum , not mention brush attachment only really get surface dirt . if you try putting pressure some deep cleaning brush stops . now pros : 1 . vacuum seem get carpets pretty clean . it good suction it raises carpet fibers right up . it almost makes my carpet look like new , i not see excessive amount carpet fibers dirt canister . some vacuums like just tear up carpets . 2 . rotating brush attachment works pretty good removing cat hair off couches bedding . all all this vacuum very very poorly designed . i may just donate this thing buy something else . i can't imagine fighting this thing every week years come or until motor dies . maybe i'll lucky motor die soon . then i'll just throw darn thing out buy something other than dirt devil . steve	-1

apparently 3rd hierarchy 4 models new s5 series miele vacuum cleaners , features , price , accessories not exactly linear transition lower higher models , nor even across series . many older series models more features higher price than newer ones . they fancy names like capricorn , red velvet , champagne , leading much confusion forcing you compare each one similar buying car . if your browser tabbed browsing ( e.g. , firefox ) , best way figure out which model best you go miele website open tab each model you're interested . flip back forth see what text changes . callisto cheapest no frills model newest series ( newest technology motor ? ) still comes electronically powered brush ( 4th pisces model turbo ) . after 3 months extensive use : pros : agility - 10 � " wide seb217-3 electric powerbrush comes standard , one reasons i chose this model . me , smaller better . while other vacuums advertise large 13 " power brushes cover more area single swipe , i don't much open carpet space . coffee tables , chairs , weight benches , computers , all need vacuuming around under . powerbrush swivels well get around corners . brush duster - most commonly used attachment ( me ) , brush duster also small ( slightly larger diameter than hose ) bristles durable . it angled default , but even this plastic piece swivels straighten out . this not mentioned anywhere ; you just figure this out yourself . low power , i able vacuum places never got vacuumed before , like over spider web computer cables telephone wires . i even vacuumed telephone itself other dust collecting objects my desk . parquet floor brush - initially , i wondered why miele would include this accessory when powerbrush included , but this " wider brush duster " actually better job hard tiled floors than powerbrush . powerbrush seems more designed churn up stuff carpets , but paraquet brush gathers collects dust stuck hard surfaces better . negative side , you might vacuum brush itself unstuck dust , i wondered why they inconvenience horse " genuine horse bristles " . there no permanent storage vacuum cleaner parquet brush , so you figure out how ensure parts don't get separated life ( powerbrush takes precedence ) . cord rewind - mechanical rewind sucked entire length cord every single time , something like 15 15 times ! ( manual says pull out entire length cord before use help dissipate heat . ) cons : price - after all , it just vacuum cleaner . there also seems price fixing newer s5 series , least when i bought this . everywhere i checked ( maybe 10 websites ) , price exactly $799 or $799.95 , only difference no tax and/or free shipping . one website even advertised " lowest price allowed ! " what diamond dealer ? this amway ? release buttons - release buttons attachments hose counterintuitive , part " comes off " rather than part " stays behind " . therefore , you must squeeze button same hand you pulling away . hose extension button particularly confusing . it oval shaped rocker button " rocks " very little . extend stainless steel hose , you remember which side button ( top or bottom ) press . there no distinction which side press , it always matter trial error i yank tug hose while pressing top bottom extension button . stiff no swivel hose - hose rotates top ( handle area ) , but not swivel base where it connects machine . instead disconnecting reconnecting get rid twists , i'd rather pick up powerhead spin it around get out twists . flex hose diameter larger than i'm used , making hose stiffer difficult store same closet where i used store my old vacuum cleaner . considering price , electrical slip ring would nice . bag full indicator - mechanical bag full indicator actually indicator how much vacuum cleaner straining suck . put your hand over end block suction it indicate bag full . right out box short carpet , it indicated bag full high power . i turned power down , it indicated less full sequentially . you read instructions using floor tool tool slightly off floor get accurate reading indicator . even , there caveats fine dust or pet hair fool indicator . extra stuff ? - parquet brush comes attached short plastic extension difficult plug directly into stainless steel hose ( button doesn't easily click into place ) . extension isn't needed connect parquet brush , so you remove it keep track where you put it . this day , i still haven't figured out what extension , other than connect other attachments i might buy future . this yet piece no place store vacuum cleaner i must ensure not get separated life ( parquet brush , " normal " filter cage , replacement bags ) . symbol marking - power symbol markings not obvious all , contrary claims . other than symbols labels " min " " max " , you read instructions figure out what other power symbols mean . least power seems increase sequentially you turn dial clockwise . quite mode #4 6 settings ( 6 highest ) , therefore not actually quietest but intended " normal " operating mode . i think most people consider " max " default mode . optional filter frame - this model comes hepa filter , so you don't need filter frame unless you're going switch " normal " filters , but brand-new right out box frame normal filters came broken cheap plastic handle , apparently due way it shipped handle protruding out cardboard wrapping . you don't even need handle frame function properly , but kind money i paid , nothing should broken out box . vendor i bought it ( best vacuum ) replaced it free . so it worth $800 ? it good job , but only time tell ..	1
what people don't think how hot chocolate works just well coffee coffee mug . i'm not coffee drinker but if this mug brings you great coffee joy you should also pour hot chocolate it . i take point off because after you pour coffee this mug enough times permanent smell left there , which means using this cup anything other than coffee or hot chocolate gross . especially water . who wants take sip water only smell coffee every time you put mug your face ? not me . not smell coffee horrible or anything . it smells good i can't imagine not smelling it every morning when other people my home making some . great mug you should buy .	1

i old beagle who decided her dotage she would bark when ever she didn't get her way , she becoming intolerable , barking all hours night , disturbing everyone around . she extremely fragile , heart condition , i felt shock collar could kill her . i admit i very skeptical this spray collar but i desperate , anyone who owned beagle know they difficult best train . so i tried collar , i am very happy report it works , tallys barking returned its normal level , which infrequent , it happened quickly , within few days , we followed directions box , which very important , good results . i can't promise this work every dog , but it worked well ours , without resorting shocks . i don't think you just hang this collar your dog expect it work , although i ocassionaly tally refresh her training , i feel it very important training outlined instructions , you get results fairly quickly . i am quite satisfied this product	1

i bought bark stop 2 weeks ago . i read several reviews either really good or really bad so i quite skeptical , but my dog ( jack russell terrier ) would bark rays sunlight coming into house , so i desperate . most important thing remember when buying product like this there aren't many things both great easy . when you buy treats dog train him , you simply leave treats out all time . no . because he would never figure out treats reward doing what you wanted him . it same thing bark stop . first thing you should this device put it audible setting then test see what makes bark stop actually go off . i found doors shutting hard , clanging dishes , etc all set it off . so , if device goes off every 5 seconds , dog isn't going think second it going off because he barking . he going assume it uncontrollable sound he live . so after putting device back into ultrasonic sound setting , i decided i would only plug device when dog barking or when he his cage . also , i never leave device plugged when i'm doing dishes slamming doors , or doing loud things . so dog only hears device when he barks . i realize this might slight annoyance walk egg shells order make sure device works , but i would rather than barking dog . way i look it , i wouldn't just randoming throw my dog treats middle his training , so why leave it plugged all time . end , first time i plugged bark stop , i let dog bark it out . he barked 5 minutes ( normally 10-15 ) then stopped . second time i plugged it , he didn't bark more than twice . bark stop puts out ultrasonic beep when you plug it , so i think now he knows when he going hear more than he wants . i think dog now gotten more used it , try out bark it , but most part , he doesn't bark much all while it , if he barks all . one thing manual say if dog trying protect house , usually this device won't help , which i think good thing . cons : when i testing microphone ( used taking bark loudness ) device , it didn't seem matter if microphone high or low . also , this device would so much more useful if it came remote turn or off , not manage each bark , but simply able sit couch click it , or click it off	1

i entire set swiss diamond addition this pan . i bought swiss diamond because , due weak wrists , i needed sturdy cookware not heavy stainless steel . because aluminum primary , affordable , lighter-weight alternative , one not want food coming contact aluminum because possible leaching it into food , i sought non-stick pans coating would not flake or scratch off end up my food . after much research , i discovered swiss diamond . i not disappointed . pans great weight -- hefty without too heavy , after several months use , coating holding up beautifully . i confess i not primarily use metal utensils it , however , so i can't testify how they hold up against metal . these pans caramelize food beautifully , evenness heat distribution them pure joy . they take few extra seconds heat up , but hold heat very well . i really love how flat pan bottom , imagine if you flush electric cooktop , these would especially appreciated . though i gas range , i trouble past pots pans slipping sliding enameled grates , but these pans not slide . i delighted discover , after realizing i accidentally left this pan low heat hour no food it , it not warp all still perfect condition . this cookware cleans up easily perfectly , too . i love they coated outside walls pans so any dried or cooked food comes off outside easily inside . one thing note if you looking pan cook eggs without oil , this may not your best choice . texture diamond coating seems grab more than slick teflon pan would , first time i tried flip my fried eggs without spatula , i less than stellar results . but sufficient oil , i flip eggs without spatula or problem ( i need make my daily quota coconut oil anyway health reasons , so i'm fine putting oil pan ) . if you use spatula , you should easily able flip eggs without oil . i hope these pans turn out durable over years . so far , after few months , they aces ! fact , my husband may growing weary my exclaiming , " i love this cookware ! " over over again .	1

there aren't any wine glasses out there i prefer over riedel vinum series ( except sommelier course ) . i one observation though , this why i didn't give this glass 5 star rating : vinums i've purchased past 5 months don't seem up same quality standards vinums i purchased year ago . quot ; olderquot ; vinum , which logo etched base , better/cleaner cut rim bowl seems thinner - making entire glass look , feel sound more elegant . quot ; newquot ; vinum , which logo quot ; riedelquot ; name etched base , lip which looks slightly rounded side-by-side comparison quot ; olderquot ; glass bowl/glass itself seems thicker . maybe riedel made some changes improve durability , but i like my old riedels better . all all , i said beginning this review , there nothing better out there than riedel vinum series ( long you don't pay full retail ) ...	1

" statement not make any sense . i am going attempt get this matter resolved through amazon . if they can't help i out one hundred dollars . their product overpriced but i thought if it worked , it would worth money . what wrong this world . most people just care all mightly dollar . i make sure when i order kitchenware or appliance again it not kitchen kraft doing business bethany housewares again !!!!!! boiling arizona !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!	-1
i decided " upgrade " spend more toaster , too . first one not work properly - one wires holds toast didn't move lever toast tilted one side burned . my second one - wires work but it not toast evenly all ! half time portions burned , even lower setting 3-4 . i don't see it whole lot faster , either . i've gone through half/loaf bread testing it i am not happy . i appreciate reviews amazon checked here see comments this product . it looks like two good reviews year ago , so perhaps manufacturing gotten sloppy . but my old , cheap , unattractive toaster better job than this ! i exchange it again or forget it ?	-1

i agree previous reviewer : this sharpest , most well made chinese chef knife out there . however , i guarantee you won't find this knife any authentic chinese kitchen because this knife just too expensive . if you want get good chinese chef knife , you should buy high-carbon stainless dexter-russell cleaver ( costs around $40 ) . it only slighly less sharp but difference not noticeable , especially if you chopping rather than slicing . there nothing wrong shun knife ; it just way too overpriced . it just knife , no mass-produced kitchen knife worth $170 , no matter how sharp it	1

after shopping carefully online off , i bought this item jc penney march 25 , 2006 . penney stated regular price $69.99 , sale price $49.99 , same price amazon currently charging . it replaces 10-year old black decker , primarily because i read several reviews suggesting dramatic drop quality bd small kitchen appliances hamilton beach performing well . i also several other hamilton beach small appliances all them function well what they designed . this seemed my best choice reasonably priced toaster oven , since i am not looking cheap convection oven , just acceptable toaster large enough baking potato now then or some other small item too large or wrong shape slot-style toaster . shopping i found no current toaster ovens lever press toasting - all now some variation twist dial this purpose . it ( so far ) performing acceptably oven , though top gets very hot . however , only first few uses produced acceptable toast even darkest toast setting . toast set dark got lighter lighter now , only three weeks after purchase , it no longer toasts all . it not darken beyond palest coloring toasting second time leaves bread only drier , not all darker . top elements not seem heat properly not reach red color needed toast bread ... or presumably broil anything , though i haven't ( won't ) use it broiler . hot top gets regular oven use , i am not confident it would safe broiler , even if upper heating elements working . three weeks post-purchase i no toasting capability all . i fully expect rest oven cease functioning soon , regardless , it no practical use me toaster , which small appliance i want need . i am returning it store starting search toaster oven over again scratch .	-1

this solid coffee machine . it makes great froth . unlike previous reviwer , i no problems froth attachment . trick make sure it assembled correctly froth correctly . make froth , keep turbo frother up close surface . you actually see frother suck milk hear hissing . heat up milk without making much froth , make sure frother below surface so you no longer making froth but heating milk instead . machine quality parts , big water tank , powerful pump , separate controls steaming making coffee , cup warmer ( which you probably don't need because there more efficient ways hear cups ) . it easy clean . i would only recommend getting decent coffee grinder , obviosuly one allows you adjust how fine you grind beans	1
these essentially bowls professional quality riedel vinum glasses produced without stems . doing without stems you get glass neatly fits dishwasher , save $10 per glass compared stemmed riedel . i using reidel o series several years they fabulous . since they genuine crystal opposed glass , they develop bouquet much better ( due microscopic " pores " regular glass lacks ) . they really gleam , right out dishwasher . best all , rims thin smooth , which luxury feel premium glassware all . if you wondering which buy " all purpose " red glass , i prefer syrah/shiraz glass over cabernet/merlot or pinot noir/nebbiolo , even though i drink mostly cabernet . syrah glass just bit taller more graceful than cabernet or pinot noir glasses brings out flavors aromas all red varietals quite well . but honestly , since all glasses well made , differences pretty minor if you like one shape more than , it fine . i wine " nut " over 20 years , these glasses teriffic . buy them , feel safe using them daily . they improve enjoyment every wine you drink , gallo lafite	1

i my rocky doserless grinder nearly nine months i never regretted purchase . this one premier prosumer grade coffee grinders delivers consistent quality espresso through drip ( almost ) up press pot . it solid , relatively quiet - i use mine my office small university close my door muffle noise little more - great option grinding each individual shot espresso . plus , its compact form factor mechanical-cool look mean rocky sit corner my desk , next gaggia factory lever machine it serves . highlights rocky its solidity quality , its ease adjustment , case this doserless model , its ability grind each dose espresso or brew minimal holdover grounds . because path burrs chute so short unobstructed , i rap side when i am dislodge any leftover grounds , or simply remove two screws holding chute use brush clear it . metal hoop below perfect holding gaggia or pavoni portafilter when grinding , removed one quick tug allow you grind into filter , press pot , or bag . rocky weight keeps it steady - it no flimsy lightweight - i personally like power switch grind switch separated doserless model . grind switch front convenien t.t he only things keeping rocky getting five stars grind settings . coarse end adjustment , rocky just doesn't quite make it real french press grind . this issue noted coffeegeek reviews which i didn't care when i bought machine , but which i now wish i considered . also , this niggling point , grind adjustments stepped , not stepless . perfect world , i like think all grinders should stepless like mazzer mini i occasionally get play . said , steps close enough i not found problem getting grind i desire , system release button collar adjusts burrs slick simple . if you market top end consumer coffee grinder , take good long look doserless rocky . when mazzer mini would overkill ( overpriced ) , but you want something closer commercial grade than solis maestro , rocky hits sweet spot	1

bonjour coffee press mentioned magazine ( maybe esquire ? ) top pick after little more research , we purchased 8-cup version . we ( our dinner guests ) loved it so much , we decided get 12-cup version . here why we like it : 1 ) container looks really nice table . we get lots compliments it . 2 ) we've it over 3 years now , use it daily , haven't single problem . i've read glass shattering or burning yourself w/other models , but we've fine . we often put it top rack our dishwasher normal dishwashing cycle , too . 3 ) it fairly easy clean , all parts unscrew if you want give it thorough washing . 4 ) probably all french presses , we feel like we get more flavor per scoop coffee . delicious coffee !! here some tips : 1 ) we grind our coffee store " french press " setting so it coarser . we measure coffee scoops , but not really water anymore since you get used just looking color mixture or how far you normally fill it . we use wooden spoon ( wooden chopsticks bbq skewers also work well ) stir grinds/water mixture - this helps prevent glass breaking if you accidentally hit glass . 2 ) i'd recommend getting this larger 12-cup version . mentioned product description it comes out 4-5 mugs coffee - this because " cups " they refer really teacup sized . this true all brands when they say " 12-cup , " not just bonjour . larger size gives you flexibility make little or lot depending your needs . 3 ) you also use this steeping tea . handy loose leaf teas aren't bags since you just press it down end	1

i've mine two years now absolutely love it . i primarily use it my protein drinks morning , it traveled all over u.s. canada me . only drawbacks beginning ( 1 ) others mentioned , it large took some getting used compared my old corded hand blender , ( 2 ) instructions side (' press button attach/detach ' ) misleading ; it not necessary press button connect pieces , first one i felt like connections got stripped when i tried so . fortunately , retailer permitted exchange replacement . attach segments , simply push them together it work fine . you need press button separate segments , it tricky pop out plug recharge it without breaking nail first , but once you get hang it this wonderful appliance	1

when i received this item i immediatley knew something would wrong . box it packaged delivered open torn up . not open like someone opened it i mean it sent box no bottom no side , just taped together styrofoam . i opened it thought well it maybe ok , this big item send . right front wheel off balance rest so whole machine wobbles , back panel puncture marks it off level rest machine . i thought jeez what i bought . so i thought well i hook it up use it , see how it . it ran beautifully cleaned my dishes cleaner than i ever seen them . point i thought well damage back wheel doesn not cause it wobble while it running so i just grateful i finally dishwasher . i unhooking it sink ball bearings hold connector piece place fell out down my sink . so i spent 2 days trying call company get replacement piece or something . nothing no answer all .... even during times they say they office there still no answer . so i searched online stores this piece . nowhere !!! danby not even registered sears or maytag ar any big dishwasher supplier matter . hell all actual plumbing repair stores not piece i needed . i told over over again , no one really uses hook up anymore ma'am , or " wow what ancient piece " . so i went online order $90.00 hose hook up ge . once it came i realized it not compatble this danby dishwasher . so i spent week trying call danby still no answer . finally my husband cut tubes dishwasher used hose clamps metal nipples piece dishwasher hoses new ge hookup together . i go out buy new adapter my sink danby one not work ge . but now dishwasher works it still cleans beautifully . ge hookup made little plastic nudules cannot fall out instead ball bearings which if you not careful fall down your sink . so i would liked give this product 1 or even 0 based customer service ( none ) way item packaged way it arrived so damaged , but dishwasher slean so very well . you dont even rinse plates before you put them they still come out sparkly . so all all i would never ever buy them again . if you add up cost dishwasher shipping , plus all money it took repair it , i could gotten much higher quality dishwasher no problems all less than what this dishwasher cost me end .	-1

i little sceptical buying non-stick , i am previous stainless steel user , but i really like hard anodized non-stick surface . it so much better than other non-stick cookware i've used/seen . it durable very easy clean . i cook electric stove , this set heats up so well evenly , i don't really miss gas stove , use lower temperature because way they transfer heat . i also love i need little no butter or oil cook , usually just use them flavor now . i wish lids saucepans fit omlette/frying pans . i've only set little over month , not used them oven , but so far i am very satisfied product	1

wish i heeded advice most reviewers before i purchased this . i went ahead purchased this because it replacing braun coffee maker we 10 - 15 years . after it got new plastic taste out it , it made good coffee . even without brita filter . just like all reviewers indicated , carafe leaked spilled badly unless you poured very slowly carefully . unfortunately , it quit working after only 2 1/2 months . seller , etronics , declining anything it saying it now outside their 30 return period . last thing i buy through them . like uhh , since they sell braun , one would think they would some recourse through braun try help their customers . so , here i am proverbial rock hard place , try find braun warranty center wait it get repaired or replaced , or just bite bullet go buy . ( want bet it won't braun ? ) additionally , what we coffee mean time ? such hazards purchasing electric appliance internet	-1

i wanted more comfortable bed so i purchased this comforter . i've found i sleep alot longer than before . getting out bed difficult . if you're looking moderately affordable down comforter high quality , this item suit you just fine . i met girl really comfortable bed . it made my own bed really unimpressive so i bought this comforter . made huge difference . i notice edges comforter more down fill than center . it seemed little odd but while sleeping its hard notice . i think how these made . you price other comforters , some cost $500-$4000 . less than $200 this comforter terrific value . high quality , 15 year warranty . recommendable . sure get duvet cover . my pit bull now sleeps floor ! i used coupon code hohosave it covered shipping tax .	1

i bought this item based various reviews here other sites . usually , when majority reviews lean one way , i find they tend correct . this time ? wrong wrong wrong !!! this veggie cutter cheap piece cr*p ! it may ok if all you want cut soft veggies , but if you want cut potatoes french fries , dont bother unless you want blow $20 plus shipping . mine lasted less than 2 months before it fell apart . complete waste my money . i high hopes based upon reviews i read this product , but i lead down ( potato ) garden path . cutting potatoes ( main reason i bought this ) quite chore . i place it floor towel get really good leverage enable me cut my potatoes . main product plastic working parts less than sturdy steel rods . i am really disappointed this product . if you planning cutting potatoes or other hard veggies , then please not waste your money . many people rated this item very high their reviews . i really cant believe these people cut potatoes this . this product just not sturdy enough job !! i write this review hopes i save others throwing their money away searching good french fry cutter . if you choose ignore my warning it breaks you ( which it ... sooner or later ... probably sooner ) , yes , me you hear saying " i told you so " . caveat emptor !	-1

like previous reviewer , we've also gone through several rake-type automatic cat litter boxes ( all litter maid brand ; 2 lm700 , 1 lme9000 ) two which failed after one year , third simply worked so poorly we couldn't wait get rid it . we'd spent enough those three buy litter robot some change left over . spending so much automatic litter box may seem silly some folks , but my wife i travel lot work can't half-dozen litter boxes laying our two cats , nor we wish spend time cleaning all them after we get home . so anyway , machine ... litter robot big ! i'd read measurements , but when i pulled it out box i still surprised ! make sure you've got room it . my first impression it after size it heft . this thing sturdy , nothing cheap it . all interior parts heavy well assembled rivets or screws , well shell . next thing i noticed simplicity . no complicated moving parts like some boxes rakes , lids , etc ... ; motor turns ball , that all you see , drive gear hidden below ball . item assembled flash : put ball base , line up gear , plug power , turn . that it . i filled it standard scoopable/clumping kitty litter . only error i made i overfilled it little it dumped some litter floor when i test cycled it . no problem , clean up mess take few scoops litter out . overall impression device it good quality should provide good service years . my only faint potential misgivings motor , circuitry rubber liner . if any these fail , i hope company still around get replacement parts . i also note no large benefit litter catcher step other than catching some my overfill . when our cats finished box they launched out door land floor , they still scatter litter . oh well , nothing new there compared regular box . cats . we switched boxes them cold turkey . our cats aren't very skittish but they don't take quickly new large devices smell funny make odd noises . they spent lot time sniffing it checking it out , but they refused use it . they held out 24 hours they couldn't stand it any more ; we observed cat equivalent crossed legs jumping up down few hours before they hopped ( meowing , walking up box looking inside , walking away , pacing , repeat ... ) , but soon one hopped used it , other couldn't wait stood door jumped soon other left . problem solved , they now litter robot converts . overall , so far we very happy it . we got over " sticker shock " size , cats got used it less than day . litter robot works exactly it supposed , we hope years serivce it . much better quality device than any rake-type litter boxes we . it leaves no bits floating litter after cycle , needs no hand cleaning after few days like rake-type boxes . we'd recommend this box . now i just resist painting it look like eva vehicles " 2001 : space odyssey " ; " open pod bay doors , please , hal ... open pod bay doors , please , hal ...	1

i bought this popular online auction $25 , but i didn't know what i getting into . buy this only if you accept following : good : other writer reported , suction unit superior , esp compared uprights hose attachments . cord pullout retract again , superior . better than my electrolux ... bad : hose extension wands proprietory , , don't expect use your old crevise brush attachments all superior suction . you can't attach crevice tool end one wands . you need attach crevice tool order put brush . gimicky . furthermore , wands fly apart unless you jam them hard . unit lacks beater-bar . don't expect this any value carpeting . on/off switch small could positioned better . no turning this guy on/off your foo t.t he bagless design old-school . it uses same permanent coffee filter design that around years years , you see it clog up no time . superior suction compensate , but you'd think after dyson solved problem one way , others would soon follow . not case here . but real bug release dirt compartment part handle . real careful picking this guy up or dirt go flying all over ( down stairs ! ) . who would think someone would pick thing up handle ? however , i should say suction very good if you don't need carpet cleaning , never want use your own cleaning attachments use it under limited circumstances , it not bad deal price . i use it cleaning out computers . all all , however , except those limited circumstances , very soon after buying this you'd realize you should paid little more gotten something you use long term .	-1

i bought this ( black ) williams sonoma over $100 - thought i'd spend extra $ thinking i getting quality item would last . . . boy i wrong , wrong , wrong ! my cheap mr. coffee lasted longer than this thing ! day 1 - plastic smelled sooo bad it turned taste my coffee into cupful plastic , chemical waste - after cleaning/ running vinegar through last 4 - 5xthroughout - it nothing but leak , flooding my kitchen counter every time i wanted cup coffee - less then six months later leaking got so bad it ready garbage . one last attempt before deep sixin ' it - figured maybe seal water measure just need jiggle . . . w/ hardly any pressure - thing jiggled right off coffee maker into my hand b/c plastic so brittle . coffee also doesn't get all hot cools very quickly - even ' thermal carafe ' which perfect if you like lukewarm coffee turns ice cold after adding cream2 stars looks alonemay better off/cheaper buying couple disposable $40 coffee makers , replacing them every 6 mo	-1
i wanted love this toaster , i really , i read all reviews convinced this would great working , long lasting toaster . i bit bullet , spent way more money than i wanted , ordered this toaster . i like way it looks i like it doesn't ' pop-up ' , you check toast anytime you want return it toasting cool lever . however , i wish i returned it . it slow , it pain plug before each use ( must unplugged when not used ) , worse all : it not toast evenly ! top burnt , bottom not even toasted all , or one slice perfect other slice like it never put into toaster . this toaster would waste money $9.99 , it should illegal charge $200 . it . said , amazon price 200 . better deal than william sanoma 299 ., but i am still sooooo disappointed this purchase . upon re-reading other reviews i find people purchased ' refurbished ' models seem more pleased their purchase . leads me wonder if upon ' refurbishing ' they making them better somehow	-1
this pot easy use , convenient , compact , good looking great investment	1
braun aroma deluxe kf550 very good small appliance company generally associated better than average quality . not all braun products exemplary , but majority them easily better than competition price reflects higher level quality . this coffee maker braun looks nice stylish ; offers some extra bells whistles my most coffee maker don't ; carries braun name- brand name i grown know trust . i like added features braun aroma deluxe kf550 offers , like permanent filter , pause serve feature , brita water filter . each these items helps make process simpler smoother than before added feature brita filter not only helps brew better tasting coffee , it also helps keep coffee maker clean . purified water means less calcification means less cleaning vinegar or other decalcifying agents . i really like permanent coffee filter but there one drawback i noticed : tendency coffee granules get into pot brewed coffee . permanent filter nice but depending how finely ground coffee , it cause problems . example , if coffee ground very fine , like powder , it may end up seeping through permanent filter dripping into coffee pot , leaving murky mess bottom each cup coffee . other potential problem overflow . depending size grinds , they clog permanent filter cause basket overflow , transferring grounds coffee into your cup making small mess kitchen counter . one thing braun aroma deluxe kf550 doesn't offer ability program . this could deal breaker many consumers it little surprising braun doesn't include this its list features . it offers just everything else you could want coffee maker but there no ability program no clock . personally , i no use feature like this why i decided exclude it my list requirements when i went shopping coffee maker . its price , this coffee maker more expensive than most but i think price fair , even if it doesn't include programming . overall , i am happy my braun aroma deluxe kf550 . it brews tasty cup coffee without any fuss it offers ability stop brewing cycle order pour quick cup well security knowing coffee maker automatically shut off two hours . i few question marks this device- durability questions only answered due time . but i like what i seen thus far i recommend this appliance anyone who wants better cup coffee .	1

i too read all reviews ... i spent several hours , so let me save you trouble . this item sturdy , washable , compact , grinds beans anywhere 4-12 cups coffee . i use it both my 2 cup french press my percolator , when my mill brew coffee maker , which i two carafs 3 baskets , busy . we really get into coffee here - i must 10 varieties beans freezer . it also fabulous job grinding hazelnuts very fine cookie dough where hazelnuts , effect , part flour . i love grinder basket top go dishwasher , little brush stowed back thoughtful utilized addition . only drawback would if you only making 2 cups coffee you want course grind , you let machine think you're making 8 cups , moving cup setting , this machine intended grind beans minimum 4 cups . when i make enough coffee my percolator , i get intermediate course grind no problem . what sold me this : after i read all reviews i went my local " megamart , " found grinders , opened up boxes makes i wanted compare , i literally took things apart put them back together . like reviewer warned , stay away those other grinders tiny ( you barely see them ) plastic pins engage start button . once those bits plastic break off , you're sol . this very reasonably priced maker which i've 6 months . i love it so much , much time i've felt just bit guilty i hadn't yet praised this maker amazon . - it time grind some beans . :) enjoy . ps : it looks very pretty/handsome counter .	1

i bought this knife january 2005 , after lusting one beautiful shun knives long time . i little concerned d-shaped profile handle , because i'm left-handed , but not any problem it . edges rounded difference flat side rounded one not intrusive sensation . said , i'm not convinced there any significant advantage this shape , either . i selected tomato knife because it seemed like it would fill unoccupied niche our rather large collection kitchen knives . this versatile knife shouldn't limited its name - not only it handle ripest tomatoes well , but it handy cutting other soft , juicy fruits vegetables or any other use which serrated blade needed , size blade makes it excellent utility knife . my husband i use it regularly , we both love it .	1

i reviewed most juicers ... many other major sites decided kitchenaid best product market . after receiving it , i changed my mind . although it promises easy cleanup " special tool " , it way too hard clean up . pulp basket contains ridge makes it next impossible get out all little strains pulp . special tool great getting out big stuff , but not little stuff . also , there ton juice left over pulp gets thrown away . this result poor design , which filters juice through pulp before exiting . product nice design looked good my counter-top , but it not deliver . i would recommend buying jack lalanne power juicer available other sites	-1
i've gone through three cutters borrowed one try out last few months . zyliss palm-held model ingeniously designed so-so use , but not really intuitive enough use readily or well ( i've professional hand tool user variety trades past 40 years ) . i tried out kitchenaid model smaller blade it nice heavy but unimpressive use . i suppose kitchenaid 4 " model might worked well , but it some negative features i discovered during my research . hanging hole set perpendicular blade - not good idea hanging against wall . handle metal plastic smooth ( not conducive maximum grip friction ) not shaped well good torque control . pistol grip nice , but doesn't really add control operator . lastly , axle bolt nut apparently isn't completely stainless eventually needs tightening because locknut nylon affected machine-washing temps . i'm not surprised mario batali stainless 4 " pizza cutter put out copco - i've coated , cast iron frying pan copco since early 1970 it exactly same condition when purchased - solid , beautiful , functional joy use own . this pizza cutter same attributes . it really well designed ergonomically , esthetically functionally . axle permanently riveted ( no bolt nut eventually go loose or rust after machine washing ) what appears single-piece axle/rivet , surrounded either side what appears neoprene washers . wheel riveted precisely enough there no slop whatsoever , yet wheel rotates perfectly during use no discernable friction . oval handle , covered typical soft grip we see nowadays contemporary tools , gives great amount control through grip friction torque . fit finish this tool beautiful , no discernable manufacturing flaws . use , it cuts like gangbusters - one quick slice through you're . no need back-and-forth get job ( i bake thick-style pizza ) . this thing really heavy substantial hand . much , * much * better than anything i've used before . obviously designed someone who knows what they're doing . price ($15 when i bought it ) ridiculously low , considering workmanship quality . i'd recommend this pizza cutter anyone serious their pizza . thank you , mario batali ( one my favorite food network chefs )	1

i really like look these square dishes . switching stoneware corelle good decision . they take up much less space my kitchen it easier carry whole stack them my arthritic hands . because their smaller size , we use lunch plates more often than dinner plates . but we miss smaller bread butter plates , so i ordered some plain white round 6 3/4 inch plates . disappointed we couldn't get small square plates , but round ones ok . 22 oz . bowls larger than most . slight lip rim helps remove them microwave without getting burned . corelle doesn't heat up like stoneware . also disappointed mugs not corelle glass , but porcelain . they feel nice your hand but could tip easier than most mugs . overall i really like these dishes would buy them again	1

my 30 year old ge blender/food processor combo broke blade blender part i could not get part so i toss blender container , leaving it stand-alone food processor . after debating buying countertop appliance , which probably would not durable something made 30 years ago , i decided give this blender try . i've always liked kitchenaid products , this one no acception . i surprised power this blender ! best part me it easy clean takes up so little kitchen real estate . making soups hummus breeze . whisking up egg whites so much less painful than dragging out mixmaster ... just give yourself big enough bowl or they all over kitchen . small food processing container just right size 1 or 2 people . variable speed lets me control how coarse my chopping too . i find turning entire apparatus upside down sideways or shaking it helped chopping everything uniformly ... but it only took couple seconds . i would given this blender solid 5 stars , but making smoothies ice not perfect , although once i got technique down ( moving blender up down around lot " attack " ice ) it ok . it took more than few seconds . if you drink lot ice blended drinks or smoothies , this job more efficiently good conventional blender . if you only use it occasionally this purpose , kitchenaid fine . maybe kitchenaid could come up special blade or container/blade combo ice blending , i'm sure lot people would buy it , i know i would . all all , i don't regret my purchase all . it versatile compact appliance me years come	1

i knew upfront other reviews when you first start delonghi radiator they bit oil smell . so when my radiators ( i bought two ) arrived , i put them open place , turned them max , let them burn off factory oil smell . smell gone two hours i brought them inside . they work great best all , they quiet , quiet , quiet ( only small click when thermostat turns off ) . i use them two rooms . one room 10x10 8 foot ceiling which i use home office . it heats room very quickly . other delonghi room 10x12 very tall gable ceiling ( 12 foot peak ) . initially i thought all heat would just accumulate peak , but it didn't . delonghi radiator fins moved enough warm keep whole place warm . these radiators small easy move around . i don't use thermostat because they heat sufficiently fast i don't need bother program mode . one thing i like these radiators they don't dry air way electric heaters ( i one it always smell burned dust air very dry afterwards ) . any radiator , please make sure you fresh ventilation room .	1

my sister previous model didn't work well . her all stainless salt not mill , it shaker . she hates it because salt saker filled bottom flimsy plastic cap that not good anymore . i like this one much more because it actual mill . careful which one these models you buy . there three kinds ; one adjusts grind twisting knob top , which isn't very good because it loosens shifts grinds ; other adjusts two settings only fine corse , which doesn't work well me either ; then there maybe five or six adjustable settings i think really best one bunch . i really like way salt comes out fine snow-like flakes rather then chunks i love results produced crushing peppers instead grinding them , process produces much more fragrant pepper smell taste dishes . product fairly new my kitchen so i can't tell you how it perform future . i am trusting it now	1

this wonderful utility wood cutting board . when shopping cutting board , there several factors you want consider : material , size , shape , upkeep . material : there several choose , but wood best if you care your knives your chopping arm . wood easiest your knives because blade sink into wood instead dulling it ( if you granite/glass ) . it absorbs shock impact , unlike granite/glass , which quite jarring cut . wood also natural antibacterial properties . there rumors going awhile dangers wood harboring bacteria , but after extensive research , they found out wood actually seems kill bacteria naturally . scientists not able recover bacteria wood board after hour , yet they could recover bacteria plastic after days ... there extensive material this , so i'll let you research more it your own i continue review this board . advantages plastic cutting board over wood board ( it easy clean , dishwasher safe , light , easy store ) goes downhill over time - whereas advantages wood board deteriorates very little over time . biggest reason this plastic cutting board only " cleaner " than wood board when it brand new . soon it gets knife scored , those little crevices harbors bacteria . people say taken care scrubbing soap - but think it , you can't fully clean your teeth just brushing ! why ? because brushing not get into crevices your teeth , that why it crucial floss . now think how much smaller knife cut plastic than crevices your teeth . microscopically smaller , yet large enough lots microscopic bacteria live . then some people say soak plastic board bleach water . this doesn't work either because vacuum effect water surface tension . you'd need able force bleach water into each knife score rinse out bacteria there . water not force it way into vacuum like it own ( what you're doing when you simply dunk it into container bleach water ) . bottom line when it comes plastic vs wood - wood natural anti-bacteria properties not diminish over time , knife scored plastic board not . even all studies people recommending plastic over wood tell you toss plastic board when it becomes badly scored . size shape : i think this 20 15 2.25 size excellent - although , it " heavy duty " size - it also comes thinner model , 1.5 " thick . i like board large enough chop , then move items over little piles off side while i chop something else . rectangle shape allows me this better than square or circle . oval shape might work , but it would harder store since you can't stand it it side . there larger smaller these john boos boards but i think larger one would too bulky heavy ( this board just topmost limit my kitchen countertop handle , my sink wash board ) . this board also 17.33 lbs , which makes it quite bulky heavy . these boards also comes 2 thicknesses : 1.5 " 2.25 " thick . i think if you buy wood board you want it least inch thick . thinner boards warp/break easier . you need it hefty . 1.5 " thick this board perfect regular home chef . 2.25 " thick one good heavy chopping - bones , more line " butcher block " . upkeep : glass/granite break/chip , but otherwise last forever . it easy clean , very pretty , dishwasher safe . it just jarring cut dull your blades . plastic superior everything easy . dishwasher safe . light , easy store , cheap , comes different colors ... but prepared replace it soon it badly knife scored . wood . all materials , wood needs most upkeep . you buy john boos mystery oil which mixture mineral oil , linseed oil tung oil . you can't just use any oil because it needs safe eat case any oil transfer , you don't want oil go rancid . you just oil wood every 4-6 weeks . wood not dishwasher safe . you want avoid ever soaking wood water , although quick scrub rinse through sink , quick thorough drying towel trick just fine . yes , it more work than others , but it not much work , i think it defnitely worth it . one more note wood boards . maple best material becaues it small pore size ratio hardness wood . you might think oak very hard wood , but it bigger pores , so stick maple . john boos cutting board conclusion : i think this perfect cutting board . material , size , shape , weight , all right . john boo also doing this since 1887 , so it good american company that around long enough know little something wood . customer service great well . my only complaint it not very pretty . it quite plain looking . wood boards gorgeous addition my kitchen , warming it up giving it very earthy real feel - but girl , cherry top would if it just " prettier " . one last thing , this board reversible . i don't like when they put little feet one side board prevents you using both sides . this extends use life board i think it shame take away . you always just place removeable , nonslip surface under your wood board keep it place - like silicone pad or sheet non-slip drawer liner stuff .	1
this product god send those people who dog pulls leash thereby making walking dog struggle ! dogs naturally tug against restraint . former methods using choke collar or even worse harsh coller cut into dogs neck if it pulls cruel my opinion method jerking dog back if it pulls . dogs not like thier heads turned if they pull . they immediately stop pulling ! i admit initially my dogs didn't like collar over nose , but passes quickly . this not muzzle any way . it gently humanely stops tugging you happy walks ! this product blessing ! you love it	1

i originally looking bosch turbo jet vac but found out bosch no longer making turbo jet under their name but they now making turbo jet vax . i purchased mine best buy . i really like looks features however this vacuum extremely horrible job carpets . brush roll assembly unit automatically adjusts height carpet however this one if major flaws i noticed hurts it . when you push forward vacuum , brush assembly tilts up toward air preventing brush rollers making contact carpet . there no way you manually adjust height rollers so it make contact carpet . you also cannot tell carpet vacuumed after numerous runs over same area due tilt angle rollers . emissions also bad . vacuum not emit " fresh " air smell but instead emits smell plastic carpet . filter horrilble job emitting clean air . last item i think hurts this model hose unit . it akward design hard use because hose length short hard pull which makes vacuum fall forward times . i returned vacuum different best buy than one i originally purchased . rep returns counter informed me they only carrying vax only few months but they extremely high return rate vax compared their other brands . i walked over vacuum section after i return replace it eureka 4870 which one consumer report top three vacs beats heck out dyson . there must least 7 used vax floor sold returns . eureka amazing blows away vax one hundred dollars less .	-1

now , they even them south ! gentle leader should not confused other head collars like halti . it far superior any dog breed or temperament . i've trained both my golden retrievers well dogs several relatives many friends over past six years using gentle leader . possible exception toy breeds , this god-send any dog owner rambunctious , head-strong or hard handle canine or if you just wants more control without extra work even trauma associated neck collars general . i my first gentle leader dog then my second , walking staying heel , sitting automatically upon stopping , turning both left right no longer lunging , pulling , jumping or straying ... all within less than 15 minutes each dog ! golden retrievers , course , wonderfully easy willing train anyway , but this so incredibly fast , it almost like watching some magic trick performed . it my vet fort lewis , wa who first taught me how fit collar use it . application simple once you see it first time . just place nose strap short flesh nose ( allowing dog breathe , eat , drink even carry items ) tightten head strap one finger tight behind ears ( base head , really ) . this gives you control ( nose strap ) dog sense well-being ( head strap ) . nothing all dogs neck or throat . i strongly encourage you someone experienced gentle leader use show you hot fit it properly first time . all dogs i've since trained or assisted their training there short-lived " leader dance " . this where , after placing leader first time , dog hops air then bows ground all while both front paws over it nose while trying remove collar . you continue give short firm tugs collar while continuing walk dog , dance quickly disappears within just few yards . i amazed how consistant this behaviour its let up always . leader basically uses same physical restraint mother dog or pack alpha male uses control puppy or young dog . grip over nose pressure back neck . it purely coincidental it looks like horse halter . control comes strap over nose . leash clips bottom this strap ( under lower jaw ) . short , quick ( but not violent ) tug leash leash brings entire head under control . head follows nose where head goes , body must follow . there never any need jerking , pulling or strangling dog . there never leash rope burns dog take control lunging away you . your arms stay their sockets , palm blisters thing past ( especially if you use cotton leash , or least leather one ... never use chain or poly-fiber leashes ) . some breeds huge necks high pain tolerance , such rottweilers , easily gently brought into line . my brother 2 years old completely out control . he heel , sitting turning within 5 minutes or so after i turned dog over my brother 15 minutes i took dog back let his 6 year old daughter lead him around . my cute tiny niece less control than dog , yet they both performed team ease . coolest thing head collar how dogs get really excited when they see it , knowing it going walk , training or just out public . they love gentle leader . gentle leader only used training or control . dog still wears its own neck collar , but only keep his tags , since dogs don't normally come pockets . gentle leader also huge facilitator " off-leash " training . dog so comfortable taking properly given commands leash , doing so " off-leash " seems take only one half one third normal time i once involved . , my friends , super endorsement , alone ! one last caution ... i pray you no way person who " stakes " out dog any reason . regardless , gentle leader should never ever used keep dog attached stake or wire run . running out end line coming up short neck/shoulders one thing neck collar . staking dog knowing head collar actually jerk twist head snap neck nothing less than cruelty , if not out out murder . use gentle leader only leash you one end dog other , please . i hope you found this useful , i know you find gentle leader . take care pass good time your canine friend	1

i assembled it all myself while my husband work boy i pleased myself ! chest took me 2 1/2 hours , which i think pretty good since i doing it alone , plus my 4 year old daughter kept distracting me few times ! only real problem came when i started assembling drawers , you could not put guides holes they drilled you because it wouldn't line up right , you move them all way side . bottom drawer sticks more than others . but i deal , maybe one these days i get around trying fix . i noticed drawers open better when you squat down level drawer pull it open . i no problems knobs falling off other people stated , though box end table knobs broken package . i called manufacturer they sending me two new knobs , don't know when they'll arrive though . there also one part assembling chest i skip because screws it called use too small too short where they supposed go .... they go under bottom decorative molding front screw through top chest , but screw way small , would not even go through wood . top screwed tightly down location so i skipped step you could not tell it functions just fine . very sturdy i highly recommend it if you wanting something not too expensive .	1

first - there no doubt this very expensive purchase , but if you two starbucks drinkers house it worth consideration . after i determined roi ( given our sbux frequency ) this machine 3 years , we purchased our first machine ( capresso 3000 ) 4 years ago . it love first drink . we went stopping coffee every morning way office , making it home some great to-go cups we purchased costco . when c3000 finally broke , we boxed up machine took it right back williams sonoma ( sorry amazon ) they happily took it back upgraded us z5 difference what we paid first unit price new z5 ( $350 ) . we love z5 !! my husband " straight " coffee guy , but i am late girl who loves how easy it hook up milk container make my late push button . i also purchased starbuck vanilla syrup so i make my own vanilla late home . if you disposable income consider this , it great machine . after reading customer service stories previous reviews , i would consider buying williams sonoma who offers lifetime guarantee anything purchased through them . when my $ 2,699 capresso failed after 4 years , they took it back without question upgraded me z5 . through entire process they just thanked me my business . i am customer life can't say enough how much we love this coffee machine !	1

this pressure cooker bees knees ! i used fagor splendid duo while ( which two slightly smaller sized pots one set also share one pressure lid ) . i recently decided upgrade amazon this newer fagor duo combi 8qt/4qt terrific price two rebates ( one cookbook , other additional fagor " everyday pan " ) so i splurged ... also got free shipping . i'm still waiting rebate items arrive , but amazon i've never problem don't expect one . after this arrived , i promptly showed it off . my folks live next town they so impressed it mom one too . so dad got her this same set christmas replace ancient presto aluminum pressure cooker she used decades ( it its last legs , cooked hundreds upon hundreds great meals) ! old aluminum pressure cookers notorious problems . i've known people who scars pressure cooker accidents . admittedly , i bit leery first . but these newer next-generation pressure cookers very well constructed stainless steel using newer designs locking additionally incorporating several new different safety features design . my fagor splendid , soon i saw how well this new 8qt/4qt elite duo combi made , i felt very comfortable using it ! i must confess , i little skeptical first because fagor recently switched manufacturing spain " designing spain , manufacturing china " , but any concerns i quality quickly assuaged when i got set took it its first " test drive " stove , then cooked few meals . i'm happy report , no problems quality i tell . cooker : lid goes pretty easily . i'd give it 8.5 or 9 out possible 10 this area ... because there slight learning curve getting lid on/off , but nothing really worry . it well engineered lid fits both pots very well . both pots heat evenly come up temperature pressure very quickly . dual-pressure valve snap use ! just turn dial full pressure ( 15 psi ) or half pressure ( 8 psi ) . when it time release pressure , there third setting which opens valve let steam escape rapidly ... this great feature!i'd like add something which i found important . diameter . this set full 10 " diameter which makes browning either pot breeze . ( splendid set pots only 9 " diameter ) . so finding one 10 " near top my list ... this one didn't disappoint ! before upgrading pressure cookers , i researched several makes/models it looks like all them exception kuhn-rikon now made china . i like kr but it expensive largest pot 7 litres , whereas this model fagor 8 quart little roomier . using included glass lid , large pot doubles stock pot , pasta cooker , or steamer using included basket . you also pressure cook whole chicken ( or large roast ) still room vegetables . smaller sized pot doubles skillet ( also using included glass lid ) or it works great smaller pressure cooker smaller items or things you would cook flat such chicken breasts , etc . one final thing , handle design newer fagor pots great , helper handle front well loop design main handle allows you get your hand around handle grip it well when you need move it while it full ( or hot ) . overall , this great product i highly recommend it !	1
