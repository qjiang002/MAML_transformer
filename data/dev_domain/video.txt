it not just this film bloated remake quick , clean , near-perfect minimalist thriller . it not much added material ( particularly internal affairs sub-plot ) feels tacked-on unnecessary . it not even pacino character toned-down shell dangerously off-kilter detective original , one more complicated characters ( frya selmer/tanya francke ) reduced down set dressing , or ending ruins film moral atmosphere . it fact nolan , sublimely talented director , unable coax believable performance any his leads . pacino method-acting bit again , taking it over top every single scene ; hilary swank plays pale imitation her better roles down-to-earth hometown girl ; robin williams -- well , he robin williams . kids this film , katharine isabelle jonathan jackson , turn fine performances , while hardly career-makers ( which they couldn't , considering how far their roles pared down ) , refreshing change pace their adult contemporaries ' mugging . see film their far-too-short performances , but make sure you rent it , don't pay too much so	-1
i very disappointed . acting principles fine , but i think only thing saved this movie me choreography bob fosse . i think what really turned me off omission few great songs . following tunes original show left out - near you , we've got think game , man doesn't know . applegate tune , good old days , abridged . new tune , there something empty chair , added replace near you , but it very weak . i wish someone would remake this wonderful show they've recently music man bye bye birdie	-1
almost unbelievably bad , except i saw remake ' shaft , ' which should forewarning . this like comic book filmgoers . no , not graphic novel adapted screen . more like comic book kids , you'd embarassed own any age . doubly offensive high quality soul music soundtrack , travesty nth degree .	-1
enjoyed lost translation , i thought i might like this one , which seems some sort cult reputation -- why i can't fathom . entire plot self-serving , shallow , unrealistic . i guess it supposed depict horror repressive religious values , while i don't condone those , film lacks clear characters or any motivation . lot people buttoned up parents who don't get it , it doesn't mean they kill themselves -- because they grounded !? since writer-director gerw up hollywood , she may not aware you can't keep your kid home school without very good reason -- social workers what not come after you . so entire premise false . romanticizing mass suicide bunch soft focus young blondes it -- after which they supposedly ascend erotic eternity imaginations their boyish peers -- could actually encourage act . it not caring , not real , not responsible . but i guess wouldn't bother rich , overfunded daughter hollywood genius out make name herself .	-1
this extremely dry anime . manga version masamune shirow filled bits humor . not so anime . character batou especially funny manga , but , reasons unknown , he driest character already humorless anime version . expect long scenes filled monotonous talking . these really make movie crawl . one minute there action , next you're listening matoko or batou go existentialism . seriously , these little talks , take up 3/4 movie . visuals awesome , no question . even so , they not fulfill need some kind thread story . altogether , not much actually , happens during movie . if you must see it , rent it first sure you want it	-1

if " suspense " filmed played woods , it didn't actually contain any suspense , would bear watch it ? previous sentence makes much suspense reason behind making " domestic disturbance " , newest `thriller ' starring john travolta , vince vaughn teri polo . let talk few minutes mr. travolta . anyone name actor who received more chances his career squandered them ? i think travolta now surpassed richard dreyfuss comeback/ lose it again king . after brilliant comeback engineered his longtime admirer quentin tarantino " pulp fiction " , travolta appeared number films interesting proved interesting choices . " face/off " " broken arrow " highlighted string hits ultimately allowed travolta join $20 million club . last few years , every film travolta appeared failed miserably . " lucky numbers " ? " general daughter " ? film hit but anyone even remember one significant scene it ? " swordfish " ? interesting , but flop . " battlefield earth " ? why he keep making this trash ? it paychecks . i can't see any other conceivable reason . john , baby , how long before studios realize these films aren't making any money they stop hiring you ? john , baby , how long before you need comeback vehicle ? frank morrison ( john travolta ) divorced father who makes wooden boats . he doesn't get lot business , but business he get gets great deal . he doesn't charge his customers enough make profit . frank this because he good guy . his son , danny ( matthew o'leary ) lot problems accepting his mom ( teri polo ) new relationship rick barnes ( vince vaughn ) . he gets into lot trouble lies everyone . couple days after his mom rick get married , he stows away rick car witnesses him murdering business associate . police don't believe him however . after little soul searching , frank believes his son . he may lie everyone , but he doesn't lie frank . directed harold becker ( " sea love " ) , " domestic disturbance " suspense film without any suspense . moment danny stows away rick car watches him murder ray ( steve buscemi ) , which we also watch , we know who good guy who bad guy . make matters worse , frank instantly believes his son , which means film boils down cat mouse game frank rick . boring cat mouse game . when you know identity villain , huge percentage suspense flushed down toilet . when frank believes danny early , rest suspense flushed down it . film would've greatly improved showing danny backseat car , watching everything , pain suspense registering his face , while audience sees nothing . then , when danny tries convince his dad , police chief , his mom , rick murderer , least we haven't seen act , we would require some convincing well . because filmmakers chose show us everything , next logical step provide some suspense would frank doubt danny , his son . however , after very brief segment , frank believes danny , causing us watch battle frank rick , which isn't very interesting . each actors , including travolta , serviceable their roles , but because film robs us just everything first fifteen minutes , remaining ninety become exercise tedium . skip " domestic disturbance " . it isn't even worthy video rental . go see far superior very different " amelie " or " man who wasn't there " . your money much better spent .	-1

i too bought this vhs vincent d'onofrio . my only negative comment his performance there not enough it ! i'll say right here now i'm not big fan smits or scacchi , d'onofrio overpowers them every time he screen . it beautiful story , i see why director gillian armstrong attracted it - it love story bit real-life depth ( rather than those soapy ones where ridiculous problems created characters lack imagination - julia roberts films , anyone ? ) . said , two lead roles needed played stronger actors , ones could keep up d'onofrio vivacity . worth look fans	-1

let just honest : this film terrible . . . not way " attack killer tomatoes ! " so " terrible " it great . . . more like way " caddyshack ii " so terrible director should forever live shame . . . i kid when this film released . , while it not particularly exciting then , it insanely tedious now . it genuine test patience . . . but no pay-off what-so-ever . here some potentially helpful information : slasher film branch two directions : supernatural ( friday 13th ii , halloween , nightmare elm street etc ... ) crime/revenge ( i spit your grave , friday 13th , tcm , scream , urban legend ect ... ) . this one falls under latter heading . while realism render more potent effect ( " this could really happen ! " ) , this film simply fails engage viewer any level . goal slasher film two-fold : horrify repulse . this neither !! " horror " element non-existent : there no point expounding , since there nothing examine . , if you love gore ( who doesn't ? ) try film . " murders " barely visible ( literally ) so sloppy they solicit no response other than yawn . many film problems technical : cinematography just horrendous . entirely film extremely underlit , colors needlessly washed-out , film stock grade " . " this , you know , not because film over twenty-five years old . . . problem always there . there one " good " moment entire film . . . when school " bad boy " his head lopped-off it clumsily thunks down prom-court walk-way . still , it more comic-relief than genuine horror . soundtrack could not worse . i am not referring disco tunes ( we accept those since this film made end disco period ) , but tracks made film . . . they sound like they squeaked-out carpenters . so , imagine lots disco punctuated lackluster , psuedo-thoughtful ballads ( like final song track ) . words cannot explain how wildly offensive it !! i mention leslie nielson meaty role ( yes , leslie nielsen airplane , naked gun) ? he plays tough-minded principal who tormented death his daughter . i know , it sounds funny , but it not !! trust me !! if you dig watching unattractive teenagers " disco night away , " hey , this film totally you !! but if you looking decent slasher film early middle-period its reign look elsewhere ( like halloween , friday 13th etc ... ) i'd willing get all ed mcmahon star-search you give this " film " 1/4 star . but it important milestone slasher sub-genre ( i not spoil film tell you why , though ) . so if you slasher enthusiast or horror scholar , watch it . . . picture-in-picture . . . maybe after few drinks . . . day when cable out . . . fast-forward !	-1

this movie may not everyone , but me it highly memorable . possible spoiler alert : this isn't your ordinary " travel back time alter futures people you care " -flick ( back future -- although , granted , it better made more entertaining ) . butterfly effect really ( alphabetical order ) acceptance , chance , charity , choice , grownup love , hope , identity , opportunity , regret , sacrifice . some reviewers mentioned quality acting . here my thoughts : kutcher me always seemed innocent , caring , small town fellow more than fun guy most us might know him , that why i wasn't surprised see him pull off this role . amy smart good mostly , but glaringly off-key times ( granted she show more range other actors )	-1

if you fan horror movies , old ec comic books , stephen king , or just fun movies general , than look no further than this 1982 classic ! = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = movie ( 5/5 ): " creepshow " anthology scary stories -- five them -- bridged together sixth tale boy who loves horror comics his abusive dad who hates them . movie features pitch-perfect performances all-star 80 cast seems lot fun this scream movie . stories follow : 1 . " father day " ( 4.5 /5)stars carrie nye , ed harris , viveca lindfors . easily cheesiest five stories ( but still lot fun ) , father day tells tale family reunion hell when long-dead dad rises grave his " caaaaaaakkeeeee " ( little good old fashioned zombie revenge ) . 2 . " lonesome death jordy verrill " ( 4/5)stars stephen king . although its easily weakest stories , it probably also most original , so keep your finger off fast-forward button . stephen king (!) gives nutty throughly enjoyable performance country bumpkin who battles alien plantlife meteroite touches down his backyard . sounds weird ? you don't know half it . 3 . " something tide you over " ( 5/5)stars leslie nielsen , ted danson , gaylen ross . this segment legendary . leslie nielsen gives performance his life psychotically jealous husband who takes notion bury his wife her lover neck-deep sand before tide rolls . needless say , love more powerful than death , our antihero soon finds himself neck deep terrifying troubles his own . 4 . " crate " ( 5/5)stars hal holbrook , adrienne barbeau , fritz weaver . hands down best tale terror , it no wonder three main actors this single story also receive top billing picture opening credits . this epic blood-soaked tale insanity , fear , fidelity timeless classic excellent performances all around , unforgettable monkey-like demon special effects master tom savini . longest segment film , " crate " tells story henry ( holbrook ) , college professor unbelievably obnoxious domineering wife ( brilliant performance barbeau ) . when henry colleague dexter stanley ( weaver ) discovers flesh-eating monster under stairway under stairs college informs henry , henpecked husband makes plans use monster his own domestic advantage . this out-of-this-world premise carries very real themes love death , friends family , moral responsibility versus personal hapiness . subtle undertones just hint depth this brilliantly written horror masterpiece , stephen king never more entertaining than this perfectly crafted tale . 5 . " they're creeping up you " ( 4.5 /5)stars e.g. marshall . bringing us back down soft landing , romero king conclude their horror anthology this wonderfully bizarre tale millionaire hypochondriac whose allegedly germ-proof apartment overwhelmed army cockroaches . this one goes way over top , but it all keeps tempo movie . if you know somebody who deathly afraid bugs , try showing them final scene this segment , then sit back enjoy their screams bewilderment . all all , i'd say creepshow one top three horror films ever made . rent it or buy it today ! = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = disc ( 1/5 ): unfortunately , " geniuses " over warner bros . insulted this fine film its fans offering up very lame disc . picture quality only passable , letterbox formatting kind funky , there absolutely no extras , save trailer , which i don't really count real feature . only good thing i possibly say disc it got 41 chapters , but only 21 those accesible disc . while we'll wait " creepshow " get same special edition treatment its inferior sequel , this bare bones disc only goes show strength film fact even no bonuses all , " creepshow " still one most rewatchable indispensable horror movies market	1

why record company would put this out vhs , not dvd , beyond me , especially considering its release date . ultimate would ( they it before , see both doors sepultura dvd releases ) take this , add it , live brixton , put it all one dvd . since this doesn't seem likely , i suggest , burn your own dvd , include not only " ricochet " " bloody murder " ( both left out ) , but also mr. bungle one music video release . happily , while " stripsearch " not listed back vhs box , it included . fnm videos ? great , great , great ..	1

price this bit steep , especially since bonus materials limited ( though enjoyable ) . nonetheless , i didn't regret spending money . maysles brothers such amazing groundbreaking documentarians anything theirs you get your hands worth it . this film follows four very ordinary bible salesmen late 1960 they ply their trade cold snow new england then sunshine florida . maysles ' focus particular one gentleman who clearly not cut out this work slowly but surely headed scrap pile . despite relative mundanity events , you find yourself transfixed these men endure high-powered mindwashing their superiors struggle survive dying industry . few films ever so poignantly made point , though god may good box office , no one really seems give damn who buys or sells tickets show	1

" grave fireflies " one hardest-watching movies i've ever seen , one i wouldn't missed world . taking place japan during latter parts world war ii ( though it could any country any war ) , it story two children , seita setsuko , who left their own when their mother dies destruction small town , left attempt survive their own . seita , brother , older two it falls him guard care his sister setsuko , who little more than toddler . two hold out hope their father , member japanese navy , eventually return them . seita setsuko wonderful captivating characters who seem uncannily real , making their plight all more terrifying heartbreaking . what perhaps most horrifying whole experience not just brutalities war , because expected ; but terribly callous nature many ' ordinary people ' children encounter during their ordeal . during darkest days war , when logically one would think survivors would pulling together , case often anything but . even family setsuko seita mother not want ' burdened ' them . although examples people who react differently crop up later , bulk time children their own ruin befalls world around them . children , fireflies setsuko finds , keeps jar , talking them feeding them , releasing them night fly makeshift shelter seita constructed . abandoned humanity , little glowing insects only living creatures children find companionship . there bright tender , even humorous , moments amidst tragedy - some them overt , others occur places where meaning subject interpretation . but it remains harrowing movie , one most crushing ever made . extremely haunting , extremely powerful , , odd way , extremely rewarding . there glimmers whispers possibility flitting , firefly-like , through darkness , effect truly eerie . i'll refrain hinting ending , but there certainly host moments sear themselves into one heart . if this movie doesn't leave you shaken , nothing ever going	1
i seen many historical war dramas far east ( mainly china ) most them not only historically inaccurate but strong bias toward enemy . yi soon shin , however , rare exception . not only drama very historically accurate but it also very comprehensive detailing meticulous battle planning admiral leads each victory but also political in-fighting chosun political factions ( second-guessing nature king ) which causes his eventual death . also , special effects great . battle scenes ( whether sea or land ) realisitic outstanding quality . only problem i find dvd not placed sufficient focus contribution ming china . then again , this not unexpected since this korean drama focusing great admiral . also , entire selection should 104 episodes . i don't know why it stops 101 . if you want more comprehensive knowledge subject , try samuel hawley imjin war ( which portrays yi soon shin more accurately quoting original sources ) . any who only intered fighting may also want check out stephen turnbull samurai invasion ( which more colorful maps detailed description battles japanese perspective ) . lastly , anyone who fan samurai warfare may want check out shogun : total war creative assembly ( now gold version ) .	1

i agree- they don't make ' em like this anymore- honest , bold , uncompromising , socially politically meaningful ... yet ( lest we forget ) entertaining . like stanley kubrick , late hal ashby didn't direct whole lot films , but most them built last ( quot ; harold amp ; maudequot ; , quot ; last detailquot ; , quot ; therequot ; , quot ; shampooquot ;) . quot ; landlordquot ; ashby impressive directorial debut 1970 . spoiled rich kid beau bridges , worrisome his parents due his quot ; liberal viewsquot ; , buys run-down tenement building intentions rennovate . his introduction , subsequent involvement , various black tenants played sometimes laughs , sometimes intense drama , but always real , that magic ashby work . social satire dead-on , but never preachy ( you listening , spike lee ? ) . ensemble work top-notch , young lou gossett ( hair ! ) giving memorable dramatic turn , lovely susan anspach hilarious bridges ' perpetually stoned bemused sister . scene which pearl bailey lee grant ( two more knockout performances ) get drunk bond over bottle quot ; sparklingquot ; wine minor classic all its own . don't miss this one	1

this movie wonderful . although it didn't exactly make me cry , it touch me sentimental way . i fell love morrie . he such sweet guy , his story inspiration everyone . i greatly impressed how he chose make most his life , even though fate handed him death sentence . he made up his mind he wasn't going sit around feel sorry himself ; he going make his final days happy pleasant entirely possible , i really admire . i also pleased effect morrie his old college student , mitch . mitch learns appreciate life little surprises , not such big rush all time . he learns relax smell roses , let go old grudges , value people his life , he even learns allow himself cry . my most favorite scene where mitch actually breaks down bawls , morrie takes him his arms two men embrace each other . this scene without doubt most moving one entire film . although it last time mitch ever sees morrie alive , it still very sweet poignant . ending pretty sad , but it also happy same time . morrie gone , yet his legacy lives . i recommend this movie anyone , any gender , any age .	-1

this one my favorite movies . besides containing stellar cast ( matthew mcconaughey , sandra bullock , sammuel . jackson , oliver platt , donald keifer sutherland , kevin spacey ) you get idea . there cast member isn't biggie ? casting genious , acting incredible . it suspenseful , deep , very emotional .. slightly dark .. it perfect movie . even rape scene well comfortably vague while still haunting you . time kill plot pretty simply explained . deep south , 10 year old black girl raped two wite rednecks , who almost kill her . young white lawyer father ( matthew mcconaughey jake brigance ) sickened news , doesn't quite know what think when little girl father ( sammuel . jackson carl lee hailey ) pays him visit asks if he'd " help him if he tight spot " . next day two redneck/monsters led up stairs courthouse their arraignment , carl lee hailey pops out storage clauset machine gun blows away two young men raped his daugher . jake brigance agrees defend hailey his murder trial begins . insanity plea used " give jury excuse aquit " but my opinion , i think it quite legitimate . what father wouldn't driven insane under circumstances ? rest movie carl lee hailey trial surrounding drama kkk violence emerges led kiefer sutherland , jake life home danger , his relationship his wife strained , his career seriously line what seems loosing battle . my favorite scene ? it might come surprise , but my favorite scene when prosecution calls stand policeman who leading two rednecks up stairs their trial . he caught knee stray bullet , now half leg . after prosecution use witness incite rage against carl lee , establish unerring identity shooter , defence asks him two questions . " you think carl lee intentionally shot you ? " " no " " you think he should sent prision what he ? "" he what i would . " but it doesn't end there policeman ( remember he missing leg because what carl lee hailey ) becomes very emotional boldly confesses if someone raped his little girl he would blow him away just like carl lee . he starts screaming jury " turn him loose , he hero ! " i think this one most emotion packed well acted scenes ( albeit there many others too ) ( great acting chris cooper policeman ) anyway .. forgive if i rambled . i love this movie if you like courtroom dramas ... star studded casts .. john grisham ... suspense thrillers .. just all around good movies .. you need see this .	1
this movie such wonderful reviews both professional critics amazon customers i expecting great things . while i agree acting ( especially girls playing christy ariel ) excellent story just too implausible i got impression minute we see family crossing canada us ( yes they irish but some reason they sneak us canada ) . anyway why earth would apparently intelligent couple enter us their two kids illegally , without jobs or much money settle most expensive city country ? i know dad actor but couldn't he settled family one less expensive boroughs taken subway manhattan ? mom teacher but can't find job but no wonder if they country illegally . yet there money private school , fixing up dump apartment , expensive camcorder , betting rent money et doll etc . i can't imagine any parents moving apartment building known " drug house " two young girls then letting girls wander they please . mind you parents couple supposedly almost crippled guilt they feel over third child - son - recently died . i kept expecting someone call social services . medical situations both frankie mom new baby not well thought out or researched . symbolism mateo , new baby frankie very heavy handed . though film told through oldest daughter eyes because several scenes elements movie not suited all children . there also several scenes really not connected oldest daughter all . maybe if i taken it more fable i would " gotten " this movie more but i expecting straight forward drama disappointed .	-1

bit campy spots , bit ahead its time others , westworld looms potential goldmine trilogy-happy hollywood . introduce all-star cast beginning , split them up three different worlds , end first film characters escaping their grisly fate ... only find themselves medieval world . repeat formula second part , adding characters who went off park , then shunt survivors off join rest roman world big third film finale . seriously , why somebody not making this already	-1
i think this movie , although depressing , good example survival instinct manifested children . maybe some sort perverted way i thought these children would become expert ways survival , this experience could positive their lives they got older . these kids knoked around early life this , hopefully , would only make them stronger granting them true picture reality dog eat dog lifestyle capitalism . these kids model capitalist system encourages rugged darwinian individualism . part me wishes i would spent few years street like these kids ( sans aurolac if possible ) . if anything we should admire these children their incredible innocent strength ... this urban primitivism liberty its best especially when contrasted those fat ugly pampered bucharetians chillin ' sydney cafe ...	1

jack ryan , hero several tom clancy novels , back it this movie terrorism global nuclear war . 1973 , during arab-israeli war , lone israeli pilot took off flew toward arab lines . his cargo : one nuclear bomb . however , plane shot down , but somehow , bomb survived . it soon buried sand left unnoticed twenty-nine years . meanwhile , trouble occuring other parts world well . president russia mysteriously dies , new president , nemerov , ( ciaran hinds ) takes power . this move alerts american cia , especially director william cabot ( morgan freeman ) . nemerov known wild card , many unsure his motives . however , jack ryan ( ben affleck ) isn't convinced nemerov . ryan wrote paper nemerov , he seems think he more conservative his views . directed president robert fowler ( james cromwell ) , cabot ryan sent russia check status their nuclear disarmament . once there , they given tour russian nuclear assembly plant . many renowned russian scientists work there . however , three mysteriously disappeared . back middle east , two men managed dig up remains missing nuclear bomb . they sell them man named olson ( colm feore ) , who pays mere [ ... ] bomb . immediately , wheels set motion . three missing russian scientists olson devised plan construct their own nuclear bomb , smuggle it back into united states , detonate it super bowl . detonation would lead united states believe , due instability russian government under nemerov , russians would blamed detonation . both united states russia would destroy each other while scientists olson sat watched . however , ryan manages put all pieces together his way baltimore when bomb detonated . huge mushroom cloud covers city , many people killed . expected , president fowler immediately suspects russians blame immediately orders counter-strike . thus begins tense game international chess ; who blink first ? ryan arrive time stop world war iii , or he too late ? i found this very exciting entertaining movie . story thrilling very well-conceived . special effects very good well . attack american aircraft carrier one my favorite sequences film . morgan freeman , ben affleck , james cromwell give fine performances . although i appreciated affleck effort , i still think alec baldwin ( " hunt red october " ) harrison ford ( " patriot games " ) better job jack ryan . i recommend this very good movie . although i haven't read book yet , i plan soon see how well movie compares it . if you're fan techno-thrillers , then don't miss this one	-1

my 12th grade government teacher showed our class this film , we all hooked . if you ever room thirty some teenagers , you know its hard get their attention keep them quiet . so really , if bunch teenagers enjoyed this movie , everyone should consider giving it chance . it might not action packed some movies out today , such 16 blocks , but it gonna keep your attention , so yourself favor atleast rent it , you might find yourself coming back buy it	1
i'm glad someone knows enough english history recognize pure fiction this film . but addition points made historical inaccuracy , i also object ridiculous portrayal mary tudor . over-zealous fanatic ( common religious stance those times - promoted both sides protestant/catholic conflict ) , she not insane film makes her opening scenes . throughout film , there this emphasis milking passions all they worth - no objectivity whatsoever . i sorely disappointed ! if you want get know elizabeth period which she lived , i would recommend superb bbc series , elizabeth glenda jackson . if you want even further background , look bbc again six wives henry viii keith mitchell . tidbits gained well movie mary , queen scots ( although few historical inaccuracies found it - example , mary stuart elizabeth never met , although it mary great desire ) even title , anne thousand days . those two more theatrical representations fulfill desire more dramatic while still coming closer history times . this film just doesn't cut it	-1

all these bad reviews confuse movie they didn't like badly made movie . this very well made movie , perfectly competent performances . tone quite serious , ending won't cheer anyone up . but then there many people who loved titanic , which i found utterly depressing . more point , though , who cares problems these rich kids ? not me . real reason watch this see molly ringwald her most beautiful . if you enjoy this film , check out less than zero , gloomy but solid ( underrated ) ' 80s film . worst ' 80s film bright lights , big city - don't say i didn't warn you !	1
dated , derivative , self-indulgent unintelligent . this truly bottom range stuff . acting , directing , soundtrack script all dire . none characters even remotely sympathetic , fact i hoping they'd die slowly painfully . i note billy bob thornton both star scriptwriter - methinks his true nature revealed script part he chose - arrogant , amoral , misogynistic , self-important coward ( zero sense humour ) . don't waste your time watching this drivel , it leave you bad taste your mouth no amount tequila erase .	-1
this first disc all editions this movie dvd includes making-of featurette should more than please casual fan film . second disc , exclusive special edition , goes deeper into just every aspect production , i just wish they'd lower amount mutual " pats back " " tom all his stunts " bit . i guess my favorite " mission " would first but all them great things going them . action films go , they really belong top crop . best thing going mi3 ethan hunt supporting team which once work together way they used old series . i hard time understanding cold shoulder audiences given tom cruise over his couch-jumping thing , sure , it hard getting excited hollywood star wanting marry third time but celebrities go nowadays , it not even worth mentioning it . this reminds me time when james cameron joked " king world " after winning oscar people becoming bitter towards him . i guess some people don't like see others too happy their lives . if cruise follows some religion which some us sounds more than bit loony , least he hasn't anything attack mine like all those involved da vinci code . any rate , don't let mediocre box office results mi3 discourage you watching it . you see real effort make outstanding film every scene	1
one best documentries its genre ; " paradise lost " willkeep you rivited till end . then it not over - cause you start thinking what you seen wonder what fact really happened . i know loads people firmly believe innocence wm3 , i wholeheartedly support retrail . but , never i wished more something like " time machine " - so one go back history this incident see what truth ; see what really took place there . we must guard against notion wm3 without any blame , keep mind they troubled backgrounds . i firmly believe someone like damien dabble various cults unsavoury influences , i thought it mistake try deny outright . instance , i don't believe one moment rebellious teenager would change his name damien honour some priest who lived amongst lepers . just doesnt ring true . maybe their undoing - try paint them misunderstood ( totally ) spotless youngsters . but please , i am not implying they guilty . not least . you watch paradise lost 2 , once you seen this one , it compelling follow-up this tragic story	-1

i first saw this film when i thirteen - perhaps even younger , i recall seeing it black white . thirty years , propelled memories which still stuck my mind , i bought this disk america ( it not released uk where i live ) . seeing again through adult eyes , one notices joins - songs which not really work , occasional twee touch . but what film ! presented marvellous technicolour , cast which takes script seriously not go over top unnecessarily , thus bringing dr seuss amazing ( freudian ? )dream/fantasy life . this not epic . it intimate film , which talks you rather than throwing endless special effects you stave off your boredom . ( it also nothing like recent live action ' cat hat'which some consider worst film ever . ) it reminds us gulf adults children , dr seuss reminds us sometimes adults see through children eyes see truth . but it also lets adults their say well . this ultimately film its time ( early 50s ) but it film which takes its chances doesn't play safe . it film which strange , dreamlike - worth taking your hear t.t hirty years , i'm glad i . why not try it ? - you might too	1
i purchase lot dvds . past few years , it seems almost every dvd comes special edition two-disc release includes deleted scenes , documentaries , cast bios , trailers , teaser trailers , music videos , director recipe three-alarm chili . i usually don't time get beyond first disc , much what i get around usually turns out boring it gets . this time , however , i am happy report two-disc anniversary release philadelphia worth both money time invested it , even if you already philadelphia dvd . special features include 84-minute documentary , one foot banana peel other grave , extraordinary piece amateur filmmaking aids patient named juan botas . what i not know mr. botas ' aids diagnosis provided inspiration director jonathan demme make philadelphia first place , mr. botas best friends mr. demme wife . meanwhile , mr. botas mentioned filmmaker demme it shame black humor , amazing courage other interesting dialogue emanated his fellow patients clinic where he treated lost forever it left their lips . mr. demme gave mr. botas his hand-held camera , results so impressed demme he wound up releasing documentary through his own production company . finished film touching , oddly comic , tragic effecting any piece drama you've ever witnessed . one patients doctor office also given few lines main feature , philadelphia . which brings us film . time its release , philadelphia received some very harsh criticism aids community its perceived flaws ; it judged many " too hollywood " realistically representative hiv / aids experience . their credit , background documentary included here , " people like us " ( which original working title philadelphia ) creative team behind philadelphia ( including jonathan demme , tom hanks screenwriter ron nyswaner ) meet this criticism head , presenting defense their work both credible illuminating . many complained philadelphia void any tenderness or physical contact male couple ( hanks bandaras ) but this not only redressed closer look their scenes together , extremely intimate scene lovers bed ( which excised final cut ) deleted not its controversy but because scene simply didn't work ( now seen it , i attest this fact ) . i long seen this movie not film aids per se , but film homophobia . indeed , main thrust plot ( besides trial ) transformation character joe miller committed homophobe more enlightened tolerant person . one my favorite scenes ( which it turns out many people wanted delete final cut ) deals subtly millers transformation - " opera scene " . scene , miller asked character or andy what he thinks gay people . attorney responds , when straight people think them all , most straight people pretty much see all gay people some sort sub-human predatory monsters , out ensnare children world into twisted sick life , destroy all straight people hold dear . andy abruptly changes subject , " you like opera , joe ? " he asks . caught surprise , joe admits he not know anything it - andy beckett - this sub-human destroyer children , responds tenderly passionately explaining his deep love beautiful music allowing joe see just small piece exactly why so many gay men love opera . he plays aria la mama morte , carefully , passionately articulately explaining story beauty behind words music . joe immediately transformed - it clear he deeply moved . playing piece , la mama morte through again its entirety , screenwriter director shows us music stayed joe long after he left andy home . we see him leave andy apartment go home sort daze , kiss his sleeping baby slip into bed his slumbering wife , while beauty music haunts caresses him , like gorgeous gay lullaby . some my gay friends among those who didn't get this scene - they saw it only stereotypical depiction gay man love opera . i got it right away - exposing joe thing beauty he'd never experienced before , andy suddenly allowed joe consider gay men not only something more than what he thought , he demonstrated we capable enormous passion ability appreciate delicate beauty . this scene , more than any other , allowed andrew beckett transformed predatory sub-human freak into human , not only joe miller , but many straight audience . it remained one my favorite scenes movie ever , small part what makes philadelphia such powerful experience . highly recommended .	1

i agree david thomson when he says few audiences west would content view american epic composed solely battles their contexts . kurosawa keen businessman his reputation west entrenched " kagemusha " " ran " , he knew what ( american ) audiences think heroic mystical " historical " japan : kurosawa art takes great deal its impetus what americans ( or westerners ) imagine japan . he not popular japan ( where they thought his stuff particularly hokey outmoded , hence suicide attempt ) . i am not saying work rubbish - there no " ugly " shot either " ran " or " kag " - merely there more " authentically japanese " films out there choose .	-1

when it comes film adaptations , most films fail some way . think japanese film director could transform one greatest plays written english language mke it his own , quite tremendous . think he could use japanese noh theater images enhance adpatation stroke genius . mifune one greatest actors play macbeth , dare say maybe best . akira kurosawa directed masterpiece proves why he top pantheon great world directors . , course , criterion collection folk out themselves , again . thank goodness them , because it wasn't them , we all would missing out great films .	1

this much more interesting visual chronicle 1982 new york ( there generous aerial views , lots location shooting , etc . ) than horror movie , even cheesy one . special effects used extremely sparingly , word " special " definite overstatement . some amusing performances somewhat redeem proceedings , but not much . end , " , winged serpent " watchable certainly not horribly bad , but it hard imagine this anybody favorite horror movie or even guilty pleasure . end positive note , dvd features clean , sharp print film .	-1
it shame this movie wasn't bigger hit -- largely because it deprived moviegoers more cinematic pairings dennis quaid ellen barkin , couple whose on-screen chemistry approached william powell myrna loy . sex scenes here truly steamy , yet used much establish character advance story titillate audience . quaid portrays casually corrupt homicide cop new orleans pd who forced rethink his life when ( ) barkin , da he seriously attracted , refuses anything him , ( ) he discovers corruption department vastly exceeds anything he ever imagined . movie may quot ; show me moneyquot ; beginning , but end , it quot ; show me remorse . quot ; plot man reformed love good woman lost popularity 20th century progressed , but quaid , barkin director jim mcbride deserve credit updating it fresh , surprising sexy way	1

premise - one could change specific events ones ' past through psychic concentration - could foundation fascinating thriller . i don't condemn film corollary either : each change produces new , unforseeable tragedies . it way story told - its ham-fisted dialogue plot , its forced obscenity every turn - reveals its teen sensibilities . it therefore fitting director preferred ending included here . it perfect catharsis teens who " ... wish i never born !	-1

rashomon ( 1950 ; directed akira kurosawa starring toshiro mifune ) one those films truly hip seen , not many others ; rather like certain books -- road , satanic verses , one hundred years solitude , naked lunch -- it certain hip cache , one cineastes all seen discuss great detail . name-droppers know they need only mention name knowledgeable context viewed awe . truth , however , rashomon sort film everyone should see ; it true classic , league casablanca , citizen kane others . film examines truth , context rape murder 12th century japan , four different perspectives ; woodcutter who witnessed whole incident yet afraid report it , bandit who committed crime , murdered man ghost ( through medium ) rape victim ( murdered man wife ) . there few elements which remain constant each version story -- murdered man tied up forced watch bandit ravish his wife , he indeed die -- but how he died varies . it either swordfight bandit , his wife hand dagger , or suicide resulting his absolutely crushed his wife choosing leave bandit . she demand his death ? he look her scorn after crime ? she really raped or she yield consensually bandit ? honesty also explored detail , wife honesty most question , but also three men sheltering rainstorm ruined gate rashomon who relate story themselves . this one late toshiro mifune ( 1920-1997 ) first collaborations akira kurosawa , his criminally-insane tajomaru masterfully acted . so effective mifune acting you truly loathe tajomaru ; you're torn pity disgust wife ( masahiko kyo , also brilliant actress ) , there truly few really sympathetic characters among cast here . camera work exemplary , shows what kurosawa best known -- unusual perspectives some truly arresting shots , proving his eye detail sharp black white it would later colour ( cf . dersu uzala , kagemusha , ran , 3 latter-day kurosawa masterpieces ) . absolutely worth seeing , proof saying there three sides every story ( wit : mine , yours , what really happened) -- but also proving what really happened isn't even ever certain	1

" sixteen candles " first film collaboration john hughes molly ringwald started very profitable franchise both ms. ringwald mr. hughes . ringwald stars samantha " sam " baker , teen who turning sixteen , unfortunately her same time her spoiled , indulged fairly shallow older sister jenny ( blanche baker ) getting married . sam wakes up her birthday , expecting her body blossom everything roses . unfortunately , her own family forgets it appears she going miserable birthday . additionally , nerdy " farmer ted " ( anthony michael hall ) developed crush sam , while sam pines away dreamy jake ryan ( michael schoeffling ) , who quite involved pampered princess caroline ( havilland morris ) . what makes this movie such staple any 80s fan not just john hughes/molly ringwald connection , but appearance anthony michael hall , john cusack ( small , but early , film role ) , unforgettable long duck dong sympathy shown sam plight . who didn't crush most unobtainable guy high school ? who didn't pine away senior , who seemed it all , including perfect girlfriend ? what girl didn't go thru high school awaiting " perfect " sixteenth birthday ? sam problems all-important her , most teens , but hughes doesn't gloss over it or make them seem trivial . he sympathizes sam plight plight teen girls everywhere , whose biggest tragedy not getting car their sixteenth birthday , or popular guy not interested them . keeping hughes ' later films , all action over course day or two , so " problems " fairly quickly resolved . perhaps not highly realistic , but more satisfactory . also not highly realistic , most teen worlds , incredibly decent moral character oh-so-popular jake ryan . would any other popular guy , upon intercepting note naming him sam biggest crush , keep himself ? would he really want dump his popular , sexually active , girlfriend because he wants more than party ? maybe not reality , but teen girl dream world , this exactly what would happen . so , ultimately , " sixteen candles " fantasy film - - fantasy teen girls everywhere 80s ate up made molly ringwald their poster girl . highly recommended nostalgic look back molly , anthony michael hall , young john cusack adorable michael schoeffling .	1

federico fellini 1972 film not his best , when he 8 1/2 , la strada la dolce vita his credit . while many critics adore this film its absurdity plotless , dreamy structure , i found it boring phantasmagorical . it simply fellini version rome not rome , eternal city itself . risk sounding negative , i shall admit there some moments which it most expressive early 1970 rome - scenes which hippies american tourists invade city , long scene outdoor restaurant where everyone talking their heads off ( though saying some pretty vulgar things ) my favorite scene- underground archaelogical excavation which frescoes old roman patricians fade into oblivion . but mostly this film weak it bored me because there no plot . it starts off alright , movie works well when there no sudden fantasy sequences . fellini himself this movie , well gore vidal . fellini envisions himself young man studying rome his youth strict catholic school ( slide/projector shows ancient monuments like colliseum , apian way , trevi fountain vatican well offensive pornographic image woman behind ) later young man journeys rome itself takes residence large family crowded apartment slum . then young man sees talent show tasteless , vulgar long-winded . i found myself just unimpressed outraged audicences went far throw dead cat stage ! it bothered me there much attention prostitution , brothels or cheap , slutty women . cover film promiscuous woman start film . film rome italy , there hardly any allusion opera or any true classical theater . pope fashion show ludicrous blasphemous . only serious , hardcore fans fellini want own this dvd . it perfect follow-up his equally absurd sexually radical satyricon , loosely based old roman epic .	1

" vendetta " interesting movie won't allow you remain indifferent . love or hate it , i'm pretty sure you opinion this polemic film , based comic written alan moore , adapted big screen wachowski brothers , directed james mcteigue . story begins england , but not england we know . mcteigue england eerily similar country orwell tells us " 1984 " . there dictator , chancellor adam sutler ( john hurt ) , chosen free elections , but afterwards decided become absolute ruler , exerting power without any kind restriction . citizens nothing , they relinquished their right participate decide , merely sheep told what what think . their freedom curtailed , but they feel safe . however someone prepared shake their certitude , make them realize things not what they seem . person ( hugo weaving ) , man willing risk everything order turn meek sheep into citizens , wreak havoc enemies destroyed his life long time ago . evey ( natalie portman ) , young woman rescues sutler minions , privileged spectator v plans , first person become fervent follower . path , though , not easy , evey new strenght forged fires prison . this highly controversial movie delves upon difficult subjects , example whether end validates means , power words . all same , " vendetta " makes you think , great actors , original cinematography hectic pace . my point view , this film simply must see . belen alca	-1

this 1971 black comedy still stitch , even if it doesn't feel audacious i'm sure it once . directed maverick hal ashby , it epitome all opposites-attract love stories twenty-year old depressive connects 79-year old life-loving woman . they actually bond over their mutual interest death , they keep showing up same funerals . however , root their respective interests couldn't more different - maude shows up reconfirm how lucky she feels alive , while hearse-driving harold simply likes morbidity it all . plot really their burgeoning relationship , while his mother constantly attempts make death-obsessed harold more socially acceptable . first , she uselessly sets him up series blind dates . foil any hope romance these women , however , he stages mock-suicides which simply perturbs rather than disturbs his mother . she then recruits ineffectual analyst even her brother victor , hawkish officer vietnam war amputee , try convince harold join army . episodic structure story collin higgins ( years before becoming director his own right " foul play " " nine five " ) allows characters develop subtle ways completely deadpan approach despite outward shenanigans characters ' actions . movie eventually moves toward greater gravitas but despite some soap opera elements , surprisingly not expense pervasive whimsical tone . ruth gordon her typically pixilated self , archetype she played years afterward , while bud cort terrific conveying his particular brand wide-eyed cynicism . it really their unforced chemistry keeps film feeling fresh 35 years later . there funny sideline performances vivian pickles harold eye-rolling mother , ellen geer overly actressy blind date named sunshine , eric christmas very funny cameo disapproving priest . cat stevens ' soundtrack hasn't aged well , say , simon garfunkel music " graduate " , but it still works folkish commentary quirky proceedings . unfortunately , 2000 dvd contains rather compromised print there no extras included	-1

thing i remember most this film when i saw it theater 1990 its honesty . every level . great care taken accurately depict one particular community one particular time -- when aids first diagnosed " gay cancer , " up through mid-eighties , when attending monthly funerals commonplace gay men their friends . though hiv/aids around decade when this movie made , there no effort part filmmakers whitewash past . they not only show ugliness disease , they show ugliness people response it . even within gay community there tendency people fingerpoint , accusing first victims more promiscuous than themselves , or more excessive users amyl nitrate recreational drugs . there fear contamination , reluctance touch or kiss , even intimacy within monogomous relationships hampered . people reached deperately new age cures , louise haye reigning goddess self-healing . choosing depict five-year period , filmmakers allow viewer see lives group friends evolve deepen . some course succumb disease die , others wrestle their losses rethink their lives . end , survivors try become part solution ; they become visiting volunteers political activists . all its authenticity , film not depressing . this incredible ensemble acting its best . campbell scott , bruce davison , mark lamos give especially moving performances , but there no slackers this cast . time movie released , face aids already changing filmmakers criticized focusing exclusively gay victims . i felt then , i continue believe , this misplaced criticism . all fiction self-limited . longtime companion story one small group friends who affected unknown dreadful disease ; it shows how each them responds challenges thrown them . yes , they wealthy or middle-class white men who spent summers together fire island . but longtime companion not celebration their insular lives . fact , end film , one this insular group , campbell scott character , shown working home care volunteer who visits latino man . i think filmmakers , like gmhc time , aware things starting change . it seems me film critics , even 1990 , forgotten aids first announced new york times " gay cancer " later " gay related immune deficiency syndrome " before called aids . but said , we need remember there many other people stories worth telling , including those people living coping aids africa . my only hope these stories told all accuracy sensitivity went into making longtime companion . dvd no significant " extras , " but transfer excellent	1

this first time i thought movie not worth seeing waited until it hit premium movie channel . this time i admit i made mistake . this movie fun watch . it well written interactions two main actors show great chemistry . nicolas cage plays special agent charge secret service detail guarding former first lady . first lady played well my shirley maclaine . agent feels he wasted such detail wants desperately get back detail white house ... first lady wants him stay . two seem thrive confrontation each other . she her best break every procedure secret service supposed follow . if you pay attention movie you see why first lady actually loves agent so much wants him her . i think picture shows us very accurate relationship occurs agent his protectee . though it could seen comedy ; there just enough drama mystery which cage character solves . very well directed perfect pace timing . i look forward buying it watching it again .	1

company , say least , unusual show . what it , really ? certainly brilliant musical , stephen sondheim . but it taken very special place broadway lore , thanks great part cast album recorded front d.a. pennebaker cameras . if you're aficionado broadway , you already know lot sondheim . so , it fascinating see young composer coaching his singers consulting recording engineers during this marathon session 1971 . it truly exciting vibrant look process , shot entirely hand-held , raw focusing close ups vocalists . performances microphones , not lenses , so you see quite few candid moments throughout evening , this gives film heightened intensity , even moreso because whole thing runs just under hour . still , if you played played cast album , it very refreshing see alternate takes shown here . dean jones emoting " alive " incredible performance you'll ever view , elaine stritch " ladies who lunch " recording lynchpin which this whole film hung . my only complaint this dvd " commentary " track . granted , this commentary track particularly well . some statements clearly scripted , like ones filmmaker pennebaker makes opening . also commenting hal prince , broadway director extraordinaire , who some interesting insights elaine , superstar diva , just her gabby self . they carefully drop comments where it doesn't take away original interview moments film , there minimum rambling , which all too typical such tracks other dvds . but fact , this commentary track should complete separate interview section , perhaps gathering few more participants , sitting them down room chat . it would chance pennebaker roll more film revisiting this alchemical moment time . ah well , there very little complain here ! if you're even mildly interested documentary filmmaking , broadway shows , cast albums or sondheim , you know what you must : get this disc ! highly recommended	-1

somewhat curiously , japanese critics not enthusiastic rashomon when it released 1950 japan . today , however , rashomon generally considered film introduced both master director akira kurosawa japanese cinema west ; it also often cited film prompted academy motion picture arts sciences create award best foreign language film . it widely regarded masterwork world cinema . set 12th century japan , film premise once both very simple very complex . man found dead forrest , several people brought forward give testimony matter . some respects their accounts agree -- but numerous others , some obvious some very subtle , their stories differ . each character gives his or her version events , various differences pile higher higher , leaving viewer wonder motivations involved . each person simply interpreted same facts different ways ? they deliberately lie order protect themselves ? differences their stories deliberate or subconcious ? film offers no easy answers . some criticized film seeming state there no such thing ultimate truth , but rashomon more complex than this : it essentially meditation our inability , it deliberate or unintentional , reach more than approximation ultimate truth due very nature humanity itself . much written look film , which indeed memorable . filmed kazuo miyagawa , it presents forrest living , breathing entity ; images powerful , editing remarkable . no less so performances , which require various actors shift behavior each person involved gives their own account event ; this particularly true toshiro mifune , frequent performer kurosawa films , actress machiko ky . but whether lead or supporting player , all performaces equally astonishing . film extremely , extremely influential over years , such it no longer quite same " shock new " it audiences 1950s ; nonetheless , this director kurosawa working very close height his power , while he would create other films equalled bested rashomon , it remains among his masterworks . criterion edition quite fine , offering near-pristine print your choice subtitles or dubbing ( former recommended ) several memorable extras . strongly recommended fans world cinema . gft , amazon reviewe	1
i find this film very interesting , though not reasons you would expect . it two male teenagers living working class neighborhood london , who one day discover they attracted each other . one them not even aware he might gay ( ste , popular athlete ) . put this way , it may sound like your typical coming age gay story . but it much more than . what makes this movie really special supporting cast . they carry weight story . character played linda henry ( sandra , jamie mother ) truly fascinating , her performance astounding . leah deserves film just herself . also soundtrack mama cas mamas papas standout . i think both gay straight audiences enjoy this excellent film	-1

supercomputer takes over world , eh ? sounds like rather unbelievable plot , except this movie they make it believable . , if you believe they'd make computer first place controls all nuclear bombs u.s. , which i very hard time believing most people who make war machines would install some kind manual safety . this movie starts out optimistic which makes it bit dull start , but halfway through it becomes very intense . ending very chilling , makes me wish there couple hours . i give it 4 stars because it bit slow predictable start , but it builds builds until end scares pants right you	-1
this film absolutely hot !! film so full erotic tension , even when there ' nothing actually happening ' (!) . , erotic appeal , i give it 5 stars , even though story gets bit unsatisfactory towards end . it feels like it originally different some essential scenes cut . but i can't say much more without giving too much away . i love very ending , though ! calls sequel , really , which unfortunately never happened . i would loved see robert patrick more steamy action ... so , if you want see two very good-looking people involved loads hot situations talking - this film get . might story bit confused - but who cares ??? it certainly not boring	1
this film long one my top ten favorites quality acting screenplay , importance theme : secret network could operate within intelligence community beneath radar legitimate agency oversight . film seems especially prescient now , given fictional network goal planning u.s. invasion mideast . voila , 30 years later , u.s. invaded mideast . when redford character finally confronts rogue c.i.a. leader plan , he connects dots says , " this whole damn thing oil , isn't it ? " exactly . let clear why u.s. armed forces iraq , rather than , say , ecuador or nepal : it strategic importance region oil . yes , plan transform iraq into democratic nation , which lead entire region direction . but u.s. isn't committing its treasure citizenry all troubled regions globe equally ; we iraq because it strategic linchpin region . without access mideast oil reserves , world economy would shaken its foundations . there many troubled , undemocratic regions world -- example , much africa ; yet we fight now establish democracy only one troubled region , mideast . coincidence ? no . simple self-interest . cliff robertson character says film conclusion : " when people cold their engines stop running , they're not going ask us why ; they'll just want us go get it . " realizing he embarrassment c.i.a. ( inevitable role any whistleblower , even reluctant one ) , film end redford gives entire story new york times . robertson character , c.i.a. station chief who caught off-guard hidden conspiracy , says , " but they print it ? " redford taken aback implication -- government could pressure media suppress story -- then he avers , less confidently , " they'll print it . " this core democracy : free press keeps government answerable its people . without free skeptical press , all elections world mean nothing .	1

considering sensational cast ( eli wallach , terrence hill , bud spencer , kevin mccarthy brock peters ) , euro-western era it made locations where it shot , ace high major disappointment . plot uninvolving incoherent , cinematography cramped completely lacking style , music weak during time spawned so many memorable soundtracks direction lacks any focus whatsoever . editing looks like it performed butcher knife . after first ten minutes , i knew i'd made mistake buying it . boring 120 minute piece junk , ace high hopelessly outgunned any number great italian westerns including corbucci mercenary or parolini sabata series . save your fistful dollars better film	-1

some medical information very helpful . my recommendation this not book someone under 35 , it not book someone who already hysterectomy , nor it someone who young children home . her hormonal theory , menopause time life when we look beyond nurturing our families , look nurturing ourselves instead slightly flawed . many women hysterectomies or other forms induced menopause very early age . i think my total hysterectomy 34 ( obvious onset menopause ) changed my ability or desire nurture my children ? course not . that ridiculous , if i think it too much , it actually offensive . her comments marriage questionable , well . marriages sustain many changes , menopause just one them . open lines communication , deep love commitment certainly enough weather " hormonal storm . " how sad it seems if one point book menopause time assess your marriage . shouldn't we doing every day , re-committing ourselves growing together ? many reviewers commented some her more non-traditional methods . i am not fan tarot cards , i'm not sure how i feel taking medical advice someone who diagnosed herself several occassions , using them . that just my own opinion . i tried look beyond . i just think this book written people older than i am . that okay , but it still leaves me looking something i truly relate	-1
this movie nostalgic me . it reminds me era i miss greatly . many people here criticize its accuracy talking bad grafitti , acting , love songs , etc . what you guys mean ? i am new york puertorican , newyorican raised ravenswood projects , queens , bushwick , brooklyn went school spanish harlem . this back day when nyc tough . la familia , ballbuster , zulu nation ruled streets back then . so i guess i got right say movie accurately portrays life nyc 80 . some guy here criticized love songs . c'mon man . what , people back then projects didn't love anyone ?, girlfriend , etc ? i find movie so real i definitely want move back nyc . i know new york isn't same . south bronx renovated . gangs gone . all bombers , lee jeans creased down middle finely pressed jackets , pumas adidas thick laces checkerboard formation , boricuas their wild carribean looks , its all gone . but i need go back , if not play chinese handball schoolyard one more time . i didn't give it 5 stars because there deleted scenes . why won't they come out dvd including those deleted scenes ? i guarantee you everyone bought this dvd would buy one also	-1

" logan run " great nostalgic 1970s science fiction . 70s great era sci-fi , where future viewed optimism , awe wonder , unlike digital-age , cookie-cutter sci-fi we get today , offers nothing but gloom doom . i just little kid when " logan run " first released , but i remember blown away it premise -- futuristic society young people living inside futuristic domed-city , where you're not allowed live past age 30 . there really no where runners ( those who refuse end their lives 30 voluntarily ) go elude sandmen ( city police ) , outside domed-city post-apocalyptic , laid ruins earth outside-somewhere near old city washington . .. michael york plays logan 5 , one sandmen who turns out more heart than city would probably prefer . richard jordan ( francis 7 ) his fellow sandman/friend who fiercely loyal city status quo , begins doubts logan loyalty this status quo after he finds logan hanging around nursery . reason all this you'll find out when you watch movie . i actually wish they shown more domed-city than they . it really cool-looking structure , fascinating sci-fi concept . but you see exterior aerial visual-effects shots city movie opening , then few glimpses afterward , but after opening shots , movie quickly gets story surrounding characters , lot scenes take place sets scenes location . like redressed shopping malls , because indoor malls new 70 , people still fascinated these indoor shopping arenas , so it made sense redress one these new malls represent interior futuristic city . but miniatures built exterior aerial shots domed-city really cool look . some people , probably younger people who grew up this cgi age , ridicule film city looking fake like model . yeah , if you squint , you makes out few imperfections , but so what ? minatures look spectacular their time . but all dated aspects this film what makes it all more interesting . imperfection more interesting than perfection anyway . but " logan run " one last sci-fi epics . those stand-alone films like grand mgm stamp them . everything today so cookie-cutter bland , production companies you've never heard putting out direc t-t o-dvd caliber movies faster than bic corporation putting out pens . it just not same anymore . but definately purchase " logan run " dvd . it even better viewing it widescreen , it shown theaters	-1

writen starring harvey fierstein , this 1988 film adapted stage play . it set new york world gays 1970s , before aids . but even then , life certainly not bliss harvey fierstein . early childhood harvey knew he different . adult , he works feminine impersonator accepted himself , but every day he confront his gayness . he uses humor cover up his hurts that why this film considered comedy well drama . but even though i laughed out loud certain points , it still poignant moving story individual search love respect . there two men harvey life . one ed , bisexual who can't quite come terms living gay man . he actually gets married harvey new " love his life " , alan , played mathew broderick invited visit . naturally there complications . but two men resolve them , move new apartment make plans adopt 15-year old gay boy . it then tragedy strikes alan viciously murdered . most important relationship , however , harvey relationship his mother , played ann brancroft . she supposed jewish all jewish stereotypical expressions . sorry , but i didn't get it . she comes across caricature rather than real person . , she played role better , i might even small amount sympathy her . this didn't happen . all i amused she tried act jewish . it good role . it just needed better actress . exception ann bankcroft acting , i really liked this film . harvey fierstein outstanding it clear role comes straight his heart . rest cast good job cinematography good . side note , part this movie filmed across street where i live . i even remember when they filming it . it depicts neighborhood dangerous one . not true all . but , after all , this movies . i definitely recommend torch song trilogy give it high recommendation . it depicts time place world gay men unfortunately ended when aids came scene . i just wish casting would better mother role	-1

this bleak , bw film 1950 revolutionary its time , but i bit sympathy those who might find it stylized even little pretentious today . what truth ? -- surely hard theme tackle . seems me whether samurai killed dagger or sword could easily determined -- least today . there would fingerprints , etc . other hand , consider how much story depends interpretation . samurai really look his wife disgust after she raped ? after all , only she would really know -- he doesn't say anything . she really fierce , bandit says , or weeping weak she appears court ? kurosawa really poking fun genre clumsy fighting , or he depicting stark reality audience still romanticized ancient times ? ending really redemptive -- i found myself wondering if woodcutter would go off sell child if it girl . even though kurosawa intended it uplifting -- note shining sun--couldn't we wonder otherwise ? i found this film extremely interesting precursor notion truth ambiguous -- but not non-existent . anyone notice during machiko kyo ( wife ) testomony , score sounded suspiciously like bolero -- but not quite . it written composer named hayasaka , but i haven't uncovered anything , except i'm not first one think this .	-1

one themes christopher guest likes both making fun people who obsessive certain things rest us don't care too much , together looking deeper how obsession cloud their outlook . imagine we talking nerds or geeks , but people doing this stuff don't see it like . they wouldn't care anyway . i like this film more than some mr guest other films due fact actors get show they musicians too , which adds so much more experience . listen carefully lyrics songs - put subtitles if you need ... it worth it . said , there couple songs there actually growing me , both sung mitch mickey . these " kiss end rainbow " " when i'm next you " - melodies catchy . leave real world behind while watch this . you may well lighten up result ! wonderfully entertaining film .	1
two great child stars blended together into one suspense movie . although , you don't really get feel suspense because peaceful flowing music , message behind plot would really give you chills . elijah wood acted out every expression he act out fully his face . you could really see fear his eyes when he realizes henry(macaulay culkin ) planning hurt someone . story begins vast highland then starts off mark ( elijah ) playing soccer his friends . then , out blue , his dad appears we brought hospital scene where mark sits beside his mother deathbed . he promises her she won't die . unfortunately , she mark full sadness her funeral . his dad go business trip japan 2 weeks leaving him behind henry family . first , he gets well henry but soon finds out his evil schemes . henry always gets away all his schemes his angelic smile . i thought elijah great , he always all his movies . though he only kid back then , he acted his heart . macaulay , i thought he really showed sense madness jealousy but lost expression times . he great expressing silent anger suspense . he showed he fully dark side . although he little changes facial expressions reactions ' home alone ' , i still give him credit acting such difficult role . if you've never stage or films before , you'd never know how hard it act villain than hero . some scenes really impressed me especially cliff scene . it amazing how production managed shoot part without any visual effects especially two young lads . all all , i thought movie entertaining . i impressed how 12-year-olds could really well their age . i'm already 15 experienced acting stage you all must know . it not easy . before critizing their acting , you think they're only kids i say , they very professional . if you like movies suspense drama , you'd better watch this . these two very expressive actors . highly recommended	1
i wasn't sure what expect this movie before i saw it . after i saw it i thought it great . tom hanks exactly what you'd expect guy whose won 2 oscars morgan freeman gives very powerful performance well ( fact his monolouge end incredible ) . definately worth your time , book same name	-1
this movie might save few kids if their parents get it . real evil fact many large corporations target kids time they diapers . commercials aimed directly little kids get them eat foods harmful your health . fast food only one many fall into this category . adults realize poor diet harmful your health but kids lured these " pushers " garbage contrary everything we want kids eat . once they hooked they nag you until you get them next fix french fries . think it clown , play areas , free toys , yummy food , what kid would not love it . least movie makes it clear eating this stuff cause your organs shut down shorten your life span . sure adults just say no , but kids trust enough actually believe no one would harm them just make buck . parents must stop this schools need keep this food out ofthe cafeteria . i just want also touch industry aspect exploits work force uses lobbyist maintaintheir cheap disposable work force . sure corporations enjoy big profits when you hire people , pay them almost nothing , provide no insurance , fire them without union mediate , put them harms way no regard their safety but this how we all lose . we all pay taxes cover housing , medical , law enforcement , education , etc while corporations enjoy increased profits . they stay business because government looks other way happily taking money so they blast us commercials election time vote them . we all pay price high our integrity what stake right our way life	-1

even though i would agree " erin brockovich " entertaining movie , julia roberts performance it no more oscar-worthy than her performance prostitute " pretty woman . " i am second no one enjoying good " david goliath " story , but this movie such shaky roots reality , it more tall tale , than " true " story historic class action suit , i would imagine , left more unhappy plaintiffs , than it satisfied ones . however , movie title implies , this indeed erin brockovich story , same way " xena " character main attraction " xena : warrior princess " ( though it should noted xena wardrobe considerably more modest than erin brockovich character ) . erin brockovich vain , brassy , boorish , single mother three young children , no marketable work skills , transparently opportunistic manner , who dresses very much same way prostitute character roberts played " pretty woman " ( prior richard gere character taking her infamous rodeo drive shopping spree ) . movie beginning finds erin unemployed pursuing personal injury lawsuit connection automobile accident ; her lawsuit lost , primarily thanks her own disastrous testimony ( swearing , cursing shrieking witness stand ) while questioned opposing counsel . unbelievably , erin parlays failed lawsuit into job her attorney ( played albert finney ) firm , mainly pushing her way into office ensconcing herself desk . later , while handling paperwork run-of-the-mill , pro bono , real estate sale , erin discovers file contains seller medical records , , reasons she ( correctly ) not understand , seem particular interest buyer , mega utility company , pacific gas electric . erin independently embarks her own personal investigation case discovers pge ( decades ) negligently contaminated ground water ( surrounding one their power plants in/near hinkley , ca edge mojave desert ) toxic , hexavalent chromium . this discovery leads queen mother all class-action lawsuits ( least terms award ) , which hundreds hinkley residents sue pge ( through representation erin boss ) toxic tort action eventually nets 330 million dollar settlement plaintiffs . roberts gives photogenic , if not especially gifted , performance her role erin . movie contains plethora flattering shots roberts ( literally gushing out skin-tight , low-cut , bustier-inspired " work clothes " would never permissible attire any employee law firm this planet ) she engages warm fuzzy discourses unsuspecting unsophisticated hinkley residents . while there much said erin apparent drive tenacity she pursues plaintiffs suit , she not especially likeable character ; rather , she rude , verbally abusive only conciliatory kind when if it serves her interests . albert finney considerably more appealing believable ed masry , aged weary attorney who erin boss . bantering occurs two generally amusing ; unfortunately thanks inept direction camera work , focus these scenes seems more roberts ( strutting short leather skirts noisy , five-inched-heeled mules ) than sometimes-interesting personality dynamics seemingly exists two characters . aaron eckhart plays affable , gentle biker next-door-neighbor , george , who becomes erin boyfriend-by-convenience . " convenience " factor totally one-sided erin benefit exclusively ; she unabashedly uses george free , live-in childcare , thereby giving her necessary freedom assist masry they put together historic case . erin eventually winds up receiving staggering two million dollar " bonus " check ( masry ) when tort action case settles ; contrastingly , george gets " thanks " his nanny services erin his walking papers . plaintiffs case assortment simple individuals unpretentious outlooks life , who dealt dirty hand utility giant . though hinkley residents sympathetically portrayed , make no mistake-this movie erin brockovich ( indeed , i not think there single scene which chacracter not present ) less brave struggles life-threatening , generation-spanning illnesses real-life plaintiffs forced face , due toxicity their water source . erin brockovich presented viewing audience ( typical hollywood fashion ) sort heroine ; but fairness it would seem more accurate say she woman who indiscriminately used people , walked others when necessary seized opportunity after opportunity until she eventually struck it lucky got rich . movie entertaining-absolutely . inspiring- not even slightly .	-1
plot synopsis please read amazon review . i wish talk reasons why you love this film . longtime fan both sam raimi ( evil dead series ) bill paxton ( aliens , twister ) , i went see this opening night . not many people claim this i'm sure because it , such small film received next no marketing . shame . this film best tradition modern film noir including blood simple fargo , both made cohen brothers . film buffs able draw connections those films their filmakers , so i won't bother get into . should you seen either these films enjoyed them , i suggest you stop reading immediately rent simple plan . if not , keep reading i try express why this film so remarkably brilliant . why i hope you take look it . simple plan , its core , four people . underneath all plot devices twists , it how they relate one . notice i did't say characters , because this film doesn't actors simply delivering dialogue . it people you get know , understand sympathise they undergo most brutal dilemmas . sure , finding mysterious bag filled money excellent plot device , but heart this film much simpler than . it basic human flaw committing criminal act trying weasel your way out it . forced most unthinkable things process . that what gives this film such depth . you watch these people try figure out how cover every angle so they get away stealing whole lot cash . end it falls apart two reasons : details human factor . they say devil details this never truer than crime . human factor , where greed concerned , people cannot trust one because they fear other person greed while unable satisfy their own . many respects this film almost homage blood simple fargo , but many ways i think it superior . i often draw comparison scene which both simple plan blood simple where body increasingly difficult dispose . even afterwards , after emotional toll taken , once one evil act committed , sure follow . it so painfully facsinating watch person work out their problem camera , frantically going over details their mind , all while their heart beating mile minute . bill paxton this better than anyone . he such likable man ( both film life ) you can't help but feel sorry mess he created . his entire performance balancing act getting away seemingly harmless crime , keeping his partners bay their mouths shut while prodded his conspirator wife . may make them all sound malicious , but really opposite actually true . they're all normal folks , like we've all seen hundred times . end it really gets you because you imagine how you would react same situations they find themselves . after all , you faced choice steal couple million dollars no one would miss , what would you ? but then again , nothing ever simple	1

" greetings " offbeat satire very young brian de palma starring equally young robert de niro . vignettes focus three friends . first there jon rubin ( de niro ) , aspiring filmmaker who idea creating " peep art . " this would consist filming " private moments , " then letting people view them through tiny windows , thereby re-creating peeping tom experience ( more this de palma much better 1970 film , " hi , mom ! " ) . however , if you expecting see amazing performance one great actors his generation early film , you going disappointed . de niro comes off overly mannered bit forced his performance , especially comparison his two co-stars . his best moment off-screen he talks woman through going bed his peep art ( she repeatedly forgets not talk ) . but he lot better two years later decent career , least until he started making credit card commercials . first there lloyd clay ( gerrit graham ) , conspiracy nut so obsessed jfk assassination half-naked woman sleeping his bed just opportunity show paths indicated bullet holes not match up ( unless jfk shot while standing his head ) . lloyd shares his deep , dark thoughts directly viewing audience he argues vigorously convince us he right . but sometimes he finds people real world assault his blow-ups zapruder film reduce assassination rorschach test . finally , we paul gerald shaw ( jonathan warden ) , who would like find right girl . his problem he his induction physical going vietnam really hurt his love life . fortunately , lloyd jon fully ideas how paul get army reject him , everything pretending gay coming sergeant ( lloyd idea ) volunteering shoot not only vietcong but also any american troops color ( jon brainstorm ) . there no real narrative thread here , which hardly criticism because " greetings " more ancestor " groove tube , " " saturday night live , " " second city tv " history contemporary sketch comedy heavy satirical bent . difference what de palma his friends come up " greetings " more experimental guerilla theater than really polished sketch comedy . but there something compelling its enthusiasm , which makes us forgive filmmaker his actors when things go bit too long . de palma admitted influenced godard french " nouvelle vague " cinema , which inspired going out street trying improvise scenes ( only they not enough film improvise , so they ended up rehearsing most film save money ) . but even this early work , de palma clearly into doing everything you movie camera ( inter-titles , split-screen , slow-motion , fast-motion , etc . ) . " greetings " historical footnote cinematic history inasmuch it first film u.s. given " " rating ( later changed " , " which what it would qualify today because some shots nude women ) . terms social history " greetings " represents some counter-culture politics late 1960s . it almost thirty years since i first saw " greetings " " hi , mom !

this what science fiction supposed , thought provoking . excellent imagery . superb plot . well developed . wonderful ending .	1
many say books always far better then movies . i agree this . i read whole entire series ; anne green gables rilla ingleside . i devoured every single one , enjoyed all characters sad when i finished reading them . but i say movie very , very good ! megan follows superb job portraying anne , jonathan crombie so good gilbert . every single actor beautiful job made their personalities come alive . i heard myself say , " they shouldnt made movie book , they ruined everything doing so . " but when i watch anne green gables , i say this differen t.t hey only brought more story different way . anne avonlea continuation story , i loved one just much . i say though , anne green gables continuing story disapointed me very much . they changed plot , characters still what you loved but joy you usually felt when you watched first two isn't felt when you watch this one . it so different book it made me mad . part i like it though , when anne gilbert get married , its bittersweet yet lovely part movie . end when anne finally finds gilbert , its beautiful moment too . so my opinion this : buy anne green gables , anne avonlea , story told beautiful way . but only rent anne green gables continuing story , don't buy it	1

other film reviewers characterized nicholas ray primarily strong director film noir other dramatic creations focused individual psyche . many his films attained cult status , many relatively low budget , i.e. , lonely place , dangerous ground , etc . this film quite different them . screenwriter , philip yordan , wrote many hard-hitting dramas spanning three decades , this screenplay continued his excellence realistic , spare dialogue . there no long-winded speeches this film , it achieved its purpose largely because way ray directed it . yordan collaborated nicholas ray few other films , two them fashioned , king kings , similar dramatic structure taking place two thousand years ago . if one sensitive person , he or she automatically drawn this film . nicholas ray definite romantic streak his soul , which amply delineated king kings ' many scenes viewed over over . pick virtually any scene movie , you not able stop yourself feeling ray sensitivity portrayed these bibilical characters . however , it not just screenplay direction , but overall production itself , make this film truly memorable . i think you mood film length , it far cry visually stimulating films you see these days , ones which quick cut rule . not nicholas ray , though , viewer plenty opportunities study film characters , since ray camera spends just right amount time each characters ' faces us feel their emotions . characters ' movements key appreciating film ; there no other director who could convey feeling through movemen t.t he acting uniformly excellent , aided yordan realistic dialogue . several reviewers lauded jeffrey hunter jesus , which deserved , while robert ryan demonstrated range accomplish role john baptist great authority . unfortunately , his role typically short it left ryan devotees again jonesing more him picture . this sad state ryan seemed experience too many his films . king kings ' use 70 mm technirama wasn't lost this dvd , which brings true light imaginative sets , colorful costumes one actually notices when watching film . orson welles provided stirring narration penned ray bradbury . reason welles allegedly dissassociated himself film must viewed context film background circumstances . film cut pasted producer samuel bronston , characters deleted final editing phase . one actually see british actor , anthony steele , background few seconds when jesus arrives jerusalem palm sunday . i would love seen unexpurgated version film . acting superb all cast members ; hurd hatfield performance called over top internet reviewer , absurd statement . his performance perfect my opinion . also , rip torn , quite appropriate , frank thring , complicated portrait , harry guardino * ignore new york accent , bridget bazlen , rita gam , viveca lindfors , siobhann mckenna , all well , lindfors mckenna very affecting their sensitivity , character actor , royal dano , emaciated but convincing his cowardice , ron randell , australian actor who should better success hollywood , guy rolphe george coulouris ( their roles seem clearly shortened , especially coulouris ) . i second motion 99 percent reviewers this movie , i.e. , those who liked appreciated film . it must-see , must own , particularly if you high definition widescreen television . colors cinematography , coupled continuously engaging score , amazing . some scenes so gorgeously re-created they brought back memories i seeing film theater when it came out 1961 . technicolor really comes through when viewed under ideal circumstances	1

" we tell you what think .

( 3.5 /5 stars ) brian depalma film , one usually expect good deal more than simply involving story . he talented craftsman , who delights making his films into experience . " femme fatale , " which depalma both wrote directed , he draws us onset refusing show face our heroine . then , prolonged scene set up story , which ravel " bolero " used good effect . set against backdrop film premiere cannes film festival , this scene wonder behold . plot film rather implausible requires some suspension disbelief order appreciate it . if one invest time effort , however , film provides enough action plot hold one interest . ultimately , depalma gives his audience credit recognizing difference fact fiction , so he fun plot twists turns . i won't go into story here because i don't want give away anything . fans antonio banderas might disappointed because he doesn't show up first forty-five minutes or so . this really rebecca romijn movie , she very decent job . it worth watching least once might worth owning if you depalma or romijn fan .	-1

this episode star trek , " man trap " my earliest memory what would become lifelong enjoyment franchise . truthfully , " man trap " terrified me ( i maybe two , or three , although i am sure time series limping it third season i seeing repeat first time ); star trek considered " adult programming " , such i not allowed watch it - i used sneak behind couch while my grandfather watched it nights i stayed their house , then would lay awake my bed scared what i'd seen , but excited just same . like space show i enjoyed terrified ( lost space ) , i didn't recognize star trek anything but world i wanted very much , but remained frightened anyhow ( i , i said , very young ) .	-1
flipping through cable stations late one night , i came across bearded alan bates intellectually poetically analogizing fig " female part " before party mesmerized embarrassed picnickers . i , too , mesmerized , especially quiet , deep , limpid restraint scene , little subtle expressions faces main characters revealing their fundamental natures , bates clear , precise voice , his deadly serious playfulness , rich green english countryside , etc . oliver reed reaction monologue especially impressive its understated humor intelligence . i not able finish film , but what i seen it stayed me uncannily powerful way , lo behold within week i discovered dvd version borders all places . i since watched it completely part dozens times . it , enormous brideshead revisited , best adaptation novel i ever seen , d.h. lawrence novel ! i'd thought it impossible , but these fellows pull it off then some .	1
leos carax pola truly one most engaging films come out past decade . throughout movie carax ( lovers bridge , boy meets girl ) creates visual poetry which both innovative contemporary . film may create sombre mood throughout but it engages you limit you start looking things way carax wanted you . i am inclined write review this movie because various negative publicity misleading reviews it received over years . true , this not your usual run-on-the mill type even art house genre , but it definitely worth watch . pola ( based herman melville " pierre , or ambiguities " ) actually acronym french title movie " pierre , ou les ambiguities " [p-o-l-a ] . ' ' pola derives shooting script carax tenth draft his screenplay . protagonist pierre(guillaume depardieu ) , young novelist coming rich family prolific background , writing his new novel but falling short new ideas . his otherwise mundane lifestyle turns upside down when he meets disheveled dark haired girl , isabelle ( golubeva ) , who resembles girl he dreaming some time . she turns out his illegitimate sister , secret he kept dark all these years . pierre finds her inspiration newer ideas opportunity break out his routine lifestyle . he breaks his engagement his sweetheart lucie ( delphine chuillot ) embarks journey isabelle - provide her all love , support protection world denied her also stimulate his own creative instincts . it definitely disappointing see even after so many years its release , few minutes sex scene pierre isabelle seems get all attention . it true it graphic but it sensual - innovatively shot use tricky camera shots , colour use light shadow . carax didn't want make it look like one those " guide sex " videos . i find pace movie quite appropriate justice unfolding story . scene forest where isabelle talks her past seems tedious first viewing but it settles you successive viewings . isabelle anxiety , insecurity pain , which she could not share anyone so long , could shown manner only . also who forget background score scott walker which supports sombre mood haunts you throughout movie ? superb cinematography clever use light shadow techniques makes it visual treat - completely sync script . fact this film which tries tell its story visually rather than using long dialogues . i see this film reaching cult status , may 25 years down line , when those criterion collection guys come out its special edition . but time i strongly recommend it those who want unique cinematic experience break usual hundred million budgeted hollywood blockbuster crap	1

three films famous " bounty " ship , this version clark gable charles laughton i liked best . this version my feelings never swayed whom i liked ( gable ship mates ) whom i despised ( laughton ) . clakr gable fletcher christian light hearted man who friend all . his shipmates looked highly upon him , even though many forced join long voyage . he sympathetic crew plight often times tried his best protect them many vast punishments . when christian fully fed up majorly unfair antics bligh his mission , he finally decides take command bounty . christian , once he command , never looks back takes his followers back paradise unknown uncharted island live rest his days . captain bligh military man bone who demands respect all , achieves it through his rough tactics , stern discipline often times uncaring ways . he leads his ship navy war rules book one hand whip other . his actions most certainly deemed unfair , unjust most all harsh . bligh feels fear one captain only way lead earn respect . way he almost seems relish finding ways " push man buttons " so he then take out his navy rules war book give reason punishment . his sole reason mission first , duty second no matter cost ones health or life leads eventual infamous mutiny . unlike other 2 " bounty " films whose capt . bligh times came across too sympathetic ; charles laughton portrayal capt . bligh came off more aggressive , uncaring unlikeable . it easy hate him cheer his eventual downfall . great performance . other " bounty " films good definitely worth watching ( especially marlon brando ) , but best lot this great black white 1935 version gable laughton .	-1

this movie very interesting very well . i don't think this comedy all , though it light moments . i personally wouldn't call it " innocent " either , because there lot pain caused people aversion anyone outside mainstream . but it honest moving . family members conflicted totally believable reactions their unique sibling/child . this french film so universal , it could anyplace if language dubbed . beautifully filmed acted , several complex characters , no easy answers or pat resolutions . feels like life . p.s. boy never considers himself " gay . " he considers himself " girl . " thus all references " bent " much more confusing him	1

_the good shepherd_ paranoid delight , detailing rise central intelligence agency ( cia ) it initially developed following world war ii . directed robert deniro ( who also role film general who played key part creating cia ) , this film shows us rare glimpse into world spies counter-spies , paranoia , secrecy surrounds cult intelligence . much film indeed accurate portrayal history said agency its role america foreign policy decision making throughout much twentieth century . film follows career edward wilson ( played matt damon ) his early years poetry student yale university , periodically spying his professors who allegedly linked nazi-sympathetic organizations , his role development allied intelligence community during world war ii , creation cia birth cold war beyond . film one epic proportions ( some compared it other classics such _the godfather_) essential viewing all thinking people . world undercover operations , no one trusted . whether or not certain individual fact working allied intelligence , nazis , or later soviets simply cannot determined , we witness this world develop sense trust breaks down paranoia ensues . movie travels back forth events gave rise bay pigs fiasco ( also hinting later kennedy assassination - believed some conspiracy theorists work cia ) earlier career wilson . yale university , wilson joins up class upper crust wasps ( " old americans " ) takes part their adolescent rituals part ultra-secretive skull bones fraternity . ( many our political leaders arisen this fraternity some conjectured they responsible wielding true power world . movie even hints idea they may responsible " soviet power " well , true puppet masters behind world events . ) wilson falls love deaf girl ( he certain " weakness " deaf girls we see later movie ); however , brief affair his upper class girl leads unplanned pregnancy thus forces him marry . ( however , it should pointed out one gets impression " elites " manipulating whole thing behind scenes anyway , because throughout movie never once definitive proof provided child even his . furthermore , he go away long time aid allied war effort thus not even there see his newborn son . ) his early days spying university professors ( or they really ? ) , wilson becomes more more involved intelligence community . this leads him serve side allies during world war ii . following world war ii , allied leaders make trade nazi scientists jewish scientists , thus begins cold war soviet power america britain contend control world . eventually series events force wilson make ultimate sacrifice - one many his desire further aims american imperialism consolidate power cia . movie also shows hints such historical realities presence homosexuals intelligence community ( fact their homosexuality used blackmail them - rites skull bones fraternity could also described vaguely homoerotic matter ! ) cia experiments drugs ( particular lsd ) . there some rather chilling lines uncanny prophecies this movie which haunted me days following my viewing it . one point robert deniro character remarks it " clerks civil servants " who gave hitler his power , thus it necessary somehow limit cia power because otherwise it runs risk creating totalitarian surveillance state . secondly , one point movie matt damon character ( wilson ) asked joe pesci ( playing italian mobster ) what " his people " ( presumably upper crust wasps ) , mentioning italians church , jews their tradition , blacks their music . this , damon replies they united states america rest just visitors here . point , it said people cia never put " " front cia . when asked why , they reply putting " " front cia would like putting " " front god . ( angelina jolie character remarks several occassions during dinners skull bones fraternity they first account all members bonesmen then invoke god . she puts it , " agency first , god second . " ) these some chilling lines movie . ultimately movie raises some very disturbing questions nature government . america heads further further towards surveillance state ( brought further direction each impending war ) , it becomes necessary examine where we come . asked movie , elite controllers who make break world events try keep war minimum , or they merely use war further their own agendas consolidate their power ? certainly scary question ponder . i feel this movie offers much think ( ultimately very frightening ! ) , but so long tough questions remain unasked people remain asleep wheel , it much easier those power slide us off into totalitarianism . finally , i should say i find it odd this movie ( which not only offers much food thought but genuinely very well put together ) gathered such low reviews . perhaps it just further indication fact public not like think ask questions this scary itself .	1

i went into my viewing ' departed ' more than bit cynicism . seen film ' departed ' based upon - hong kong thriller ' infernal affairs ' - i prepared take snobbish view original far superior . adding my skepticism neat little line i read press effect hollywood just bestowed upon martin scorsese its best picture prize what , most opinions , approximately mr. scorsese sixth-best film . [ instance , ' departed ' could second-coming ' godfather ' no way could it surpass brilliance scorsese ' goodfellas . ' i hope there more than few voters now kicking themselves casting their votes ' dances wolves ' - film hasn't aged well all , especially given costner post-wolves car wreck career vs . scorsese decades-long brilliance . ] anyway , surprise , surprise : ' departed ' brilliant its own merits . it borrows - but not copy exactly - alan mak felix chong original conception . three things make ' departed ' succeed : 1 . scorsese uncompromising vision - ' infernal affairs ' featured some some pulled punches : fateful fall building ends bloodless , almost artful landing car roof ; ending seems crafted sequel mind ( , indeed , ' infernal affairs ' spawned profitable trilogy ) . no such pullback scorsese : same fateful fall results shocking splatter blood ; film brutal denouement - which ends quite differently original - lays waste any possibility sequel . 2 . william monahan brilliant adaptation - his script mashes up mak/chong ' affairs ' tale elements ' brothers bulger . ' result hand-in-glove fit its boston setting . , native bostonian , i found most accents spot-on , led locals mark wahlberg matt damon . 3 . damon/dicaprio/wahlberg triumvirate - these three guys outstanding . damon continues choose great roles perform brilliantly them . he key film , sell covert version himself both his police superiors movie audience . he goes full-out , southie-bred bostonian here . it awesome portrayal . those who think that not acting , compare him here vs . takes jason bourne tom ripley . this guy force . dicaprio his equal here , but surprise here wahlberg . his role simply didn't exist ' affairs . ' it relatively small part , but wahlberg completely steals every single second he screen . he deserved oscar nomination .	1

i loved this film . lot people who like it said it hokey silly , but wonderful . i found it little silly times ( especially romantic subplots ... although i love heston " women poison " line , then grahame responds " it wonderful way die " ) , but most part , it wonderful film really details how circus life unfolded . it documentary feel times , because it really dives into how much endeavor it put show . film also shows actual circus acts almost their entirety , not cut up some stupid montage sequence you'd get these times . technicolor photography some most beautiful i've seen ( wonderfully restored this dvd ) , crowd scenes ( demille speciality ) superb . no cgi here , all people real , all acts real . while there probably stunt doubles leads , it still real . performances top notch , especially stewart ( who always makeup ) , heston . heston great actor , he constantly lampooned current media personalities " hammy " his stance guns ( other conservative issues ) . i think it all bs . he damn good almost everything he . betty hutton gorgeous shapely . nice see time hollywood when you didn't anoxeric get part or star . look close lawrence tierney , who plays rival heston . yes , it tierney , who played joe reservoir dogs , 40 years later . train wreck ( minatures ) bit awkward silly , but dramatic aftermath well . superb piece cinema mr. demille ...	-1

bicycle thief ( vittorio de sica , 1948)one things i adore italian filmmakers they know how end their movies . whether it completely understated ( michele soavi dellamorte dell'amore ) or so over-the-top " cheesy " doesn't even begin describe it ( argento suspiria ) , you know you're going get some sort reward build-up . bicycle thief no exception rule ; you see ending coming mile away , but doesn't make it any less payoff . antonio ricci ( lamberto maggiorani ) trying get post-world war ii italy , where poverty rampant . he lands job hanging posters , which he needs bicycle . family sell bedsheets get his out repair shop , but that all right , innit ? after all , he making money now . until , , morning his first day job , his bicycle stolen one city ubiquitous bicycle thieves . rest movie , antonio , aided his son bruno ( barefoot contessa enzo staiola ) some friends , goes looking his bicycle and/or guy who stole it . antonio , consumed more more random injustice thing his frustration indifference rest world his plight , finally hits bottom , expected results . antonio , no point this movie , good guy . even when he top world , just gotten his bicycle out hock , he berates his wife stopping visit seer ( scene that actually one film most suspenseful , since you know his bicycle going get stolen , you just don't know when ) . he berates seer , yes , which later becomes integral part his character , but his wife well , which integral part his character right then . he never all good his kid . he orders his friends around like mussolini . when he gets frustrated , he takes kid out grilled cheese sandwiches two them proceed get plastered ( allowing antonio -- de sica -- rumination class structure , daughter wealthy patron restaurant catches bruno eye ) . all this , way , morbidly funny , yet you know you're watching tragedy , antonio low-rent lear or titus andronicus . maggiorani -- who , despite turned ( his big-screen debut ) one great performances italian film point , never landed anything more than supporting role rest his life -- plays antonio if he knows antonio andronicus , but not if antonio knows antonio andronicus . that great stuff , right there . i've putting off watching this years because , honestly , i no idea why movie bicycle thief would captured imagination critics public alike . well , now i know , i tell you , they're right . this fascinating study man slow descent into obsession , it well worth your time . ****	-1

granted , i saw this movie three morning party , but i think i enough sense me realize how truly horrible it . it so ... bad . it some seriously subpar performances pretty much all involved , script just awful . gosh , it hard believe i actually sat through it . it just so ... exactly what it , i guess . stupid sex comedy that absolutely terrified anything else . thing really pushed this above radar me blip truly offensive tone some material . i think my real downfall here fact i'm gay guy whose friends mostly straight guys . scenes regarding certain character his chance encounter homosexuality so repugnant it almost ridiculous . now , i'm not one get offended easily , but this just took it bit too far . just attitudes behaviors expressed most characters just made me depressed , which isn't really something i look movie . it just seems me if ' gay ' replaced ' black ' , this would deemed racist probably wouldn't ever released . not i'm condoning censorship , but when your tone becomes so ... mocking , i guess . oh well , i guess all i'm trying say i definitely not repeat viewing this film , i don't recommend you view it all if you're woman , or gay , or you care others	-1
" where sidewalk ends " winning film noir/detective story . dana andrews plays troubled cop reputation abusing suspects . fact , he whacked demotion very outset . events get complicated when he slaps around his very next perp- war hero- guy hits his head dies ! wse quickly high gear . da attempts clumsy cover up . his new boss , karl malden , quickly fingers rough tough tom tully murderer . he perfect fall guy , but audience , not mention da , knows he innocent . plot boils when da gets involved tully daughter , gene tierney . here perfect uptown girl decidedly downtown location . this plot contrivance actually believable . da let his girlfriend dad go sing sing death he caused ? resolution unmentioned here . viewers watch wse themselves but those who not disappointed . wse fast moving highly credible . there required nighttime shots sleazy night spots , dingy tenements , dark alleys dank garages . if there daytime scene , this viewer missed it . suspense maintained throughout , even though audience all " evidence " . reuniting andrews/tierney ( after " laura " ) director preminger complete success . this reviewer made mistake ! he reading silver ward " film noir " peeked ending ! even so , resolution wse still great one , almost shocking ! viewers urged savor atmosphere this film/noir detective classic take fadeout it comes .	1
i love films which unfold complexities slowly , use color deep intention , don't rely words say everything must said . end affair lovingly carefully adapted film . fit into time , i feel you must allow film like this stand its own . many adjustments made story , what eventually emmerges , me , even more cohesive personal . one thing i particularly love end affair , color pallette sharp attention clothing . i love sarah red suits , her green jacket , her hair ( carefully suited time ) , way colors stand out , but subtlety , every scene she stands until her character begins fade . this movie permanently affected my aesthetic sensibilities . * most * affecting aspect movie me however , able deeply relate character sarah , i think many people . most us our superstitions , even when we work keep them subdued , certainly seemingly " miraculous experience , " or great trauma ( they usually go together don't they ? ) bring those things surface . i thought bendrix henry dynamic played out film fascinating . it created contrast two ways living really : one figure , content live straight line , climbing little little bits satisfaction but no passion , other all passion anger intensity . henry , way , created passion sarah felt maurice . he bottled her up placed her shelf where she simmered , i think " vulgar sex scenes " some called them , extraordinarily necessary if you want understand emotions going . then again , sarah religious devotion followed her commitment henry , which before vow she seemed no intention lessening , so you also see she more than sensual person she maurice , she also practical wife . neither role she playing . every central character this film , dichotomy , more than , they wonderfully spectacularly flawed , which certainly core graham greene insightful philosophic writing . this labrynth film , rich unanswerable questions , contains most brilliant use perspective i ever seen . if you , like me , like watch good film several times , i recommend listening neil jordan commentary least one viewing , then watching it again . -stephanie	1
these people who appeared soundtrack movie o brother , where art thou . there whole lot more aseach performer invited sing other songs well thebest them carefully recorded ryman auditorium inthis wonderful concert , but it all carefully packaged this dvd interviews , glimpses into backstage frenzy goes concert like this . emmy lou harris , alison krauss union station , late john hartford emcee/musician , host gospel , bluegrass country musicians make this perfect dvd friends over watch . perhaps my favorite tracks two numbers gillian welch partner david rawlings . both participate other artists well , but it closing pair numbers dr. ralph stanley give this dvd stamp historical significance . if you not own this dvd , your music film libraries incomplete	1

" aguirre , wrath god " movie i discovered roger ebert " great movies " wanted see long while . film directed legendary german director werner herzog , whose work i've only recently introduced . i've seen only one other film man film " stroszek " which appeared ebert " great movies ii . " when i review film , i usually base my star rating entertainment value . there lot great movies aren't very entertaining . i liked " stroszek " but i noticed herzog slow , pacing style similar kubrick . this film , he plot could make suspense/action film . instead , it slow paced film madness , greed , other things . it easy see why film considered great film . it great . beautifully shot , terrific performances , definite directorial brilliance . movie entertainment value low , it moves same pace " 2001 : space odyssey " even though it contains lot more dialogue . movie first pairing director herzog actor klaus kinski , relationship just famous films they together . movie lore states herzog threatened kill kinski , while brandishing gun him . kinski claims his autobiography he only one onset gun . am i only one who thinks image germans threatening kill each other funny ? first all , movie spanish conquistadors which makes fact film german bit strange . but doesn't matter . movie gonzalo pizarro doomed expedition find city el dorado . movie oft mentioned opening shot one most beautiful i've seen cinema . it shows long line people walking down steep mountaintop valley down below . plot begins when pizarro stops , realizing el dorado might not exist after all , sends much smaller party explore farther upriver . party led guy named don pedro de ursua , while aguirre ( kinski ) second-in-command . several more key players , including aguirre daughter inez , priest named gaspar de carvajal , ursua wife also there but i'm not going get much into plot so bear me . even though aguirre holds rank second-in-command through most film , he running things throughout . when raft gets stuck water , he declines send someone save them , so forth . out all wonderful shots film ( there lot ) my favorite haunting final shot , which i won't reveal here . i've never seen film kinski didn't even see kinski until i saw this film . man fits role so perfectly . he got face looks like it chiseled 14th century sculptor , wide lips when curled back make him look evil deranged . what i've read kinski , it seems he almost playing himself while playing aguirre . i'm glad i saw this film , but i don't see myself watching it again . i acknowledge it great film , haunting film even , but it only going click movie buffs just how good it . i wrong before though . i've liked films much more once i grew familiar work this film definitely herzog stamp it . it good film , where theme more important than plot . it moves slowly , isn't extraordinarily entertaining , but it great . entertainment : c+cinematography : adirection : aacting : adialogue : b+grade :	-1

i saw this movie when i 25 years old , same age michael o'keefe , very good young actor . i agree reviewer his range emotions ... anger , love , compassion , superbly expressed . i think he should won best supporting oscar time , but instead academy gave it timothy hutton ordinary people ( fabulous young actor ) . robert duvall , course , brilliant always . i seen movie several times , each time it reminds me two struggles duvall : dominance over everyone around him , struggle masculinity father son ( duvall o'keefe ) . this struggle interesting study father who very proud but yet threatened , manly sensitiveness , athletic ability , spunk his own son . first indication this when they playing basketball together . o'keefe typical vigorous 17-year-old ( almost 18 ) , expertly dribbling shooting duvall into increased anger frustation . i think very quick whack duvall gave o'keefe butt o'keefe slightly bending over , very skillfully dribbling ball away duvall , first indication he his father .. boss . you don't embarrass boss beating him . i even thinking , because duvall such jerk -- please michael , let your father win ! next , terrible scene performed so well -- when duvall , furious o'keefe not relent giving him two point extension , stadiscally bobs ball o'keefe head , humiliating him calling him his favorite girl . o'keefe retaliates yelling " this girl whipped your ass good , colonel ! " . i thought duvall would start physically fighting his son smart , but retort so smart , it left duvall silent paralyzed . those two chemistry , truly great together . watch it , performances move you much story typical but challenged , military family	-1
i loved this film . but you may very well not like it all . answering couple quick questions help you know whether you should stay away eight crazy nights : anything artwork offend you ? honest here ; there nothing wrong you if you offended content . if you're kind person who might say , " i normally don't mind ( or i even like ) crude humor , but just went too far " , then answer " yes " . if you think artwork go too far , if you any personal sacred cows , then very cautious watching eight crazy nights . next , you like think yourself more mature than you , say , 13 year old ? i don't just mean , " you more mature " , but you pride yourself , so you don't find joy playing 13-year-old again . if yes , that indicator caution . finally , people who actually teens who answered " no " above questions , you dislike your crude humor any positive messages or sentimentality ? if yes , use caution . it not eight crazy nights most outrageous , risk-taking , potentially offensive comedy ever , or it constantly juvenile or ever over-the-top sappy . offense maturity , there nothing here that not found average episode south park . but maybe because it animated holiday film where many people aren't expecting something like south park , lot viewers -- especially offendable proudly sophisticated -- turned up their noses . eight crazy nights actually quite complex sophisticated many artistic levels . animation exceptionally well -- least good complex most disney features . example , there many subtle layering perspective effects , similar disney multiplane approach , often mimicking " live action " cameras , so different focal depths blurred . environments lush subtly modeled . characters fluid well drawn . there many difficult sequences , such action sports scenes , they're all very impressive . script-wise , adam sandler achieved film both mocks/spoofs traditional holiday films manages one same time . it not different theory , say , elf or bad santa , except sandler isn't all afraid continually go throat his brand humor ( which isn't suggest elf or bad santa bad films -- i love both them , especially bad santa goes throat sometimes , too ) . plot some similarities christmas carol main character , davey ( voiced sandler ) , over-the-top , bitter , bah-humbug attitude holidays brought past events . davey even visited something akin supernatural entities one point . sandler music music performances impressive . focus silly/funny lyrics , course , but times , his singing songwriting skills suggest he could easily career music business instead . while watching eight crazy nights i kept thinking how much i'd like see sandler penned broadway show -- would just thing help knock broadway out its frustrating musical content conservatism . couple characters , especially whitey ( also voiced sandler ) , take some getting used . sandler doing one his odd , affected voices character , whitey designed disturbing disagreeable . but course joke he symbol positive holiday spirit , so sandler again pulling rug out beneath our expectations -- something he regularly , many different ways , throughout course eight crazy nights -- that good thing .	1
i bought this dvd research purposes . i performing " promises , promises " musical based " apartment " . i am so glad i bought this dvd , this great film . that not just my opinion . " apartment " nominated 10 academy awards , won 5 , including best picture best director 1960 . this film speak you many levels . one level , it indictment corporate politics condemnation philandering executives . level , it examination extramarital affairs , sometimes dire consequences . level , it love story where damsel distress literally meets her white knight . then again , it people who fall into abyss , only find redemption happiness they deserve . it knowing what right , finally finding courage what righ t.t he cinematography great , lighting . setup perfect . we shown enormity life insurance company , its 31,000 employees manhattan headquarters . shots teeming , faceless humanity fantastic . long shots endless office fabulous , make you appreciate black white . out this morass , we asked get know 3 people ; c.c. baxter ( jack lemmon ) , fran kubelik ( shirley maclaine ) j.d. sheldrake ( fred macmurray ) . they embroiled love triangle change all their lives . late , great , jack lemmon wonderful c.c. ( chuck ) baxter . lemmon dapper 35 years age when this film made . he wants get ahead , he so selling himself out . he loans his apartment senior executives their extramarital assignations . they turn promise move him up corporate ladder . there humor this , baxter trys juggle " appointments " 4 different execs . but , rest this film , there pathos it . chuck quite thing cute elevator operator fran , played 26 year old shirley maclaine . she returns his innocent flirtations , but some reason keeps her distance . maclaine all sweetness vulnerability . so , why won't she go out chuck ? it turns out , fran boyfriend . boyfriend director personnel , j.d. sheldrake . sheldrake quite married , slept many women office , including his secretary peggy olsen . macmurray plays wonderful cad . he not sleazy or oily . he able continue stringing fran until one fateful christmas eve . i won't continue discussing plot , you need experience it it unfolds . while " what happens next " not huge leap imagination , skill actors sensitive direction make fascinating viewing . there some great scenes this film . pivotal christmas eve scene sheldrake fran get you visceral level . macmurray maclaine shine here ; her vulnerability his meeting her vulnerability incredible insensitivity . brilliant . lemmon shines " discovery " scene when he figures out fran involved sheldrake . sheldrake borrowed apartment rendezvous fran , fran left her compact behind . compact broken mirror . chuck , not knowing who it belonged , returned it sheldrake . later , christmas eve party , fran loans her mirror chuck , who recognizes it . lemmon communicated so many emotions his face , his voice , his body . he such actor . this movie listed among top 100 movies all time , it deserves place your shelf . highly recommended .	1
granted , this production made television they obviously intent keeping it play set design such . however , it certainly would better " film " if it given budget so . prime example " merchant venice " robert deniro jeremy irons . just wonderful cinematography attention detail alone give shakespeare extra touch realism makes truly satisfying film .

i watched this film after viewing nathaniel kahn more personal depiction his father . latter one intimate conversation dead . this one asking viewers share growing process living person , parallel through events recent history usa . leitmotif time history running personal perception interpretation these events . maya architecture , funny say , lot sensuality touch , which goes beyond visual . never any other film architect work audience so moved - detail depiction hand touching piece stone engraved names ; quiet flow thin film water over piece stone interrupted tip fingers tracing history place .... tears .... we see kahn architecture emptiness self order contain infinity universe most cerebral way ; while lin embracement past , present future most romantic sensuous . sometimes i wonder if it turning architecture into too much emotional apparatus ? anyway , i would recommend such interesting parallel viewing two films these 2 american architects	-1

one finest post-halloween horror films , funhouse features suspense shock equal measures . claustrophobic setting funhouse after closing time perfect stage elegantly lit carnage . director tobe hooper made more successful films , but my opinion , this his best . carpenter dazzled suspense halloween , sparking best worst period horror-film making history . this one best period . clever opening credits tip off edge this movie over spate low-budget splatter fests turned increasingly sadistic they tried outdo each other violence levels . here mutant killer his creepy brother ( film best performance ) sympathetic backstory . even sexual titillation tastefully . gore without guilt . i loved it	-1
tobe hooper , who recently unsettling dance dead episode masters horror showtime , well family classic , texas chain saw massacre ( 1974 ) , presents not so pretty picture carnival life , somewhat pathetic-albeit homicidal-monster decidedly unhandsome visage , penchant mayhem . opening film nod halloween psycho , two other masterworks genre , there builds into creepy story revolving around teen lust , sleazy carnival characters , `man-made ' monster needs like everyone else , but simply cannot satisfy them more socially acceptable ways . fascinating subtext running through story it variation tragedy dr. frankenstein his monster . tobe hooper tale , monster one born genetic mutation , cleverly foreshadowed freak animals alive tent exhibit , where fetal brother monster floats jar abominable attraction hoi polloi . indeed , film opening sequence , frankenstein monster carefully shown , first poster showing glenn strange characterization ( my favorite ! ) , then mego doll-oh sorry , action figure-carried young boy , joey , whose sister soon curses him because his bizarre prank scares wits out her . joey actions also subtext running through film : he dons mask become monster frightens his sister , actual monster wears frankenstein mask become less monster , therefore less frightening others . it interesting note , unlike current spate horror films feature eye ( popping)-candy little else , this film , characters presented choices , yet consistently make wrong ones . we all know , horror film , when you make wrong choices , someone , or more likely today everyone , winds up dead . amy , buzz , liz , ritchie , joey consistently make wrong choices , suffer dire consequences . tale dr. frankenstein his monstrous creation , wrong choices also led death disaster , but least here we funhouse ! funhouse surrounded carnival , seedy , grimy affair filled seedy grimy denizens . there bag lady looks very much like grandmama addams family spouting " god watching you !

sandra bullock plays reckless woman , supposedly writer , although this only mentioned once passing , who , her british boyfriend constantly boozing partying it up . she also seems hooked painkillers . after ruining her sister wedding , then stealing limosene drunkenly crashing it into house , she ( although this not shown film ) , sentenced 28 days rehab alternative jail . rehab , she meets some interesting characters various addictions , eventually starts own up her problems begin her recovery . rehab characters , who each curiously show us 30 seconds insight , seem promising , but what we learn them vague . lame chanting rehab center silly , it never explained why people buy into it so readily . times film played like educational video dangers alcohol/drug addiction , but even falls short there , center clearly lacking addressing some areas treatment . some performances decent , while others not so good . what happens after 28 days up , we simply assume what her life going like ? film seemed better suited tv movie , really .. i could keep nitpicking , but i think you get idea . although it kept me interested , i not exactly entertained , trailer hinted this entertaining film . i pretty much disappointed i	-1

robert bresson last film if very short 81 minutes , chain events two young boys start when they cash counterfeit bank note photography shop . what follows less tale greed money , more tale how little deceit go long way , much further than anyone would ever expect . main character unsuspecting delivery person , who happens come photo shop collect payment his services , gets knowlingly handed boy fake bill shop owner , plus two other forged bills he received previous occasion . this sets off chain events turns life upside down one innocent person wrong place wrong time . it also turns into tale how focused revenge this once innocent person gets . pacing very swift direct , leaving no time way console or relate characters or their actions , until long after images passed . viewer thrust into your face storyline , lethargic characters , merely walking their way through events take place . it almost plays out like one many cable true crime reenactment shows , rather than film . unlike truffaut or chabrol , bresson wastes no time getting deep into anyone thoughts or taking any time character development . my opinion , drawback this we never fully sympathize unfortunate turn events strike down our main character . i mean " fully " emphasis , don't get me wrong , what happens yvon character truly upsetting turn events . flipside this , what i feel benefit wooden , undeveloped characters : we sit back watch these dreadful situations more entertainment level than most other pessimistic dreary storylines . there so many instances this film either require second viewing , or just some simple reflection little puzzle solving bind together everything just took place . i fully understood enjoyed every aspect unbound ties left open ended bresson , except immediate ending . i still yet discern why crowd continues look direction yvon just come , without anyone turning their head he passes . it only piece yet figure out . i've even realized exactly why yvon actually turns violence end , which him saying jail he see character partially responsible him landing prison again , even though he moved maximum security facility . aspect you really uncover yourself , there no narratives or usual crime tips discoveries usually found this film genre . truly memorable film , one enhanced stunning widescreeen sharp transfer new yorker films . it shame it just went out print . there also some very interesting insights into bresson mind 2 interviews . well worth every penny	1
because sheer length this documentary number topics covered , it hard pin down exact analysis it , since so much going . i agree this historically important documentary , many powerful scenes , both during interviews just during scenes when camera wordlessly panning over what remains camps today . although it would too easy simplistic just automatically give this 5-star review say it best most authorative film shoah ever made . this no means covers nearly everything happened during shoah , even its massive length nine half hours . last hour devoted just warsaw ghetto uprising , but apart ghettoes aren't covered . what this documentary cover five six vernichtungslageren ( annihiliation camps ) poland -- treblinka , sobib�r , belzec , chelmno , oswiecim ( auschwitz ) , what happened people their way there death wagons . there interviews people all sides -- survivors ( including only two survivors chelmno , simon srebnik michael podchlebnik ) , ghetto guards bureaucrats , people who ran camps ( particularly franz suchomel treblinka ) , villagers who watched death wagons coming going ( their reactions these peoples ' fate what they claim them seems mixed ) , survivors themselves , polish diplomat jan karski , who begged world stop genocide he knew very well going . among survivors interviewed rudolf vrba , one my heroes , who escaped oswiecim 7 april 1944 his friend alfred wetzler try warn world what planned hungarian jewry . big plus supporting this documentary it made 1985 , when there more survivors around , most them younger than they today . though some people might turned off how much film subtitles , i enjoyed hearing all german , french , italian , polish , hebrew , felt my own listening comprehension german vastly improving film wore , times barely needing subtitles . all said , this film times feels like it overshot mark , since it covers so much ground even within specific topic extermination camps poland , yet doesn't really seem very structured . many times this documentary very nonlinear feel composition , which one level works since when dealing something like shoah , all concepts time place really become unimportant nonlinear , but even so , it also feeling just jumping back forth interviews footage . example , we return several interviews number times after long stretches covering other things . there also some segments could cut didn't really belong there , like dancing couple german nightclub . entire documentary , information merely presented ; no conclusions drawn , no analyses made , no archival footage used . some people might feel this just appropriate technique such nonlinear structure , but after finding out what ron rosenbaum say monsieur lanzmann book ' explaining hitler : search origins his evil , ' one led question why he used some these techniques why he doesn't feel there should any analysis shoah , no attempt explain why these awful things happened or account great evil took place , though accounting it somehow justifies it . certainly this important film everyone should see least once , but some effect lessened lack archival footage , nonlinear structure layout , refusal draw any conclusions , make any analyses , provide any historical background why these events set motion first place . it important film shoah , but no means most important one or most authoritative one ever made . price also seems little hefty ; it because this film huge reputation it costs much more than most other four-disc sets ?	-1
i vaguely remembered this film cable or network tv . time release go-go eighties it seemed somewhat anomaly it highly critical view role first world third world misery . i agree somewhat review " bad writing " sating sugarcoatingof role us murder hundreds thousands leftists just vietnam getting underway . also film reminded me somewhat " quiet america " , " missing " , " killing fields " ... it showcases what goes wrong third world when there outside meddling . romance ( sigourney weaver mel gibson ) social political issues don't fit well they could , or only one plotline- preferably social political- my opinion may made this more powerful . but , like somewhat happy ending , this type sugarcoating , unfortunately , usual hollywood fare . nevertheless , this may gibson weaver finest roles . it definitely their most socially conscious . helen hunt , playing billy , transgendered role , fabulous worthy oscar more . journalists , other westerners , also played very well quite smarmy , case british general embassy party , indicative ongoing power andthe somewhat anachronistic roles empire- particularly british . finally i wish movie could bit longer offer more depth , but 90% films it couldn't exceed two hour maximumtradition . also movie displays incidents 1965 made 1983 , but it seemed like it could taken place yesterday . it too badthere isn't movie similar this current middle eastern debacle .	-1

this movie epitomizes sub-genre " french films " . which say it engenders every tired stereotype what makes some french films either unwatchable or unenjoyable ( other type films france or french directors , including jean-pierre juinet/luc besson/ etc , who good sense pacing action frenetic mood ) . explain my statement stereotypical french films , movies question consistently consist stilted drama unlikable characters who not much use concept understatement or indoor voice , whose lives always immersed melodrama , whether or not circumstances warrant it . these films also not seem place much value pacing , indeed regard slow plodding progression indication depth thought , even if such elements not evident . something else seems troubling french film ( if not culture itself ) seemingly nonchalant attitude physical coercion sexual encounters . more than one interview gerard depardieu cavalierly waxed nostalgic participating gang rapes during his teen years . correspondingly , this film more than one occasion where teenage girl assaulted , each case matter regarded minor ( if any ) attention best . there also inveterately disfunctional interactions all parties this film , so common . it turns out , hardly characters particularly likable or sympathetic . father conveyed marginally sympathetic character end , until his encounter lise . one thing i give french credit they not feel compelled towards using formulaic , predictable happy endings . aside this , title apt metaphor plot mentioned other reviews . however , i not very impressed film , plodding execution other reasons listed . i didn't think movie completely terrible , but i also think it wasn't very strong ( barely 2 stars ) . additionally , both film synopsis several other sources guilty misleading descriptions regarding so-called erotic/sensual nature girls ' relationship . if this why you renting it , you very disappointed . otherwise , if you unremitting francophile or praiser foreign films , you find some excuse laud this film , if no other reason than your need .	-1
futureworld(1976 ) cheesy low-budget rip-off sequel westworld(1973 ) , reminds me many low-budget rip-off sequels planet apes same era . futureworld holds up much more poorly time than westworld , mainly because it trys use too many technological gimmicks , which look silly 30 years later . westworld far higher-quality production , coming main studio(this one came 2nd rate studio ) . westworld directed michael chricton , much more realistic " scary " than this movie - especially role yul brynner character . some sets simply awful - i especially loathe one where main characters keep coming out behind metal grate . look box structure metal grate built into - what purpose it there ? ... look wall behind it - it metal rollup door ( it probably kept half rolled up , characters probably ducked under other side get into box structure ! ) ... context movie set , whole thing makes no sense , looks absolutely absurd considering how much screentime it gets . oh , other than weak performance peter fonda small appearances yul brynner , movies ' cast list looks like guest star list all episodes year rockford files tv program ... we even stuart margolin ( angel ) playing main part	-1

dario argento directorial debut brings us intriguing murder mystery . anyone fimiliar argento works should thoroughly pleased this film . while it not nearly violent his other slasher flicks such " tenebre " , not same level " deep red " or " suspiria " , it doesn't lack suspense or style .

derrida said this film : " it either master piece or catastrophe ! " film deserves five stars various reasons , yet convincing him allow it produced reason enough ! ( derrida against project , until it began ) . producers superbly deal aporias authorship - effacement biographic fixity ( explored derrida foucault ) violence signature text production . producers ' brilliant solution reflexively expose play this tension , rather than ignore or succumb it (- otherwise , there would no dvd ! ) . title going " chasing derrida " , how pertinent , but dropped whatever reason . it seems then amazon reviewers - both favorable negative - miss point : this film not providing philosophical depth or biographical richness . it creating aesthetic piece stimulates our curiosity deconstructive thinking , not authorship or questioning , but investigation trace alterity : engagement other which so much fascinated derrida . such , while film provides glimpses slipping trivia deconstruction , i totally agree derrida own opinion : " i love this film !	1

fan hard scifi , i must say this film meets standard admirably . not only there interesting plot - discovering what happened attempt terraform mars - but there both action thoroughly plausible scientific speculation . story moves quickly , there plenty surprises , acting quite good . there even spiritual dimension it subtle rather than your face . center story , which opens character study disrupted unforeseen ( potentially deadly ) complications , scientific mystery . thus , there unknown , puzzle must solved some best minds earth well disciplined military . details revealed , there sudden unexpected developments , revealing more more characters their mission . then there vision future part all great scifi . i found all details believable , somewhat clueless interactive computer voice capabilities unpredictable amee , multi-capacity military robot , environmental catastrophie earth necessitated terraforming mars , last chance human survival . together , this makes rivetting believable story throws some great characters into mix . i watched it several times complete enjoyment . warmly recommended .	-1

this book refreshing antidote modern day bias . during time when ideology mechanics take precedence over truth objectivity , it refreshing read slavery impact various levels society ; clergy political agendas blacks who also profited . few today would disagree slavery terrible blot american history , but mrs. stowe book great job portraying people " people " . black or white , clergy or not , humanity inherent weaknesses - strengths - not confined any one culture or society	1
my impression this movie it seems six-hour mini-series cut down 116 minutes , not too successfully . only plausible reason i see its utterly confusing disjointed scenes would they trying create uncertainty one would feel society recently disrupted some cataclysmic event . if there any sort plot , it attempt young man try care orphaned children . he wants emily help him this endeavor ; however , it seems every time they get together they engage sex , even when little kids room them ! then , they sort break up when guy wants take some feral children , or least children who live like they brought up some wild animal . what victorian scenes story anybody guess . some would suggest it some sort fantasy julie christie . whatever purpose victorian scenes , twice they resort nakedness . once decidedly unsexy middle age , heavy woman stripping completely naked . second when four-year-old emily sleeping , her night gown risen up ; she turns over her back , fully exposed mid-chest down , some man , presumably her father , covers her up . if they needed show fully naked children , it would seem me much more understandable group bath filthy urchins joined children group . little emily coming uncovered , tucked loving parent isn't anything any parent preschool daughter hasn't naturally happen ; it it just didn't seem anything catastrophe movie . my conclusion this movie too disjointed erratic much use raising any personal or social issues could discussed . after watching movie one much more likely asking what all instead discussing or thinking some edifying issue it raises	-1
ok , so this movie not scary , or even intelligent least bit . if your watching this thing hoping truly frightened , then maybe you should go elsewhere . but if you like corny , bloody " horror " movies , then this one you . i watched this movie one day , reasons i can't explain , i couldn't stop laughing . what mummy pulling people brains out their noses wire hanger ( resulting mass red jello ) , demon cat latching onto man crotch , there no way not enjoy ridiculous hilarity tales darkside . crowning comedy jewel this film , though , gargoyle love story . i already knew how this thing going end 7 minutes , but i wasn't expecting hilarious muppet-esque gargoyle . or part where starving-artist-guy picks chick up off street ( no , not hooker ) , , telling her streets dangerous , he just takes her back his place they get it . yeah , keeping her real safe there , pal ; nice line . part where , even though he knows he shouldn't , artist just sketch , paint , sculpt likenesses gargoyle he saw . like it so freakin awesome-looking , he just can't get it out his head . thing looks like toothy chameleon wings ! like something stephen king made up when he five ! but i guess this artist thinks it really cool , ' cause he would put his own life danger just make play-doh model it . what dork . anyway , this movie hilarious . now , all actors play it straight , if not overly dramatic , so i guess this supposed serious scary ? i don't know , but angle definitely doesn't work . so just watch this movie revel its horrific cheeziness . you'll good laugh . i know i	-1
" browning version " movie i discovered library . it wasn't synopsis peaked my interest or anything , but i nothing better i got movie free ... so i figured , why not ? movie classic so loved oscar nominated director mike figgis ( best director , ' leaving las vegas ' ) he remade it 1994 . browning version film some people find dull , it completely built characters dialogue . there no action , no profanity , no sex . latter implied times though . michael redgrave ( who i'd never heard , but saw interview him that dvd ) plays andrew crocker-harris , teacher . whom we only briefly see beginning film don't meet until we find out it his last year teaching school . all his students overwhelmingly happy hear news . glance , crocker-harris mean , emotionless , man ; all his students hate him . only one , young boy named taplow ( brian smith ) feel sympathy him . getting glimpse into his home life , we learn his wife millicent ( jean kent ) frequently openly cheats him . nigel patrick plays frank hunter , science teacher affair millicent but growing like crock . plot simple , but features wonderful dialogue astounding performances . particularly redgrave . i realized his performance great while watching film , but after watching interview i see it pretty amazing . man characteristics voice completely different crocker-harris ; it deservedly won best actor cannes film festival . hopefully this movie gain more notice fact it criterion collection . if you stumble upon this movie , or even if you splurge few bucks rent it , it wonderful intelligent movie . redgrave final speech end evokes same reaction us , it his students . grade :	1

i saw this film first time three weeks ago , it my second favorite film , behind only schindler list . this film contains every element person could want film : great acting , great music , excellent directing , fantastic moving story . biggest thing i against this movie what people say it , it not chick flick , nor " tear-jerker " yes it very emotional , but story not love two main characters , it redemption nick nolte character . this film my opinion best film streisand any man watch . it managed discuss something most men hard time discussing ; their emotions !! i played this my father , who forty-six , it his favorite film . anyone who beyond sterotypes respect story , man situation , not afraid little love emotion , should love this film . this nick nolte best film , he not anything after this even comes close . goes streisand , krabb , george carlin . they well casted , their performances make this film very memorable one . this film not anyone who thinks women only ones who watch love stories , guys only ones who enjoy terminator .	1

if you don't like long , slowly paced movies steer clear " wings desire " . this not film you watch conventional sense , looking plot-relevant action after action . it takes much more impressionistic approach its story . lesser director hands film would simply rambling , aimless dreadful , but end result anything but . i am hard pressed think five films contain such full-bodied , interesting characters . voice-over film beautifully written interspersed , but it not voice-over instructional narration ; think it stream-of-conscious device : characters ' thoughts , their observations ruminations , heard soundtrack if leaking out unknowingly , allowing viewer eavesdrop . this could easily left viewer type scientific voyeurism , but far it gives characters humanity might not otherwise come out . v.o. isn't contrived or stilted , it sort semi-realist mental drip poetic bent , but it doesn't feel forced all . it expresses frustration isolation trapped ones own head , seemingly inescapable prison intellect emotions , top contend outside world reconcile yourself it . this something better seen than explained . i talk this aspect film so much because it symptomatic nature film : meloncholic whimsical . but all it meloncholia it never felt bleak or joyless me ; perhaps i too enamored characters lyrical cinematography . if this stuff isn't your cup tea it seem like three hour water drip , i suppose . i think take angel predicament seriously miss point film , which say it no " point " or lesson all , but then none films i like pedantic bent . this movie just extended observation into collective consciousness , which makes it sound pretentious but it really anything but . instead film end i feel bit uplifted assured , if beauty inner life not go unnoticed or unfelt . i think this film you must take personal level really appreciate it	1

1993 1999 , popular television show japan called " iron chef " ( " ryori no tetsujin " ) pitted its acclaimed one its professional chefs against challenging chef each week using particular theme ingredient all dishes made . show hosted flamboyant chairman kaga ( takeshi kaga ) who opened each show , presented challenger , unveiled theme ingredient gave brief synopsis before winning chef declared . show gained popularity syndication u.s. food network using mixture dubbed english subtitles . due rising popularity show cable subscribers , upn tv network decided broadcast american version show 2001 produced larry thompson organization lions gate television canada . unfortunately , these two companies failed effectively reproduce elements japanese show made it so popular . instead , they created poorly written directed substitute akin watching wwf wrestling match , not challenge two professional chefs . first mistake larry thompson organization lions gate television made their selection new chairman " iron chef usa " . though i very much enjoy william shatner his roles captain kirk original " star trek " tv series , t.j. hooker show same name his more recent role attorney " boston legal " , his attempt chairman " iron chef usa " far too farcical clownish taken seriously trying replicate takeshi kaga flamboyance original japanese tv series . their next mistake commentaries . during each original japanese " iron chef " shows , group commentators ( which included culinary expert ) would explain what each chef doing , well analyze possible dish outcomes . " iron chef usa " commentators treated two chefs if they athletes would even send annoying " field reporter " ( sissy biggers ) ask them stupid question while they busily preparing their meals . their other major mistake their selection judges . most japanese " iron chef " shows included actual food critic one judges , well japanese actors , actresses sports personalities , who quite articulate their critiques prepared meals ; but " iron chef usa " judges inarticulate inexperienced . not surprisingly ( quite thankfully ) , only two episodes " iron chef usa " starring william shatner ever produced entitled , " iron chef usa : showdown las vegas " " iron chef usa : holiday showdown " . each these shows dvd i rate well-deserved 1 out 5 stars poor mockeries much more entertaining original japanese version . 2004 , food network produced its own version entitled " iron chef america : battle masters " included two beloved original japanese iron chefs , hiroyuki sakai masaharu morimoto , hosted takeshi kaga nephew , mark dacascos . it far better show than ill-fated 2001 " iron chef usa " . if you considering purchase 2001 " iron chef usa " dvd , you so your own risk	-1

i consider myself well schooled low budget schlock various film genres . watching cheesy films acquired taste , one not easily cultivated overnight . even some knowledge who makes these types films under my belt , i still stumble over major contributors clunker movie catalogue wonder why i haven't spent time these delicacies before now . roger corman my latest discovery . i admit i heard corman before reference spate vincent price horror classics emerged 1960s , few other films he made over course his career , but until now i never saw many them . this guy giant low budget film , producing or directing some 500 plus movies last forty years . he still going strong far i know , never limits his output one particular genre ; he made westerns , horror , action , drama , science fiction films seeming ease . moreover , according bio this dvd , corman helped launch careers numerous hollywood bigwigs . if " big bad mama " any indication , i continue spend lot time this filmmaker projects near future . " big bad mama " sort feminist reinterpretation those movies depression era highway outlaws ; it " bonny clyde " lipstick long tresses . angie dickinson plays wilma mcclatchie , mule headed , dirt poor texas woman temper desire better her conditions . life hasn't easy wilma , not two young daughters raise ramshackle cabin out sticks . what woman during these tough times ? why , strike up relationship local bootlegger barney ( noble willingham ) , course ! but when wedding ceremony one wilma daughters goes horribly awry , barney perishes shootout , wilma left holding several unpleasant bags . feds involved bringing down barney , led bonney ( richard smith ) , now set their sights wilma her kids . unfortunately , mcclatchie plays right into their hands taking over barney illicit liquor operation . some point , wilma decides she enough poor decides hit road search ill-gotten gains . she takes her two lascivious daughters , polly ( robbie lee ) billy jean ( susan sennett ) , ride . why not ? if you're going embark crime spree , you may well make it family affair . problem , wilma cannot escape lure sleazy , good nothing men . she first hooks up wanted criminal fred diller ( tom skerritt ) , quickly consummates their partnership old fashioned way . then conman extraordinaire william baxter ( william shatner ) enters picture , wilma brings him into fold well . resulting jealousy diller baxter , most unusual relationship struck up diller wilma daughters , certainly lead dangerous tensions within gang . despite these internal stresses , wilma continues plot next big score . gang finally stumbles upon perfect scheme ; they infiltrate soiree thrown bunch rich folks kidnap one them . mcclatchie her compatriots succeed abducting jane kingston ( joan prather ) , but plan fouls up when diller decides get up close personal hapless heiress . then baxter pulls fast one . then cops g-men close . cue gunfire crashing cars . roll credits . who live who perish ? surprisingly , you'll actually care answer question while watching " big bad mama . " i've seen several corman classics now , " big bad mama " ranks one better ones . first , you've got solid cast filling all main roles . dickinson not only looks fantastic , but she believably portrays poor woman looking out her own nothing lose . tom skerritt , actor i've never liked anything , actually manages avoid annoying me murderous jealous fred diller . shatner , well , he probably his most restrained here role requiring him talk softly oily tones . i got kick out daughters . both them so far over top you can't help but laugh their antics . sure keep eye open their dancing routine local veteran get together . anyone dense these two airheads ? guess so . thankfully , performances unfold against second important element makes " big bad mama " lot fun , namely film great atmosphere . while i imagine plenty anachronisms plague movie , i thought 1930s props looked way better than i expected see low budget picture . finally , you really get opportunity see angie dickinson take few risks , so speak , but you'll miss it if you blink . considering what actress role , i'm surprised she took part when she still player hollywood . dvd standard standard roger corman release . you get obligatory short interview leonard maltin , bunch trailers . sequel " big bad mama , " unoriginally entitled " big bad mama ii , " came out roughly ten years later . while i haven't seen sequel , which apparently once again stars angie dickinson , i say first film lot fun . great performances , bountiful skin , sleazy attitude , wonderfully realistic atmosphere makes this corman classic must see movie fans .	1

decalogue indeed collosal moving people said . each film inspired one commandments , although commandments never mentioned directly . kieslowski made these films all one year , which me amazing . this made polish tv , showing television doesn't completely stupid all time . all these segments full moral ambiguity , clear answers never given , just like real life . i love fact kieslowski never answers things directly . if this american production , it would gone 2 ways . first , it could right wing , simplistic , heavy handed " message " film would dumbed down level 4 year old , like " afterschool special " . or it could whiny , left wing politically correct " tolerance " episode where everything would worked out because people basically good everyone needs self esteem . either way both insulting disingenuous . i especially like 2nd film , where woman , who affair pregnant her lover , husband who hospital . her husband could possibly die . she pesters doctor find out her husband condition , partly out concern , but because her fetus well . she tells doctor if her husband lives , she'll abort fetus . if he dies , she'll baby . that very murky , morally ambiguous situation . when sitting through this part , i wondered what i would situation . i haven't clue , really . when i saw clint eastwood masterpiece million dollar baby , i thought these films , because eastwood film kieslowski films dealt morally complex issues adult artistic way . these films life art . there no time this film ( or other segments ) where you feel you're lectured , i love it . it religious things , but religion isn't mentioned . it morals , yet , you don't feel it . it great art , that all , enough .	1

" fun ? yes , but neither great movies . " spiderman 2 " great movie . we forget who actors . kirsten dunst girl-next-door mary jane watson fantastic , beautiful ordinary simultaneously . rosemary harris looks much like aunt may anyone could . finally , tobey maguire so perfectly cast peter parker , all seamless . i fully recommend spiderman 2 . i'm ready " spiderman 3 , " hope producers realize there enough good spiderman material make five movies good this . anthony trendl editor , hungarianbookstore.co	1

i really enjoyed this film i know nothing soccer . i liked acting teacher i found relationshop cf his students very heart warming . unlike others though i not like hair . it put me mind something large furry crawled onto cf head died . never mind though , he looked great otherwise performance surprisingly complex moving . i liked ending unlike previous reviewer . you looking more detail ? you miss point he could quot ; move onquot ; his passion new one	-1
even great actor like harvey keitel cannot save this film . mr. keitel best what they give him which almost nothing . keitel patriarch family suffers through his continuous schemes make money , most them centered around non-existant mining operation swindals . if you're going make movie con games then least tell us something them - might make movie interesting ! if keitel unconventional attempts earn living meant backdrop story family relationships , fine , give us inter-personal drama , but we don't get either . this film drags simply forgetable regretable . nothing happens this film - nothing	-1
i never heard this movie , fact never knew it existed until just recently .. however , i only state how deeply it affected me .. it so very profound .. it so beautifully wonderfully photographed others stated .. very intimate sex/love scenes tastefully .. however , after reading numerous reviews am wondering if some reviewers saw same scenes i ?... question so called ' rape ' scene .. well let me refresh your memories [ ones who seemed ' missing ' this ] ... scene happened shortly after chinese man [ her lover ] witnessed very suggestive scene when brother his sister dancing together .. oh so very close almost erotic !! this scene implied something very indecent like incense .. look his face told it all .. everything there .. every emotion showing his face ... disbelief first , deep hurt when he realised what actually happening them .. then feelings betrayal then anger .. this manifested itself later batchelors quarters when he angrily slapped her face then proceeded quietly but brutishly take her .. i not view this rape , it understood .. he felt betrayed , angry shame what happened .. her family [ white trash ] just treated him so shamefully too ... but it scene he just witnessed she danced ever so closely suggestively her brother made him so angry .. she understood .. she made no moves stop him , she not shout out neither she participate act ! ... also i noted how deeply he must cared her when he gave her his beautiful very expensive ring must meant so much him .. ring which belonged his deceased mother .. so much poignancy his face when he pulled ring his finger ... ending too so superb , i felt so deeply moved sad think finally after she realised how much she care him it too late .. it always too late ... what fabulous , heart-wrenching , moving story ..	1
i bought this my son because i wanted him see old classics instead all nickeloden crap . it good one . we both enjoyed it very much .	-1
say this great film probably overstatement , but it certainly great idea film . gibson looks good , weaver looks good , hunt acts good , weir directs good , script better than good . much . it movie ideas , which earns high marks these days , so few flics make claim . sure , it stumbles bit , ending purposely frustrating , carry forward theme white guilt " what then shall we ? " beyond all , it sensual , unpredictable , pretty damned intelligent . seen anything lately multiplex fits bill ? i ain't . see it yourself .	-1

this film reveals jesus far different than serious detached version one usually sees other films . this four hour , word-for-word , account " matthew " , bruce marchiano remarkably portrays jesus who he - first century jewish man ... compassionate ... loving ... giving ... sorrowful ... joyful ... real ! even his appearance " real " - weather beaten ... slightly dirty tunic ... hair flying . i highly recommend this film - you'll fall love this jesus . i understand bruce plans produce " gospel according john " but needs support - i hope he gets it because we need film " real " good " matthew "	1

lover lane .... no brainer slasher movie straight video its really horrible . lover lane hot spot where you wanna go make out but 15 years ago some people murdered up joint 15 years later , some relatives people who murdered up there ( always ) tormented present but " hook man " urban legend . pretty much snoozer bad acting ( who calls this acting good ? ) . how many screaming teenaged girls we seen movies ? it only works if movie good this not good movie . plot twists turns arent even great .... idiotic writing . starring : riley smith ( radio , 8 legged freaks ) , erin . dean ( lolita , pig tale ) , suzanne bouchard ( joyful partaking ) , sarah lancaster ( four kings , dr. vegas ) , diedre kilgore ( good luck , falls ) , billy o'sullivan ( change heart , rites ) , matt reidy ( hit run , carried away ) anna faris ( scary movie 1-4 , just friends ) one her earlier movies . nothing save this thrown over cliff .... it ridiculous	-1
i went see this movie when it first came out , i nearly fell asleep watching it . this movie not worth watching . it so fake , it easy tell whats going happen next	-1
this any entertainer ultimate fantasy . power kill critics who you feel ruin your reputation deny you legitimacy . edward lionhart { played price } ham actor theatre circuit who loved works shakespeare so much he devoted his career various salutes tributes playwright . london top critics felt lionhart wasn't too original they became annoyed his shakespeare tributes so they always gave him terrible reviews simply because they wanted him take hint something other than shakespeare . well , lionhart felt he deserved critics circle award but critics gave it newcomer over legendary lionhart . this prompted him jump multi-story complex presumed dead . he comes back life aided his demented daughter , two kill eight nine critics who most insensitive their reviews . each critic killed using murders shakespeare plays they respectively panned lionhart . example , one play hapless victim eats his own flesh blood ( robert morley appears homosexual critic who force fed poodle soup ... his character didn't any children so his two poodles closest thing he " family " ) . death came when price plays ' butch ' , gay hairdresser who electrocutes furture wife , coral browne . this film hilarious it two messages . first : critics power over public opinion it often their take movie , play , or record album often persuades public into investing their time or money into something . second : no matter how personal how awful review might , offended party shouldn't kill his/her attackers . ignoring bad reviews denouncing critics dummies proper way handle pious critics . seek out this film enjoy lionhart happiness getting his revenge . critics so cynical full themselves you no sympathy them { however , you pity one likable critic who tasting wine drowned lionhart dunked into wine barrel	1
watching this hilarious sequel original hit film like watching live action looney tunes . its fast paced motion , plethora gremlins doing wild crazy things , all " jokes " reference original , this sequel just good if not little better than its original . other than insufferably cute little mowgie , other gremlins horrific little demons who stop nothing wreak havoc luxurious high rise perpetrated donald trump tycoon ( mr. clamp ) . virginal heroes original back even snow plow driver his wife show up . it all mindless , reckless fun very entertaining . zach galligan phoebe cates appropriately naive mushy ; john glover hoot tycoon ; robert picardo fine glover henchman , robert plosky looking like grandpa munster funny dick miller jackie joseph ( who appeared original 1961 little shop horrors ) good snowplow driver his wife . even almost 20 years later , these guys hilarious	1
this jazz-fan delight : tons jazz , featuring tenor saxophone some bebop thrown . most music nice mellow stuff interesting hear , even non-jazz buff like me . music interesting story made me purchase dvd , which i subsequently watched few couple times . story pretty laid-back , simple tale american alcoholic sax great playing france who reforms because french fan who cares him . dexter gordon unique voice makes helps him become interesting character hear real-life jazz great proves decent actor , too . francois cluzet plays admirer who goes out his way help his idol . gabrielle haker pleasant watch cluzet young daughter . she always seems pleasant smile her face . i don't why this film rated " " because there no sex , no nudity , little profanity except several " mf , " which must reason rating . nevertheless , it pretty tame movie . even though story bit slow would probably bore heck out most young people today , i found it entertaining definitely different . it just nice , gentle story , whether you fan jazz or not .	-1

1970s artistic prime peanuts specials , " it easter beagle , charlie brown " no exception . voices , animation , music all superb . it some quite funny moments , such store their christmas decorations up marcie antics eggs . i wish some music released cd ( i don't know why it wasn't charlie brown holiday hits ) . it classic perrenial show . some disliked lack religion , but i think schroeder quote , " it time renewal , start spring " sufficient . " it arbor day , charlie brown " foreshadowing poor quality would come 1980s . it made 1976 , one year after " my valentine , charlie brown " , but voices aren't good . voices main problem here ( although they're still better than ' 80s ) , but they're not only one . backgrounds aren't good , baseball field more brown than usual , even all plants . even vince guaraldi music isn't quite lively usual . still , this good show some quite funny moments . it fun special obscure holiday , even though i don't know when it . i don't understand relevance charlotte web 2 game , other than just commercialism . i think it only works three five age group . regular advertisement would more useful . this fun dvd .	1
written joseph minion ( after hours , vampire kiss ) directed barry shils ( wigstock : movie ) , motorama ( 1991 ) stars jordan christopher michael ( " full house " , favor ) gus , ten year old boy dysfunctional family who decides one day take it road . also appearing great many semi-recognizable names and/or faces including dick miller ( piranha ) , jack nance ( " twin peaks " ) , robert picardo ( " star trek : voyager " ) , flea ( blue iguana ) , mary woronov ( night comet ) , garrett morris ( " saturday night live " ) , michael . pollard ( roxanne ) , john diehl ( stargate ) , martha quinn ( chopper chicks zombietown ) , sandy `jack klompus ' baron ( " seinfeld " ) , vince edwards ( " ben casey " ) , meat loaf ( fight club ) , charles tyner ( longest yard ) , irwin keyes ( house 1000 corpses ) , susan tyrrell ( cry-baby ) , shelley berman ( meet fockers ) , drew barrymore ( scream ) , who featured prominently dvd cover but appears all ten seconds film . i mentioned earlier , jordan christopher michael plays gus , ten year old boy who , fed up this messed up family , decides hit road stealing cherry late model mustang . now i should probably mention film , which appears set american southwest , actually takes place sort alternate type reality where states different names than those we might expect ... example , landscape featured may lead one believe we're arizona , but within film sign might say we're state essex . anyway , way gus starts participating game called `motorama ' , sponsored gas station chain . game involves cards given customers after purchasing least five dollars gas . participants collect cards , they remove affixed sticker , hopefully reveal letter , idea collect all letters spell out word `motorama ' win grand prize which 500 million dollars . gus travels filling station filling station ( always buying only five dollars worth gas ) , he comes across all kinds bizarre individuals including pious gas station attendant ( diehl ) , motel operator ( nance ) who unusual prejudice towards squirrels , psychotic , simple-minded busboy ( flea ) , vindictive security systems designer ( baron ) , so ... gus collects more more cards , game becomes somewhat obsession , one begins take its toll both physically mentally ( gus seems aging fairly rapidly ) . eventually his travels lead gus virtual no man land , nightmarish state marked over industrialized landscape ( oil refineries what not ) plethora individuals even more bizarre previously experienced , all search final card he needs win game , or so he thinks ( always , sure read fine print ) . if what i've written doesn't make whole lot sense , then you should try watching this film . i suppose there message or two emerges end , but after ten minutes i stopped trying comprehend much what happened story doesn't seem written accommodate viewers expecting straightforward tale . way , surface this may appear film geared towards children but that certainly not case there some violence , profanity , even bit nekkidness , all which contributed movie `r ' rating . there some comedic bits throughout , but many these seem include dark element . one scene particular features gus , need funds , stopping roadside rest stop challenging family man , played dick miller , game horseshoes money . miller character loses pay up , forcing him pull hansel gretel routine his two , small children ( seems he afford support his entire clan rest their journey ) . this tone much humor , so if it doesn't sound appealing , then you'd best skip this film altogether . i'm unsure if i supposed like character gus throughout film he portrayed not only criminal ( stealing car , motorama cards , siphoning gas ) , but he also appeared somewhat smarmy , smart-mouthed , patronizing punk need beating ( which he receive , more than once ) . but then again it not like i related any grownups movie , so whatever ... i mentioned earlier number performers appearing film but one should known most these performances brief jordan christopher michael only person we spend any meaningful amount time ... he seems like decent actor but this type material it seemed me one could act any number ways still film come off relatively same , eccentric road trip into land mondo . there one aspect i found annoying , even after i stopped trying make sense things , near end when things come full circle , manner speaking . times it seemed film weird just sake weird ( which i dislike ) , but other times there seemed some genuineness , so i'm willing give movie benefit doubt . all all this real curiosity piece , one probably won't appeal most audiences . picture format this columbia/tristar dvd release seems something oddity me it presented fullscreen anamorphic . that right , i said fullscreen anamorphic ... what hell point ? seems me those interested only fullscreen format would care less if picture anamorphic , those interested anamorphic aspect would looking original aspect ratio presented theatrically . either way it kind shame there tons scenic desert vista shots would come across much better original widescreen format . picture itself comes across clean , dolby surround 2.0 audio comes through well enough , subtitles available english , french , spanish , portuguese , chinese , korean , thai . far extras there squat , unless you count trailer 2001 david spade film adventures joe dirt , which i don't ... cookieman108by way , andy summers , former member band police , supplied original music this film . some it good , but there repetitive quality got my nerves little .	-1

mccabe mrs. miller often talked one list director robert altman seventies films takes cinematic genre ( namely western ) subverts it point making it seem like attack its cinematic precedents . traditional western gung-ho heroism nowhere evidence , it seems , mccabe mere parody hero director invites audience laugh . if this case , than mccabe mrs. miller would , best , looked upon satirical look-back cinematic tastes fifties . self-congratulatory " how far we've come ...

i seen many historical war dramas far east ( mainly china ) most them not only historically inaccurate but strong bias toward enemy . yi soon shin , however , rare exception . not only drama very historically accurate but it also very comprehensive detailing meticulous battle planning admiral leads each victory but also political in-fighting chosun political factions ( second-guessing nature king ) which causes his eventual death . also , special effects great . battle scenes ( whether sea or land ) realisitic outstanding quality . only problem i find dvd not placed sufficient focus contribution ming china . then again , this not unexpected since this korean drama focusing great admiral . also , entire selection should 104 episodes . i don't know why it stops 101 . if you want more comprehensive knowledge subject , try samuel hawley imjin war ( which portrays yi soon shin more accurately quoting original sources ) . any who only intered fighting may also want check out stephen turnbull samurai invasion ( which more colorful maps detailed description battles japanese perspective ) . lastly , anyone who fan samurai warfare may want check out shogun : total war creative assembly ( now gold version ) .	1

gremlins 2 should definately considered superior sequel . everything this movie top notch b-flicks usually not case . even critics who despised first gremlins gave this movie good reviews . so much creativity put into this film it surprises me spielburg didn't return project(joe dante return ) . everything character development , stage settings , music , overall story well thought out you tell actors enjoyed playing their parts good time set . gremlins 2 no means takes itself too seriously . first portion movie gives you impression it rushed though it doesn't end up way . four characters including gizmo return first gremlins gremlins themselves designed bit differently though it definately better . regarding my comment creativity this movie , you must see it yourself . this gremlins sequel ( superior sequel , mind you ) gets dvd treatment it deserves like terminator 2 terms bonus features ( okay , terminator 2 alot more but you get my point ) . each feature worth viewing there also some easter eggs a.k.a hidden features . first i hoped gremlins 3 but i don't see how it would rank up this one . even if you happened not care much first gremlins , you still should give gremlins 2 look . i honestly know someone who didn't care too much gremlins but told me they really enjoyed sequel	1

this movie came recommended someone who my opinion wouldn't brains appreciate it ! i'm grateful him turning me one most perfect little gems movie come years . i rank it right up there station agent , quiet , small picture very little plot oh , so much heart soul ! if you like film takes its own sweet time unfold , letting you come ride , then get this one . if you're looking car chases gunfire special effects all those other big-box-office necessities , then stay away leave this those us who value beauty	1
public enemy one big three original gangster films " little caesar " " scarface " . i call it one first true talkies because true dramatic acting employed all characters none dramatic posturing gesturing common before . also , much effect made presence sound itself , such frequent gunplay especially last scene cagney character " homecoming " sound song " i'm forever blowing bubbles " playing background victrola phonograph . film screenplay received film only academy award nomination , based upon novel " beer blood " . however , film wasn't given best picture nomination , nor cagney nominated best actor his portrayal gangster tom power . this film released approximately same time little caesar making star out edward . robinson . cagney character scarier two gangsters , though , because cagney came across more physical than robinson . " public enemy " one first gangster pictures talk " whys " crime well specific criminal activity . case lead character tom power , root causes clearly included doting mother brutish father . specific criminal actions shown film , these largely borrowed actual events biographies gangsters earl weiss charles o'banion , rewritten screen accomodate script . james cagney spot-on portrayal murderous thug role made him star . unfortunately , it also typecast him gangster duration 1930 . combination hays code his oscar winning performance " yankee doodle dandy " finally began diversify roles he played . aside , such well-made film , i spot one particularly " ed wood " worthy moment . clearly after prohibition started , tom his partner crime loading beer into truck they then force speak-easies around town . there huge sign building marked " brewery " . today , would like house sign it reading " meth manufactured here " , inviting quick visit authorities . if you enjoy this film , you might find " warner gangsters collection " better value since it not only this film but also includes " little caesar " four other movies	1
man , some my all-time favorite skits this wonderful compilation here . some reason , monty python crew decided re-do skits , so instead their original form , skits slightly different sets costuming , but ( thankfully ) masterful dialogue not altered any way . i guess crew felt original skits weren't 100% true their vision , so they made few changes match their original intent . one many stand-outs dirty hungarian phrasebook , where poor hungarian man thinks he asking cigarettes when he says , " drop your panties sir william . " marriage counselor who flirts man wife because man sissy anything it . still accountant who wants liontamer , provided lions aren't much different anteaters . course you'd expect classics like dead parrot sketch , nudge , nudge , lumberjack song , last but not least upper-class twit-of-the-year , which happens appropriate finale . my personal favorite sketch expedition mt . kilamarjaro , where john cleese sees two everything unless he covers up one his eyes . i also get kick out sketch where people fall out high buildings . this movie here contains best writing some best comedians ever walk earth . it real treasure every sense word	1
i looking billy elliot more than two years . i heard it should very good or even excellent film reason watching it i seen several working title films before ( boy , notting hill , love actually , four weddings funeral ) i found all them much more sincere emotional than average hollywood products . also these british films something offer you rarely find hollywood movies : charming heartwarming mixture sweet funny comedy inspiring touching drama . last month , finally , i found tape . very first moments movie my eyes riveted screen when movie ended feelings emotions overflowed me . billy elliot my opinion billy elliot brilliant movie , easily one best movies year most likely current decade . director movie stephen daldry brought us exceptional , truly inspiring moving , emotional poignant movie . entire story all characters completely believable atmosphere small provincial town somewhere north-eastern england skillfully captured transmitted us . sometimes movie sad , sometimes it funny but stephen daldry work never leave you indifferent . story occurs small coal-mining town 1984 there signs severe depression all over town . you see all around shadow distress even poverty . some simple but incredibly powerful scenes bring us sad feeling hopelessness even despair . there big coalminers strike town but it easy see it also hopeless strike . but all this only masterfully recreated background main story title character , twelve years old boy . he recently lost his mother both his father elder brother striking coalminers . billy forced his father attend boxing classes one day accidentally he see girl ballet classes occur same room he find ballet much more interesting than hated stupid boxing . so he attends those ballet classes instead boxing there nothing surprising after few weeks his father suddenly finds out billy didn't attend boxing worst all he attending ballet classes . main conflict occurs . billy must fight his choice , fight against his own family . there two stereotypes against him . first one ballet girls , not boys ( lads football ... or boxing ... or wrestling ) . second sounds even worse : all male ballet dancers gays . billy not but no one his family except aged grandma want even heard ballet . there only two people whole town , who support him - middle-aged ballet teacher mrs. wilkinson his friend michael , who same age billy who found he possibly gay . this gay subplot easily became conservative audience very controversial question . but fact such stereotypes not invented director movie if you would try learn more this terrific picture you found jamie bell , who took dance lessons age six , suffered similar sneers taunts . billy problem he must fight not only against bad obstacles misunderstanding but also against strong social stereotypes . several brilliant come scenes bright humor greatly emphasize struggles main hero . jamie bell playing billy best performances ever among young actors . his performance ( particularly dance sequences ) so genuine , bright sincere all time we easily feel expression young boy , not director , choreographer or writer . bafta award best actor year well-deserved it pity conservatism academy too often becomes insuperable obstacle many great movies . julie walters ( academy nomination best supporting actress ) billy ballet teacher also great job talented woman talented women who forced teach small provincial town pitiful salary . chemistry teacher student great line billy elliot . two other important supporting characters - billy father elder brother tony also excellent their evolution perfectly showed stephen daldry direction . beautiful soundtrack perfect combination classic ( including nice reference great swan lake ) modern music . original " " rating shouldn't mislead you . except strong language it should easily pg-13 . but this very rare case where some strong language profanity necessary authenticity characters understanding . movie suitable teens it definitely able give some good lessons them . 10 out 10 looks well deserved . thanks reading sorry my bad englis	1

melville farr ( dirk bogarde ) , married highly respected barrister verge making qc , becomes embroiled homosexual blackmail plot when youth he befriended arrested commits suicide . farr attempts track down expose blackmailers , much distress his secretly gay acquaintances colleagues , farr his wife forced confront his own ambiguous sexuality ... i hunted this film down because it came up time again reviews discussions " brokeback mountain " i wanted see what all fuss . it apparently pivotal moment history british cinema , first movie use word " homosexual " let alone pitch argument against britain anti-sodomy laws . that all bit irrelevant - almost comical - these days , certainly no reason bother watching this unless you're particularly interested film history . what struck me , however , what prompts me recommend this film , way it still stands up dramatic thriller even today . it beautifully paced , finely crafted terms shooting editing , writing marvellously fresh . it feels almost contemporary . way opening thirty minutes unfold short course screenwriting : just enough information revealed keep you engaged , while enough held back make it intriguing . duration it remains true demands mystery plot . never becoming just social essay , it almost completely resists urge preach audience , notwithstanding controversial topic . my only reservation around ending - laura final decision strikes me both too needy too generous quite credible . but overall this excellent film	-1

it difficult review this movie without comparing it " postman always rings twice " ( tpart ) . that because both based same novel james cain . i heard " tpart " years before i finally saw it first time earlier this year . my impression it good movie but , waited anxiously so long see it , it something let down . last night i tired looked forward watching good movie . i chose " ossessione " but almost changed my mind when i saw it based " tpart " . after all , i'd recently seen didn't think it such great story see again so soon . fortunately , i gave movie try quickly absorbed into it . what seperates " obsessione " " tpart " quality acting excellence directing . there feeling this movie lacking john garfield/lana turner version . we seem know what everyone thinking feeling without depending obvious dialogue . there series scenes , example , involving character name spangnolo who becomes involved gino , male lead . there any number ways you interpret him his relationship gino . fellow vagabonds political theorist his understudy homosexual lovers . visconti gives us so many subtle hints it up viewer decide themselves ( disappointedly , i assumed latter relationship ) . way everyone interacts one so impressively passions they emote really reach out touch us . fact it italian doesn't hurt its ' passionate nature . i theory foreign language movies ; they require your constant attention since you don't want risk missing critical subtitle . result , we come away more focussed every aspect movie this tends make good movies even better . i don't want disparage " tpart " since it good movie . however , " ossessione " stands so much taller so many ways i'm not sure i'll ever feel need watch " tpart " again . take praise " ossessione " rather than knock " tpart "	1

i seen many historical war dramas far east ( mainly china ) most them not only historically inaccurate but strong bias toward enemy . yi soon shin , however , rare exception . not only drama very historically accurate but it also very comprehensive detailing meticulous battle planning admiral leads each victory but also political in-fighting chosun political factions ( second-guessing nature king ) which causes his eventual death . also , special effects great . battle scenes ( whether sea or land ) realisitic outstanding quality . only problem i find dvd not placed sufficient focus contribution ming china . then again , this not unexpected since this korean drama focusing great admiral . also , entire selection should 104 episodes . i don't know why it stops 101 . if you want more comprehensive knowledge subject , try samuel hawley imjin war ( which portrays yi soon shin more accurately quoting original sources ) . any who only intered fighting may also want check out stephen turnbull samurai invasion ( which more colorful maps detailed description battles japanese perspective ) . lastly , anyone who fan samurai warfare may want check out shogun : total war creative assembly ( now gold version ) .	1

almost 2 hours long . film filmmaking . narcissistic view movie business . film film shot , ends when this accomplished . we see what goes daily lives those involved work , director ( same truffaut ) producer , cast , stuntman . there curious lady , wife one employees , who sits knitting watching her husband so he doesn't cheat her during work . everybody keeps busy working flirting chaotically , only one who not mix work pleasure seems director ( maybe producer ) . it supposed funny , even nostalgic . there visual references great classic directors film history , how film industry changed ... one thing learn this story fiction plays role our lives : it serves contrast frivolity emptiness our real lives . " you think story woman who falls her father-in-law still interesting today ? " , asks reporter leading star . question quite revealing what our world become . sex alcohol keep these pitiful troupe working like gasoline keeps car running . important moment when knitting lady ( mentioned before ) gets tired watching so much promiscuity going around starts yelling whole crew . what role she play ? she typical conservative fun-spoiler ? or she truffaut alter-ego ? hard say . that one reason why this whole film pointless . it just describes what goes , which not interesting all , there no plot , there no interesting characters , only adults acting children acting adults . scene director assistant , sexy gal , after one female workers runs away stuntman leaves her lover , says " i could leave man film , but never film man " , which doesn't make her any more likeable me . least if it only 60 or 80 minutes film i would given it 3 stars . film empty pointless its characters .	-1

koreans honor their greatest military hero this epic drama which takes place late 1500s . career tactics this admiral still studied u.s. naval academy , doubtless those other nations . screenplay based couple novels , so there some fiction , but life yi soon shin well documented , so there plenty fact supporting story . if you not familiar korean drama , it good keep mind this not hollywood product , but they very well special effects such considering non-hollywood budgets involved , it easy see past all enjoy tale told . it long series , but presents epic power , depth dimension well worth watching it unfold through each every episode . it would great also see kbs make other dramas available viewing through amazon , such " seoul 1945 " .	1
finally , i get my first chance see this brigitte lin so many martial arts film fans keep talking . she beautiful , delicate , absolutely deadly lien , mysterious assassin raised wolves later trained martial arts . or without white hair , she all but untouchable battle . only real problem she wrong side fight , serving elite assassin evil cult led , uh , unique brother-sister pairing attacks eight clans . cho yi-hang ( leslie cheung ) designated successor current master wu tang clan , which makes him de facto future leader united eight clans . he doesn't really cherish role , though ; fact , he doesn't even see real reason fight until such time cult actually acted against eight clans some way . when battle finally joined , cho dishonors his master his kinsmen taking off enemy elite assassin . he thinks two them start new life themselves elsewhere , leave fighting dying others , basically escape their obviously precarious situation - but there always repercussions such bold actions this . this especially true when you fail honor promise you made utmost earnestness . there less fighting action than you might expect - but it always treat when lien shows up . she literally makes mincemeat out her enemies nothing more than strong rope ; i mean , this girl just wicked fast , she would just soon snap your head off look you - although , it must said cho manage see more her than any other man ever lived tell . obviously , there romantic element story ; it sort romeo juliet star-crossed lovers theme , except montagues capulets never went so far go around beheading each other . romantic dimension actually rather subtle , any viewers who miss full impact revelations toward end may well wonder how this could considered much love story all . director ronny yu bride white hair beautiful film , but i must admit i felt it lacked certain vitality ; picture always seem somewhat cloudy some indistinct kind way , making print look older than it ( film released 1993 ) . still , perhaps real beauty film its ability succeed multiple levels . naturally , there obvious martial arts romantic themes , but this movie also offers up intriguing study good evil , particular , one personal responsibility toward others both sides conflict	-1

elementary school kid during ' 50s , i still remember " duck cover " song . " atomic cafe " excellent look into past see just how dangerous new technology when expected benefits exaggerated known hazards considered insignificant . i remember article how nuclear power plants would provide us so much energy we would pay monthly flat rate $25 unlimited power . no one foresaw three mile island or chernobyl . only real voice questioned our headlong rush into nuclear age producers science-fiction movies because , 1950s , any politician or scientist who questioned our nuclear policy condemned communist .

james cagney scores coup his role tom powers movie called public enemy , which chronicles rise fall tom powers within criminal element . tom sidekick , matt doyle , played well edward woods . decision move cagney into leading role let matt doyle played edward woods works very well this picture . movie begins early 1900s when tom matt already up no good young street thugs . theft , making people fall down , con jobs routine parts their juvenile world . movie progresses see tom matt into early adult lives when they eventually move up gangster world chicago . they also switch " employers ; " they go working peanuts putty nose ( murray kinnell ) making big money working big mobster paddy ryan ( robert emmett o'connor ) . public enemy great job displaying effects tom lifestyle members his household . tom brother mike , played so ably donald cook , acts very convincingly show his disdain his brother involvement organized crime . tom mother , played beryl mercer , remains blissfully unaware tom involved quite so deeply mob . jean harlow only actor this film who could used more plot ; her part good one but not great one . look jean playing gwen allen , love interest tom partway through picture . she acts wonderfully . film direction william wellman shines through all way through picture . most graphic violence what we never see -- instead camera pans away show reaction matt face when tom kills somebody , or camera focuses record playing victrola when death come . other reviewers note this enhances seriousness violence -- they right . excellent ! sound quality excellent 76 year old film ; cinematography excellent . characters well framed within camera only off center when it enhances quality scene . dvd bonus features only add this terrific experience . particular i liked 20 minute extra entitled beer blood . this extra focuses jimmy cagney how he participated making this classic movie . newsreel shorts reflect good judgment they greatly enhance overall experience watching this movie . i highly recommend this film fans jimmy cagney . people who enjoy films organized crime consider public enemy classic , too .	1

warning : movie spoiler below !!! i confess my primary reason buying copy this film , grounded recent history . i around early 80s , when . ron hubbard his scientologists going full-bore logistics making book into movie ( hero depicted original edition paperback looked like chuck norris , or so i thought ) , when all sudden hubbard died , whole project apparently fell apart . back then , i close 20 years old i curious whatever it these scientologists turned supposed help improve person quality life ... then i read larry wollersheim 1985 lawsuit . you figure rest out yourself . anyhow , oh , yeah , movie ... storyline your basic alien invasion number , i.e. , invaders arrived make life miserable poor humans ( this film , aliens look lot like klingons star trek ) , until your typical dashing young male hero organizes band his fellow humans rise up tell invaders get off our planet . pretty simple straightforward , but hey , there other films much worse than battlefield earth , they've taught me if you good enough special effects , even lamest sci-fi storylines work ! thing stood out this film , though , its reliance everyday talk contemporary cliches much its dialogue , result , it came across rather corny ... film recommended its comedy value , rather than things like epic space battle scenes . also , " bad guy " aliens use some sort psychic power interfere minds their human subjects , order keep them organizing revolts ... i must say , trying depict mind-manipulation effects film pretty much same thing movie varnish stripper when applied cd --- it turns it into confusing , incomprehensible mess ! couple times , picture would break up into concentric blur , i'd wonder what heck supposed going . how makers this film ever talked great studio like warner help them film it , something which forever remain mystery me . i remember just before this picture opened , group scientologists trying hype it : " oh , watch --- this film going bigger than star wars gone wind combined ! " you guess what happened when those staggeringly huge box office numbers never materialized ... you say " oops "	-1

i love it when two my favorite actors movie together . when one off screen , you other keep you entertained . when they're screen together , it movie-making its best . plot itself leaves bit desired . film production stop-and-go so long , i heard director changed direction before it finished . my guess some what lost what missing movie , particularly regards understanding benicio character properly . nonetheless , tommy lee jones benicio del toro shine throughou t.p.s. animal lover , i love two leads movie pro-animal too	-1

first time i saw this film back high school , over 20 years ago . time we thought this craziest movie we ever seen whoever it who written script made such off wall film somewhat insane himself . yet , we hysterically laughing throughout entire film . upon watching movie again , years later , nothing changed . i still found myself laughing throughout entire movie . it just off-beat before . it great cult classic i would definitely recommend this film others	-1
i seen many historical war dramas far east ( mainly china ) most them not only historically inaccurate but strong bias toward enemy . yi soon shin , however , rare exception . not only drama very historically accurate but it also very comprehensive detailing meticulous battle planning admiral leads each victory but also political in-fighting chosun political factions ( second-guessing nature king ) which causes his eventual death . also , special effects great . battle scenes ( whether sea or land ) realisitic outstanding quality . only problem i find dvd not placed sufficient focus contribution ming china . then again , this not unexpected since this korean drama focusing great admiral . also , entire selection should 104 episodes . i don't know why it stops 101 . if you want more comprehensive knowledge subject , try samuel hawley imjin war ( which portrays yi soon shin more accurately quoting original sources ) . any who only intered fighting may also want check out stephen turnbull samurai invasion ( which more colorful maps detailed description battles japanese perspective ) . lastly , anyone who fan samurai warfare may want check out shogun : total war creative assembly ( now gold version ) .	1

this film parody " most dangerous game " ( 1996 ) [ says , tla video ] john woo ( yes , him ) " hard target " ( 1993 ) [ " pest " ( 1997 ) most closely resembles " hard target " , which win awards academy science fiction , fantasy horror films , usa ] . it most likely inspired adapts both films -- both serious films while this farce satire . perhaps not politically correct if analyzing those " quacky " karaoke scenes ? some would say too much emphasis bodily humor , but this film hunting -- outdoors -- where men ( women ) squat use pheremones [ " father , i feel funny " ] attract prey ! john leguizamo vs . jean-claude van damme ? it get any funnier ? it goes shelf next " beyond therpay " " sibling rivalry "	1

please note -- this movie receives one star only because amazon not offer zero star ( or , more appropriately this film , negative ) rating . recently , entertainment weekly compiled list " 25 worst movie sequels " ever . how " american werewolf paris " avoided its rightful place this list now one great mysteries my life . like everyone else drawn this unfortunate attempt film , i watched because i am fan john landis ' original " american werewolf . " watched , , 15 minutes ... which more than enough time establish this ' sequel ' should stillborn during pre-production . i almost tempted follow this ' film ' its conclusion , see exactly how bad it could get , but i simply could not subject myself such torture . only thing could make this worse movie ? viewing original " werewolf " first , which emphasize even more tragedy " american werewolf paris . " so , why this such terrible movie ? i should taken dvd case description sign -- it explained i would watching ( i'm paraphrasing ... but pretty close ) ' rockin ' horror film ' hip , up coming group young actors , ' , even better , i would treated ' soundtrack complete hottest today music . ' umm ... no . i challenge you find more blatant lies than ones offered movie promoters . wit , sample several idiotic scenes plot devices :( 1 ) tom everett scott wants prove his courage bungy jumping off eiffel tower ... which would fine , except , given shape particular structure ( going out top bottom ) , our young hero would jumping into tower itself . might problem , but one he never seems consider . we really like protagonist this stupid ? ( 2 ) just before he ready leap , young woman throws herself off ledge . t.e. scott jumps save her ( despite fact his rope not yet harnassed ) , gracefully nabs her just before she becomes splatter sidewalk . she runs off , he ( hey , i right ! ) bangs his head beam put hospital . after waking , his concern her understandable ... but why , any rational universe , would he suddenly infatuated clearly suicidal woman ? he says something effect she ' different ' or ' sophisticated ' or some other garbage ... despite fact their relationship point comprises all eight ( wordless ) seconds . ( here , i'm also bit nitpicky ... because i can't life me fathom why he would julie delpy even remotely attractive ; mental instability bad enough , but her looks hardly negate those problems ) . anyway , absolutely no lucid reason , he suddenly decides this girl his dreams ... entire movie based his inexplicable admiration , flaw symptomatic entire plot structure . ( 3 ) classic scene : young lovers ' first date ... which he ' accidentally ' pulls out handful condoms , subdue her anxiety his intentions , he forced pretend they actually pieces gum . yes , this level sophistication clearly rampant throughout movie . those high points first ten minutes , i'm fairly certain rest narrative downhill atrocious beginning .	-1

i'm happy this dvd my collection . director robert siodmak pioneer " noir " , but this straight-forward suspense story , one my favorites . it film debut rhonda fleming , she quite good . elsa lanchester again cute , ethel barrymore received oscar nomination her performance . year later , dorothy mcguire would receive her only oscar nomination " gentleman agreement " . mcguire , indeed , covers this complex role completely , without speaking word . i most impressed . film one my favorite suspense fims 40 . i'm not sure why anyone can't enjoy chills .	1
simple words , easy rider probably most morally detestable film i ever seen . my impression hippies before seeing this movie , they more or less just lazy(but peaceful)people . now hippies kinda disturb me . beginning film when they stopped some food commune it clear director wanted me sympathize hippies . i personally , however , could not felt anymore different . there kids running around everywhere not watched , while adults irresponsibly thought only themselves , wether meant engaging immoral behavior such taking swim naked or doing drugs . odd thing though while drugs never exactly glamorized ( though frequently heros this ) , swimming naked treated if innocent children play . seriously grossed me out . how could something so lustful dirty , thought like ? hippies just plain creepy . also its kind hard get around thae main characters . these guys nothing more than no good drug smuggling degenerates . yet they sad excuse movie place heros . director or one cast members i believe , making easy rider , compared two main characters john wayne . but if john wayne ever played hero lowesome these one , movie would just simple not any fun . problem this movie south . they potrayed nothing , but lowesome biggots . their hatred hippies unrealistically comes out no where . now i'll admit there people like this , but generalize entire south , unfair . ultimately though i would say worse part this movie , where they lsd trip apostles creed(a catholic prayer ) recited . strong practing catholic , this could not more offensive . i leave room after half way through scene it disturbed me so much . i returned once it over , though frankly i wish i never seen it first place . everything this scene represents what i hate society . hatred religion expressed not very peaceful or loving . long story short , this movie immoral they com e.p.s. i dont think i ever look my steppenwolf cds or records same way again	-1

movie : i finally got around watching one asian cinema finest classics , ringo lam " city fire . " i must say i really impressed . film starts off little shaky ground but soon gains its footing takes off when chow character ( also named chow ) reluctantly goes undercover . i really like scenes where he first tailed then actually * hunted * rival cops who seem want nothing short him dead . ending just incredible , not just fireworks , but way loyalty plays out . film worth watching just last 30 minutes , although rest also well-paced part girlfriend thing little boring but add dimensions chow character , thanks chow yun-fat good acting . dvd : i know i'm not purist when it comes foreign films , i usually don't like subtitles ( esp . chop suey subtitles ) , so forgive me saying i actually liked dubbing job this one . there no chinese soundtrack this all , just english dub . i thought voice actors pretty good job , much better than any other dubbed foreign film i've seen . adr remix also really good , they even english song worked into nightclub scene . i'm usually turned off high-pitched cacophonous audio effects hong kong films , but american remix engineers very nice job pairing surround sound audio great visual experience ringo lam given us	1

jack nicholson knew no one could ever equal masterpice polanski " chinatown " so he didn't try . what he make when he took over this troubled production robert towne ( polanski still claims he re-write much chinatown ) visually beautiful portrait 1948 los angeles boom meditation past how it haunts us . smoke ring filled opening peggy lee " don't smoke bed " jo stafford " haunted heart " end , nicholson frames colorful orange blues 1948 los angeles against darker internal memories past . gittes successful p.i. who works divorce cases plays golf . l.a. county filled orange groves created water so sought after " chinatown .

" this one you don't want miss . it really terrific must see nicholson fans .	1

" looker " very stylish film always one my favorite michael crighton efforts ( even better than " westworld " ) i would rated it solid 4 stars if it weren't this * terrible * transfer job they i t.t he problem not clarity , color or sound -- it film gate . they must used absolute worst machine world , because image constantly moves even during static scenes . if you watch this small ( 26 " or smaller ) set it may not bother you , but anything larger drive you crazy , i assure you . which terrible shame , because this little sleeper film ( it went almost unnoticed when released ) worth seeing . it contains one crighton favorite themes -- tech misused or gone out control -- great albert finney giving rare performance adventure hero . my advice -- definitely don't buy this film . rent it netflix give it watch , particularly if you don't nice big screen tv . perhaps if when this released high def they'll much better job ( then it would indeed worth buy )	-1

andrei rublyov ( 1969 ) andrei tarkovsky my number 1 ( shares tarkovsky zerkalo ) film all time . it pinnacle film-making me - one few most visually beautiful films well one deepest films ever . beauty every frame exquisite - i pause film very often just admire i t.t here only couple more films touched me profoundly andrei rublyov . i am always surprised hear it very slow film - tarkovsky , it very well paced , i am never tired its 3+ hours running time . film based life 15-th century monk icon painter andrei rublyov who wanders through country torn barbarism , later tatar invaders . tarkovsky explores several very important topics his film : what talent how artist responsible it ? man god , artist power . final 20 minutes film best most inspiring i've seen cinema . me , last chapter film , " bell " perhaps greatest its emotional impact piece cinema ever made . i can't stay calm collected when i see it . boriska sobbing like child after his bell rings - he child , boy , lonely lost ; andrei breaking his vows silence , his words boriska hope , many roads they would walk together . andrei icons we finally allowed behold admire , their breathtaking divine beauty serenity , their melodic lines pure joyful colors , faces saints angels their eternal mystery , quiet knowledge sadness , looking inside themselves inside our very souls ; music literally takes you somewhere above this earth , heights such purity beauty you could hardly breath where even " swiftest birds " pain death can't reach you ...	1

like most people , i ridiculed riverdance everything like . but working store sold this , i absolutely floored how awesome michael flatly feet flames . this not compared river dance or lord dance ( precurors feet flames ) . this much more show ; kind like difference cirque du soleil saltimbanco quidam . production value skyrockets makes anything else ( before it ) look archaic . feet flames showcases more than just celtic-style dancing . there musical numbers both female duo solo singer . there some sort story involved but i never focused too much it . dancing fantastic . while show geared around michael flatly skills , he allow his other dancers some spotlight . interviews/making-of quite insightful . who would though flatly loses several pounds ( water/sweat ) during each performance ? it wild show showcases just how profitable ' riverdancing ' . sheer energy show , performers even crowd make you want dance it	-1

i loved mortal kombat , i thought sequel would carry great kombat legacy . i heartily dissapointed when i saw annihilation . brian johnson cool khan , but some special effects so fake i laugh . robin shou returns liu kang , savior earth . after killing shang tsung , group heads home when all sudden , emperor busts up party sends his minions down . there , khan makes his first appearance , his abnormal , yet awesome soldiers . johnny cage killed , rayden(now played james remar)fights khan , winning but sacrificing johnny cage . now , earth seven days before it destroyed . what i didn't like this movie appearances people who died first film , like scorpion sub-zero . who heard sub-zero brother . thing got me how liu kang fighting got worse since first film . he losing every battle , except end , even then he wasl osing . not get this film if you want avoid dissapointment	-1
mortal kombat : annihilation one those films so bad it actually hurts watch it . nearly complete recast almost all characters ( odd , considering interviews after first movie , all them said they'd want/ willing come back sequel ) , horrible ( even 1997 standards ) cg effects , cliched fight scenes ( gee ... two women mud pit . i bet it took them all night come up one ) , virtually everything could gone wrong this movie go wrong this movie . loosely based story mortal kombat 3 video game ( set immediately after first movie , which , while not great , looks like citizen kane compared this stinkburger ) , movie set lofty goal depicting shao khan ( played brian thompson , alien bounty hunter x-files ) his army ( shown most scenes small band extras . oooh ... scary . ) they attempt take over earth merging it alternate dimension known outworld . this merging realms result destruction humanity . only week anything it , lord raiden ( played james remar , replacing , i can't believe i'm saying this , much better christopher lambert role ) once again enlists help liu kang ( robin shou ) , sonia blade ( sandra hess ) , princess kitana ( talisa soto ) , help select few other characters video games ' crowded lineup , prevent this happening . story itself not necessarily bad . however , given film obviously low budget weak screenplay , loss most excellent cast first film , most jarringly , direction even more inept than paul w.s. anderson , it quickly becomes clear they set their sights too high , only practically everything come crashing down . only saving grace this film its killer soundtrack , featuring updated version theme created first movie , well music kmfdm , megadeth , rammstein , juno reactor , others . if ever you're looking punish yourself something , then all means watch this movie . however , if you actually like yourself want remain good terms yourself , you avoid this movie like plague . believe me , you'll thank yourself later .	-1

i don't understand why this version cuts out key scene church sean connery stands up his pew challenges priest sermonizing against violence saying something like " what violence against miners ? " fact , they appeared purposely edited movie make audience think comment richard harris makes after service " talking back priest " refers pleasantries sean connery exchanged priest after service way out ! i remember this scene vividly since it when i saw this movie almost 40 years ago now , it cool see someone stand up church stand up church hypocrisy . cut this scene also distorts movies development close friendship priest held sean connery how each could act within their roles while retaining their bond . odd . any insight fans ? -	-1

among most ridiculous critical reactions any movie ever vicious reaction david leans film . coterie untalented hacks ( led likes pauline kael richard schickel ) bound determined tear down lean after huge financial successes his past few movies , this gorgeous meditation power forgiveness ( or lack thereof ) their victim . robert mitchum cast against type , sarah miles ( ripped into some idiots given role because she wife screenwriter robert bolt ! ) , three great character actors : leo mckern , trevor howard , oscar-winning john mills all giving spectacular performances . i admit christopher jones weak link , but if so , it only significant flaw . movie beautiful watch any you ever see , maurice jarre ( usual ) took his work up step composing score lean film . it good " brief encounter " or " lawrence arabia " ? no . but this terribly underrated movie ranks up there best rest david lean movies , including dickens adaptations or " kwai " or " zhivago " . great movie !	1

i curious see movie maniac years . huge horror fan since i child i surprised i hadn't seen it somewhere line before . however i never able find it any video stores even after dvd release . i ended up getting it netflix let me just say .... it would fully worth cost purchasing it blindly ! this truly underrated slasher/horror film , my opinion , one absolute best slasher flicks 80 , but not way one might think certainly not way i expected . i expected run-of-the-mill cheesy , ta , horror flick , which would absolutely fine me , but instead i got very gnarly , incredibly acted ( joe spinell amazing ) , horrific suspenseful , even sad horror story . i rarely so surprised good way any film . i try not give anything away , but warned i probably give away some surprises , least they my opinion . one thing i loved so much how well we get know killer . he not one-dimensional or shallow character , he complex tortured .... just guy ! i never seen killer portrayed quite this way . first half film , maybe even more , we see him his home we see him stalk kill people , we see him maniac . then suddenly halfway point , maybe little further our maniac becomes interested woman who takes his picture park . he goes her home under premise basically non-existant , which really only weak point plot might i add -- exactly how he got his foot door her , so speak . i forgive it because maybe more happened they just didn't show . anyway , point this man who we seen little more than tortured soul , murderer , lunatic , comes into this beautiful woman home completely normal . he charming , whitty , jokes her , he intelligent , thoughtful , talks her art her photography , they go date she seems genuinely like this big guy . i felt bewildered ! i already felt bad guy -- i hardly ever felt such sympathy " bad guy " like this but boy i this case his interactions this lady make it all more sad , seeing he fact okay , least time . anyhow , withour revealing much more than which i so excited , this movie avoids lot typical horror cliches right up end which nice . i wish it not ended so abruptly , but hey , i can't ask much more this one ! effects very well . this savini his best -- some work here even better than his work dead movies , which me , saying lot . if you fan 80s horror , or any slasher/horror you would well check this movie out . it dramatic , creepy , chilling ( especially savini cameo scene -- yikes ! ) , sad . more layers my opinion than most movies its kind . :	1

first off this film not color . its not torture slasher film . dont fooled lame cheesey packaging . its bw 30s/40s dracula/frankenstien castle type film but executed amazing skill . it goes extra mile then some . sound look plot all within classic hokey range - but brilliance true gift horror . i dont know if i saw les baxter version ( whoever sound it awesome ! ) . but i love les baxter so now i go back make sure i see his version . im not familiar barbara steele ( sorry ) but her performance phenomenal .	1
my experience , seeing words " national lampoon " any film title bad omen , indicating tastelessness dearth actual comedy up ahead . national lampoon gold diggers manages take series all-time low - which , sadly , no mean feat . friedle chris owen act if they auditioning future installment dumb dumber , plot suffers definite " ick " factor - , sadly , those actually movie strengths . calvin ( friedle ) leonard ( owen ) grew up together orphanage now trying make their mark world young adults . they certainly don't want work living , so they take up life petty crime . they pitiful failures this wind up jail . then , two old ladies they accosted street bail them out invite them visit their impressive home . guys ( which i mean calvin , he only one really capable actual human thought ) think their hosts rich , so it they devise plan marry them , wait their imminent deaths , then live large their inheritances . doris ( louise lasser ) betty mundt ( renee taylor ) may heirs mundt prophylactics fortune , but they fact cash poor ( thanks their insane uncle , who charge mundt estate ) . they make their own plans marry two young men , purchase sizable insurance policies them , then kill them . double wedding takes place , marriages consummated ( i hear yuck !? ) , month passes . calvin finds married life buxom , not-dead-yet doris driving him insane , so he leonard begin setting " accidental " traps their wives ; naturally , women finalizing their own murder plans same time . mr. mrs. smith , this ain't - but goes without saying . i won't lie say i didn't laugh or smile time or two because i , but national lampoon gold diggers aims low - really low - cannot begin escape black hole stupidity upon which it built . i think i speak vast majority human beings when i say we just don't want see senior citizen women prancing around onscreen like victoria secret models . there crude then there national lampoon crude , gold diggers crude it gets . this film should all rights career killer anyone involved it - although nikki ziering may emerge relatively unscathed given fact her screen time severely limited	-1
i seen many historical war dramas far east ( mainly china ) most them not only historically inaccurate but strong bias toward enemy . yi soon shin , however , rare exception . not only drama very historically accurate but it also very comprehensive detailing meticulous battle planning admiral leads each victory but also political in-fighting chosun political factions ( second-guessing nature king ) which causes his eventual death . also , special effects great . battle scenes ( whether sea or land ) realisitic outstanding quality . only problem i find dvd not placed sufficient focus contribution ming china . then again , this not unexpected since this korean drama focusing great admiral . also , entire selection should 104 episodes . i don't know why it stops 101 . if you want more comprehensive knowledge subject , try samuel hawley imjin war ( which portrays yi soon shin more accurately quoting original sources ) . any who only intered fighting may also want check out stephen turnbull samurai invasion ( which more colorful maps detailed description battles japanese perspective ) . lastly , anyone who fan samurai warfare may want check out shogun : total war creative assembly ( now gold version ) .	1
old silent film course classic . it comes german school horror films 1920s . it adaptation bram stoker dracula , but it takes liberties original . it situated bremen not london . his girlfriend or wife quite rightly mina . rensfield boss real estate agency . trip dracula castle standard . dracula voyage bremen also very standard . real change comes end when mina sacrifices herself giving herself dracula keep him active up after [ .. ] crows . then he dies everyone saved . naive rewriting ending into some palatable cathartic compensation horror life : salvation possible escape real eventuality . but it also very christian ending way , or isn't it jewish after all ? woman sacrificing herself sake social group menaced dracula . this sacrifice epiphanic since it brings salvation . this fantastic horror period german cinema seems longing happy ending , just if reality germany then so bleak happiness could only dream consolation or solace cinema could propose people . film though admirable quality pictures shooting . black white film such subject could easily become drab , which it never . pictures always innovative way or contrast or composition makes poor technique days quite able translate complex situations . acting these silent actors also quite admirable body language they use never overdone which would make it grotesque . it just expressive enough mean what it supposed mean without any negative second level reading . dr jacques coulardeau , university paris dauphine university paris 1 pantheon sorbonne	1
sometimes you see movie such great acting it , you never forget it . i can't imagine anyone playing dian fossey other than sigourney ; throughout whole movie , you feel her rage , her loneliness , her determination . i also think this movie good job not making dian look like angel , because devoted she , she her flaws . years isolation remote mountains africa hardened her . sometimes i think it would better if instead endlessly fighting hunters , she changed her approach helped give them job oppurtunities so they other ways make money besides hunting . however , despite her flaws , dian fossey still deserves recognized remembered her selfless efforts protect gorillas . this movie just	-1

" my left foot " well-detailed biography author , writer artist christy brown , born athetoid cerebral palsy . brown life story told flashback form documented detailed fashion ; centering around christy struggle dealing severity his physical condition while , through support his loving caring family ( which included some 22 siblings all , thirteen siblings surviving ) , making himself rather well-known outstanding writer , painter poet . christy brown never regarded man trapped inside prison twisted , contorted body , but man who could show entire universe just exactly what he became capable doing - giving abundance love , hope faith through genius his talents . boyhood ( when christy first snatched piece chalk his sister hand using his only mobile foot ) manhood ( when christy turned world its collective ear never saying never refusing give up spite his condition , letting his masterworks speak themselves ) , brown life worthwhile journey , everyone , disabled or not , profit his experiences . so much offer , it not hard see why " my left foot "' two main actors ( daniel day-lewis brenda fricker ) received academy award nominations their outstanding work one best movies 1989 . after seeing this film several times now , i often wonder why hugh o'conor performance ( young christy ) became overlooked , didn't garner him any major hardware result . result day-lewis ' potrayal adult christy , it quite amusing many people convinced otherwise healthy actor himself cerebral palsy . fact , i believe it through day-lewis ' commitment dedication role ( even refusing come out character eating lunch wheelchair ) major reason why he earned well-deserved academy award . not all far behind day-lewis fricker performances , wonderfully touching portrayal ray mcanally ( who died shortly after filming ended ) christy tough-as-nails father paddy brown . conclusion , if everyone followed christy brown example he lived his forty-nine years spent earth , world would much better place which live . features this special edition dvd release , reviews good read interviews insightful . it would real treat if daniel day-lewis himself present this special edition give his account christy brown life story . hugh o'conor interview sheds least little light christy beginnings gives this dvd edition more than enough credibility making " my left foot " worthwhile necessary one dvd movie collection . video itself , although containing some noticeably visible dirt spots places , still good transfer , audio quality excellent . i can't say enough this wonderfully brilliant piece cinema ( kudos jim sheridan his excellent directing shane connaughton sheridan well-written screenplay ) , so just pick up your very own copy " my left foot " see what all fuss !	1

although not fan kenneth brannaugh , i willing give his hamlet fair viewing . since this my favorite play , i hoping film would better than his last two mediocre endeavors into shakespeare plays ; unfortunately , it worse ! beginning performances : jack lemmon wonderful actor , but here , he embarrassment , many other actors assembled , including julie christie ( whom i usually adore ) . casting all over map which makes uneven performances unsatisfying scenes . brannaugh own delivery text rushed usually unconvincing , despite vehemence which he delivers every over-ennunciated syllable , which sounds manic , bordering farce . bad direction over-indulgent acting ! it might interesting see what brannaugh would good direction , instead his own . i could go my problems staging other production values but damage this brilliant work every level not worth going depth . good news zefferelli hamlet , actor i don't normally like -- mel gibson -- spot perfect . actor excellently cast , production values direction serve text , rather than competing it , brannaugh version . zefferelli knows his shakespeare his films , my opinion represent definitive versions ( watch his romeo juliet taming shrew ) , too bad us he didn't more . too bad , also , no one contemporary seems capable . instead we get recent unwatchable junk " hip-cool " sensibilities . argh ! it not surprising no one rush produce dvd this tragedy film	-1
only good anti-communist french anti-communist ... that something i've believed since first reading raymond aron . this gallic tradition continued through bernard henry-levy now i'm adding french director regis wagnier my list ... film stars sandrine bonnaire catherine deneuve . it idealistic communists who return paris ussr 1946 help build up socialism wake wwii . what they find , instead , suffering they never imagined . film certain french quality , especially relationships ; yet , there something russian there , too . filmed kiev , it really looks russian , even when faces seem french . fear , paranoia , suspicion -- even dancing men red army chorus -- all very russian . what missing little bit russian warmth , which somehow found even most shocking russian films . french bit more cerebral rational , i guess . but picture packs wallop , all same . i won't spoil it revealing plot . least it happy ending ( really russian movie , hero would shot , i would think ) . it really , really good . i recommend it . add it your own netflix queue -- or buy it amazon ..	1

it difficult review this movie without comparing it " postman always rings twice " ( tpart ) . that because both based same novel james cain . i heard " tpart " years before i finally saw it first time earlier this year . my impression it good movie but , waited anxiously so long see it , it something let down . last night i tired looked forward watching good movie . i chose " ossessione " but almost changed my mind when i saw it based " tpart " . after all , i'd recently seen didn't think it such great story see again so soon . fortunately , i gave movie try quickly absorbed into it . what seperates " obsessione " " tpart " quality acting excellence directing . there feeling this movie lacking john garfield/lana turner version . we seem know what everyone thinking feeling without depending obvious dialogue . there series scenes , example , involving character name spangnolo who becomes involved gino , male lead . there any number ways you interpret him his relationship gino . fellow vagabonds political theorist his understudy homosexual lovers . visconti gives us so many subtle hints it up viewer decide themselves ( disappointedly , i assumed latter relationship ) . way everyone interacts one so impressively passions they emote really reach out touch us . fact it italian doesn't hurt its ' passionate nature . i theory foreign language movies ; they require your constant attention since you don't want risk missing critical subtitle . result , we come away more focussed every aspect movie this tends make good movies even better . i don't want disparage " tpart " since it good movie . however , " ossessione " stands so much taller so many ways i'm not sure i'll ever feel need watch " tpart " again . take praise " ossessione " rather than knock " tpart "	1
this 2003 remake " monte walsh " tom selleck third ( but hopefully not last ) western tnt , it probably most stirring film tribute end old west cowboy way life . this saying quite bit some fine westerns like " wild bunch " , " shootist " , ( even more recently ) " open range " well other movies dealt changes resulting progress u.s. enter twentieth century . other reviewers covered plot line great detail already , so i won't retread ground . suffice it say , while selleck monte walsh hero picture , he portrayed character flaws intact well . montelius walsh loves three things life : horses , women , drinking ( order these things changes different times his life ) . he stubborn , afraid commit martine ( his favorite prostitute whom he seem love ) , refuses change . he also hard-working loyal his friends , especially his best buddy chet ( played keith carradine ) , these qualities what make his character heroic storyline affecting . i'm convinced if selleck starred primarily westerns throughout his film career , then his movie success would dwarfed his " magnum p.i. " role . tnt westerns , his three previous westerns dating back 1979 " sacketts " , establish him premier cowboy actor . " monte walsh " finest those efforts date , it hoped selleck ' saddle up ' again soon ; perhaps he'll even reunite sam elliott whom he starred his first two made-for-tv westerns who also made some first-rate westerns tnt . watch this one . it elegiac tribute passing old west american cowboy . may both continue live films	1

i theory : audiences getting smarter . whereas before big hollywood movie massive marketing push would've all rage , now people starting know better . they're realizing terrible movie terrible movie no matter how often we see julia roberts deal more romantic comedic mishaps or much stuff michael bay destroy . so when movie comes like john malkovich , or memento or even visually impressive like matrix , we stand up take notice . building career largely inventive music videos , first time director spike jonze comes out gate probably most unconventional comedy you'll see . loserly craig schwartz ( john cusack , always good ) aspiring puppeteer who can't get any work . then he his dishevelled looking wife lotte ( cameron diaz ) leaving their small new york apartment pets everywhere since lotte pet store worker . craig , due his puppeteering skills gets accepted company located , amusingly , 7 1/2 floor , complete cramped ceilings . he also strong attraction one his co-workers , feisty maxine ( catherine keener ) . one day while working , he discovers small day going inside he finds out he see world through john malkovich eyes 15 minutes unceromonious dump new jersey turnpike ditch . craig maxine get idea : charge 200$ people experience john malkovich which novel idea until lotte goes through feels deeper connection , especially around idea maxine . then we bizarre love square or star or something since craig loves maxine who loves lotte but only when lotte inside john malkovich ... ' head . try not wrap your head around it since it better explained movie after awhile you don't even worry stuff like vessels or portals , you just go it . casting course important no one seems wasted , even diaz , who i normally can't stand . real treat though course malkovich since times you almost can't tell if he acting or if he really quirky . then there comedy which subtle first-was-funny-but-now-it-ain't like 7 1/2 floor small ceilings but then film shows you what happens when malkovich steps through his own portal it becomes not only technical marvel but one flat-out funniest things i've seen lately . only problem story certain point it shifts gears film almost speed walks its climax rather than lurching forward , like it shot foot . like amazon review says , i don't know if film warrant repeat viewings you get more out it every time you see it but first viewing quite something	-1

all movies i've seen " set " former soviet union , this one manages best show reality . stephen rea , viktor burakov , what would interesting job forensic pathologist - except he hampered what he or say soviet dogma bureaucracy . when he learns serial killer targeting kids other vulnerables , luring them out city rape murder them , he outraged ( frightened his own children safety ) . he also determined catch this man . unfortunately , all his superiors deny possibility communism ever producing such deviant refuse give him even smallest tools help catch him . many , many years pass , burakov diligently pursues murder after murder , forced his superiors take precious time out true investigation shake down other soviet targets such homosexuals ( deemed dangerous soviets ) . finally , when communism collapses , he allowed his superior , fetisov , one man who sympathetic his mission , use modern tools such computers assigned adequate manpower stage hunt this horrible killer who piling up bodies over twenty years . all leads here , rea , sutherland , demunn , very convincing , even if their russian accents not quite right . also authentically soviet buildings , streets , extras . since burakov real enemy here stagnation apathy communism , it would inappropriate if buildings he worked , lived , or searched clean tidy well taken care . fortunately , they accurately reflect what going during death throes unworkable ideology - this bleak place exist . demunn portrays chikitilo gray passive/aggressive . he eminently overlookable which explains why , when caught first time , he released . it also explains how he lured all these kids their deaths without anyone taking notice him . while he clearly monster , there scenes which demunn manages inject humanity pathos making him seem pathetic addition evil . burakov relentless pursuit this killer despite odds what it cost him personally emotionally what make final moments movie so touching . this movie difficult watch it not shy away violence committed ( though what shown not gratuitous ) , but ultimately , it saga one man determination what right outwait apathetic regime . very satisfying	1

i always thought dustin hoffman tootsie , which i haven't seen , movie producer wag dog , which i love . or rain man , fine film . but hey , guy give us nasty edge if script calls it . hoffman became lenny bruce . bruce material great times awful others . nowadays , course , none it would shocking . film shows us bruce faults , unedited , presumably contrast great material he could produce because and/or spite his excesses . but still , something missing . something crucial . i don't know what . i only know this film could so much better .	-1

i picked this dvd off rack random selection , mainly because i don't believe sean penn ever appeared bad movie .... this got one his best ( even though he probably still teenager when it produced 1983 ) . he portrays young delinquent purse snatcher mugger named mick o'brien , who rapidly escalating violence his crimes . ultimately , during attempted drug robbery his best friend murdered he accidentally runs over young brother his bitter enemy , paco moreno ( fairly well portrayed esai morales .... he definitely no sean penn ) . because his youth , mick sent grim , grimy , violent juvenile detention center presided over " usual suspects " : inattentive , seemingly deaf guards who allow atrocities perpetrated daily no consequences .... prison trustees ( clancy brown portrays one ) who flaunt rules , sexually abuse , terrorize inmates .... warden who weak , fickle joke . standing up trustees demonstrating his talents mayhem maniacal violence , mick becomes dominant inmate .... effect , ruling place , until two things happen challenge him : paco rapes mick girlfriend ( revenge death his brother ) gets sentenced same juvenile detention center mick . they now hate each other more than ever , trapped within same hellish institution .... you know something horrific going happen . sorry , but if you want see how this incredible set-up plays out , you'll rent or buy dvd .... i assure you , it money well spent . acting superb ( sean incredible , even teenager , exuding undercurrent barely-controlled violence ); plot suspenseful bloody but always makes perfect sense ; direction , cinematography , sets , sound , etc . terrific . this genuinely excellent movie .... i give it my highest recommendation .	1
i am absolutely thrilled deluxe treatment his fine film received . even though , surface , " fly " gory fun horror film -- i long considered it important masterpiece well one greatest love stories 80 . anyone familiar cronenberg , film director , knows his work challenging , avant garde , controversial , weird , gross , brilliant -- usually all above . " dead ringers " , " naked lunch " , " crash " " history violence " all exceptional works someone defies expectations makes films he wants ! true genius , even his more minor works better than most hollywood product . " fly " relatively accessible work cronenberg , one easily enjoyed mass audience . simply put , it horror story science nature gone awry . it quite scary , quite gross , quite enjoyable . what distinguishes film , firstly , performances . jeff goldblum never better , different world he would gotten oscar nomination . geena davis perfect -- quirky beginning , but grounding film real emotional resonance end . i believe their interaction , their relationship , phenomenal love story ! how much you willing sacrifice when person you love literally falling apart ? how long you support them when their actions become insupportable . these real people , even though situation fantastical , you really feel them . what also important film context time which it released . " fly " seen many allegory aids . 1986 , major studios not making films this subject . it would while before mainstream cinema got around really addressing issue . yet here " fly " , mainstream horror movie illness . graphic degeneration body betrayed . it not hard see symbolism many issues images , cronenberg master subtext . but i don't necessarily want politicize film , just something think if you haven't contemplated it before . either way , impact film hasn't lessened me -- especially romance . please don't think " fly 2 " anything this brilliant movie ! kgharris , 9/06	1

i college when brit pop phenomena hit . but i snob back then , deeply involved my college radio station turning my nose up this tripe . oh just too mainstream commercial me like ! course i've since matured , i gave brit pop chance since then , this documentary taught me few things i otherwise didn't know . there curious phenomena takes place america uk terms pop culture . one gentleman made comment pendulum swing back forth two , certainly true now i think it . i heard stone roses , but they never caught avengence here . then , course , nirvana happened eclipsed everything else . after kurt died 94 , oasis began rise uk " grunge years " began . i heard stories all kids uk chasing after oasis their packed , sold out shows , new chapter began . this documentary concentrates mostly gallagher brothers . noel far more well spoken than liam ( but everyone knows because i don't think he spent nearly much time pickling himself ) , everything noel said seemed more meaning behind it . they interviewed few more people , such damien blur guy pulp . damien seems like real downer , they should've given guy pulp more say he seemed little more animated than blur . i liked beatles vs . rolling stones - type rivalry established against blur oasis ( seeing whose album would hit #1 first ) , but you tell they really weren't interested it creation press . plus , you got impression london swinging again like mods 60s . it little ironic they too fell into same traps we america death grunge . heroin too them their grasp ( referencing blur song " beetlebum " , it supposed heroin ) . , celebrity death ended their trip well ( ours kurt , theirs princess diana ) . here it 10 years later . blur pulp seem gone way dodo , but oasis still around . they're not hot phenomena they , but they continue make music seem staying power ( when they're not fighting or drunk/high ) . now coldplay seems one leading brit pop charge . maybe they , fact , live forever	-1

this film teaches lesson other side political isle than i usually sit , but it tells it well . it vaguely reminiscent other films 1940 but i can't remember title . it " know thy enemy " film , teaches culture clash . i'm not one respect culture if it demands it , but if it earns it i . this film two warriors get stranded together dangerously hostile world work together survive . they learn each other languages , culture way even die-hard conservative like me cannot argue . perhaps everyone learn something this . film right wrong , it change one perspective . end , i remember audience cheering theatres	-1

this movie really makes you stop think , how you live your life how others live theirs . every person life purpose . each us find out what purpose . many don't know it , but you live out your purpose still enjoy life same time , affecting other people positive . this movie almost seemed mind pessimist , but some may say realist . i think it reflects moral conscious day . i seen good number sidney poitier movies , it amazes me how he always keep poker face every tough seen ( one calling little no expression when giving someone critical information ) . he ranks right up there all leading men hollywood old , great actors back day	1
complaints this dvd release all correct . great movie , low qaulity release . yet i'm surprised no one mentioned thing angered me most , self censorship . bataan race scene where ustinov swaps bataan bottle beer . we're ok witness pirate drunk , but sports commentator saying teenager running bottle beer beyond appropriate ? what execs disney thinking ? if they need put out disclaimer leonard maltin befor showing such " questionable " material they many vault collection ... fine , but stop chopping up movies . our ten year old children not buying these movies , many us actually alive see originals no we're ripped off . stop angering loyal fan base this ignorance . keep this mind when you contemplate inevitable release cleaned up widescreen version this title	-1

george stevens masterpiece , me , best all biblical epics . it takes dramatic license setting scripture events , but it so very peaceful profound manner . script very well written , presenting scripture poetic , dramatic manner musical score superb . biblical scholars disagree over meaning matthew 16:18 passage " this rock i build my church " - here seemingly presented refer peter himself rock when true meaning most accurate translation would appear statement peter - jesus christ son living god - rock or foundation which church built . cast this film very large , cameo roles many major stars day . max von sydow exceptional actor who captures loving , caring spirit jesus . location , including four corners region us , striking background story life ministry jesus christ .	1
this high octane , pure entertainment wonderful cast including jimmy stewart june allyson . it also best footage convair b-36 peacemaker ever put into movie theater . frank lovejoy great job , but not quite imposing general curtis . lemay - person his character , no doubt , emulating . there message this motion picture terms quality people required put up very difficult positions within fledgling strategic air command . it hard work make things happen this picture dedicated character dedication those individuals who protected this country during cold war . this film would wonderful co-feature " gathering eagles " rock hudson mary peach . they're portrayed roughly eight ten years apart history sac . each time i see extradordinarily long take-off footage b-36 , i get little misty-eyed . i remember watching last b-36 it made low-level departure loring air force base , maine . , like movie , venetian blinds shuddered most other structures ! this would wonderful dvd format	1

this one my favorite movies long i remember . even when i young i didn't understand all jokes , but when i recently rewatched it ... well my love it rediscovered . this film basically takes pridictable unoriginal story two people trying succeed their sport end up falling love makes it instantly memorable its snappy dialogue fun one upmanship main characters . this film would worth it some its insults alone ! overall , i would say it diamond rough . but if you looking serious film then this might not appeal you , cutting edge pretty much fun filled romp start finish	1
i quite disappointed this film . director used some non-actors play some parts , it shows . also , editing camera work shoddy . one particular scene , you see mouchette turning her body , which causes coffee cup move toward edge table . next shot , cup falls floor . effect very self-conscious clumsy . finally , actress playing girl fails convince us her state mind occurs fim end . perhaps other viewers may like it	-1

i actually really liked this movie , i thought it fun , fairly intelligent , sexy , humorous , quite suspenseful special effects pretty good o.o kay so i am fan angela bassett james spader , they pretty hot this movie you admit ! angela plays dr kaela evers ship medical officer james ship hunky co-pilot nick vanzant who lustful eye kaela who isn't interested him much his disappointmen t.t he action takes place medical spaceship alien artefact secreted aboard miner aforesaid medical spaceship its crew rescue who unbeknown them slowly mutating into something not quite human courtesy alien artefact . there also ship computer called sweetie female persona who pretty much running show technology point view star go supernova . one one crew picked off demented miner , who mayhem his mind , soon only spader bassett left ship which danger sucked into gravitational field crumbling star there only one life pod left share it means possibility kaela nick dna merging together which it partially , they both end up one blue one green eye but miracle miracle kaela also ends up pregnant , condition she never expected ! all all it pretty good sci-fi film , shame it panned so much because it well worth watching but i noticed over years i reviewing films more intelligent sci-fi film offer , less likely it appreciated " green slime mega-blood guts " brigade i call them . you know who you guys , if it isn't gung ho no plot then you don't want know ! watch this film enjoy , if you brain your head appreciates something comes under , " intelligent " " thoughtful " , however if this too much your brain cells , give it miss watch something easier like star wars or men black , great films lots fun but totally lacking anything remotely intelligent beginning end	1
i've heard naysayers badmouth this movie , but i've never understood it . they use descriptors such " preachy " , " overly dramatic " , " self-important " , so . good grief ! what you , bait fishers ( not there anything wrong that) ? this story this man family , it truly beautiful . i guide trout fishing trips missouri , so , course , i love this movie partly fishing . this film explained my fly-fishing passion my wife more effectively than my words dragging her few fishing trips ever could . scenes filmed magnificantly such way you follow logic instinct each fisherman uses catch each fish . however , story so much more than this . story begins norman making note there never clear line religion fly-fishing his family , parallel continues throughout story his life . success fly-fisherman based knowledge , physical skill , intuition , emotion , but balance also required . balance only comes through spirituality , whether you stiving godly person , or whether you simply commune nature spiritual fashion . without balance , tangled line cause you pull your hair out . balance , even most unsuccessful fishing trip brings joy . so norman stuggles understanding his younger brother paul , who attained such miraculous balance river , but whose life away river rapidly spinning out control . end , observant viewer should recognize it paul pride eventually leads his downfall , it family failure their attempts rescue paul they continue struggle remainder their lives well . norman spends his life trying tap into god balance through fly-fishing hopes he someday understand what happened his family why . perhaps finally writing his book helped him answer few those questions . walt fulps http://www.missouritrouthunter.co	1

director kon ichikawa , known his harrowing gritty portrayal brutality war film " fires plain , " which took place philippine island leyte , during wwii , given us truly great look defeated japanese army burma close war . " burmese harp , " not unlike " fires plain " deals defeated japanese army . however , where " fires plain " shows viewer despair private tamura , film " burmese harp " gives us look into spiritual awakening one japanese soldier towards end world war two . soldier main protagonist named mizushima ( shoji yasui ) . moreover , unlike ichikawa later film " fires plain " this film not so much hellish nighmare fighting war , much it deals hellish aftermath burma campaign , how horror this tragic campaign weighs heavily conscience one japanese soldier . those you who not familiar wwii , or burma campaign ; it burma where japanese imperial army suffered greatest loss life world war ii . film , mizushima agrees go fortified mountain stronghold , where last remnants japanese soldiers holed up , refusing surrender . he inform them surrender japan , those inside lay down there arms order return japan . however , something goes terribly wrong company japanese soldiers refuse surrender . narrowly escaping death himself , mizushima decides not return his company , or japan . something changed . he nursed health priest , steals priests clothes : buddhist monk . he proceeds across burma , he sees nothing but unburied corpses dead japanese . mizushima affected seeing these unburied dead his fellow japanese countryman , symbolic death rebirth , he assumes role monk decides not return his unit pow camp , or even return japan until all his fellows soldiers buried . he begins task burying any all japanese dead he comes across his journey across burma : very formidalble task indeed ! mizushima horror seeing bodies unburied dead profound affect him , he become different person . this truly profound poignant film . considering this film released 1956 , mere 11 years after end world war two , makes this classic film which must rank right up there some greatest antiwar films all-time . this film predates " fires plain , " good 3 years . early film dealing this war , i believe this one greatest films come out japan dealing trauma wwii . especially considering directed japanese , released japan . must see , highly recommended	1

this isn't funny . it isn't well directed or scripted . perhaps it could great , if it decent scriptwriter or director , but it didn't , so it turned out mediocre best . unfortunately , i believed all hype this website bought copy this my boyfriend i watch . i told my boyfriend according most reviews i'd read , this going brilliant , hilarious cult classic . but now we've watched it , he i both know better . we know it dreadful , i only imagine all nice things i'm going him make up my expecting him sit through this tedious monstrosity . only highlight us spirited argument he i got into halfway through movie where we'd seen one actors movie before . i'm pleased say i won argument . pretty much only highlight movie me . my opinion this not ' hilarious cult classic ' others so often describe it . i don't know how drunk i'd agree assessment movie , or find it even little bit funny , but i suspect i would get smashed enough i'd need stomach pump afterwards . if you want see genuinly hilarious cult sci-fi classic , pick up copy flash gordon . great actors , great sets , wonderfully campy scripts , brilliant humour , soundtrack queen . furthermore , it stood test time still great today , unlike ' ice pirates ' , which dated really badly . better yet , get hold some ' red dwarf ' dvds ... seriously , red dwarf sci fi humour its best ! it so good , it spoil you other sci fi comedies	-1

when you decide adapt classic film you should take warning several aspects : story aged ? how suspense concept altered new audiences ? we know professed sympathy cimino rourke . we saw him year dragon . somehow mickey doesn't look credible distorted mind criminal . he too rational cold represent hard character . illumination serious problem . whole drama looks extremely theatrical : anthony hopkins looks uncomfortable role mimi rogers inexpressive . elias koteas simply out context perhaps that why insipid dialogue . maybe david morse shows certain wild tendency . there rigidity dialogue . obviously you assist common places : internal disagreements policy procedure . lindsay cruise assertive this role . but initial sequence getaway terrific . it looks too artificial viewer ' adrenaline simply not emanated . sumptuous photography saves film collapse . music didn't help maintain suspense . it not easy readapt classic film fifties . something similar happened cape fear `s remake . question might around new approach suspense new technologies . bogart looked extremely old role rourke looked too elegant convincing ex con . good entertainment teenagers pop corn rainy weekend .	-1

" old chicago " blockbuster movie made 1937 , box office smash which contributed significantly emergence 20th century fox major studio . seeing roadshow version this film makes one wonder why fox bothered put shorter version dvd because you never view it again . all sudden , dramatic portions film make better sense , smooth continuity henry king directed film notably missing shorter version . all principals ' performances improve too because what seemed quite superficial now more depth . example , instead told don ameche honest lawyer , we see him action ; instead told tyrone power crook , we see him offering bribes . power , particular , very convincing charming irish rogue . story corny tale o'leary family hokey quality which undermined lot fox big productions . time you heard third time " we o'learys strange tribe " , you almost hope they suffer some unspeakable death when fire starts ! alice faye plays belle fawcett , dance hall attraction whom crooked power marries . this faye bid major stardom when she replaced jean harlow who died just before production began . faye diffident first but her confidence grows film great success her . her version " carry me back ol ' virginny " memorable . alice brady won best supporting actress oscar her role mrs o'leary but there nothing warrant it except good irish brogue fact she playing serious part once instead screwball mothers which she typecas t.t he special effects which make up last 20 minutes film spectacular really give film status it retained . dvd package contains couple short newsreels biography program don ameche but it would benefited commentary such important film .	1

this traditional telling life jesus , before his birth resurrection . cinematography breathtaking , color , costuming , writing aided carl sandberg flawless inspired scene jesus weeping then raising lazarus dead awe inspiring . it this scene which motivated me write this review . rather than showing us thunderous awakening dead within tomb , stevens jesus lift hem his toga make difficult climb up rocky bluff , puffing all way tomb top hill . once there , jesus strikes pose made popular style ivan mestrovic french bronze sculptors mid twentieth century . when jesus reaches high tomb , stevens sandberg compose masterpiece prayer god life before jesus calls out , " lazarus ! come forth ! " but striking juxtaposition , stevens pulls back camera , hundreds feet tomb showing jesus , son almighty , mere speck against infinity countryside , let alone universe , much fist fight charlton heston gregory peck big country , shows scale man god work . however , jesus calls-out lazarus instead seeing him rise , we see wonderment , bewilderment , fear love men prospect one man raising abyss . we see crowd , camera dollies , rolls scans , faces believers , unbelievers , doubters ever faithful , their reactions man dead three days , reawakened act god , brought forth human , favored god . how much more effective this direction ? rather than straw man seeing dead rise , we see instead how people like us would react such thing , awe , tears joy , fear , love , attempts reconcile reality , unbelievable . there no better way show spectacle scene alone must-see aspiring artist or film director . my only complaint film nitpicky one , jesus ' ( max von sydow ) hair too short . if you believe , clap your hands , even if you don't , its worth 199 minutes your time . i saw film friends when it came out 1965 own vhs dvd , watched it group , one which self-proclaimed atheist-he tears his eyes lazarus scene . 4.75 star	1

( well , least copy i received ep mode ; perhaps some other copies * * recorded sp ; i cannot sure this . ) but this ep recording makes no sense me all , since all 70 minutes could easily fit tape spool " sp " ( standard ) playback mode , give better quality boot . it also seems strange columbia produced some tapes this series 10 " all family " videos sp mode , while others ( like this one ) recorded inferior ep speed . most curious indeed . but , even so , video audio look sound pretty good here , considering limitations vhs format . fact , hi-fi mono sound this tape actually sounds * better * than audio any multiple aitf boxed sets dvd . dvd audio tracks seem tad " weak " me . completists beware ! --- these columbia/tri-star videos " aitf " not showing complete , uncut episodes . some large chunks programming edited out this video , others this series too . which , again , seems strange , because there no commercial interruptions here , obviously no need trim anything time reasons . but , obviously , columbia used truncated , syndicated prints these " all family " videos . example missing scenes --- first episode this tape , final 2 3 minutes epilog scene missing ( when archie mike/meathead talking greeting card edith received earlier episode ) . it * * , indeed , all just " filler " , without much substance , but it would still nice see shows uncut . if you desire see complete , unedited shows , you'll purchase seasonal boxed sets " all family " dvd . dvds present shows uncut form , which great see , because there some often-excised scenes shown dvds you've probably never seen before , due chopped-up prints shown commercial tv . smile-inducing dialogue courtesy mr. archie bunker " meet bunkers " .................. archie ( talking daughter gloria ): " pull skirt down ! ...... every time you sit down one them things , mystery over ! " lol	1
this film evocative quirky , madcap robert altman his best worst . we got it because we bud cort fan family , just see him makes it worth it . but story strange , resolution less than satisfying . if you're really big altman or cort fan , then you must see it . just aware this not western !

there only chinese background . just like memoirs geisha ( actresses - or least main ones where chinese instead japanese ) actors actresses good earth where not chinese either . i certainly cried foul when memoirs geisha chinese actresses where asked play japanese roles . actresses memoirs geisha not pull it off then good earth stars paul muni luise rainer not pull it off either - sorry . now , would role o-lan better played anna may wong arguable . chinese american - she removed here chinese ethnic roots - or she . nevertheless , point there only chinese people background . paul muni plays wang lung , peasant chinese farmer . conversely , luise rainer o-lan , his once slave now wife . this cinematic adaptation pearl buck novel ( which arguably source problem ) wang lung o-lan trying make their way what epic battle against poverty , nature , whole host other impediments - like their own personalities . starting scratch building their land holdings up nothing , then famine hit , losing everything . family moves south only slum it streets city . o-lan - perennial luck bringer finds cache jewels during riot ( which she almost killed herself ) , she wang lung become landlords once again . wang lung sets up stereotype disloyal chinese fellow who hurts his wife deeply - one who brought all luck engaging second , younger wife . get biblical , our protagonists - using skills gained their young son - battle against plague locusts win ! predictably ( it all over place ) there tone inexcusable jingoism movie . good earth more reflection how we saw chinese rather than authentic rendition chinese themselves . muni rainer ( who won oscar this role ) miscast roles , particularly minor characters ( many whom also played non-chinese ) terrible job playing chinese - they all caricature . one could only give kudos movie like this if ( 1 ) one thought this wonderful rendition what we think chinese , ( 2 ) one never china . it orientalism should seen such . miguel llor	1

i really liked this film . before michael moore became liberal celebrity , he completely obscure magazine writer filmmaker . this film major underground hit time , it still excellent today . you really feel people who lose their jobs , you're infuriated callous indifference roger smith management general motors . i really liked segment where flint tries reinvent itself tourist mecca midwest . it consisted horribly misguided attempt opening up hilton downtown flint , opening up theme park called auto world . it justs smacks desperation stupidity ; it make you laugh grimace same time . instead giving these people really good jobs again , they come up this idiotic scheme , which ended up disaster ( both hilton auto world closed within year ) . moore recent years become " political celebrity " , politics become quite cottage industry america . it not just moore doing it ; right wingers like hannity coulter doing it too . they all got books ; some them got films ; some them radio shows . lot them aren't really interested changing anything , it might interfere their livelihoods . i don't know if moore like or not . but this still potent , darkly funny film real class warfare , dismantling working class america .	1

this film good overview case , primer book " devil knot " mara leveritt . it tough present details 90 minutes or so it runs , but it pretty darn good job it . while echols necklace evidence isn't presented documentary , it should also noted judge burnett incessant denial every motion made defense , while same time placating prosecution every turn , isn't presented either . it should also noted , benefit some other reviewers , blood specimens recovered echols necklace couldn't analyzed dna , only blood type . one blood type match damien echols other matched both jason baldwin steven branch . it seems highly implausible 3 young men , one mentally handicapped , could pull off this horrific crime only leave secondary fiber transfers spot blood necklace , ( blood type which matched one alleged perpetrators only one victims ) . if documentary biased , it can't begin counter-balance bias trial judge who would later also serve appellate judge . documentary gripping , but same time fails show miscarriage justice almost entirely handiwork anything but impartial prosecutor robes named judge david burnett . you need read book too	1

i've heard lot good lot bad this film . i don't think anyone deny power denzel brilliant performance , but far accuracy film concerned , it judged harshly it . i personally don't know truth behind this mans conviction , his innocence his quilt , only he knows , but portrait painted this film portrays rubin `the hurricane ' carter victim corrupt system . me it very moving film , regardless if it true or not , eyes actors involved it truly grips draws you into this mans fight freedom . denzel delivers his finest performance here ; well deserved oscar nomination , proves he very talented actor . i am fan denzel , although i've made my concern very clear ( fact denzel times seems only excel when playing these types characters ) , i feel he shines here . despite constant criticism , i feel this must-see film , if not emotional , albeit somewhat fictionalized ( or assumed better word since no one really knows ) , story then brilliant acting part everyone involved . dan hedeya great job crooked ( fictional ) detective who makes it his life goal punish rubin crime he committed child ( crime should never considered crime ) vicellous reon shannon wonderfully lesra , young man who not only fights rubin freedom but helps rubin regain hope life he once . like i said , very heartwarming touching , regardless whether or not rubin guilty or innocent , basic story his fight survival love support he received lesra his companions true act human love spirit joy see	1

i stubbornly resisted this movie because its topic homosexuality , admit i baiased against it only reason . when i finally watched it ( purely paralegal point view ) i amazed sensitivity given issue hand : not necessarily homosexuality , but aids , bias our society still such issues , even 2005 . ( sorry i allowed my predujiced feelings get way . ) it case like this - real or imagined - validates legal system . great wrong comitted against mr. beckett , he fought back , won . relationship andy miguel handled tastefully tactfully , wasn't offensive me all . i especially grateful see how supportive andy family him during this horrible time his life . i very highly recommend this movie " historical " value : not only putting " face " aids homosexuality , but bringing awareness subject .	1

i remember seeing this film when i 7 or 8 years old it scared me senseless . seeing people getting their heads chopped off mutalated who knows what flies around big city gave me uneasy eerie feeling . i didn't know what name this movie i looking it video stores . i stumbled onto this accidentally taking my chances this dragon sky killing people movie i saw 20 years ago , i bought it . after seeing it again , this movie scared me death so many years ago . though , today standards , this movie rather cheap cheesy , it still gave me uneasy eerie feeling . this movie original , flying dragon summoned ritual killings , eats people like birds eat worms . this movie hybrid godzilla slasher flicks . this definately b-movie material , but it fun watch brings back some childhood memories ... worth more than price admission	1

this movie pure classic . there really isn't much more say . it excellent acting , edge-of-your-seat story , it based book stephen king . what more could you ask ? kathy bates plays her character its fullest . while she starts out excentric heroine , she gradually becomes one most terrifying beings ever grace screen . times , you almost question whether she insane , or just depraved sadistic . her self-invented slang so hilarious , it'll you quoting it life . most eerie thing this movie how every act evil performed bates ( her mind ) act love . she really cares her " special guest " , wants him feel same way . that all she really wants . one thing really freaked me out same time i rented this movie , i rented " diary mad black woman . " there reference this movie most frightening sequences . ( please keep mind i not recommend " diary " . it one most boring pointless movies i ever seen .	1
federico fellini 1972 film not his best , when he 8 1/2 , la strada la dolce vita his credit . while many critics adore this film its absurdity plotless , dreamy structure , i found it boring phantasmagorical . it simply fellini version rome not rome , eternal city itself . risk sounding negative , i shall admit there some moments which it most expressive early 1970 rome - scenes which hippies american tourists invade city , long scene outdoor restaurant where everyone talking their heads off ( though saying some pretty vulgar things ) my favorite scene- underground archaelogical excavation which frescoes old roman patricians fade into oblivion . but mostly this film weak it bored me because there no plot . it starts off alright , movie works well when there no sudden fantasy sequences . fellini himself this movie , well gore vidal . fellini envisions himself young man studying rome his youth strict catholic school ( slide/projector shows ancient monuments like colliseum , apian way , trevi fountain vatican well offensive pornographic image woman behind ) later young man journeys rome itself takes residence large family crowded apartment slum . then young man sees talent show tasteless , vulgar long-winded . i found myself just unimpressed outraged audicences went far throw dead cat stage ! it bothered me there much attention prostitution , brothels or cheap , slutty women . cover film promiscuous woman start film . film rome italy , there hardly any allusion opera or any true classical theater . pope fashion show ludicrous blasphemous . only serious , hardcore fans fellini want own this dvd . it perfect follow-up his equally absurd sexually radical satyricon , loosely based old roman epic .	1

gone 60 seconds guilty pleasure - its vacuous superficial , full typical hollywood produced " guy-movie " cues . cars , guns , explosions , anti-heros , angelina jolie abound , well comically evil villains , comically thin plot devices , comically honourable car thieves . all said , though , movie great what it - typical bruckheimer celebration over-the-top action . its fun get lost action , director dominic sena imparts great sense pace ( which he failed carry over into 2001 swordfish ) , keeping tension level-high , action front centre , cars full throttle . there also some real funny moments too - " brick house " rendition police impound lot makes me laugh every time . just brief comment here : some movies , it just looks like everyone fun set . this one them . regardless how goofy or superficial roles , everyone screen far into them , looks like they're enjoying every second it . it makes great viewing experience - its always more fun watch movie where actors invested script , compared one where staff plods through reads their lines zombie mode . jolie cage good resonnance , ribisi great always - this movie makes we want go out get copy boiler room . let me start saying menus give you seizure if you're epileptic , so watch out . they're attempting communicate " fast , " i guess , but it comes across more " spastic " " illegible . " oh well . 5.1 mix great - full life , well-deployed bass great motion spatial placement . these important characteristics this movie , you'll hearing plenty cars zoom across screen , helicopters hovering behind you , so . i'm little surprised there isn't dts track or anything really fancy this disc though - given director cut nature release , i expected top shelf audio treatment . while this certainly good , its hard imagine its best . director cut : apparently this version film includes " never before seen footage cut into movie . " its not disclosed where this footage film , however , or how much it there , so its hard say if it material impact or not . i saw original years ago , didn't notice any major deviations version this , so i'm not feeling lot excitement this " feature . " jerry bruckheimer filmo- bio-graphy : one little known fact judge his picture included this disc , jerry . fact very close relative chuck norris , if not actually chuck norris himself . other than revelation , this feature pretty uninspired - lots ho-hum text scroll through . conversations jerry . : this feature much more substance than prior one , even though its fundamentally unrelated gone 60 seconds . his conversations , bruckheimer explains role producer , conception , funding , staffing ( finding director , instance ) , so . this some interesting material , bruckheimer comes across really humble guy who knows how lucky he working top knotch talent . action overload : here some filler you . montage action scenes movie , set some nameless soundtrack piece . underwhelming . big chase : this series several vignettes , dissecting big finale chase film , shelby mustang vs . 500 cop cars . this very , very good material - director sena various stunt crew explain piece piece how visual effects film put together . lots great knowledge absorb . various featurettes : 0 60 : this " ok " featurette , which centers mainly character development , writing , casting . worth watching , nice short . wild rides : believe it or not , nick cage his own stuntdriver movie . nicely ! stars move : series featurettes key characters their stories , narrated bruckheimer , writer scott rosenberg , actors . notwithstanding fact i no idea what different " director cut , " this great release . there some real quality extras there , good audio video , , well , all adds up quality	1

previous reviewer noted film basically platform expound george bernard shaw views munitions , war other issues day , rated it one star . i found shaw social views , brilliantly elucidated robert morley better acting performance than many us ever seen him , what make this great film ; whether you agree them or , like morley estranged screen daughter wendy hiller title role , disagree , dialogue fascinating ; acting morley , hiller , rex harrison , robert newton youthful deborah kerr , first-rate ; gritty london locales add greatly atmospheric ambience film . i hope powers-that-be favor us dvd version this great film soon	1

kurosawa adaptation king lear succeeds every way , so brilliantly : visuals , plot , score no equals either individually or taken whole . criterion excellent job reproducing vibrant colors movie , which essential . plot based king lear , but where it diverges it improvement - final scene no parallel king lear , my opinion most moving . unforgetable	1

first time i saw this film when it came out 1986 , time i terribly disappointed . didn't like film all , thought it amateurish pretentious . but then i watched it recently dvd , realized it really good film - performances all really good , i liked seeing dc scenery , directing mike nichols wonderfully subtle . despite fact both nicholson streep sometimes overpowering , nicholson get bit hammy times this ( i still can't abide scene where he sings ) , i found both their performances deep nuanced . co-stars good too , added lot , i especially enjoy catherine o'hara portrayal gossip . carly simon singing really set tone well this movie , which definitely worth watching . if you don't like it first time , watch it again year or two , i'll bet you'll re-appraise it more positively	1

head honcho [ ... ] i watched well over 200 reality/political films give " why we fight " my highest recommendation . this needs shown prime time television ; if it it would prompt thunderous public outcry badly needed government military reforms . it covers facts many don't know united states , like our penchant endless involvement military actions over seas . film launching pad infamous eisenhower farewell speech which he warns america growing military industrial complex . then , unique compelling style it pinpoints famous people , places moments time candid footage revealing quotes ; it also delves into personal perspectives few ordinary citizens affected sept . 11 resulting occupation iraq . it visits key players government exposes what really drives war machine . it looks military contractors congress their incestuous relationship . it also reveals much too influential role so called think tanks play crafting our national policy . addition soundtrack features some great musical talen t.t he information presented this film something every american should know , but they don't know it most part because people who want those war wheels turning don't want people know what they're doing or why . it seems war minded even believe people not any need know . people beg differ . " why we fight " my personal top ten most important movies list which why it would great gift . informing people kind gift really worth giving .	1

this always favorite movie mine -- enchanting , visually stunning superb acting . but i say , i think digital remastering takes some enchantment away . least audio aspect . actor voices lost human richness -- esp women voices which sound higher pitched slightly annoying . even music sound effects sound little " off .

previous reviewer challanged lack normative values , however , even though there elements risque film , director chose reserved let actors ultimately audience decide themselves what they think it all . i thought plot , scenery , songs everything else all great . it french musical whodunnit but one doesn't take itsself too seriously . whoever wrote bad review shouldn't take it so seriously either ( besides , it ridiculous rip countries birthrate if it part artistic value movie , so he should ranted somewhere bit more appropriate . ) my favorite characters played denouve huppert ( both whom amazing actresses their own rights ) all twists turns kept me entertained , even though bit suspension disbelief required . then again , it musical , so disbelief should left door	1

i really liked this dvd . hard it watch all painful memories it brings flooding back into forefront consciousness . callous cold hearted indifferent nastiness reagan administration those it considered lesser americans lay hospitals suffering dying . this dvd shows dr gallo shallow man vaccuous heart lacking anything remotely akin human compassion unless course camera rolling . film shows cdc headed political hacks who elevated collected arts administrative spin control , reckless indifference suffering \ death people it not like stonewalling stuff mythic legend . while dvd shows ugliest demons human heart laid bare whole world might see it also shares most humane tender moments early days before hiv / aids got those names . film showed how even one america darkest hours when true presidental leadership asleep switch , little people those deep inside government all they could protect public health living up highest standards onr called offer themselves service our nation . dvd simply told truth it left pretty much viewer make up his or her own mind what they think those times . there some moving facts end dvd all now quite dated . i guess thing caught me so totally off guard running tally showing numbers sick dying people earliest days epidemic . it so sad how reagan adminstration so viciously sat its hands doing nothing while so many died epidemic it might not stopped but it might slowed significantly it only acted same fortitude home it mustered beruit or libia . yes i dwell too much sickening aspects those times because just seeing it again after lived through it makes me mad . seeing this dvd just convinces me we real leader white house when aids hiv grid gay cancer first burst onto scene things might not so grim . but this dvd so much more than venom pain loss it also highlights human kind its best . there much love this dvd balanced grim realities day . back day i not say i front lines , because indeed i not . i think this movie must anyone collection its current price it not beat . course i brought copy might buy spare lend out teaching purposes . this dvd pretty accurate hiv history it should told	1
kurosawa stands out one great directors modern cinema . this movie particular often cited shining example his artistry . sets , lighting cinemotagraphy superb . where film falters editing . it choppy parts point laughable . add scenery chewing overacting toshir� mifune viewer left sense kurosawa missed mark this ambitious projec t.t he great director resorts some rather hamfisted sentimentalities end he attempts salvage tale sound fury into something significance . he only partially successful .

i agree all other reviews which discussed " ikiru " terms its message individual : live your life meaning purpose , take pleasure helping others , cherish nurture children . however , there one other aspect i'd like highlight : kurosawa thoughts individual society . commentary stephen prince makes clear , one main points behind kurosawa work head-on critique japanese society immediate post-war era . although this period laid foundation japan economic recovery , kurosawa not alone pointing out drive economic prosperity accomplished huge human spiritual cost . this idea also one prime motivators behind work other japanese artists humanists like hayao miyazaki ( " spirited away " , " princess mononoke " ) lunatic right exemplified mishima . kurosawa uses watanabe kenji foil expose hypocrisy selfishness society values materialism order above humanity mindfulness . one hand , most other reviewers pointed out , kurosawa condemns way bureaucratic small-mindedness government stifles any real concern well-being ordinary people . other , watanabe son daughter-in-law embody new age impatience its elders their inability see beyond their own concerns even when people around them clearly crisis . number people complained length second half movie , but ( prince commentary again makes clear ) , flashbacks important establish stronger sense watanabe co-workers characters both illustrate their gradual understanding meaning watanabe life but also highlight their inability really follow his example . kurosawa view society pretty cynical when you come right down it . even though many his works celebrations individual creativity spirit , he also forthright forces arrayed against it : small-mindedness , fear making mistakes , greed herd mentality . it no wonder he often accused " un-japanese " . one also see this thread kurosawa later movies including his period pieces such " seven samurai " " kagemusha " : both these films , ordinary folks high mighty also found wanting groups . while there may individuals principle , they not prevail end . but , kurosawa makes this point each his movies , efforts such individuals true definition nobility spirit , it this message which provides power behind all his works . this wonderful piece movie making . it humanism its most trenchant finest . you must see this film , it one best movies all time .	1

" el-hazard : magnificent world " anime very much " tenchi muyo ! " mold : romantic comedy/adventure which blank-slate protagonist makoto thrust into sci-fi scenario gets play hero while chased multiple women . though characters " el-hazard " aren't developed deeply " tenchi " crew show occasionally suffers awkward pacing , " el-hazard " charm all it own . mysterious antiheroine ifurita compelling , kids ' hard-drinking teacher fujisawa consistently funny . most impressively , " el-hazard " tells complete satisfying story , tying up its seeming plot holes ingenious last-episode twist . usually these types shows start strong , only end up limping through anticlimaxes false endings . even romantic tension unambiguously resolved ! dub also pretty darn good , though it tends get overly shouty , especially segments centering jinnai . can't guy ever just speak normal tone ? " el-hazard " hardly type show change your life , but if you like " tenchi " or other anime this vein , this box set probably good bet . ( set actually contains two separate shows : original " el-hazard " oav its 4-episode sequel " el-hazard 2 . " sequel inconsequential side story unfortunately doesn't really add any value . )	1

walt disney made five television shows davy crockett fess parker title role buddy ebsen his sidekick george russel . you now own all five these television shows two versions . this version presents all five television shows they first presented abc mid-1950s . there also two-movie version combines these five television shows into two movies . i personally prefer disney treasures version . this version also includes additional material may interesting fan series . gem additional material interview fess parker . television shows this set diverse style . first three television episodes " davy crockett - indian fighter , " " davy crockett goes congress , " " davy crockett alamo . " these television shows some basis historical fact , though many things portrayed these shows wrong . example , davy left rifle he called " betsy " back tennessee when he went texas . what amazing these television shows response americans . suddenly children everywhere sporting coonskin caps carrying replicas muzzle-loading rifles . it became unfashionable native american , very fashionable say " bar " instead bear . though davy not survive events alamo , davy popularity such walt disney brought davy back two additional television adventures , " davy crockett keelboat race " " davy crockett river pirates . " according walt disney , this second set adventures based stories created davy crockett , who become legend his own time . stories more humorous than first three , showed even larger-than-life version davy crockett than first three adventures . what most remarkable these television shows how well they hold up . story davy crockett timeless . davy attributes those form basis how americans see themselves . self-reliance , honesty , keeping your word , plain-spoken remain characteristics most americans value . viewer forgive several things we now regard politically incorrect , particularly first part first movie , where davy seems little regard native americans . however , later episodes davy clearly values his friendship native americans attempts honor commitments u.s. government made them . i allowed my children watch these movies when they very young . yes , there some violence these movies . however , davy george russel used violence only when there appeared no other reasonable way out . given era depicted these movies violent , i think movies directed produced well . these movies great way introduce your children era when american ethic honesty , hard work , trust formulated . davy crockett instrumental example we all follow , perhaps now more than ever . this movie must every family film library . enjoy !	1
sure , this movie classic . but it any good ? frankly , i found it tedious extreme . it certainly pleasant look . sets quite amazing , cinematography absolutely beautiful . story ( described detail many other reviews here ) potential both thriller thought-provoking essay ( ultimately it neither ) . acting top notch , all special effects . those us who cut our teeth using teletype machines always get kick out seeing them all their anachronistic glory . fact , all computer stuff believable era pleasantly nostalgic . but whole thing never rises its premise . its " thriller " aspect artificial not tied central plot line , entirely predictable moment our friend handed only key stop nuke ! resolution afterthought ( quick fix extreme ) , barely even mentioned two lines dialogue after artificial danger ( narrowly , whew ! ) averted . characters thin best , stock wors t.t his movie really slow survey what people early 70s thought technology would like mid 70s . yawn . ( i must laugh whole bell/paper bit . it means nothing plot , ultimate contrivance . ) if deadly virus actually came back space , there would certainly action many fronts , plenty interesting conflict go around . some people would try understand it , others would want only kill it . there some potentially interesting tension right there . some people would argue keep danger hidden public , others would want warn them . again , could good source tension . someone would surely suspected military wanted harness it biological weapon ( mentioned passing , but never developed ) , while others would try very hard prevent . more tension . i'm just saying this movie littered missed opportunities something more than collection boring experiments pointlessly slow-moving scenes which it actually contains . this movie poster child boring science fiction , it would not way . i haven't read book , but i bet it lot better . its core , this movie boring dud .	-1

logan run belongs class old school science fiction films which popular early mid-1970 , prior beginning star wars franchise . these films not rely non-stop action or dazzling special effects , but rather thoughtful , intelligent stories , intriguing " what if ? " scenarios , astute social commentary . they included sci fi classics such soylent green , omega man , andromeda strain , westworld , others . while shopping mall setting some special effects logan run pretty cheesy , it still interesting film its themes may even more relevant today botox era than they 70 . i heard they doing remake would like think it improve original . unfortunately , given recent history hollywood , it more likely they drain every last bit intelligence out story , replace it more explosions , perhaps smith .	1

super size me received some good reviews , but film not yet generally recognized masterpiece it most certainly . this one few films clear concept executed perfection . didactic objectives esthetic values not diluted committee whose final product compromise conflicting views objectives . anyone who seen film should recognized making money could not primary objective producer , otherwise he would not so unsparing exposing truth food producers , among most poweful power blocs country . one striking virtues this film how american brand humor used so skillfully illuminate such unhumorous subject national health endemic ! even while laughing , viewer no doubt ever script deadly serious life-and-death subject . could there ever better example than this film how heavy subject treated effectively light-handed , even comic manner ? course laughter fact serious matter , arthur kostler amply noted only few words : " dictators more afraid laughter than they bombs . " but humor hard use except strict comedy or farce . morgan spurlock obviously understands this uses humor abundantly but proper restraint good judgment . he not take unfair advantage those whom he criticizes . he criticizing what people , not who they . he may made people mad , but some those people may fullness time if not before , recognize his criticisms their actions common good , including their own . after all , they endangering their health if they consume their own products . how we not admire guy who offers himself human guinea pig provide evidence what supersized junk food diet human body ? he extraordinary vocation his project deep concern welfare his fellow human beings endanger his health such way . millions americans experiencing impaired health shortening their lives because faulty diet . fact we what we eat . but , alas , our schools doing very bad job educating us how eat right government agencies doing very bad job protecting us against junk food . example , take look food package try decipher what ingredients printed tiny pale yellow characters pale peach background .

thing i remember most this film when i saw it theater 1990 its honesty . every level . great care taken accurately depict one particular community one particular time -- when aids first diagnosed " gay cancer , " up through mid-eighties , when attending monthly funerals commonplace gay men their friends . though hiv/aids around decade when this movie made , there no effort part filmmakers whitewash past . they not only show ugliness disease , they show ugliness people response it . even within gay community there tendency people fingerpoint , accusing first victims more promiscuous than themselves , or more excessive users amyl nitrate recreational drugs . there fear contamination , reluctance touch or kiss , even intimacy within monogomous relationships hampered . people reached deperately new age cures , louise haye reigning goddess self-healing . choosing depict five-year period , filmmakers allow viewer see lives group friends evolve deepen . some course succumb disease die , others wrestle their losses rethink their lives . end , survivors try become part solution ; they become visiting volunteers political activists . all its authenticity , film not depressing . this incredible ensemble acting its best . campbell scott , bruce davison , mark lamos give especially moving performances , but there no slackers this cast . time movie released , face aids already changing filmmakers criticized focusing exclusively gay victims . i felt then , i continue believe , this misplaced criticism . all fiction self-limited . longtime companion story one small group friends who affected unknown dreadful disease ; it shows how each them responds challenges thrown them . yes , they wealthy or middle-class white men who spent summers together fire island . but longtime companion not celebration their insular lives . fact , end film , one this insular group , campbell scott character , shown working home care volunteer who visits latino man . i think filmmakers , like gmhc time , aware things starting change . it seems me film critics , even 1990 , forgotten aids first announced new york times " gay cancer " later " gay related immune deficiency syndrome " before called aids . but said , we need remember there many other people stories worth telling , including those people living coping aids africa . my only hope these stories told all accuracy sensitivity went into making longtime companion . dvd no significant " extras , " but transfer excellent	1

many reviewers this site said they would want see film focuses hardships extremes immigrants face when coming united states . this , i respond : we've seen hundreds times films . same goes sports films . we've seen movie glory road other films like coach carter , remember titans , hoosiers . they exactly same movie different team . that not say these films aren't decent sports flicks , but film industry needs take step back when making film potential just like every other film its genre . said , exactly what jim sheridan america . story so original acting makes this film glorious triumph . basic story follows family irish immigrants who come america same notion all immigrants : attain american dream . but , they all sooner or later find out , american dream ideology 99.9% people never attain . they trouble finding place stay , end up apartment top run down building many its residents junkies . father johnny ( paddy considine ) struggling actor , who hasn't able get part since death his son frankie , who fell down stairs . mother sarah ( samantha morton ) takes job ice cream parlor earn rent money . oldest daughter christy ( sarah bolger ) probably one smarter people film , sarah bolger gives flawless performance such young girl . she stereotype oldest child who forced grow up too soon . her younger sister ariel ( played sarah bolger younger sister emma ) typical naive little girl who asks fifty questions everything . there some really touching scenes throughout course film , one especially comes mind , where father almost squanders away all family money trying win e.t. doll youngest daughter . there essentially three miracles film , christy , who also narrator , relates these three events set three wishes her brother frankie told her before he died . other great scenes film involve family their relationship man one floors below . when they first arrive house , christy calls him " man who screams . " this man name mateo ( played brilliantly djimon hounsou ) he brilliant artist quite bit emotional problems . he sort figure " morality " film , often giving out endless amounts advice . mateo some sort disease ( we only expect it probably venerial disease ) he gets sick throughout movie . america features one best ensembles i ever seen . every actor perfect every scene . djimon hounsou paddy considine give best performances entire film , jim sheridan wrote directed every gorgeous shot film . while i agree one other reviewer how christy modern camera story set eighties , stupid facts like these should not detract overall message film . overall message , then , not just how immigrants face hardships when they come america ; we already know previous films and/or experiences . film such deeper message , relating not just immigrants , but every person who watches this film . i really not want give message away , but rather i leave it up you go rent or buy this treasure film . this truly one most unforgettable movies i ever seen	1
cast alone makes this great film own - lionel barrymore before pain spinal problems forced him wheelchair , clark gable , norma shearer small part up-and-coming leslie howard . classic story good evil , but who cares who wins when you get watch talent like this when it still young fresh . norma shearer extremely popular time this made gable just beginning climb perverbial hollywood ladder . they genuine chemistry together my favorite english actor , leslie howard , small supporting role but adds stylish noirish feel this film . aside , howard went make many great films , including " gone wind " " petrified forest " ( humphrey bogart bette davis ) , but this great talent killed during ww ii when flying states england . legend lingers today not disproved howard acting undercover agent britain u.s. he taking valuable information britain when his plane shot down june 1 , 1943 . this film , gable seductive shearer loves every moment it , but her father , barrymore , see danger ahead valiantly fails keep his daughter tragedy he sees coming them all . no one could picked better cast this film , smallest part lead . they all superstars their time it wonderful films like this here new generations view . storyline may seem quaint compared today values , but i wish sincerely young people give this film others its genre chance . there not doubt world those every generation beyond 18 truly enjoy " free soul " . they say - " what not like !	1

nicolas roeg curious , ambitious director " man who fell earth " one his most curious ambitious films . made wake success films like walkabout , this film 1 3 movies roeg made it into criterion collection . i've only seen two other roeg films ... walkabout don't look now . i don't think this film better than either those it certainly more flaws , but it definitely trippy experience . david bowie makes his screen debut thomas , alien who comes earth bring water back his dying planet . once earth , he becomes millionaire becoming head huge corporation ; he begins affair young woman mary-lou ( candy clark ) receives help his quest nathan bryce ( very young rip torn ) . bowie makes it clear this film he good actor , even though he looks little like annie lennox film . it hard flaunt acting skills movie like this , because this movie not based plot . fact , plot actually pretty minute part this film . this film more focused its visuals , other roeg films , there plenty . roeg cinematographer , before becoming director it clear he always hand visual style his films . they all unmistakable mark made their creator . man who fell earth couldn't made many directors , because it so essentially built images . usual , roeg comfortable nudity there plenty here . i think walkabout don't look now perfect films if they're not perfect , they're close it . man who fell earth not perfect ... it overlong ( 137 minutes ) , sometimes doesn't enough emphasis plot , but it still worth seeing . it science-fiction film people who don't even like science fiction . if you like stunning cinematography ( or , least , appreciate it ) . i'd recommend definitely checking this movie out . grade :	1

badly neglected both audiences critics time it original release , nuts film ripe reevaluation . based tom toplor 1981 courtroom play , nuts definitely dialogue-based film little hollywood flashiness . though extremely well-written ( toplor , adapting his own work darryl ponicsan alvin sargent ) sharply staged directed veteran martin ritt , it cast whom really responsible bringing nuts life . barbra streisand gives absolutely bravura performance should earned her oscar nomination . alternately hilarious frightening , streisand always mesmerizing she delves so far into character . richard dreyfess nothing less than streisand equal her public defender . he too robbed oscar nomination . supporting cast top-notch ensemble professional character actors ( maureen stapleton , eli wallach , robert webber , james whitmore , karl malden ) , all whom work their craft flawlessly . nuts ' screenplay indulge predictability some typical courtroom-plot conventions little too often , but toplor absorbing script still deserves high praise it fascinating exploration what constitutes normality whether or not insane should required receive treatment . nuts isn't going win over any fans 3-cuts-per-second action films , but it leave lovers thought-provoking , expertly-acted dramas fascinated . dvd : picture quality dark grainy , however , i believe this reflects film intended look . sound fine , it nice film trailer included . streisand intelligent entertaining full-length commentary main extra here , it more than makes up disappointing tracks she contributed what up , doc ? main event dvds	1

going into this movie , i expected alot bs . especially noting two lead characters rappers ; i must give alot props ja rule , he actually pretty good actor ! also , i expected alot gun fights , no real plot . however i pleasantly proved wrong . this movie actually gives us chance audience get tune characters . return giving us ability sympythetic towards them , what they're going through . plot pretty simple , two 20 something black males , trying get over their ' cash-flow ' problem . one , who love music , other just want any method getting ' set life .

" ringer " kind movie where , upon quick glance , most people would assume made strictly shock offend . considering infamous farrelly brothers ( " there something mary , " " me , myself irene " ) stand producers , one could imagine many cheap-shots this movie would take . surprisingly , though , it doesn't . despite restrictions movie gives itself , it quite funny times . despite somewhat predictable plot , it actually bit heartwarming sentimental . apparently , i'm minority people who actually enjoyed this movie . then again , i tried not keep my expectations up too high . starters , this isn't exactly farrelly brothers movie , so don't go expecting type humor . sure , it shows up times , but " ringer " more conventional than those movies . johnny knoxville ( " jackass " ) perfect steve , reluctant participant special olympics , coerced his uncle gary , played brian cox ( " manhunter , " " red eye " ) . steve forced into games part pay off his uncle bookies , but also able afford surgery replace three severed fingers man he hired mow his lawn . plot get bit ridiculous points , you see steve happy-ending lynn ( katherine heigl " bride chucky " ) , volunteer olympics , coming miles away . but despite all , movie good job carrying message without condescending or losing it sense humor . if you look cover dvd or read any reviews feel urge instantly offended , don't . " ringer " quite well-done , actually features many mentally-disabled actors prominent roles . if that not enough you , it also flat-out funny . it simply good comedy decent story interesting original angle . just don't take it too seriously	1

this just great fun anthology horror film george . romero , it also writen stephen king so you probably know what expect when you these two geniuses horror genre together this deffinetely high quality film . creepshow inspired horror comics tales crypt ec comics which released during 50 quite unique bit controversial during period , these five tales quite good alot fun watch especially halloween but still you could watch them any time , during beginning title sequence shot like comic book some nice animation then live scenes happen where bratty kid playing around his horror comic book then his dad finds out gets angry upset well story resolves end film when boy gets his revenge , boy played stephen king son so watch out some bad acting these stories not really scary but you wouldn't mind since they're alot fun watch anyway here short summary these five stories:-father day involves family reunion , ashtray unnatural desire cake . watch out ed harris corny dance sequence zombie rises his grave , very good storyline revenge retribution " where my cake !?! " . lonsome death jordy verill features stephen king dorky dumb farmer who discovers meteor all sorts growth fungus decides touch it , not good idea since now hes turn into plant . this one worst storylines but good thing its short doesn't take long , there some funny parts though . something tide you over tells leslie nielson interesting plan vengeance against man who stole his wife played ted danson . this very good suspensfull storyline keep you edge your seat leslie buries ted danson character sand . crate one my favorites it some wonderful special fx tom savini who made effects monster crate looks like its world quite creepy , story college professor who very loud obnoxious wife played adrienne barbeau who keeps embarissing her husband infront everyone untill opritunity comes get rid her , this story alot twisted dark humor it some gore . they're creeping up you rich greedy eccentric executive type who deal roach problem , this very nice storyline wraps up everything . overall film classic 80 horror film best george romero flick since he more known his living dead trillogy this film also showed he could other things beside , great stuff highly recommended . make sure you also watch sequal this back back , best storyline imo raft where college kids get eaten creature lake .	1
most reviews so far fail make these points : if you not yet seen other films bresson ( such diary country priest ) or certain other austere difficult directors ( tarkovksy mirror comes mind ) , you probably wasting your money if you buy this one -- rent it or get it your library . second , it helps know bresson thinks actors " models " not vehicles plot character development ; they deliver their lines ( what few they ! ) largely emotionless way , result , evidently , repetition point where lines uttered almost unconsciously . third , bresson views almost all what most people call " movies " merely filmed versions theater -- other words , typical movie bresson nothing more than kind play happens filmed . he believes what he pointedly calls " cinema " must something different order find its real potential art : namely , true art film lies creation meaning through juxtaposition images . ( i don't think i know what he means , but that what he says -- all this excellent 1966 french television show accompanies dvd viewers must watch after film itself . ) my own experience : i both frustrated fascinated film but glued it despite its lack narrative arc or traditional emphasis cause effect . i find bresson bleak take human nature this film too dark ( i am not particulary sunny myself human nature ) but am drawn further consider balthazar , other bresson films , future . fact , i woke up next day immediately thinking balthazar am still thinking film two weeks later . rate such film , sense , both foolish beside point . it not " enjoyable " any normal sense yet it clearly masterpiece way many works modern art . you really prepared approach it aesthetic intellectual challenge try understand how meaning might emerge juxtaposition filmed images . oh , i mention donkey might christ figure	1

wow . jeanne moreau marcello mastroianni monica vitti , all same movie together . talk incredible amount screen presence . moreau mastroianni play married couple trapped listless relationship . they keep missing each other , making half-hearted attempts reconnect or least stay same frame together longer than 5 minutes . but they drift apart , mastroianni gravitating towards capitalist society world , moreau wandering off edge screen go long walks herself . empty , abandoned streets make her happy , give her taste life freedom . i think _l'avventura_ , where woman , similarly unhappy her relationship , drifts off edge screen vanishes altogether . but moreau doesn't disappear . she sticks around watch her disintegrating marriage like train wreck , even instigating her husband flirtation vitti , tycoon daughter . i never really understand what motivates characters antonioni films what they . i guess that why i keep watching his films , even when i don't " get " anything solid them , even when watching them isn't exactly " enjoyable . " but i can't stop watching them , probably because they're realistic . they leave me flat feeling , but really really enriched flat feeling , like i've just through trying experience real life can't even begin make sense it or identify what " point " . acting here so different what passes nowadays oscar-winning acting . it totally different concept performance . actors _la notte_ great , not so much because they project character , but because they absorb their characters fully . there withholding quality their presence sometimes makes me feel skeptical their shallowness , or equivalently , their depth . but i never fully doubt , because there always so much substance there , anti-sentimental understated . i want say something like , " though these characters live increasingly technological environment , depersonalized ahistoricized industrial redevelopment , they still carry around heartbreaking sense history . " film begins couple visit dying friend hospital , ends their long night beautiful-people party hosted millionaires . characters aware folly , but they also recognize power disaffection , contradiction , boredom . moreau severe , striking face weighed down sorrow burden active one relationship . she look hunger , neediness she suppresses most time displays caution . mastroianni suave stoic , disillusioned intellectual more than touch opportunism him . vitti highly perceptive , capricious , but resigned ; more than any other character film , she hints possibility unrealized generosity underlying her shiny veneer wealth privilege . all characters seem live aesthetically . i mean , they seem detached their feelings , yet they act them nonetheless . they meta-awareness their actions which might called sophistication . actually , this sensibility rampant among antonioni characters , who almost always drawn upper-class intelligentsia milan or rome . this case , mastroianni character writer , novelist i think . vitti reads literature improvises restless prose poems into tape recorder . we never find out exactly what moreau character , but she take epic long walk during day that work art itself ; she sculpts her experiences feelings out walk , she composes conducts walk . which brings me importance women antonioni films . antonioni , women often function agents moral intelligence otherwise decadent , alienating , careless world . moreau risks her own safety break up fistfight some tough teenagers . vitti disturbed breakdown love mastroianni moreau marriage . ( fact , vitti pretty much excels this function all antonioni films she appears : that why she one my favorite actresses all time . ) these just more visible instances , but general pattern always present : women take experiences give back ethical responses , while men , well , kind adrift lost . they need women sober ground them . i'm struck fragility this need locate moral intelligence other human beings . perhaps that why antonioni characters depend each other so	1
most surprising aspect this 2006 thrill ride movie ninety minutes , it almost half-hour shorter than its 1972 predecessor , blessing really given director wolfgang peterson seems only interested filming action sequences . inspired choice remake , veteran director already proven sharp acumen providing exceedingly cramped , seafaring adventures his classic wwii submarine movie , " das boot " more recent fishing trip-gone-wrong , " perfect storm " . offsetting problem , however , mark protosevich trite screenplay abbreviates character development favor banal dialogue stock responses . net result there little concern fate any characters , especially women who look interchangeable when soaked , no matter how dire consequences . peterson wastes little time , barely fifteen minutes , setting up ten key characters big tidal wave . point , he combines predictably spectacular cgi effects outsized set pieces dramatize familiar journey this group takes find their way hull where they seek safety . one indisputable improvement over original way peterson effectively shows fast elevating water level more realistic way , especially characters swim lot more through submerged air shafts . less realistic way all characters appear swim olympian levels their ability forego oxygen lengthy periods . but set-up gets repetitive , only diversion , albeit minor one , figuring out which character killed next . alpha male , josh lucas cuts reasonable action figure playing gene hackman hero role though more mercenary type given his character professional gambler . relegated second lead , kurt russell seems inheriting ernest borgnine role but not blowhard cop but sensitive former mayor new york ( huh ? ) . they argue periodically what path take , but that only relationship any semblance reality film . no one colorful shelley winters or stella stevens this time , rest actors barely register , including wide-eyed emmy rossum playing russell conflicted daughter jacinda barrett brave mother predictably precocious son . biggest waste normally colorful richard dreyfuss cast rather pathetically gay , suicidal architect who barely says word once action starts . climax gets quite convoluted its technicalities , then it simply ends . there nine minutes end credits end listing multitudes who worked special effects . two-disc 2006 dvd strictly aficionados this genre film several " making " featurettes history channel documentary which looks possibility such waves wreaking such havoc . surprisingly , there little reference 1972 inspiration directed ronald neame . consequntly , there barely enough hold interest over course two discs . unmemorable viewing experience overall	-1

this gem movie probably not blockbuster when released . storyline thin almost non-existent , it could summed up " everyone gets chance screw up second time " . nevertheless , there enough twists turns make what story there interesting . this must sort movie every good actor actress would love role screenplay written accomplished playwright . it farcical melodrama rather than comedy but nonetheless highly enjoyable . film-making team , hard up critical funds , just thrown out small town new hampshire . their movie plot necessitates choice small town new england locale water mill ( one reason why they short funds they build old water mill replica new hampshire town ) . movie begins director his crew find themselves small town vermont ( actually most scenes shot connecticut or massachusetts ) . beauty location well-captured excellent photography . makers " state main " not fall into trap shooting film during fall . new england fall colours would major distraction although alfred hitchcock black comedy " trouble harry " succeeded despite shot vermont peak fall leaf colour season , but then hitchcock exceptional genius . small town going its leisurely way until film crew arrive . obvious star " state main " philip seymour hoffman previously little known hollywood actor whose first appeared screen spoilt rich daddy supported george willis jr. memorable al pacino film , " scent woman " . hoffman key role " state main " author screen play writer movie within movie . better known hollywood star alec baldwin plays lesser role film-in making male star . he portrayed lustful male whose sexual preference under age nubile girls . director played william . macy , who completely unflappable no matter what . producer arrives after crew settled . role played droopy-eyed david paymer , who completely obsessed money bribe anyone get things moving . male star lead almost fatally distracted young teenager ( julia stiles ) . female lead siren , sarah jessica parker , demands substantial extra money appearing naked scene claiming she found religion . hoffman smitten heart attractive young woman ( rebecca pidgeon ) town who engaged or semi-engaged local bad man town councillor . i leave it reader imagination find out if film crew gets second chance screw up again . movie directed david mamet , leading american playwright . mamet wrote screen plays " postman always rings twice " , " untouchables " , minor role performer 1986 thriller " black widow " . he directed several movies aside this one past 17 years . it evident mamet , who also wrote screen play this charming melodrama , loss suitable title film , just like director play , who wanted call his movie " old mill " , only find out , upon arrival vermont town , much advertised " old mill " burnt down 1960 . so mamet settled uninspiring title " state main "" intersection where town brand new traffic lights still stand start movie . interestingly enough title dvd version " state main " circulating greece translated " without title " . i am fairly confident this little known 102 minute movie become movie buff classic one day .	1

when disney released sword stone onto dvd 2001 , disney only really gotten into releasing their movies onto dvd within last two years , starting their failed limited issue line . gold collection followed , some limited issues repackaged gold collection titles , more titles released . most these decent , if not somwhat problematic dvd transfers few , if any , bonus materials . however , few disney gold collection titles given decent releases . among those 30th anniversary edition bedknobs broomsticks ( although not officially gold collection title many people standards , it says gold collection spine . ) this 2001 dvd release sword stone . first off , film given nice transfer here . dvd case boasts it '' fully restored remastered . '' although it not up par platinum edition restorations or masterpiece edition alice wonderland transfer , it far better than many other gold collection transfers . it nicely cleaned up , although it bit grainier than one would like , there still bit dirt transfer . colors punched up nicely , though . video transfer here very satisfying , audio mix . disc also includes quite few good bonus materials . sword stone scrapbook features concept art film , production photos , character design , concept poster art , official poster art , more . two sing-alongs lifted disney sing-along songs video series provide fun captions two film more memorable songs . film facts ... well , basically . two animated shorts , '' knight day '' '' brave little tailor '' very entertaining . '' music magic : sherman brothers '' shermans talking songs they wrote sword stone , including couple deleted . ( shermans also music magic featurette bedknobs broomsticks , one better , because it also gave little info making film , well its 1996 restoration . ) finally , episode walt disney disneyland tv series included - '' all magic '' 1957 . although this isn't directly related sword stone , its inclusion praised nonetheless . my only disappointment this dvd lack any sort theatrical trailer or tv spot . come , disney ! nonetheless , sword stone fine example disney earliest attempts give their movies deluxe treatment single-disc dvd releases , reserving their 2-disc dvd releases platinum editions ( this year snow white platinum edition dvd released . ) dvd releases their most recent animated features . i wholeheartedly recommend this dvd fans film	1

" apartment " directed billy wilder ( some like it hot , double indemnity , sunset boulevard , list goes ) starring jack lemmon , who previously collaborated wilder some like it hot , great film considered many others great film . it american film institute top 100 ( #93 ) roger ebert great movies . i never seen billy wilder film until four or five months ago . after watching film , i'm not sure i like it more than three films mentioned above , but it smart comedic semi-love story features two great performances lemmon shirley maclaine , well others . films idea truly original : lemmon plays c.c. baxter , commonly called bud . he works insurance business ( big surprise wilder film ) trying get promotion unorthodox way . he loans out his apartments executives company , so they carry out affairs women . beginning film , one executives leaves girlfriend , we get one funniest lines film ( i regret say i'm paraphrasing ): man : why all you dames live bronx ? woman : you mean you bring other dames up here ? man : certainly not ! i'm happily married man . funny bit , we learn doctor who lives next bud ( dr. dreyfuss played jack kruschen ) under impression bud sex-machine , one point , asks bud if he'll sell his body science . love angle film fits miss kubelik ( maclaine ) , one women who runs elevator bud building . after getting his promotion ( his boss mr. sheldrake [ played double indemnity , fred macmurray ] asks key his apartment first ) , he finally asks miss kubelik out . she tells him she date , but meet him theatre . this date happens mr. sheldrake , whom she love despite fact he married , frequently tells her he'll leave his wife , never . anyway ; moving away plot , film shot black white point when wilder could easily used color . researching film bit , i discovered he uses black white make colorful events around bud seem dull unammusing . realizing i called this love-story beginning review , i add love story merely facade . it plays like love story , but i think final scene ( final line ) make it clear it really not . i think final line some like it hot ( if you haven't seen some like it hot , don't find out what line advance ) best curtain line ever . before seeing film , i didn't know what line . before seeing this film , i know what final line . me , it didn't sound impressive . after watching film , when you view line context , it really good . wilder knack ending his movies kind note he oh so perfectly . i said , earlier ... this isn't my favorite movie wilder cannon , but it wonderful film combining just right amount comedy drama way only wilder could it . grade : a-	1

i'll say it again : this one greatest adventure/romance epics ever made -- i don't use those terms lightly . harry faversham ( john clements ) , whose family wore its military tradition its badge honor , resigns his commission when his regiment sent egypt help win back sudan under kitchener . his three best friends , who fellow officers , his fiance , ethne burroughs ( june duprez ) , give him white feathers mark cowardice . he determined prove them wrong , goes sudan his own , redeems himself rousing adventures . particularly good ralph richardson captain john durrance , one three friends , who silently love ethne burroughs . blinded sunstroke left dead after attack his detachment part mahdi army , durrance rescued native peasant whom he cannot see who not speak . peasant , course , harry faversham . later england , he faces terrible dilemma only one honorable choice . richardson brings so much skill part durrance , whether brisk optimistic epitome upper-class officer or man love doing right thing , he almost steals movie . sweeping photography nile egypt first-rate , battle scenes big wide . romance understated noble . there some sly , good-natured humor aimed kordas british traditions . movie more than 65 years old fresh exciting it when it first came out . it filmed technicolor ; colors rich vibrant . it features great score miklos rozsa . this one those excellent movies make you wonder why anyone would attempt remake . incidentally , june duprez starred next year great adventure , thief bagdad . it worth purchasing four feathers	1

demetrius gladiators very good movie , classic sense term . many people his time adored victor mature , while critics sometimes claimed he melodramatic , but mature impressively right majority films which he cast . studio system smart way . this case , mature brings drama life almost single-handedly , certainly carries off this cast-of-thousands sequel robe beautifully . mature well suited 50s sword-and-sandal trend , i'd say this film , demille equally good samson delilah , among his best performances period . this film respectable interesting sequel robe , unequivocally worth seeing . what more , i can't agree jay robinson " over top " -- he just fascinating villain he robe , we're lucky more him role this movie . considering robinson became , all accounts , mentally obsessed his character roman emperor these two films rest his life , i'd say this movie even more fascinating regard . robinson one those actors who proves old saying it only takes one stand-out performance secure actor place history forever . robinson performance easily best roman emperor ever committed celluloid up until now , i claudius notwithstanding . short , don't sell this movie short , or you'll worse it . movie tone certainly different robe , but it genuinely satisfying hollywood entertainment fairly high order . budget generous , cast excellent , movie looks very good all most important aspects result . feel free bring popcorn , i'd recommend kleenex well .	1

nos amours movie once seen , never forgotten . it dredges up gut-churning mix jealousy , impotence , fear aging leave you feeling empty afraid sound your girlfriend slamming door behind her last time . not anything so dramatic happened me . pialat always compared cassavetes , probably because each them pose , literally cassavetes ' case , prospero figures whose idea directing " let it happen , " conjure elements , without imposing their . this supposed humble self-effacing approach yet films both men secretly clamor more better than other films , very often . films cassavetes , however , became increasingly florid expressionistic ( more interesting ) deeper he tried get bare-bones truth . pialat i think more consistent this pretense objectivity -- his films all acute probing psychological level minnie moskowitz except much less sunny . i've seen nos amours described all over internet his " best film " people who apparently taking faith since they haven't seen anything else him , usually going then state he minor talent . correct them : there nothing minor pialat , nos amours his most immediately striking film , but not his best . there no best when you're dealing artist pialat caliber . story young girl named suzanne self-immolating journey into sex much more hysterical overacting than any other pialat feature gives impression raw intensity his other films belie . this why most americans would probably consider it his best but what i missed pialat usual tactic making film revolve entirely around banal conversations , digressive plotlines unrelated , out-of-nowhere scenes all seem dance around unspeakable void -- just seems loom larger larger more people try avoid it . think gerard depardieu le garcu , taunting his wife new husband eating his jam toast every day 3:00 dot , seeming good-natured , but inwardly feeling like obsolete sex toy relegated garage . or jean yanne visits his aged , doddering father autobiographical we won't grow old together , which seem retrospectively taunt futility stormy arguments yanne marl�ne jobert . drama pialat movies always tempered knowledge one day none this matter . this strategy missing relatively straightforward nos amours , or it even more cleverly hidden ? i wonder . what i noticed while watching this dvd , i missed first viewing , family pressures interpersonal wounds inflicted suzanne painful but almost irrelevant , sort psychological macguffin . ( pialat would say psychology itself one big macguffin -- there only love no-love , faith no-faith . ) one character who gets little attention , just couple fleeting scenes , suzanne first boyfriend luc , but he key tragedy . suzanne cheats him once pointlessly , if sleepwalking , american soldier , luc rejects her . it may not seem matter . but then there scene where suzanne talking luc one her friends , friend asks " he handsome ? " " ohhh , oui ! " suzanne says , her face lighting up only time movie , before quickly dissolving into her trademark fixed sneer . this kind sock-in-the-gut moment endlessly forgiving gentle -- where others would just see tramp , pialat sees terrible innocence . next time you go adult website remember many girls there once just like suzanne , many them carrying image luc around them they walk through fire . kicker even if suzanne family caring wise , she would same thing , slept just many guys , because , though too naive understand anything like christian concept , she rejected perfect love now unconsciously flagellating herself , trying crucify herself through sex . this where movie gets fascinating -- all screaming shouting suzanne family just noise meant distract . pain resides somewhere much deeper , somewhere farther back , each them suffering its incommunicability ( how could suzanne father understand sights smells , specific nostalgia , her experience luc ? how suzanne understand what her father experienced his youth ? yet they same experience . ) scorching power movie comes pialat going deep far back possible , back bite apple , back wound side , facing truth most people spend their lives denying -- first love only love , then you're dead . world dead . far leaving no recourse action , this understanding where real action , real love -- basis pialat films , " amour " opposed " nos amours " -- begin .	1

i am jane austen fan . i love pride prejudice there three very good marvelous adaptations great novel . however , mansfield park jane austen most complex serious novel , whole it my favorite . fanny price most difficult jane austen heroines , not wittiest or most beautiful , but one who knows difference right wrong . she mentored her uncle , righteous honorable [ i don't use terms loosely ] sir thomas bertram . somehow , adaptation this great novel twisted sir thomas into sadistic , sexual pervert . moreover , fanny constantly babbling us jane austen quips not part this novel . they simply missed point book . acting okay . settings okay . directing sad . but sense disappointment betrayal perverting essential theme book left very sour taste	-1

movie more famous style than substance , though it set movie world its head . third-rate hood paris ( jean-paul belmondo ) , who thinks he bogart , steals car , then kills policeman who pulls him over . now lam he goes his girlfriend ( jean seberg ) asks her hide him until he collect some money owed him previous job ; after he tells her they go rome . but seberg empty , soul-less , finally ruthless he , end she turns him police . but it way goddard relates story everyone ga-ga over this movie masterpiece : he presented new ways viewing his material - fast-cutting , imaginative camera angles , total breakdown time space , no transitions . his idea give impression " living moment . " there some memorable scenes , especially bedroom scene belmondo seberg discussing art philosophy final shot seberg , but times it very hard relate these two conscienceless , amoral characters ; i know it all alienation impetuosity , but whew ! location photography streets paris superb set precedent new wave filmmaking . excellent too musical score ( part jazz , part classical ) . it extremely influential movie , groundbreaking revolutionary , though some it most creative techniques ( jump-cutting , example ) become second nature today	1
while most films fall under giallo banner far more style than substance , this one rises far above all . among dario argento finest works , it eerie psychological thriller which part hitchcock , part raymond chandler novel , part cinecitta . story believable captivating , suspense chilling , acting superb . course there great music , ennio morricone helm sounds , course there all kinds good-looking people , cool cars , stylish set pieces , just you'd expect italian film 1970 . but this film those extras minor attractions , film itself what keeps you watching	1

me , heathcliff one most complex compelling characters ever written i once thought any actor would fall short playing him film or miniseries . watched this beautiful haunting adaptation one my favorite novels all time , i say ralph fiennes more than succeeded bringing aforementioned anti-hero life . emily bronte would proud . everyone who read wuthering heights knows tragic love story cathy heathcliff how he becomes dark , brooding , manipulative , diabolical man who takes his revenge people who he feels wronged him torn him away cathy , including her daughter his own child ward . fiennes brings out heathcliff many conflicting emotions flawlessly his performance floored me . juliette binoche cathy linton/catherine earnshaw great well . supporting cast quite splendid too -- no cardboard cutout performances here ! backdrop moors beautiful gothic , just like bronte described them her book . i am very impressed this adaptation . i haven't seen 1939 film adaptation or miniseries masterpiece theater yet , but i wonder if they come close this wonderful film . bbc produce adaptation some time next year i think richard armitage ( north south ) would make wonderful heathcliff because he too could bring many nuances his acting . meantime , i shall treasure this one watch it over over again	1
i've always loved this movie , now i own it dvd , i able watch it time again bring back great memories	1

my view garbo greatest film , her most personal . among my other favorites camille ninotchka , but queen christina her stand-out classic above all others . i read garbo personally exicted involved this production extent unparalled her , motivated swedish ( her homeland ) history opportunity play one history most enigmatic figures , queen who " abdicated her throne love " ( though this portrayal , course , largely " hollywoodized " -- you probably throw most expectations historical accuracy out window , just set back behold ) . here every aspect legendary garbo one film : breathtakingly beautiful woman , amibiguous sexuality , great tragienne , aloofness , boyish playfulness , restless longing escape any enforced tableaux or expectations others live her own life her own terms , all things she common queen christina . here also her warm , memorable final pairing her former real-life amor frequent co-star john gilbert . two legendary scenes stand out : garbo walking , if daze , memorizing inn room which she gilbert just spent night ( scene almost lost due censors ) , course final , unforgettable closeup , greatest closeup history cinema -- simply stunning , heartbreaking farewell dying gilbert moments before . not missed scenes also garbo running out castle into bitter cold , rubbing snow her face like child , warm relationship her elderly attendant , . aubrey smith , who dotes her like daughter , combing her hair , tending her every need tender love protectiveness . -- one overlooked subtexts film parentless christina relationships two major father figures , lewis milestone ( frequent co-star ) palace official , who vehemently protests christina decision step down throne , personal attendant , . aubrey smith , his benevolent , mark twain face , caring christina motherly fashion , wanting only her happiness , wherever takes her .... life garbo indeed appeared reclusive aloof , though i suspect she simply very shy person who perhaps never fully comprehended what it we all wanted her . but here , queen christina , actress woman merge . garbo opened up us way she never before would never again , fully showing us both her great strength acute vulnerability , result spellbinding , treasure forever , garbo gift us all , we all beneficiaries .	1

fran�ois truffaut first film english language still stands up well , my opinion . it very fine adaptation ray bradbury book . i wonder what it says us today ? possibly quite lot . world which story takes place look , superficially , inviting . maybe this what it means living police state ? guy montag , played great style oskar werner , cool character ( forget moronic american meaning word " cool " here ) , he isn't passionate lives rather passionless life . millie montag , his wife , played julie christie , who also plays role clarice . film powerful because it rarely overstates its case keeps violence minimum . film " futuristic " mid-sixties , when it made , it decidedly ' 60s look it now . however , it present us people who forgotten books get their kicks very large -interactive tv screens - not would ever happen , would it !	1

its core , this film what happens when person defies system , any system . it true story frances farmer , beautiful , smart , rebellious movie star `30s who seemed it all . because her many advantages system took while catching up her ; maybe that where fury vengeance originated . payback required more than pound flesh , system wanted her spirit , her intellect , her soul . portrayal psychiatry practiced those days unlike anything you see anywhere else , it makes cuckoo nest look like vacation tuscany . indeed , psychiatry this film less healing force than means preserving social order conformity . jessica lange deserved oscar this role , she didn't get it crime . this solo masterpiece performance easily par streep sophie choice . lange beauty , intelligence , sophistication , edge play this complicated woman , she throws herself into part fearlessly . saucy starlet oozing coy charm , radical intellectual hanging lefties nyc , belligerent scrapper knocking heads studio moguls , star-crossed lover inviting disaster betrayal way others invite friends over dinner , self-destructive victim descending into darkness booze pills , adult infant manipulated fiercely controlling mother , psychiatric patient - abused sport disassembled ; lange shifts through facets like she driving porsche country road , you never notice her changing gears , every minute ride thrilling . best thing this film , apart lange , shows , it doesn't tell . viewer left interpret without heavy-handed moralizing . truth frances farmer life so fascinating bizarre simply bringing it screen more than enough . few us experience involuntarily committed mental hospital - much less lobotomized - but all us tried thwart system one point or paid it . every viewer applaud farmer irreverence idealism , even when it naive , feel sorrow when she must confront cruel consequences . this dark movie , not all hollywood lives happy endings , but it true movie . frances takes you places you never gone barely imagine ; jessica lange delivers performance lifetime - not just her lifetime , anybody lifetime	1

kieslowski never took easy way out . each hour-long film intricately plotted , beautifully filmed loosely examines spirit ten commandments . but filmmaker never beats these moral themes our heads . kieslowski once said interview he always turns camera back himself , but never obvious way , i think this effect achieved here . forget polish moment . turn down sound you would still able identify this kieslowski film . they could authored no other . my favorite underrated tenth installment coveting your neighbor goods . one level , this film riotous comedy , paring co-stars white together two brothers who lose their father , but discover his stamp collection . . . only lose it(and kidney boot ) poland stamp mafia . but level , it profoundly moving film well . stamps tenuous connection their father(who they obviously never understood)and one . losing their father collection , they start one anew booze it up , enjoying one company . . . honoring their father memory . . . fulfilling one those universal commandments .	1

men certain age remember how , when we kids this played tv early 80s , we thought it so cool when huge army police officers fired so many shots into house it eventually collapsed , when bus shot full holes even larger army cops . but those two over-the-top scenes all this movie going it . other action scenes pretty silly unbelievable , especially scenes involving sniper helicopter , atop parking structure , both whom " can't miss " positions missed anyway . moreover , if you know anything law plot beyond silly . it involves eastwood sent phoenix las vegas escort witness extradited back arizona trial . witness testify bad behavior part phoenix police commissioner , corrupt assistant district attorney involved commissioner coverup . assuming material witness extradited , which i doubt , crime appears committed vegas , so it would tried vegas , not phoenix . if ada prosecuting case corrupt wanted cover commissioner , he could just dismiss case , there would no need murder witness . idea they would want draw attention case 200 cops line up try assassinate witness beyond ridiculous . sum , plot action both absurd , only interesting scenes crazy firepower overkill house bus . but those two scenes probably can't carry entire movie average viewer .	-1
this movie part canadian soap opera part effective slasher movie . plot ripoff prowler , or vice versa ( either way , prowler much better movie , go see instead ) . it deals vengeful wraith promising spree if valentine party ever held after tragic holiday party-to-blame accident coal mine left one survivor resort cannibalism unemployment . coarse you know them crazy kids go party anyways . basically , anything killer miner or mine itself great , but everything else just plain tacky . john stanley creature features guide gave it 4 stars ... i've decided anything he says good automatically bad . i can't believe band actually decided ripoff this particular piece pop culture sell records . its not because they drugs but because they imagination-less state not doing drugs	-1

this very well made film . director excellent . only complaint i ending . relationship two leading characters isn't clarified enough . young woman sincere her affection her older man ? yes . no . yes . definitely not , she just playing him what she get , love younger man . no wait , yes she loves him . wait , hold , why she walking away ? older man annoying , odd hero we don't want him get what he wants , we want him fail , because he rich , stuck up , without redeeming social value . young girl tells him he knows nothing women . it seems what she really wants dominated smacked . but no , maybe that not what she wants . well , yes , it seems what she wants . interspersed all this comic ambiguity , we treated random acts terrorism . blooey ! rich pig dead . when it our hero turn dead rich pig ? end movie , maybe ? he sure made uncomfortable reports terrorism . it seems terrorism natural reaction , mobilized lower class , entrenched despicable upper class . this film very french . it enough quality its manufacture get five stars , but it fizzles away very end , leaving me wondering just what hell happening our loving couple relationship before it time bring down curtain them . smack me , won't you ? i've given you every reason . oww . good , now i know you love me	1

okay , if you don't like this movie then my opinion your not horror movie fan . anyone who grew up 1980 knows loves jason voorhees ! only reason you wouldn't fan because your one those stuck up , horror movie snobs who only likes movies such halloween other over rated played out slasher flicks . jason goes hell - final friday ( only it wasn't last ) one more creative friday 13th movies ever made ! sure there might some rather small plot holes here or there but thats no big deal . considering series gone this far , i think it amazing director pulled off something so creative ! instead jason run through woods entire film , chopping up teenagers who bearly act , director decided go different direction . movie starts typical friday 13th scene , attractive woman all herself camp crystal lake . she walks one cabins then eventually decides take shower . pretty stypical stuff usual slasher movie bimbo . soon enough however , we ( fans ) discover she member government s.w.a.t team , sent destroy jason voorhees . jason killer tons people , i'm actually quite shocked government ( or whoever handles there situations ) hadn't stepped sooner ! anyways , they find jason unleash everything they got him . after shooting him bunch bullets finally blowing his body bloody chunks , everyone thinks jason finally dead . what they don't know they're dead wrong ! ( sorry silly pun ) here where i think jason goes hell well . director explains how jason able come back all those times , through all those sequals . it actually idea i myself early days 80 sequals . jason heart takes shape form some creature hell . whenever host body ( whoever jason happens using time ) becomes too nasty it use anymore , it basically uses host . otherwords , it simple body snatchers plot . rest movie we watch helpless victems fall prey jason demon heart , taking over their bodies . soon we discover plot detail helps movie but us friday 13th fans , know it plot hole . no big deal considering it dosn't hurt anything long run actually helps story movie better . jason sister ( if you remember first friday 13th , jason mother said she only one child ) order become reborn again , he needs take over her body . you tell , jason goes hell alot more plot details creative story twists than most other ones series . i won't go into anymore detials movie , you just sit back watch blood fly ! ending also treat us horror fans too ! something any respected friday 13th fan waited see many years eventually blessed it later down road . i won't spoil anything if you haven't seen movie , you'll just watch it . over all , jason goes hell - final friday wonderful addition anyones friday 13th series gore hounds should enjoy much here ! it fun movie gives fans what they want see . more plot , more story , more gore ( get unrated version ) more jason ! anyone who thinks they're " above " this movie terms horror fan , get lost ! you don't belong here ! obviously slasher scene isn't you .	1

if you find " greatest story ever told " believable , where jesus speaks rich baratone people , not people ; if you think yeshua always frowning or serious ; if you trouble thinking son man dumping bucket cold water over peter head laughter , then you might not like how this move portrays our christ . looking some reviews here i'm surprised people can't see jesus smiling . if it true he man , then he must some fun besides just healing sick . it written he not characteristics drew people him ( he wasn't glamourous , wasn't flashy , probably didn't even " look you want know better " ) , scriptures seem point us someone who pretty ordinary appearance , but who performed extraordinary acts kindness dregs society . remember , he not call rightous , but sinners . speaking seasoned sinner myself , i wouldn't listen barratone who spoke me , not me . i wouldn't believe he could much capacity compassion if he just " purdy boy " . i wouldn't take him seriously if he never smiled . whereas one reviewer said he found gospel john more realistic , i found version far less realistic because he too glamourous , too suave , besides , he perm . my vote gospel according matthew . i watched this move well over two dozen times i'm still learning it . it also amazing me how producers could make book seem coheriant without interjecting single additional word not niv	1

according long , interesting interview writer , jean-claude carriere , assistant director , jean lary , which came my disc ( studio canal : reg 2 ) , all masochistic footage this film extremely thoroughly researched before its release 1967 . these all " real " fantasies recounted real women . those parts film which superficially presented real , therefore , ie idea doctor wife would actually spend her afternoons humiliated maison de joie , fantastic ; fantasy sequences actually " real " . disorienting , isn't it ? first question if these female fantasies dominated brutal men repeated today , 40 years later . seems unlikely . next question if anything story real . isn't whole thing completely surreal ? nothing what unfolds need actually happened all , including bit husband shot sitting paralysed wheelchair : it all his wife dream . why husband shown staring empty wheelchair street one scene ? wife may even fantasised molested little girl , also fantasises her husband helplessly passive baby , who needs looked after --- since she hasn't child her own . idle bourgeois wife --- one bunuel typical targets --- nothing else occupy her mind during day . film promoted " erotic " . sells tickets . it didn't seem erotic me slightest , fact it all very cold intellectual puzzle . whole scenario highly unemotional artificial : elegant home couple , their smart clothes , tidy , domestic brothel , stereotypical customers , stereotypical gangsters their pulp fiction dialogue behaviour . photography seemed flat , without depth , assistant director comments darkness shadows deliberately avoided . since i find puzzles fascinating , it very interesting entertaining watch . kubrick clumsy eyes wide shut seems inspired it , just his clumsy shining inspired last year marienbad . both these french films intellectually far superior anything produced hollywood these days .	1
like del toro " pan labyrinth " which made huge waves non-hollywood world , " devil backbone " not easily categorised . ghost story ? yes , but much more . picture scary tensions spain early days civil war ? yes , but more . wonderful tale how group children mature amid disaster tragedy come almost their own family , replace ones they never or separated ? yes , but more . rich symbols allegory ... yes , but ... richness what . . eliot called " objective correlative " gives one sense underlying depth . instance , there huge unexploded bomb stuck middle school courtyard . what it but metaphor hidden ghastly secret waits explode reveal reason mysterious ghost boy santi ? we only find out santi story near end . then there devil backbone itself - reality congenital deformity where spine exposed , but spooky-looking sample floating jar preservative - doesn't jacinto exactly match name ? irredeemable core evil , like shakespeare villain or captain pan labyrinth . del toro doesn't want claim there something good everyone : he says no , some characters just irreversibly turned dark side , very backbone evil . then there subtle end-to end connections add more richness . early scene school classroom , children shown picture mammoth teacher makes point these days creatures so big strong hunters could only succeed working closely together group . end , children - survived - exactly they hunt gunman , pointed wooden spears yet ! i don't really agree reviewers who see strong parallel " lord flies . " children here ( wonderfully acted , way ) don't regress primitive kind anarchical ritual-filled state : fact they bond ever more closely deal very directly real world around them . one thought : seen this , i now don't think any more pan labyrinth we absolutely , definitely meant take ofelia fantasy scenes all her mind . clearly del toro doesn't mind creating " real " supernatural entities . perhaps " pan " he just wants leave us state permanent uncertainty , though majority view among reviewers it literally just fantasy .	1

now i saw some reviews site some bad some go way far into plot . now adult i'm going rate this . pokemon first all show follows ash ketchum aboy who begins adventure catch train pokemon-creatures inhabit his world . it pretty much childrens show but movie really strong theme . it begins scientist funded giovonni , corupt mad man charge lethal organization . now scientists recovered fossil said remains legendary pokemon mew , also first one existence . cloning process successful but mewtwo soon discovered humans care nothign him rebelled against his creators . once giovonni betrayed him mewtwo adamant destroy humanity thining humans all same . doing he brings forth greatest trainers planet clones their pokemon . movie teaches greatest lesson learned- we all different but if you look past differences focus what we common then perhaps we so much more . good lesson hidden inside chaoticly famous series	1
this big dumb action thriller , i mean best possible way . sure , it not die hard ... however i don't think it fair compare every bruce willis movie one greatest action movies ever made . it more than it fair share excitement plot enough twists turns keep me occupied . opening car chase top notch . there quite few excellent character actors who turn great performances here ... look tom sizemore , robert pastorelli , andre braugher , timothy busfield ( well his spindly little girl legs ) . it not going change world . it not going make you forget die hard . it fun thriller ... especially couple friends , some popcorn , few beers . worth rental !	1

unlike reviewer below who used this space espouse his political views whine fbi behavior real life , i'll talk actual movie . this good , fun movie very black white its storytelling . much like dragnet shows ilk , good guys good bad guys bad this . fact fbi isn't like real life doesn't make this bad movie . it designed puff piece fbi , so naturally it biased towards them . however , using hardesty family showcase changing fbi great storytelling device jimmy stewart really brings this life . it takes what could bland makes it interesting fun vehicle . we all know things aren't simple easy things portrayed this movie , but this enjoyable good guys versus bad guys escapist drama .	1
this retelling snow white seven dwarfs actually based script billy wilder wrote before immigrating united states germany , but it only after success disney version demand created it . enormously versatile howard hawks ( quite literally most versatile director film history , only director mastered and/or created five or six genres ) took script turned it into one last great pre-ww ii comedies . story simple : group monkish scholars living together new york city writing encyclopedia . one them writing slang , but unfamiliar contemporary argot begins research his topic talking people outside his normal range acquaintance . he runs into gangster moll sugarpuss o'shea , who takes advantage scholars move them order escape police , who want talk her implicate her guy joe lilac . while hardly snow white , she certainly managed stir up their lives . film made wonderful number things : wilder clever script , hawks typically deft direction , solid performance gary cooper , but most all scintillating job overwhelmingly alluring barbara stanwyck stellar collection veteran character actors playing seven dwarves . all latter great , but special mention made richard haydn ( who excells even beside others , his extraordinary overpronounciation everyday words ) , oskar homolka , s.z. sakall . there few more delightful collections character actors any hollywood comedy . i personally prefer barbara stanwyck any other actress hollywood history . she possessed emotional immediacy no other actress could approximate , while her skills perhaps tad below those someone like katherine hepburn , latter never managed match her fire passion . she so sexy ! i grew up watching stanwyck big valley , so when i first started seeing her great roles thirties , forties , fifties , i absolutely stunned how sexy she could . she attractive , yes , but sexier than she attractive . she never sexier than she here , exception her role same year lady eve . reason see this film appearance gene krupa early nightclub sequence . krupa , course , benny goodman throughout thirties , so this very early his career leader his own band .	1
i'm sorry , i love gina gershon i looking forward watching this movie since i like action films . but this such run mill martial arts flick . i wasn't even intrigued watch whole thing without hitting fast forward button through most show . basis this movie - main character expert martial artist who comes town just rising aryan militia becomes prominent nearby . it starts them killing black preacher everyone loves who promotes people stop hate , white boys militia don't like . * gasp , i never would guessed*main character kicks everyone behind , gets girl , acting horrible plot could pasted any flick action film . your time could better spent watching paint dry . or if you're desperate something like this then watch universal soldier , least it funny	-1

before her death 2003 age 101 , filmmaker leni riefenstahl would you believe she no affiliation nazi party when she asked adolf hitler document momentous four days leading 1934 nuremberg rally . however , it obvious her concurrently celebrated reviled 1935 propaganda film she mesmerized hitler oratorical skills judging dynamic way she captured his undeniable charisma . she shows remarkable deftness editing techniques camera movement placement remains gold standard among documentarians . riefenstahl succeeds making hitler larger than life figure masses without resorting editorial commentary validate what obvious images . film begins hitler arrival nuremberg personal aircraft where he greeted enthusiastic throngs nazi supporters . fact , first third film focuses primarily civilian support fuehrer then transitions opening reich party congress where we see familiar historical figures , such rudolf hess joseph goebbels , speak . this leads third day activity rather unsettling shots hitler youth they prepare greet hitler rows teepees which they camped . her discriminating use close-ups most striking here when we see tow-headed aryan boys hypnotized hitler speech . film ends startlingly choreographed rally famous shot hitler , flanked heinrich himmler viktor lutze , walking down emptied aisle place wreath wwi memorial ( shot replicated george lucas end first " star wars " ) . climax designed celebratory hitler leads masses toward unity under reich his fanatical delivery . like d.w. griffiths ' " birth nation " , it difficult defend intended messaging behind such trenchant film , yet it criminal not recognize powerfully cinematic sense which riefenstahl imbues her work . 2001 synapse dvd contains good though not outstanding print transfer . however , there two worthwhile extras - extremely informative commentary track historian dr. anthony . santoro ( which i recommend you switch immediately fully appreciate individual personalities historical details behind rally ) short riefenstahl made following year rally celebrate wehrmacht ( german army ) , " day freedom " . there little use attempting any sort objectivity this film it intended evoke strong emotions sole goal solidifying reich country still feeling weakened wwi . this respect , riefenstahl succeeds admirably	1
i've always fan this film , though it wasn't until recently i got see it all way through end . 2d , " creature ... " good , but only . since this film intended seen true 3d form , doesn't mean crappy redblue anaglyph glasses version , really best way see it . gladly , field sequential 3d edition available two web sites it fantastic . stereo depth really makes movie better than ever . plus , all dimensional sight gags work instead just making you wonder why they filmed way . able experience stereo depth beautiful underwater photography , even black white , leaves you wanting more end . i highly recommend " creature black lagoon " , but only 3d using shutter glasses system found " ultimate 3d collection " amazon.com ( buy it cheap usednew seller )	1
i never saw this film theater , so i can't completely sure this how it supposed look . but , assuming dvd transfer accurate , i find all praise kore-eda " painterly " visuals completely undeserved . film shot entirely natural light ; so , daytime indoor scenes , glare windows doorways blots out or silhouettes everything ; nightime indoor scenes , everything murky underexposed . it all looks horribly amateurish . outdooor scenes come off somewhat better , but slightly grainy overall , almost if they shot digital camera . cinematography ( possible bad transfer ) aside , there also matter kore-eda excessively static direction . i appreciate still , quiet camera work ozu or jarmusch , but kore-eda takes this style pushes it ridiculous lengths . his camera never moves , not even occasional cut or panning or tracking shot . it just sits there , dull inert , while scenes drag then abruptly end , almost arbitrarily . i guess this technique supposed impart contemplative effect scene , but again , it just seems amateurish . performance fashion-model-turned-actress makiko esumi , grieving young widow yumiko , reflects director numb , soporific visual style . instead quietly torn grief , she comes across merely affectless . maybe director wanted use zombie-like non-actress comatose camera work convey numbness grief , but result far edifying or moving or even interesting . ultimate effect this movie only stupefying boredom .	-1
i seen many historical war dramas far east ( mainly china ) most them not only historically inaccurate but strong bias toward enemy . yi soon shin , however , rare exception . not only drama very historically accurate but it also very comprehensive detailing meticulous battle planning admiral leads each victory but also political in-fighting chosun political factions ( second-guessing nature king ) which causes his eventual death . also , special effects great . battle scenes ( whether sea or land ) realisitic outstanding quality . only problem i find dvd not placed sufficient focus contribution ming china . then again , this not unexpected since this korean drama focusing great admiral . also , entire selection should 104 episodes . i don't know why it stops 101 . if you want more comprehensive knowledge subject , try samuel hawley imjin war ( which portrays yi soon shin more accurately quoting original sources ) . any who only intered fighting may also want check out stephen turnbull samurai invasion ( which more colorful maps detailed description battles japanese perspective ) . lastly , anyone who fan samurai warfare may want check out shogun : total war creative assembly ( now gold version ) .	1
very interesting movie dian fossey , dedicated conservationist dedicated her life preserving mountain gorillas . she bit crazy - no doubt it , but very dedicated . movie takes place congo , then moves rwanda when fossey kicked out congo . other sources , movie not all accurate , but what movie ? it gets main points right , it makes compelling movie . downsides my point view 1 . romance , which , since this hollywood , way overdone , 2 . incessant coughing dian fossey - so she smoked ? she didn't die lung cancer - why we listen her cough whole movie - why get one fact so accurate when they distort so many other aspects movie ? 3 . why she so dedicated these gorillas ? she gets little crazy some points . overall good movie worth watch - scenery africa really great	1

legend suriyothai most expensive movie ever made thailand , production funded royalty itself . visually , suriyothai must most enthralling film i've ever seen . dead-on awesome costumes , superb cinematography sets ( which filmed real historical sites ) just tremendous , worthy academy awards . scale so huge , movie needs viewed least twice . however , suriyothai flawed many reasons . first , original version actually 4 hours long (!) , scaled down just 2 1/2 , understandably suite western audiences . i've seen original version thailand must say though it drag , it much better more depth version released west . however , this skeletal version consequence scaled down , so fact , half movie missing other words . pretty unfair , my opinion . secondly , i would expected more well-choreographed fight scenes . say least , collosal battles pretty clumsy ill-directed . so , don't expect much braveheart-style combat . movie such extravaganza deserves more than just uninspired battle scenes . basically , initial flaw would come result movie scaled down . characters appear dissapear . most main characters paperthin development we sometimes forget who who times . i watch movie three times understand movie entirely . nonetheless , if you patience interest seeing into history nation far away , this definate movie check out . i would advise watching movie first before you buy it , since suriyothai definately quot ; like-itquot ; or quot ; hate-itquot ; camp . i personally love this movie , since i see it potential seen original version . story epic proportions if understood correctly , i would even say it one best . better than hollywood far .	1
story wonderful other reviewers attest . its shame audio video quality subpar american standards . much also lost cutting film fullscreen ( 4:3 ratio ) . older chinese films don't seem get same quality or quantity releases newer ones . techinical purists may gag , but this may only chance own this great film , even if it its lesser glory	1
i saw this movie without really knowing what it completely suprised how good it . diane lane , who not only beautiful , but talented , plays yuppie housewife who given gun her husband . after she gets her neighbor involved , james legros , they embark series strange , mysterious events . this movie won best picture sundance film festival 1992 , worth renting , but don't buy unless it under $20 . diane lane truly underated hollywood quot ; my new gunquot ; proves why	1

richard lester refreshingly breezy adaptation dumas classic one best interpretations this venerable classic . he combines elements swashbuckling swordplay satirical buffooneries pink panther movies . michael york , scrawny yet efficient , plays d'artagnan youthful exuberance . raquel welch hilarious bumbling , accident prone constance , spike milligan likewise hoot her aging lustful husband . musketeers played oliver reed , frank finlay richard chamberlain , dashingly heroic , if little out shape ? faye dunaway cold calculating lady dewinter while geraldine chaplin quite coquettish queen . rounding out marvelous cast charlton heston , christopher lee , simon ward jean pierre cassel . lester filmed this its sequel ( four musketeers ) same time , but studio opted go sequel whole movie would too long . they both fine films , although follow up little darker tone . well worth viewing good time	1
this film caused me nightmares when i child ( after it run television ) . i never forgotten seeing this movie -- nor i forgotten sleeping lights week -- even though i am now 50 years old . several internet movie database websites list this film quot ; suitable children . quot ; i don't think so ; unless scaring crap out your children your goal	1

i read lord flies high school intrigued its unusual content . i , course , dissect book expose its ' symbolism , ' but unlike many works poetry literature , i agreed this one actually made statement . when remake came out i anxious see how filmmakers would interpret disturbing island living young boys . film stuck book surprisingly accurate manner . before watching film , read book . it improves entertainment value movie makes everything make more sense . i not disappointed film seen it more than once	1
little heavy unfortunate accidents main character , but still great comedy	1
i first saw this film when i 21 . its simplistic symbolism left me cold . i saw it again , 10 years later . it simplistic symbolism made me weep . i knew why . yes , la strada movie very mundane premise ( life ) which reduces man/woman relationship its most base . men , their most primal , selfish brutes . woman , left unnutured , masochistic twits . fellini offers stark staggering perspective humanity which forces us relate characters whom we see appaulling pathetic , yet uncomfortably close all us , left same options . ending obvious , but it says it all . btw : woody allen made regrettable remake la strada entitled " sweet lowdown " , no credit given original ( far i know . )	1

i read lot military fiction , ranging " it all glory " stuff people who've never heard shot fired anger but wish they , " it all hell " stuff people who've never heard shot fired anger but trying send message . somewhere middle , bit both aspects lot experience , relatively few novels written guys who've there , writing experience situations closely paralleled what they went through - bit hell , bit glory , lot detail . cruel sea sits near top latter category . nicholas monsarrat journalist who commissioned into navy start world war 2 spent his war small ships , fighting german submarines battle atlantic . main character cruel sea , keith lockhart , journalist who commissioned into navy start world war 2 ... it first-rate book . even without monsarrat biography , it obvious he knows what he talking ; it shows details . most military fiction certain amount scenes away front , dealing main characters ' personal lives ; cruel sea same , it excellently ... no means glamorously ( there one particular thread , lieutenant unfaithful wife , antithesis glamor ) , but very realistically ; scenes don't seem all tacked " give fighting men human side " , but feel like - - integral part book . characters same people london bar or middle atlantic ; you get feeling most people , most incidents , based real people situations monsarrat either knew or knew , during his time war . certain , very small , percentage military fiction transcends " military " label - fiction people , military situation . combat isn't focus story ; it simply part it . life sea character development take precedence over fast-moving plots ; there , realistically , no individual bad guys ( how many soldiers or sailors know names men other side ? ) , but work executed well enough plot would feel irrelevant . i've read hundreds books military fiction . bare handful good this one . thoroughly absolutely recommended	1

i lived small village andalucia many years . i am very grateful i appreciate this film what it , visual love poem place , people passions region gatlif previous film latcho drom all roma culture . gatlif pays meticulous attention every detail how flamenco music its people infuse help define everyday spanish life this day . it begins remarkable homage flamenco muslim heritage featuring living flamenco legend , tomatito . although much lost translation subtitles , lovers simpler , truly family-centered life treasure poignant , visually satisfying vignettes modern spanish village life . entire family living together lovingly caring disabled family member . gathering pomegranates together . enormous paella outside cooking serve 50 family members christening . people greeting one they get bus ( this scene heartbreakingly delightful short dvd which takes place sun-parched , narrow city streets almeria gypsy neighborhood . ) . cemetery rituals . painted shutters lace curtains windows . family widows - harvesting olives , whitewashing graffiti off village walls , cleaning up after previous nights ' flamenco party . spontaneous outbursts clapping , singing dancing occur anywhere - street , under tree , bus . these all scenes still visible every day ; they not staged movie . melodrama this film no different polite , socially acceptable melodramas play out every day our own society ; reputations , families , relationships destroyed very refined , sanitary , occult manner . spanish , gypsies particular , no concern such posturing show what their heart all see , even if it darkest pangs human emotions . this comes unequaled , boundless complexity depth flamenco . i very fortunate study flamenco andalucian gypsy who grew up learned spain greatest flamenco artists , among them her most beloved dancer , carmen amaya . understand this film , flamenco , spain , one must abandon all attempts understand it allow duende - spirit flamenco - possess one senses one soul . flamenco not contrived enough worry itself theme , story line or impressing audience . it arises place deep within soul most us keep carefully guarded shut off . gatlif exposed it , once again , us experience i'm certain success enough him .	1
stunning " audioscape " pure flamenco . only reason this film not get 5th star me its over-acting simplistic plot . but maybe that not such bad thing . it would take focus away power music cinematography . you literaly pause movie any point , find perfect shots rich blends colors textures capture essence this film , not mention look like museum-exhibit-quality photos . but it both cinematography music made this film so stunning . best scene far old man woman team under tent open field , belting out complex soul-stirring notes simply voice guitar . true story this film its music . now , how soundtrack ???!!!	1

" la belle noiseuse " , directed jacques rivette , splendid albeit admittedly extremely long film manages make spectator understand possibilities dangers distinctive art . extremely good painter bare soul his subject , but not always good thing , specially if artist ruthless eye concentrates worse moral traits his model . when it time stop ? real artist betray himself his art not paint what he seeing ? problem edouard frenhofer ( michel piccoli ) faced , when he choose his art his wife . frenhofer , extremely famous artist , decided stop painting portrait called " la belle noiseuse " , because he knew his model , his wife liz ( jane birkin ) , would hate results . according liz , " he wanted paint me because he loved me . he stopped painting me because he loved me " . many years later , frenhofer gets chance finish his painting , thanks visit admirer , young painter named nicolas ( david bursztein ) . nicolas suggests his beautiful girlfriend , marianne ( emmanuelle b�art ) , could new nude model " la belle noiseuse " . frenhofer loves idea , liz . even marianne , mad first nicolas his suggestion , ends up embracing challenge . however , days go frenhofer marianne become immersed world their own , nicolas liz start feel restless , abandoned . they know new painting make difference , things never same them their loved ones . but they something ? it enough ? course , answers those questions don't really matter , you discover them soon enough if you watch this film . what important , then ? my opinion , director wants show us process creation through eyes artist his model , hard choices sometimes must sometimes made order create real work art . it worth it ? how much himself others should artist willing risk ? those , my point view , real questions " la belle noiseuse " makes you ask yourself . whole , i say i really liked this film , but i don't recommend it everybody . if you just looking engaging movie entertaing you make you laugh , " la belle noiseuse " not you . other hand , if you mood relatively little known jewel amaze disturb you , making you think , watch this dvd . belen alca	1

gremlins 2 should definately considered superior sequel . everything this movie top notch b-flicks usually not case . even critics who despised first gremlins gave this movie good reviews . so much creativity put into this film it surprises me spielburg didn't return project(joe dante return ) . everything character development , stage settings , music , overall story well thought out you tell actors enjoyed playing their parts good time set . gremlins 2 no means takes itself too seriously . first portion movie gives you impression it rushed though it doesn't end up way . four characters including gizmo return first gremlins gremlins themselves designed bit differently though it definately better . regarding my comment creativity this movie , you must see it yourself . this gremlins sequel ( superior sequel , mind you ) gets dvd treatment it deserves like terminator 2 terms bonus features ( okay , terminator 2 alot more but you get my point ) . each feature worth viewing there also some easter eggs a.k.a hidden features . first i hoped gremlins 3 but i don't see how it would rank up this one . even if you happened not care much first gremlins , you still should give gremlins 2 look . i honestly know someone who didn't care too much gremlins but told me they really enjoyed sequel	1

make no mistake ; " chato land " sprawling , unforgiving environment offers little water no reward . blistering , sprawling landscape rock sagebrush , however , but backdrop this story shows man his most ugly moments . charles bronson stars pardon chato , half apache indian who enjoying drink saloon when he antagonized arrogant sheriff . chato goes against sheriff wishes leave because his heritage , lets his actions speak themselves , leaving mouthy lawman dead floorboards . posse soon rounded up variety area men , many them farmers ranchers . they embark trip find chato avenge death town , well feed some their own continual hatred towards indians general . greed , hate perseverance battle logic , pride tolerance group soon start battling each other over what they think right wrong when it comes avenging death lawman . great western film 1971 , chato land offers solid stoic storyline wrought irony well themes loyalty revenge . charles bronson aside , superb supporting cast experienced well . victor french ( later " little house " " highway heaven " stardom ) graces screen one posse members , jack palance james whitmore tow , its well rounded cast never lacks quality acting despite somewhat linear storyline . palance plays part quincy whitmore , war veteran who understands , sometimes even respects apache actions more than most . his arch-nemesis jubal hooker ( played simon oakland ) who " fever " wanting see apache man hang , even if it costs them lives which could end up coming down last man . jubal excellently played oakland man who consumed his own destiny vengeance . loyalties loved lost , large part movie very emotional power prestige we experience dismay men they deal battles rage within their very own camp , minds . bronson portraying cunning , intelligent yes even ruthless apache warrior , chato land western filled buzzards drinking blood , dark side man , notion if you go battle someone their own back yard , you better think twice who best odds , regardless how many men you bring you . scenic landscape shots taken night well during scorching hot days excellent , sound quality this dvd my opinion very good if not perfect . if you want western gets dirty but portrays deep story within , see " chato land "	1

reform school girls over top woman prison cult classic fun fun fun watch . i watched this movie 100 times growing up mid 80 , it still pleases today . wendy o williams completely mesmerizing watch , although her acting pretty bad say least . still film manages entertain its completely unbelievable premise . i love this movie . pat ast wendy o williams make this movie what it , why sybil danning got dvd cover i'll never know ( she barely film ) . pat wendy ( both who since passed ) make great villains though , thoroughly enjoyable watch over over again . if you like low budget , entertaining prison films lots women , violence nudity , then you love reform school girls . soundtrack pretty awesome too , showcases . o . w real talent musician performer . check out dvd commentary ! it pretty funny entertaining listen !	1
i enjoyed my second viewing this movie ... it proves power robert duvall ... he play most parts if born them . anyone who fan williams faulkner should enjoy it .. but word warning .. it not those suffering depression	1
bruce willis would not first actor bag their own work . some people might take fact actor bags their own work very authoritative statement not bother seeing such film . if actor doesn't like their own film , why should anyone else bother ? but i think such need not always case , this movie one good example . artist always critical their own work , rightly so . but just because they see things they don't like their own work or something else film they , not mean others certainly see same things same reasons . after seeing trailer this movie dvd i , i came upon imdb post bob costas ' tv interview ( i've never seen it myself ) bruce willis saying he knew this movie crap when he making it , this experience made him decide choose projects based projects merits avoid hollywood tripe . this other reasons , i not bother pursue getting movie time . recently , i came across this movie wal-mart $5 discount bin bruce willis fan i grabbed it . after watching it , i find it easy say even though i don't care much movies involving serial killers , this decent enough flick would worth it i paid $10 instead . it could defined typical hollywood tripe , especially if you're actor who business years looking expand your horizons . but not all tripe truly tripe . bruce decent enough job going up against killer , movie not just tired boring numbers . it looks sounds good , good production values cinematography , fairly suspenseful entertaining . big picture it probably fairly typical this type movie , but if you want see bruce willis go through paces taking down serial killer routine , it decent interesting take it all without lot your face gore or anything . incidentally , i plenty others think hudson hawk rocks ! some people just don't get it i suppose	1
ok , i rounded up 4 stars . this really isn't bad , though . it idiom most american viewers won't familiar . major characters kuan yin , confucius , flock other gods , godlings , immortals , buddhas , figures myth , other well-known figures stereotypes chinese pantheon . there flying heroes , improbable weapons , acting least par dr. who series . other words , lots viewers see it alien , disconnected , amateurish , well filled overly convenient miracles . but it not western idiom , so parts it taken their own terms . it look low-budget film , so you won't see effects star wars scale . it bit cheesy over-the-top , which part appeal . fights bloodless , romance chaste , all but youngest kids understand characters . if you don't take it or yourself too seriously , there lot fun this one . //wiredweir	1

growing up " coal miner daughter " ky myself i assure you this spot-on accurate . mining ky small town often only means successfully support your family . my father worked union mine after " company man " but even union strikes frightening often violent so much stake . we often shipped off town safety while my dad would guard house . this mid 70 well . i admire accurate depiction people this documentary . i expected them depicted sterotypical uneducated southern rednecks what i saw wise , passionate well-spoken ( albeit southern drawl ! ) women amazing fearless . would love see followup what happened town people 30+ years later	1

uncle buck absolutely hilarious , no better actor then john candy play this role ! uncle buck slobby , unorganized , middle-aged man , asked his brother stay over his house , so he take care his 3 kids , while he his wife out town visiting her sick father . even though uncle buck seems like careless slob , we get see his paternal side we see how he actually really cares each these children . best scenes ones where he look after oldest child who rebellious teenage girl , also starring this film very young macaluay culkin gaby hoffman 2 younger children . this movie classic , i totally recommend it ! not mention it john hughes film .	1
i love this movie . this movie blue print all revenge horror movies we now . its slasher movie real characters . most slasher movies characters who over top whatever sterotype movie character , look like crew models lol . looks cast , i tell studio didnt tight cast call roles this movie . unlike most slasher movies , i didnt want whole cast die , even though sooner or later they would face their fate . even wendy pretty tame mean girl compared some other ***** newer slasher movies . they actually likeable kids , happened make one little mistake lol . ending sequence one best saddest i ever seen horror movie ever ( even inched passed " carrie " ) . main reason one songs " fade black " . listen words they actually follow story line . yes , soundtrack made this movie . every time you hear music it fits scene perfectly . i wonder what would happen if you dance number jamie your prom . lol i just wish it comes tv more . i just ordered dvd , i heard word remake this classic underway sometime coming up real soon .	1

i can't really say how much i love this movie . it obvious strength powerful moving performance jack nicholson . randy quaid also excellent . but script - lines reveal so much characters . writing strong enough novel , breadth expansive . i few favorite scenes , such bar scene restroom scene , but there one sticks my throat every time i see this film . various points picture , cheery march played soundtrack , obviously sarcastic counterpoint inglorious life enlisted man stuck unforgiving system . once three main characters go through their " lost weekend " young prisoner , they snowy portsmouth , only few precious hours before their charge must turned over brig . this time , nicholson character developed such fatherly attachment naive prisoner he grant him any last wish : even attempting burn frozen wood campground so three wieners . after they eat hot dogs , there slow panning shot pristine snow covered park , not soul sight . slow , mournful dirge plays soundtrack . it end line , fellas . party over it time face harsh realities . young charge gonna locked up eight years you two " mean [ ... ] " going right back into love it or hate it lifestyle where your freedoms few far . it slow pan , which ends shot jack nicholson sniffling bitter cold lamenting his hard-nosed partner , young man whose spirits he tried lift , get pummeled abused long chunk time . it fear any parent their sensitive child entering harshness world . if you patience , if you tell good acting bad i recommend this film you	1
pest just released regioun 4 . pest guy who scam artist who finds himself offered lot money german whacko ( jeffrey jones ) hunt him game . it filled comedy , whackyness over top humour , you could say it real life cartoon ways . john plays funny charactor named pestorio " pest " also mad tv aries spears plays his best friend bunch unknowns . overall movie some funny stuff it pretty underrated . i hope john didnt apologise it , he nothing apologise this film . bring return pest . ( part 2)the bonus features audio commentary ( zzzz ) badly biography read john producer . there also 5 minute featureete / behind scenes thing couple trailers . john actualy wrote opening song he singing it hillarious hear what he come up improv . it only cheapie , so it worth price . other wise rent it before dissmissing it , it highly underrated .	1

this film , faithful horn autobiography , beautifully photographed . last gasp tribute vanished america ( both frontier west * * liberalism ' 60 ) it virtually flawless . mcqueen , like wayne , started what essentially westerns except his medium tv . his movie career , like wayne , econmpassed action roles several genres . his macho image , like wayne , often overshawdowed his acting , , finally , like wayne shootist , mcqueen ended this stunning performance . farnsworth excellent coble , evans true character glendolene myrtle kimmel , who horn great champion , pickens pickens . billy green bush portrayal us marshall joe belle sufficiently slimey central characters this tragedy , producers not find it prudent use actual name deputy us marshall joe lefors ' who bragged rest his life he " slickered tom horn " his exploits . i'd say it must see .	1
lee marvin chuck bronson both top-flight actors , their presence this movie only makes excellent ' chase ' plot much better . this one watched when desire see good action film hits again again it contains interesting nuances issues keep it getting ' old .	1
terrence malick acquired tremendous cult following auteur , but this , his first film , only truly successful one among them -- one finest films ever attempt capture donwside american dream ( it without pretentiousness ) . although many films inspired notorious 1950s killing spree charlie starkweather caril fugate , natural born killers frighteners , badlands really only one resonate -- part because it treats its starkweather-fugate analogues not quintessence gleeful evil but rather polite disaffected , making their killing spree all more astonishing . kit carruthers ( martin sheen ) handsome , well spoken , very gracious ; he chastises himself when he speaks ungrammatically records notes telling children very pietistic typical homilies playing fair listening minority opinions but acceding majority . he shoots father his girlfriend holly ( sissy spacek ) only when man threatens deny kit what he feels fairly his -- holly -- , thereafter he uses his gun means rid himself simply people who attempt arrest him . it becomes basically adolescent wish-fulfillment scenario . when kit holly escape forest build themselves elaborate treehouse , they become like swiss family robinson or huck joe raft escaping their pursuers . cinematography film widely praised , its extremely inventive use music ( carl orff " musica poetica " well songs mickey sylvia nat ' king ' cole ); sheen spacek could hardly improved upon central roles	1
i say i love this movie very well . but after all these years it release why ? it not put widescreen format or updated hd or blueray or new 2 disc dvd set laser dics version widescreen format someone needs get this out newer formats so we really injoy this movie ..	-1

i read some negative reviews here i just laughed how naive some people . they call this racist movie , it horrible , spike shouldn't make movies anymore . but if these people open their eyes , they realize all negative comments actions movie really happen . it true both sides black white . movie made expose how we people general expose ignorance different races each other . not only movie address race but it also addresses drug problems community well issues affect families . but i guess some people too narrow minded catch . anyway this classic spike lee film great cinematography , good script , awesome cast . definitely dvd your collectio	1

i first saw this film tv when i 10th grade , i my friends house it when i arrived , i asked him where h___ , it so beautiful . anyway this film really friendship more so than sex man two beautiful women . peter gallagher great actor , i wish he more films today , he should so called lists . anyway when i finally went crete santorini aug 1990 again 1991 it even more beautiful than i thought . so women . i would love see sequel years later same actors see how their lives turned out . there nothing sleezy this film all despite what others may say . great study friendships relationshipsi would highly recommend this film anyone	1
this series sold missing episodes , like many others here unbox . they think their customers so dumb ? would you buy dvd series missing dvd ? what sense this make ? what disappointment this service ..	-1
this show could lot worse . melissa sagemiller looks amazing dark hair freckles . i'm not sure how i feel this series but i watch entire season just finished second season where strongest hit last five minutes first episode second season ; maybe means this series compelling . if you don't agree how news represented perspective law enforcement terrorists , then you should still watch it know those perspectives . espousing may tedious but it never repetitive without point made . michael ealy would make dependable leading man superhero franchise . i see him batman beyond more than green lantern .	1
i loved this movie . i saw it when it first came out it such good feeling movie . i never forgot it i am so happy i now it my own .	1
this always one my alltime cinema favorites i happy see it available dvd . story , script , direction , acting superb .	1
excellent ; almost exciting sitting theatre during performance	1
there nothing attractive life crime portrayed this film , one its strongest suites . based actual events , it study criminal existence its most bleak --- hats off filmmakers cast pristine starkness it all . there certainly nothing romantic or cool these people who respect no one nothing . i viewed it because i like actors curious see what they'd material like this . sean bean villainy down fine art --- but note his villains aren't charming or any kind ad youth plug into . we don't want identify his bad guys , we just want them get their just deserts . ( bean all more treat when he heroic role sink his teeth into like sharpe , neil byrne , or boromir --- even his heroes flawed , which says something roles he chooses --- but he always intriguingly watchable . ) alex kingston , tom wilkinson , charlie creed-meyers all uncomfortably fine their respective roles abused wife , partner crime , hapless wheel-man . others termed this drama " gritty " , but i think it goes even farther --- it cautionary tale	1
those you who haven't seen any films late , great french director , francois truffaut , day night ( french title : la nuit americaine ) great introduction . this actually won academy award best foreign film , it evident why . day night really valentine francois truffaut love affair cinema . this great intriguing story ( sort film within film approach ) . ferrand ( played truffaut ) hardworking film director , trying line all his ducks row , film complete his movie , " je vous presente pamela . " often case , nothing going quite planned . starters , his beautiful lead , julie ( jacqueline bisset ) , recovering breakdown . her co-star ( jean pierre leaud ) completely unreliable , severine ( valentina cortese ) , aging actress , hitting bottle pretty hard during filming their picture . what more , all sorts other intrigues taking place members crew ( romantic otherwise ) . i love this shot because it almost seems like pseudo-documentary , well loving tribute blood , sweat tears go into making film . how great truffaut got front camera this piece . he really should it more often . this film equally funny touching i highly reccomend it .	1
koreans honor their greatest military hero this epic drama which takes place late 1500s . career tactics this admiral still studied u.s. naval academy , doubtless those other nations . screenplay based couple novels , so there some fiction , but life yi soon shin well documented , so there plenty fact supporting story . if you not familiar korean drama , it good keep mind this not hollywood product , but they very well special effects such considering non-hollywood budgets involved , it easy see past all enjoy tale told . it long series , but presents epic power , depth dimension well worth watching it unfold through each every episode . it would great also see kbs make other dramas available viewing through amazon , such " seoul 1945 " .	1
timothy dalton fan , i watch quot ; king whorequot ; just see new side my favourite actor , i completely drawn into it . there lot fighting it rather risque times , but plot memorable . i loved costumes scenery europe -- this period piece king who falls desperately love young married woman . she feels trapped because every single person she knows trusts blames her not agreeing serve her king -- becoming his mistress . it takes her own husband disbelieving she not yet gone king her succumb pressure , yet she never enjoys his presence all . war erupts france she becomes ill , because king love her , he cannot concentrate fighting war instead heals her himself . i won't give away ending , but it superb film excellent acting . i definitely recommend it , but caution everyone it deserves it ' ' rating	1
i love this movie . it good all ages . i am 9 years old i love this movie . this story , their group called " larry amazing animals " . animals group 2 dogs , cow , ferre t.t his movie inspired me circus called " circus kids " . part gave this movie only 4 stars , when clifford left his home . course he goes back birdwell island . if you you not like part where he leaves home , skip it	1
i've seen several spongebob cartoons enjoyed them ( i'm 39 ... ) my 9 year old daughter , but not seen this movie until recently . i give it 4 stars only because i enjoy traditional spongebob cartoons more than i movie . movie seemed bit scarey times ; both thematically visually , but it pg rating this reason . you get bombarded " goofy goober " song , but if you're watching it ... you probably don't mind . bikini-bottoms up	1
this movie i looking long time this excellent movie elvis i am really satisfied i recommend this movie all elvis fans .	1
based my perusal others ' reviews this movie , it seems some people expecting something monumental profound , hence disappointed . i don't know why they such lofty expectations ; " keeping faith " just one many ' romantic comedy ' genre . given this however , it most part enjoyable movie , if not entirely believable . heck ; reality itself unbelievable half time , so just suspend tendency hyperevaluate if you'd like appreciate this one . this my first introduction edward norton , i think he stand-out , both actor firs t-t ime director . dvd includes some deleted scenes , few which i'm very thankful deleted . movie could benefited some further editing well , but least worst bits scrapped . ben stiller jenna elfman don't much ' chemistry ' , efforts force fit would not served story well . there several veteran actors among supporting players , ann bancroft eli wallach among them , giving " keeping faith " bit boost . also enjoyable glimpses three leads ' characters ( norton , stiller , elfman ) adolescent friends . if you'd just like few laughs follies human beings nature their relationships , " keeping faith " well worth time investment .	1

sunshine doomed box office failure . three hour movie simply too long enjoy theater . it works much better dvd which turned off one so desires . still , i no hesitation giving it five stars . this film worthy your patience . we follow trails tribulations sonnenschein family hungary very beginnings twentieth century late 1980s . initially , this jewish family trying make best things citizens now extinct austro-hungarian empire . anti-semitism pervasive but jew , paying very high cost , permitted assimilate into larger christian community . what price tag required acceptance ? it abandonment one jewish religious cultural heritage . all three sonnenschein youths even opt forsake family name . things obviously not great . still , situation improving . then world war i breaks out their world collapses . one brothers foolishly seduced into embracing communism while other wisely understands viable society must committed rule law . present system might not perfect , but royal family benevolent willing continue relinquishing its power . regrettably , destruction caused great war eventually brings collapse empire . mid 1930s nazis rapidly dominating political landscape . adolph hitler could care less jew assimilation . only genetics matter jews deemed biologically evil . their planned eradication logical conclusion nonnegotiable ideological premises hitler thugs . even military heroes , olympic fencing champions , practicing catholics scheduled butchered . members sonnenschein family realize too late precariousness their situation . finally , communists take over . these totalitarians allege embrace universal brotherhood , radical egalitarianism , despise anti-semitism . this turns out , sadly , not entirely accurate . i amazed how honestly creators sunshine dealt jew hatred during stalin era . only jews tolerated soviets those self-hating variety . all others persecuted --- often point execution . sometimes even self-haters found themselves taking bullet back head . disgustingly , leftist intellectual establishment prefers ignore this vile chapter history communist movement . yes , you must see this movie . it should perhaps even placed top your list . david thomsonflares into darkness	1

( 4.5 /5 stars ) this fantasy film set during world war ii , nazis chasing jet-propelled backpack technology enable their airmen land enemy territory . there even mock nazi propaganda film illustrate awesome power this new weapon . fact , film really blurs fantasy reality , appearances w.c. fields cab calloway , among others . timothy dalton plays neville sinclair , actor whose life bears uncanny resemblance errol flynn . fiction mixed reality amusing because it offers imaginative alternative straight fiction non-fiction . other hand , " da vinci code , " " jfk " current bush administration all proven mixing fantasy reality produce downright ugly results . there some very good action rocketeer , played dashing handsome bill campbell , eludes nazis attempts foil their plot . jennifer connelly radiant his love interest , jenny blake . this type movie where gray areas not exist ; everything either black or white , good or bad . excellent sets , wardrobes , styles , etc ., this aids film establishing its nostalgic , 1940s feel . this very fun movie most family . even though there little objectionable material , some themes might better suited ages ten up .	1
back cover : miracles happen ! award-winning actress mary steenburgen ( tv joan arcadia , hope springs ) gives solid performance ginny grainger , young mother who rediscovers joy beauty christmas , thanks unshakeable faith her six-year-old daughter abbie ( elisabeth harnois ) gideon ( harry dean stanton ) , ginny very own guardian angel . ginny wonderous experience touch your heart warm your soul timeless tradition past disney favorites . one magic christmas fulfills all your most treasured christmas fantasies . share it those you love . my review:i'm such sucker christmas stuff . i probably own more christmas books movies than regular ones . so this review not " bah humbug ! " scrooge . i don't expect all my christmas films " happy happy joy joy " all time . my absolute favorite all time it wonderful life , which very dark places . first off , i don't think acting bad this movie . cinematography pretty good well . i made my judgment based content storyline , which , my opinion , flopped . what i really found annoying way ginny , heroine , constantly villified . example , let me paint you picture her life : her husband laid off hasn't worked six months . they two young children . she making minimum wage , they're barely scraping . they've also evicted their home ( since it owned her husband previous employer ) forced move her father-in-law . they very little saved bank , yet her husband wants take out $500 buy christmas presents kids . she understandably balks idea . first all $500 way too much spend presents just two kids , even if you're rich . unless you want your kids become spoiled ! ( remember , this movie originally made 1985 , so number even more outrageous . plus , they only one meager paycheck live no house their own . i think she reasonable . but she painted bad guy not blowing bunch their savings toys . then her husband wants sink what little money they into his own bike shop , possibly go into debt own his own business . again , she villified only responsible one , telling her husband he needs get steady job steady paycheck . after all , they may need their savings survive . this not time blowing it dreams may never pan out ( usually don't , since most small businesses fail first year ) . but no , she shown mean , cold-hearted witch saying this . grr . it just so irritating . yes , you want give your kids magical christmas , yes , husband always dreamed owning his own shop , but you responsible , especially when you children feed clothe . i don't think she scrooge wanting responsible adult ( she buy her kids resonably priced gifts , after all ) , but film painted her such . this film so depressing . it felt like world constantly kicking this family while it down . happy ending long time coming . also , i'd very hesitant show this movie impressionable young children . i certainly wouldn't want one my children think they constantly disobey me , run away home middle night , or talk creepy-looking strangers trench coats . that how kids end up abducted or killed ! not really realistic . i really expected better disney , especially when i really loved one their other christmas movies , santa clause . there way better christmas movies out there . see my list " christmas movies i watch every year " movies worth your time money . i don't recommend one magic christmas . if you're still determined watch it , try rent it first , or you might find yourself upset you wasted your money , like i .	-1

i love dark comedy more than next person , laugh things i probably really shouldn't . so i thought this movie , hyped very dark comedy , would right up my alley . sadly , apart few moments here there , " very bad things " simply fails comedy . it fails drama , because every single character unlikeable unsympathetic . that too bad , because actors fantastic their best material given them . i fault script , which problems best , direction editing , which give movie strangely languid character inopportune times . you could worse , but this strictly rental best .	-1

what i say ' richard pryor - live smokin'' ? first , big thank you filmmaker who insight document this amazing comic genius film . see beginnings man who would redefine comedy forever joy . sadly , there no film little richard his zenith concert 1956 ' 57 precious few concert clips early chuck berry . but here enshrined forever 1971 concert slightly nervous , possibly high possibly attempt kill nervousness ( not should excuse ) richard pryor trying out his then-untested material he worked diligently develop previous year berkeley , ca when he left his cosby-copying , highly paid jive career . this film shows him trying find his true comedic voice . one last thing -- pryor unafraid ' close room ' ( i believe that term ) i think it means not afraid go there ; make members audience walk out midway through performance . pryor fearless it showed his later work . he push it . he wouldn't richard pryor if he didn't	1
funny , only one other reviewer here noticed , or guts , state obvious : girl this movie obviously delusional need psychotherapy . but i digress ... alright , here truth this movie . always-great macy plays middle-aged college professor who offers help one his failing students , this case young woman clear psychological problems . student question blows simple misunderstanding into full blown sexual harassment charge aimed destroying professor , which turn would mean losing his hard-earned tenure . any normal woman would clearly seen misunderstanding what it : misunderstanding , consequently drop matter entirely . not so student-from-hell this film . she not only misconstrues professors intentions , she goes personal vendetta single-minded purpose shark hunting baby seal ( only shark more intelligent ) , whereas girl comes accross moron schizo-affective disorder . she tries completely utterly destroy man . just when you think it couldn't possibly get any better , things go bad worse . what happens next could only take place mind someone desperate need thorazine : she accuses professor raping her . you say ' nut case ' boys girls ? i enjoyed this movie only because macy , who my opinion one most underrated actors our times . however movie bit unrealistic most men would either walked away this girl completely , told one their peers it soon enough make others aware situation , or - this what most men would if it came same point it movie . hire lawyer !	1

this film painfully outdated -- it never good begin . i suppose you would call this " romantic thriller comedy . " it fails every one these fronts . thriller portion preposterous , nothing but convoluted story 60s tv show . it not particularly funny either -- oh , but it tries . romance portion probably comes across best , but this only because excellent actors leads . no , what " into night " going it quirky , unique premise it never delivers . landis seems more concerned jamming scenes pointless cameos in-jokes . this film , which could regarded underground classic , none substance garner such praise . it not receive it . " after hours " , which came out same year , vastly superior . best thing " into night " watching young , gorgeous , pre-catwoman michelle pfeiffer , some la landmarks since demolished ( ships diner ) -- original one-sheet poster very , very cool	-1

thus , quote film above , goes movie shark attack 3 . all negative feedback this film true . rather than go what stated well already , though , here what i believe most memorable lines make this film uber cliched : " you're extinct , f-er ! "" my lawyers field day you . they real sharks . "" i'm really wired . so why don't i take you home eat your _____ . " ( after destroying megalodon ) " mega-la-who ? " ( laughter ) " hey , where cocktails ?

other reviewers said , leonard maltin absolutely wrong this film . comedy very tight well timed . dialogue wittiest any movie i've seen era . it tend little toward one-liners , but it doesn't matter because it fall-out-of-your-seat funny . ingrid bergman divine role you would never expected her . signs times ubiquitous -- references quot ; pill , quot ; quot ; hippies , quot ; quot ; squares , quot ; etc ., but comedy far dated . best aspect film its unconventional plot . romantic comedies highly predictable class -- this one keeps you guessing . puts even neil simon shame . highest recommendation	1
this film made 1978 behind scenes look world professional football remains sadly pertinent nfl today making meshing business world athletes sport its own . nick nolte plays aging aching receiver who heart play game football but lacks ability his mind controlled people who run game . nolte excellent he winches moans throughout film waiting his chance play but continuously undermined corrupt coaching staff owners his team . mack davis plays handsome texan quarterback who cares little mind control more good time . charles durning maalox drinking assistant coach who adds some comedic relief story , bo svenson who plays psychotic linebacker nothing but " kill " his heart . dabney coleman steve forest evil business brothers who treat their players like machines tossing them out whenever necessary without thought . finally g.d. spradlin excellent job head coach without much soul but plenty insight . story shows world filled parties , adultery , corruption drugs it engulfs football players searching fulfill their dreams stardom self-importance . one hit end it all one badly placed step change their world . order succeed long career game drugs used keep aging body going . while outside toke marijuana ends game ( shades ricky williams here ! ) . somehow it just doesn't make any sense . film great classic if you love football but actual game scenes high school football best . politics ...... aren't they everywhere ? watch stirring speech athlete heart delivered late great john matuszak .	1

this affecting movie . many those who loved played basball their teens , even if only fleetingly , question back their minds . could i make it baseball ? obviously , very few succeed quest make bigs . but lots us wondered . this movie actually two movies one . first , local team , no record success over past few years , starts off poorly . they make deal their coach ( played randy quaid ) if they win district championship , he -- who once labored vineyards minor league baseball before calling it quits -- would attend try out try attain his dream . needless say , things work out you would expec t.t hen , upon attending try out , coach throws harder than he ever his earlier minor league efforts . he goes mid-80 mph fastball when he younger 98 mph fastball well into his thirties . makes one wonder ? however , this movie based real life story ; real jim morris ( played quaid ) , indeed , got major leagues . lots emotional moments . baseball afficianados like this , even if it formulaic . others might not " get it , " although it affecting movie several levels ( father-morris son , husband-wife , morris father-son ) . all all , worth watching . lot fun	1

i enjoy watching teen movies because i'm ever so curious how director sees this particular age group misconceptions present his view much teens ' view things . this movie unlike most teen " romantic comedies " i've seen , not necessarily good way . first all , main characters unlikeable don't represent actual categories people real life : we good looking rebel who actually not so rebellious after all but then gets back his old ways ( stupid twist if you ask me ) , nerd who can't get any ( they picked worst possible guy play nerd ; he actually pretty good looking funny guy ... ) , nerdy girl who hasn't grown up yet ( ends up hooking up rebel but they break up ) , gay guy ( i no idea what his role this movie ) , aggressive victim child abuse (...) , freaky nympho tint lesbian ( what hell you thinking daniel waters ? ) finally rebel childhood best friend who falls love him rejected ( film focuses 5 minutes its total 88 this character ... i don't know why she even here , she no obvious role her situation doesn't reflect all real world ) . next up , i think director sexually obsessed or something . ok , i know sex important part teenager life but this movie lame 13 year old girls aching sex even lamer 19 year olds who nothing else better . if i wanted see hormonal imbalance , i would go watch discovery channel . there more important things life than sex , this " masterpiece " definitely doesn't illustrate them . characters ' thoughts actions limited camp itself director focuses too much useless stuff tries create stereotypes , but fails miserably . most teen movies moral side them , they teach audience certain values , unlike " happy campers " . this movie only taught me it so cool obsessed sex , it cool 12 year old girls think they're oh-so-hot women , only absolute best looking guys hook up ( not true real world ) more [ ... ] . also director makes completely ridiculous situations seem normal , such camp leader getting hit lightning then acting completely weird , counsellors buying 47203 boxes condoms ( there only so much sex you 40 days ... ) , whole " don't-touch-me todd " thing , so so forth . this movie isn't worth $2 i paid rent it . those who think this better than american pie series should go out more . american pie work art , this piece [ ... ]	-1

this review 2001 warner brothers dvd . it 1959 paris jazz saxophonist dale turner ( dexter gordon ) playing blue note club . his stage presence seems sedated he sits rather than stands holds sax rigidly through most set , but his music mesmerizing . his biggest fan , francis borler ( fran�ois cluzet ) isn't inside club , but outside rain , listening every note though his life depended it . struggling graphic artist , francis doesn't enough money inside club , but one night after turner leaves blue note , he bumps into francis asks frenchman if he'll buy him beer francis gladly accommodates turner even though it probably cost him all money he his name . later it becomes clear turner drinking problem all his close friends including his landlady try isolate him alcohol . film moves more great sessions inside club , but one night dale picked up public intoxication point francis takes role dale personal caretaker even cajoles turner into moving him his young daughter into their small apartment . close-knit friendship continues turner clean sober . near end film , turner goes back america francis tagging but francis ' visit short lived he decides return france . movie best jazz film i've seen , it works magic because main character real professional jazz musician not actor music live not piped . movie take place this small lounge paris , adds international appeal , warmth very personal connection this brilliant art form . wonderful movie , too much time devoted borler obsessive relationship turner . this could quintessential jazz film if it focused more turner relationship other musicians more discussions mechanics music . far , best off-stage scene movie when turner dinner attractive female singer whose longtime friend she reminds dale voice gratitude , " you one taught me listen bass not drums " turner quickly replies back , " you would figured it out 10 or 15 years anyway " . other thing makes this film so special intimacy nightclub time when jazz musicians seemed far more accessible . final scene movie many years later large stage amphitheater which commonplace today jazz concerts gives older jazz fans longing golden age bebop those small clubs special musicians who played like dale turner . this must-have dvd any serious jazz fan . dvd presentation film justice . color widescreen presentation immaculate most importantly stereo soundtrack sounds fantastic . movie : a-dvd quality :	1

last reviewer interpretation book involves narrow understanding profit motive " greed " no understanding property rights . ( same problem environmental movement today . ) ... someone truly driven profit ( once-ler ) motive would not cut down all his truffula trees , but rather would replant manage his truffula forests order continue his biggering ( growth ) into future . same time , habitat forest creatures continuously renewed ( dispelling this apparent dichotomy ) . lorax , there no clearly assigned property rights . thus , once-ler no incentive protect his own property . indeed , since no one owns surrounding property either , once-ler also allowed pollute , well . they no recourse sue him or exact compensation , so once-ler allowed spread cost his activities onto everyone else . this known economists social theorists tragedy commons ... lesson i'll teach my kids this book respect other property , nature , " common property " ends disaster	1

i've owned laserdisc this 1981 performance many years . i've tranferred it dvd so i could view it conveniently dvd changer because i'd lost hope it would ever appear commercially dvd . production brilliant great " victorian " touches ( terms time period they seem come ) act ii ; mechanical " contraptions " wonderful . production fantastic , it should , yet seems rooted late 1800 . it also rich , sensual royal opera production . young domingo baltsa their best . regarding other dvds opera : much one vaguely admire opera de lyon " some tales hoffman " , striving different ( very stark ) destroys opera me . 1978 paris opera production ok if rather provincial looking ( very simple sets ) . 1970 komische oper berlin production actually quite good lively , but it sung german . even if musical performances royal opera production only ok it would winner , but performances excellent . anyone who thinks they even little interest french opera should buy this	1

personality nazi brownshirt one heightened need acceptance . fred leuchter painted such many people , some who knew him(and i'm guessing knew better ) we may witnessing others who didn't . brownshirts insult , assault , rather than intellectually confront expose objections their popular ideas . maybe major lesson holocaust brownshirt mentality live any culture so long popular movement idea available them cling . so long need acceptance outweighs need competition ideas . there must someone hate brownshirt exist , so they may prove their allegiance group . maybe great contribution one give their group sincere dissent , dissent not equal disloyalty ... except nazi state . there great free press germany nazi times , so long free thought constrained within preset boundaries . " mr. death " not representation fred leuchter . fred leuchter representation fred leuchter . might i suggest not suggesting collection articles many same people this documentary . that not clarification , that reinforcement one idea . rather go find fred speak him . get his view . if you don't preformed agenda ( like van pelt or morris ) , you may get him respond like i . i found different fred(and much much different story ) than i given director morris others . question not whether german gas chambers used murder people , question whether someone allowed think contrary , or any other idea . , without his house firebombed , concerted effort ruin him financially take place , his reputation ruined , or any other stuff happen . if fred ordeal any indication , brownshirts alive well , but i don't think fred one them . one fact i would alter my previous post rabbi bauer support " no gas chambers " . bauer supported fred methods , not necessarily his conclusion . i tried vain contact bauer , where he differs fred . fred high regard rabbi bauer . polish forensic investigation(which came soon after fred's!) not come same conclusion fred , but essentially duplicate fred data collection methods results . there testimony nuremburg trials both inmates german staff homocidal gassings took place those camps germany . 1960 , physical chemical tests showed no gassings occured there . it took 16 years(1976 ) simon weisenthal admit no gassings took place those german concentration camps . former inmate auschwitz said no homocidal gassings took place there . but all this isn't say auschwitz gassings didn't occur , but rather simply say some may think they didn't occur they shouldn't condemned ... unless idea create enemy out sincere people like fred	-1

after first two pink panther films , both peter sellers blake edwards chose move other projects . mirisch company , however , wanted film , frank tom waldman , both whom edwards cohorts , came up new script . this story more keeping last few clouseau films which would come much later : focus entirely clouseau not so much characters situations around him . weight this film , therefore , falls entirely talented shoulders alan arkin . mr. arkin up task , his interpretation clouseau much different than sellers , one would expect . arkin clouseau just confident his abilities , but somewhat more human core . one point film he doubts his abilities just moment , but only moment . this clouseau also more genuinely attractive women than sellers clouseau , which makes some comedy not seen edwards/sellers films . inspector clouseau fine supporting cast , beautiful european locations , moves very quickly , if sometimes erratically . humor not fall-out-of-your-seat funny , but pleasant bouncy . arkin contributes interesting , dancer physicality clouseau , especially when trying sneak . enjoyable , if not indispensible , sidebar pink panther films . there no extras speak dvd . transfer original 2:35 aspect ratio , color excellent . there preview steve martin pink panther	1

it doesn't surprise me " phantom " failed box office . it lacked star power other films time , relied name recognition hero who isn't flashy batman , spiderman , or multitude other characters , , honestly , it wasn't summer blockbuster material . perhaps if it came out dead winter when most studios toss out their artsy flicks hoping oscar recognition , it would better . said , i admit " phantom " wonderful flick watch . granted , it doesn't flying heroes or webslingers , but it wonderful story it classic vein those old 1930 cliffhangers . billy zane game kit walker/phantom . he classic hollywood look him makes him perfect role . kristy swanson ( original buffy ) wonderful job diane palmer , damsel not-so-much-distress . catherine zeta jones , james remar , underrated cary-hiroyuki tagawa head up stellar supporting cast . real " treat " here , however , treat williams xander drax , evil mastermind behind all phantom problems this film . he completely over top , delivering smug lines like , " show me power ! " enough cinematic flair you can't help but love his devilish character . story involves search three skulls : one bronze , one jade , one gold , give their owner ultimate power . drax , power-hungry man he , hunt these three skulls . only things his way sang brotherhood , who responsible creating phantom many centuries ago , phantom himself . tale bounces lush jungles africa ( but actually australia backlots california ) mean streets 1930 new york city , then dreaded devil vortex . it full swashbuckling , gunplay , high adventure , few explosions . cinematography brilliant , capturing beauty australian locations it filmed . blues greens fill tv screen wonderfully , vibrant purple phantom suit supplies wonderful contrast deep greens browns jungles . overall , there isn't too much that offensive this flick youngsters . language get little bit strong younger lot , but if you let your kids watch recent recent pg-13 hero flicks , i'm sure they handle this one . there quite bit violence , including couple impalings , but all it way no worse than most other superhero films . i highly recommend this flick fans films like " shadow " " rocketeer , " well most other superhero flicks . it might take awhile get beyond very purple outfit our hero wears this flick , but it all played out great intentions nod classic cliffhangers long ago	1

its take-no-prisoners approach filmmaking , andrei rublev reminds me francis ford coppola self-indulgent masterpiece , apocalypse now . tarkovsky film biography fifteenth century monk renowned his painted religious icons . rublev russia equivalent michelangelo , some works attributed him display formidable beauty which all more remarkable because they created during rude violent time . film told through series loosely linked episodes which rublev either central , peripheral or irrelevant action screen . film brilliance self-indulgence evident right opening sequence . man paddling canoe across river get away gang pursuers . when he reaches other side , he ties himself primitive hot air balloon takes off into sky . high above his tormentors , he experiences vertiginous joy . we too , thanks some truly innovative camera work . man exhilaration cut short when balloon loses air crashes into horse , killing him instantly . what this rublev not much , other than metaphorically - man tries soar above danger chaos this life , only crash back down into mud . he wanders various churches he commissioned paint , rublev sorely tried . he tempted lubricious pagan women , nearly dies during sack vladimir ( horrific mesmerizing bit filmmaking ) loses half-wit girl he trying protect band roving tartars . when he afflicted , rublev retreats into scriptures . his real triumph not his art , but he managed hold spirituality made his art possible . like calm vermeer created during period religious political turbulence europe , rublev faith becomes triumph over reality rather than retreat i t.t arkovsky use lingering long shots combined abrupt cuts chapters give movie static , yet elliptical feel . it creates odd narrative rhythm , but it not dissimilar viewing great icon , which both stillness sense underlying mystery , which mystery attaches faith . end , whole andrei rublev greater than sum its fascinating but disjunctive parts . its various episodes bear witness heroic effort required make art during nasty brutish era - not unlike tarkovsy efforts bring his idiosyncratic vision screen under totalitarian regime committed social realism . patient this movie , let it lead you where it , you amply rewarded	1

three years after first mortal kombat film , fans couldn't wait annihilation come out . unfortunately , sequel not well box office after viewing it , i see why . first , i start what positive movie . kitana more role jax , i preferred sandra hess sonya little over bridget wilson even though she good job sonya character first movie , some fight scenes ( jax vs . cyrax , sonya vs . mileena , liu kang vs . baraka , sub-zero vs . scorpion ) sequenced good , dvd bonus features nice , soundtrack awesome . these positive aspects , however , could not save overall film disappointment . so what went wrong ? like first mk , annihilation attempted blend two mortal kombat games into one movie ( mortal kombat 3 ultimate mortal kombat 3 ) . unlike first mk , however , blend not successful . too many characters put into movie therefore character development most them almost non-existent . aside , only three actors my knowledge returned previous movie though it understandable why other actors not return . what else went wrong this sequel ? some acting either over-the-top and/or downright pitiful . shao kahn character raiden character poorly resembled . also , some characters didn't even get much screen time all . one flaw immediately noticed beginning movie one main characters gets killed off ( i won't say who because it probably obvious ) . while some fight sequences good , most them rushed some just flat-out ridiculous . this goes double animality sequence . sadly , mk annihilation doesn't rank up first one . despite all this , there some good news . after eight long years waiting , third mortal kombat film hit big screen most actors returning first movie . plus , third installment not only kontinue where first left off but also ignore events annihilation	-1

i seen many historical war dramas far east ( mainly china ) most them not only historically inaccurate but strong bias toward enemy . yi soon shin , however , rare exception . not only drama very historically accurate but it also very comprehensive detailing meticulous battle planning admiral leads each victory but also political in-fighting chosun political factions ( second-guessing nature king ) which causes his eventual death . also , special effects great . battle scenes ( whether sea or land ) realisitic outstanding quality . only problem i find dvd not placed sufficient focus contribution ming china . then again , this not unexpected since this korean drama focusing great admiral . also , entire selection should 104 episodes . i don't know why it stops 101 . if you want more comprehensive knowledge subject , try samuel hawley imjin war ( which portrays yi soon shin more accurately quoting original sources ) . any who only intered fighting may also want check out stephen turnbull samurai invasion ( which more colorful maps detailed description battles japanese perspective ) . lastly , anyone who fan samurai warfare may want check out shogun : total war creative assembly ( now gold version ) .	1

( when bobby asks may not difficult , she stiffens asks , " why shouldn't i difficult ?

this movie really showcases extreme dorkiness early 80s . but it really no one fault , they didn't know they dorks back then , that just way everyone acted before michael jackson came . clarence beeks ( breakfast club guy ) turns his usual mcgruff crime dog performance . nice appearance tom hanks too ; his 2nd best performance , very closely behind saving private ryan , which i would recommend watching immediately after seeing this movie . they go well together . oh well , least this movie gave police squad ! idea how open up their show . it still better than hercules new york , although very much , no	-1

documentary film maker , kenneth carlson , succeeds building his comedy manners toward dramatic conclusion . this documentary comedy sense " go tigers " happy ending , main characters ' situations life improve throughout film film generally sunny though there dark undercurrents life city massillon , ohio . " go tigers " not game football , it effect game small town . massillon barely city its ~ 30,000 people maintain high school football stadium 15,000 + people professional quality field sports plant . massillon high school football factory film follows three players selected family members through undefeated season . there some fantastic sequences football overshadow current u play because these boys so consistently good . game sequences gloss over details play , showing over top fans , band , parents central characters , cutting out fantastic plays . why i say it not " " football because , while score board play boards shown there minimal coverage rules , technique , field position or strategy . locker room half time pep talks given center stage . locker room scenes feature pointless rants strings obscenity players interspersed level headed coaching inspirational sermons all massillon denominations . team always comes out energized this motivation . massillon not wealthy city , so theme " where money come " ? choices made citizens plot thread runs through lives three players their families . you'll need see film if you want know more . i say , strength conditioning coach awesome , professional caliber athlete . there all too brief walk part opposing team mascots who fall down laughing funny . film covers town darkness , but not great deal emphasis . example , live tiger cub mascot mauls small child front his mother . film maker not blatant subtle points made massillon . my one criticism " go tigers " this film 20 minutes too long . it lingers over several football games way too much detail , but same time not enough . games covered superficial way without enough reference play make games interesting . excited fans don't move plot forward you see them over over over ....	1

i guess there must something profoundly wrong me , because i rather liked " maniac " . sure , i'll concede its definately not everyone , but what ? old cliche goes , one man trash man treasure . so , what i like maniac ? 1 ) while marketed slasher film , it utilized none stock slasher film cliches so prevalent time . namely , " all sluts die but virgin gets away " faux morality friday 13th halloween . 2 ) killer not super human killing machine like jason or freddy . rather , this character real . not literal sense , but its easy believe killer like this could exist . " maniac " much character study it horror film . joe spinnel gives outstanding performance " frank " , schizophrenic serial killer . he three dimensional character , film told entirely his point view . you see film , he not pure evil . he clearly trying stop , but he can't . i actually felt pity him . 3 ) i impressed more than competant direction cinematography . film shot very realistic , almost documentary style . performances natural believable . musical score excellent well . this film textbook example what achieved low budget some imagination skill . 4 ) i won't hypocrite . i'll admit it . i enjoyed this film visceral level . while pretty tame today standards , gore effects expertly executed always brilliant tom savini . if this makes me " sick person " , then i'm no more demented than millions fans who line up see " silence lambs " , " scarface " , hundreds other " visceral " films . i'm no more sick than millions people who spend hours day playing " grand theft auto " . point its movie . no one ever got hurt watching movie , or playing video game , matter . if watching " maniac " all it takes send you over edge , you probably pretty screwed up begin . isn't there enough real horrors world get upset ??? so , those who found film so offensive they would condemn everyone who doesn't share their phony moral indignation , why you bother watch film all way end ? weren't you sufficiently outraged halfway through film ? , without giving away too much ending , it not " stupid " some charged . frank clearly hallucinating . since film told his point view , audience could " see " his hallucinations . his wounds purely self-inflicted . once again , director choose original rather than fall back old textbook cliches , which this case would final showdown which caroline munro kills him . highly underratted , unfairly bashed dismissed critics , " maniac " achieves what it aspires ; very original very imaginative horror film great performance joe spinnel . fans " good " low budget horror films likes george romero wes craven , this essential viewing , which why they play it fairly regularly ifc . i'll take this film over " final destination 1 , 2 , 3 " , or similar formulatic crap masquerading horror films any day week	1
i can't understand good reviews given others this movie . frankly , i thought it dog . not say it no redeeming features - friendship young girl lawn man endearing , if improbable . girl herself real sweetie , good actress - perfect part . fact , acting all around admirable . but script ! yikes ! not single character whole movie - partial exceptions two protagonists - any motivation anything they . people acting awkward or mean ( fact , just everyone movie other than said two mean ) , or spiteful , or stupid , no reason all ! it seems though somehow , movie could good , but didn't make it . call it almost watchable . i came away lawn dogs ( yawn dogs ? ) feeling not all enriched . puzzled , perhaps , why anyone would make such movie . well , there admirable , unlikely friendship . but all . pass this one	-1
it many years ago i read mcmurtry " last picture show " it one reasons he became , still remains , one my favorite authors . when i came across this video , i thought it might quick review book me . well , i ever pleasantly surprised . i can't remember too many details book i not seen movie . let me tell you right here ; video classic able so much more than book . i often find i prefer " movie book " these reasons : first , sound track , then sets scenery , then , actors ; particularly when they your favorites . top , you sit back , soak it all up ; all couple hours . i graduated high school 1954 . i lived small town nova scotia 5 , 000 , it just 9 years after end wwii . important since it army base town , nearby air force bases well navy bases halifax . although town never suffered much many during depression , it going through great changes . we 2 movie theatres , each showing matinee 2 evening shows . you could see 6 movies week then there drive ; or more commonly called " passion pit " . they've all closed . you also gotta remember there no tv then , certainly no way you could watch home movies . movies very cheap those days , around 35 cents , hence very popular . then there pool hall , better known " academy " . this focal point teenage boys even some other guys town . however , once grown into manhood settled down ; pool halls became thing got replaced family , golf club , or more " respectable " endeavors . you would never find businessman , doctor , or any other " upstanding member community " pool hall , but they all frequented them their youth . pool hall , arena or diner first place you headed when you wanted find out " what going " . little wonder i relate so this story . like , i said ; our town hadn't fallen such hard times thalia , we more akin peyton place . music much more us those days unbelievably , much it still played . i big fan country popular . here where video really shines . it loaded our favorite music background . ours time music radio , top tens , jukeboxes , car radios drive-in restaurants , record players course high school dances . all replaced tv , walkmans earphones now i-pods mostly rock . there amazing array familiar singers video ; eddie arnold , phil harris , hank snow , tony bennett , lefty frizzell , frankie laine , johnnie rae , kay starr , hank thompason , webb pierce , jo stafford more . however , one really haunts whole video hank williams . i still remember when he flooded airways his songs . it stroke pure genius choose his " why don't you love me like you used ?

it hard impossible believe george cukor 1954 musical remake star born ever box-office failure or considered anything less than perfect movie . opening hollywood premiere scene similar one begins singin ' rain , star born quickly proves itself brilliant expose cruelty greed hollywood " star " system . now-famous plotline , alcoholic movie actor norman maine ( james mason ) " discovers " aspiring singing star esther blodgett ( judy garland ) , takes chance her talent ( she " little something extra , " he says ) , gets her screen test film contract . she slowly but surely becomes star , while norman " star " falls due his drinking . they marry , but even esther love cannot save norman ultimate self-destruction . this plot summary suggests " show-within-a-show " -type musical , fact star born sometimes presents us show-within-a-show-within-a-show ( we watch esther watching herself big screen , her movie she plays performer ) - conceit gives film disoriented quality , even norman himself unable distinguish illusion reality . one could almost call star born musical people who normally dislike musicals : its drama - particularly norman personal drama - shakespearean stature , all its musical numbers either " onstage " variety or " one character [ esther ] singing entertain character [ norman ] " variety ; there , other words , no artifice would odds realistic drama . moreover , judy garland singing so inspired disarm any criticism . " man got away , " song first attracts norman esther , classic sequence , garland hummed notes beginning way brass matches power her voice song climaxes . garland other great numbers , too ( all , except those comprising " born trunk " sequence , written team harold arlen ira gershwin ) , including " lose long face , " " it new world , " " here what i'm here , " song symbolic esther willingness sacrifice everything care her husband . while judy performance great , james mason greatness itself . his brilliance norman maine lies fact he never allows this tortured man seem merely pathetic others ; even he plans his own suicide , he puts good face situation help his good looks uniquely english wit charm . movie villain norman press agent ( jack carson , actor not known playing villains ) , who out jealousy spite undermines norman courageous effort stop drinking , making him believe he never anything better than drunk . charles bickford well-meaning studio head , whose flaw he too cautious conventional his attempts help norman . clocking three hours ( even freeze-frame device telescoping some action ) , star born strange film , combination backstage musical , hollywood expose , love story , tragedy , inspirational story . it wasn't fully understood or appreciated when it first appeared perhaps understandable after all , but it should no longer neglected .	1

first flash white this movie runny droppings falling pigeon onto overcoat karol karol ( zbigniew zamachowiski ) he enters parisian courthouse . next time we distinctly see white , it porcelain toilet into which karol vomitting . these two scenes occuring so early , you know white , this film , represents not purity , but pure cra- . however , if true color , it definitely not true movie , which pure gold . white , three-colored french flag , represents equality , " white " kieslowski second film " three colors " trilogy -- " blue " ( liberty ) first , " red " ( fraternity ) third . it our polish protaginist karol karol ( redundancy , duplicate , even name ) who brings up issue equality " julie " " blue " appears briefly rear court where karol french wife dominique ( julie delpy ) divorcing him his inability consummate their marriage -- wedding night or since . karol relatively short man boyishly charming face , which , alternately smiling yearning , carries us through movie . dominique ( french , " dominer " means " dominate " ) blonde , taller than karol , says she no longer loves him , although , strange conversation him " understanding , " she says , " you don't understand i want you , i need you . . .

unbelievable ! i bought both cd soundtrack , dvd this inconcievably brilliant musical collaboration automatically hooked . i've never seen any other les miserables performances stage . i admit i watched movie starring liam neeson . but when i watched this concert , i immediately biased . colm wilkinson such heartwarming yet awe inspiring way bringing jean valjean life . fact his age he could still hit those higher notes just testament him dream cast . ruthie henshall . fantine mother little cosette played hannah chick . never before i seen more perfect merging character performer . when she sang i dreamed dream , you could feel see every emotion coming forth . you could believe what she going through , she deserved her spot dream cast . judy kuhn . older cosette . before pocahontas , judy kuhn made cosette her own . she made it quite seen she enjoyed her role she feeling love marius who played michael ball . micheal ball brilliant vocalist he , testament his role spot cast . phillip quast javere . character i felt so many emotions . hatred , understanding , pity , respect . he definately character ages . quast so tear jerking javere , especially when his character commits suicide . i truly feel sorry quast character , i also respected his determination once he performed song stars . lea salonga eponine . disney veteran(aladdin ) , her performance my own deserved outstanding ovation she recieved . she tender , she honorable , she made it quite easy audience sympathetic her cause strife . other very honorable mentions include adam searles who played gavroche , michael maguire who portrayed enjorlas , alun armstrong who played innkeeper course hannah chick whom i mentioned earlier portrayed younger cosette . best performances my opinion ensemble performing song one day more during end act 1 , michael maguire performance you hear people sing , epilogue performance end act 2 , one performance i didn't expect mention , michael ball performance song empty chairs empty tables . keep eye dvd gathering every valjean performances around world performing colm wilkinson multi lingual version you hear people sing , then belting out rest ensemble powerful encore chorus one day more . you hear people sing ? well if you buy this dvd les miserables , i garauntee you more	1

i don't care if it sexist dated ( , okay ... it ) , i'm giving 1967 " guide married man " politically incorrect 5 stars anyway because i love this zany comedy classic ! i agree reviewer manuel hernandez -- they absolutely don't make movies like this anymore because they can't: there simply no modern equivalent legendary likes jack benny , phil silvers , art carney , lucy ball , carl reiner , sid caesar , louis nye , terry-thomas or , matter , stars walter matthau robert morse . ( witness inept results ill-considered attempt remake stanley kramer 1963 masterpiece " it mad , mad , mad , mad world " ... ) after heard it years , i finally saw " guide " very first time cable movie channel 1993 enjoyed it zingy start satirically sentimental finish . ( any ideas where i find snappy title theme turtles ? ) walter matthau treat uncharacteristic role wide-eyed suburban everyman tutored whys wherefores adultery smarmy neighbor robert morse .

i watched battlefield earth because it just went into rotation cable movie channel i see if rumors true . i made it end , waiting hoping all while some redemption would make it worth trip . sadly never came , credits rolled i chose fall line everyone else who says this movie unqualified disaster . fairness travolta ( though he hardly blameless ) , . ron hubbard story main culprit , horribly conceived best considered failure many misguided loon . said , those who follow crazy people don't deserve much more respect . if travolta wished venerate his fearless leader , least he could attempt turn hubbard semi-fictional paranoia into something least marginally entertaining . artistic license would gone long way toward saving this mess . instead , story became mockery itself , leaving this production sad effort otherwise very talented actors	-1

" children corn " some potential : " corn " cult children charismatic adolescent its leader takes over rural town nebraska . based short story stephen king , this fairly interesting unusual concept . unfortunately , some very weak execution what mars movie . its director , fritz kiersch , sometimes works " alan smithee , " pseudonym directors who don't want attach their real names movies they know turkeys . this movie doesn't quite warrant , though it isn't very good either . there scarcely anything more pathetic than movie claims frightening , yet simply not . most egregious use hokey , faux sacred music . aside linda hamilton , john franklin robbie kiger , performances pretty weak . it doesn't help some dialogue laughably bad some special effects cheap look awful . isaac chroner ( franklin ) instructs children town murder all but one adult , who apparently needed warn potential visitors against entering town . his advice nearly prevents vicky burt stanton seeking medical help there , but darker forces prevail couple finds itself fending off attacks kids . if excessively dramatic acting cheesy effects climax not make you laugh , incredibly lame final scene certainly . not say this movie all bad , however . though never scary , there few effective moments throughout . ( i don't want reveal any them because they would only reasons watching movie ) die hard horror fans might want check out this 1984 release , though fans good movies probably want steer clear . this anchor bay dvd anamorphic widescreen good picture sound , though this not director cut .	-1

this version " four feathers " excellent , story much deeper than newest version ( starring heath ledger ) . other reviewers told you what story , so i won't go into tha t.t his movie excellent cast including following : beau bridges , jane seymour , robert powell . all actors excellent job making you believe they who they . battle sequences leave more than little desired , but they excellent day . love story very believable not include any sexual scenes or unecessary nudity . man who plays father also very good , i'm glad all back story why beau bridges character way he . overall , story really very good , but it battle sequences saddning part . you clearly see men not stabbed several sequences . well , minor quibble . anyway , see movie , it doesn't contain any sexuality ( unlike new version ) should plus most parents adults	1

my main motivation seeing this movie better understand reputation echo park , little area nestled next downtown los angeles . i moved echo park late 2004 . it depressing - vicious cycle drugs , dropping-out , domestic violence . it all here , told through eyes latina teenagers . it easy see woman hand direction piece important roles women played . i didn't care movie whole because it felt sluggish uneven . i also found myself not caring any characters . so-and-so gets shot , la la loo goes jail . whatever ! aside , though , evil neighborhood druglord called ernesto . it turns out my next-door neighbor real-life also called ernesto . luckily , it just coincidence	1
i bought this dvd because it features alan rickman . i also purchased it because someone else amazon review ( they sounded like they really knew what they talking ) . i am glad i bought it used , because if it new , i would feel i'd cheated . movie suspenseful waiting doctor office . there no sense suspense , i thrilled chilled lukewarm cup tea ( mind you , i'm not type who requires non-stop action special effects happy ) . dialogue throughout tedious trite ; scriptwriter should unemployment line , well director editor . plot , some respects , totally illogical , other times nonsensical . even previous scenes don't tie neatly enough end . plot entirely unconvincing implausible . choices characters make - whether restless , bored , frustrated - don't tie normal patterns logic suck all realism away film ( like greedy , unwashed vampire ) . movie features wealthy , bored couple . i also bored . but i'm not wealthy . however ! all actors their best within limitations this film . polly walker very convincing sensitive , but hypercritical wife . fact , i'd say she provided best performance , her character most three-dimensional human . they should provided more time make audience more sympathetic her character . norman reedus fairly genuine young man , although he seemed more creepy psychotic than attractive . he failed grab my empathy . which makes plot movie more implausible ... jaded , wealthy couple would allowed him into their environment . alan rickman his usual subtle work , but it so subtle i thought they might not let him his morning coffee before filming . his attempt american accent not fly too well . later movie , however , he becomes much more interesting . end lacked passion not surprising all ; it entirely predictable . rickmanistas , yes , you get see alan naked . so , just fast forward end movie you happy . i always admired alan rickman - i'm big fan - but he would better more skillfully scripted directed film . so , i give it two stars . * yawn	1
three problems this film : 1 . pacing - film pacing doesn't vary . it very boring . matter fact , this wouldn't problem if film much more tense ( e.g. , " speed " ) , however this film lacks high-action intensity pull off such slow expository speed . 2 . effects - too many sequences this film rely color light superimpositions , there overabundance high-speed imaging . scene changes employ erratic barrages images desensitize viewer thrilling " horror " scenes . furthermore , they fail make enough sequential sense film plot really mean much film greater whole . upshot : film relies too heavily art editing , point where plot twists no longer interesting . 3 . triviality - plot conclusion quails face " so what ? " question . viewer left sense , " i sat through film ? " light points ( 1 ) ( 2 ) , this obnoxious bit icing cake . don't waste your life . alon	-1

next generation basically remake original texas chainsaw massacre , fact up hour into film plot practically identical , though different characters locations used . original little overrated my opinion this " remake " quite frankly terrible . bad acting exception renee zellweger matthew mcconaughy who their best terrible script several movie actors . only major differences original leatherface now dresses woman , which fairly amusing but hardly essential , tacked conspiracy theory . conspiracy theory secret society only surfaces last half hour absolutely ridiculous , i won't explain it , theres no point , watch it yourself if you want know how stupidly film ends . i would sooner suggest avoiding this film completely though , even die hards admit its awful , i only gave it 2 stars because i reserve 1 star very worst worst ( yes even worse than this ! )	1

oriental i am fairly familiar films released our geographical neighbours , although not extensive standard hollywood productions . japanese films , whether it made kurusawa or more obscure artisan , i fairly adjudged them whole lethargic pace , inconspicuously lacks background music/instrumentals , generally pressed celluluid films simply comparatively substandard . village dreams , while touted award winner glaring testimony this stunted japanese film-making characteristic . review it yourself . pace alone wantingly needs tighter editing . it same character seen even kurusawa ran - quot ; highly acclaimedquot ; work my case , i couldn't even view third time , because even its dvd resolution quality only likened eye-view person who suffering his earliest stage creeping glaucoma . village dreams so quot ; relaxedquot ; if filmmaker expects people like me available time they enjoyed 1940s japan obscure countryside . very least , straight narrative this film consolation , but ran , actions so hard follow , you'd puzzled who fighting attacking whom . most unforgivable quality this dvd transfer poor film stock . picture approximates quot ; third generationquot ; recording vhs copy . this means you'll sorely dissapointed get vhs-quality copy copied , turn , vhs copy which copied original vhs quot ; master tapequot ; . course , dvd transfer not fault , its simply japanese despite their touted techno prowess just couldn't give us decent film stock , could least preserve their comparatively well-made gems . glaring deficiency films like this comes even more obvious , when shown high resolution tvs . i've viewed this film 29-inch sony wega flat tv , 50-inch mitsubishi projection tv , pioneer dvl 919 909 . if not antics two children leads , village comes off wearisome . i bought this film despite its hefty price tag mainly because i'm film collector . its works like this whets my appreciation world cinema . unfortunately , village poor resolution takes away gratifying cinematic enjoyment , well negating its quot ; collectabilityquot ; factor . this should looked more glorious if it could approximate celluluid quality examples like what dreams may come or dark city , but course that asking too much those editing-challenged japanese filmakers . i want ask amazon refund because this not well worth its price value . i compulsed buy it because its cover , i thought it least exotically glorious-looking kundun , but it proved just small , obscure production . critics may raved it , just like those canadians black robe , but final word they're just run mill , albeit thoughtful , films ....	1

this film documentary , not movie . those you who admire european films honest , casual nudity , this film may not you . european films honest , casual nudity usually non-pornographic content . this film brings anatomy down degrading level . if you want view this film , fine , but prepared some tears nausea . this film not faint-hearted . though here america we need let loose our prudishness when it comes casual nudity , yet , europeans who tolerate young children victims sexual exploitation i ask , where your child protection agents , your social workers , your law-enforcement agents , your religious leaders , crying out loud , parents ? i admire europe easy-going ways when it comes casual nudity , whether screen or their beaches , but when you view this film , you might think lot said way we protect our children america against sexual exploitation . i cannot think more vicious , sinister crime . i believe body soul , only these young lads cheated out healthy outlook body , let alone normal , healthy childhood . my poor heart just cries out them . i practically saw devil through pornographer question . i going rent " angels , but not angels , " but this film , " mandragora " , enough me	1

logan run belongs class old school science fiction films which popular early mid-1970 , prior beginning star wars franchise . these films not rely non-stop action or dazzling special effects , but rather thoughtful , intelligent stories , intriguing " what if ? " scenarios , astute social commentary . they included sci fi classics such soylent green , omega man , andromeda strain , westworld , others . while shopping mall setting some special effects logan run pretty cheesy , it still interesting film its themes may even more relevant today botox era than they 70 . i heard they doing remake would like think it improve original . unfortunately , given recent history hollywood , it more likely they drain every last bit intelligence out story , replace it more explosions , perhaps smith .	1
movie : ***** dvd quality : ***** dvd extras : *** dramas _teenage gays coming out closet ! _ so plentiful , they sometimes run together my mind . " edge seventeen " exception statement because it genuinely exceptional movie every way . screenplay todd stephens sensitive true life , or rather , many people lives . it tells story eric ( chris stafford ) , young man growing up small town sandusky , ohio , who just beginning grapple his sexual orientation . what so refreshing script eric portrayed neither victim nor hero ; he simply kid cusp adulthood who trying find himself . eric sometimes selfish thoughtless ; other times sweet naive ; occasionally manipulative ; but generally good guy ... other words : completely human . holds true other characters movie , including eric parents who love him dearly but aren't quite sure what make his fast-changing moods appearance ; his female best friend ( tina holmes ) who harbors deeper feelings him ; his new gay " family " ( headed lea delaria ) who fiercely supportive , yet sometimes insensitive where he terms his coming out process . thankfully , stephens ' screenplay remains true itself right down final fadeout doesn't cop out trying wrap everything up into neat little package ; end movie , there definite sense these characters continue live , learn , make mistakes , thrive . ( sequel , anyone ? )the entire cast uniformly outstanding . chris stafford embodies eric all his complexity ; his performance never strikes false note . tina holmes amazing his confused female friend ; more than once her face vocal inflections reminded me extremely young meryl streep ( high compliment indeed ) . stephanie mcvay distinguishes herself eric baffled mother , andersen gabrych fine eric first same sex crush whose confident veneer covers troubled heart . perhaps best all comic lea delaria , who turns warm winning dramatic performance earth mother whose wisdom understanding always available eric , regardless how hard he sometimes pushes her away . strand dvd offers flawless letterboxed transfer featuring outstanding audio video . somewhat sparse extras limited theatrical trailers " edge seventeen " five other feature films designed appeal lgbt audiences . it would wonderful additional benefit cast crew biographies filmographies reasearch tool viewers who want explore others works filmmakers , but this small complaint . overall , this truly must-see film , one worthy repeat viewings .	1

i finally made my first purchase amazon unbox video downloads just try service am happy report solid customer experience . $1.99 , i purchased downloaded one my favorite episodes " twilight zone " , it took twenty minutes download through broadband connection . i don't think it most ideal way see full-length motion pictures , but 26-minute classic tv program , i think my 17 " lcd monitor makes suitable viewing experience , video quality downloaded file clean . aired september 15 , 1961 show third season opener , episode cold war fantasy appropriately called " two " last two survivors earth , man woman , after apocalyptic world war 2109 . written directed tv veteran montgomery pittman , simple plot revolves around complicating fact he american infantryman she invading russian soldier . like two feral animals , they glare each other among debris deserted town destroyed war . he even knocks her out her after she aggressively throws pots pans him . reality their solitary existence , however , gradually dawns them , especially after they see evening dress shop window inspiring her speak her only word dialogue - " prekrassnyi " - russian word " lovely " . what really makes this episode memorable unlikely casting . two years before she twitched her nose " bewitched " , brunette elizabeth montgomery , looking appropriately ravaged sporting deadly ray gun , plays untrusting russian soldier surprising fierceness vulnerability . american played perennial tough-guy charles bronson , fresh " magnificent seven " . even though he spout some inane philosophical lines describe futility war , he leavens his natural sullenness determined romanticism . they make odd couple , but it works splendidly . i also learned canned fried chicken become staple 22nd century . narrated rod serling his inimitably halting manner , show ends my favorite line his signature postscript : " this ... love story .

wonderful movie 2nd world war period . poetic very british . movies like this no longer made	1
it right . scene transitions nicely . even though lot this predictable , it still funny makes one eager see what ' next . fernando literally goes down line all sisters , till he shot gun wedding last . scene cuckold err ... cuckolded cuckold hilarious . sisters very vivid pretty ( well except cruz girl ) . overall very brilliantly story	1
most serious directors actors aspire level professionalism seems effortless point casual . like best baseball outfielders catching swirling flyballs nonchalant jog flick wrist . other hand , kinski herzog want you feel every moment effort , every muscle twitch , oppresive heat , mind-numbing glassy eyed exhaution , dangerous waters , sleepless nights . watching this movie , i easily imagine furious arguments sullen bitterness men pushed their creative physical limits . they suffered make this movie they want you know it . herzog actors tolerate conditions exertions far beyond call duty what ? make flick . aguirre men tolerated far more gold most didn't live see . heart titular character , played kinski wild eyed wraith more dead than alive he descends into utter madness refuge against ordeal death he presides over . know anything kinski know aguirre not terrible stretch him . if anything , his performance more brave its selfexamination than creative its acting chops . herzog , his part , seems good old-fashioned meglomaniac he appears derive great satisfaction pushing his cast crew far beyond normal limits treating them like little toy people so he rich famous director . he singular vision determined see it screen , no matter what . he throwback american studio director/petty tyrants like john ford , alfred hitchcock ( gentleman tyrant who referred actors cattle ) , michael curtiz many others . herzog determined control kinski resists control their collaborations output kind two brained insane but brilliant filmmaker . aguirre almost two movies . one brillant study madness ordeal other equally fascinating , if unintentional , documentary two difficult half mad professional collaborators making great movie often spite themselves	1

i watched this movie again again , i can't imagine better carmen than rita hayworth ! her carmen free spirit , proud , sensual , intelligent , yet vulnerable too . glenn ford may slightly miscast don jose , but he rita such chemistry they make this film work . what really sets this film apart , though , rita fantastic dancing ! she raised tradition spanish dancing time she 4 years old -- she came famous family renowned spanish dancers -- it such pleasure watch her what must come so naturally her . no other dancer match her her sheer gracefulness passion . i've only seen dvd version this movie , so that version i'm recommending . colors luscious photography clear crisp . musical score very moving . this film may very well become one your favorites , especially if you're rita hayworth fan	1
i owned video several years just purchased dvd . hannah her sisters far exceeds anne hall my favorite allen picture . such joy . dvd wonderful	1
i seen many historical war dramas far east ( mainly china ) most them not only historically inaccurate but strong bias toward enemy . yi soon shin , however , rare exception . not only drama very historically accurate but it also very comprehensive detailing meticulous battle planning admiral leads each victory but also political in-fighting chosun political factions ( second-guessing nature king ) which causes his eventual death . also , special effects great . battle scenes ( whether sea or land ) realisitic outstanding quality . only problem i find dvd not placed sufficient focus contribution ming china . then again , this not unexpected since this korean drama focusing great admiral . also , entire selection should 104 episodes . i don't know why it stops 101 . if you want more comprehensive knowledge subject , try samuel hawley imjin war ( which portrays yi soon shin more accurately quoting original sources ) . any who only intered fighting may also want check out stephen turnbull samurai invasion ( which more colorful maps detailed description battles japanese perspective ) . lastly , anyone who fan samurai warfare may want check out shogun : total war creative assembly ( now gold version ) .	1

great thing this " movie version " all original voices clifford ( john ritter ) , emily elizabeth , cleo , t-bone exactly same clifford episodes tv . basically , it longer version regular clifford episode but they've added few new friends some songs here there . speaking , songs actually upbeat bit catchy . but not so catchy where i find tunes stuck my head hours ........ unlike some other kid movies ( i.e. - thomas tank engine ) where they play same droning chorus over over over again . this movie great compromise because my 2 1/2 year old son loves it , after watching it him numerous times now , i still like it too .	1
this movie rocks , man . i'm so happy they finally produced stephen king script almost entirely true original story . more than . it 99% accurate . they added some stuff like new female character played julie entwistle , wasn't book , but it turned out integral enhanced ending . normally i'm very critical people who watch these movies without read books first , but this time i think i confidently say even non-readers should like this movie . it masterpiece suspense gore . rent it , folks , call him " night flier .	1

this one great " unknowns " movie world : great film seen very few people . i'm still waiting dvd but not holding my breath . thankfully , my vhs still good . but like anything good , we'd like share this others most people never heard this movie . those sensitive souls who enjoy fascinating portrait unusual person or persons both sad uplifting , this your ticket . it both , spades ..... haunting film you can't forget . it tragic tale yet happy ending sorts leaves you feeling satisfied . what it , i can't remember if it based real-life situation , story woman who dwarf son what happens two them , beginning france , moving ireland , over united states then back ireland . way , mother , played so sadly french actress anne parillaud ( original la femme nikita ) , gets involved two men : gabriel byrne matt dillon . all three these adults really interesting , likable people , but nothing like dwarf , who played magnificently two actors . alan pentony plays " frankie " child more lovable kid would hard find . corbin walker great job playing adult " frankie . " trust me : you not forget either them . walker narrates film , telling it mostly flashback style , his best-selling book . addition his mom two father-figures his life , short story frankie love affair astronomy stars , hence " frankie starlight . " only profane character movie book publisher who two short scenes . , two quick sex scenes , give it " " rating . otherwise , this wonderful old-fashioned storytelling , kind makes you really care characters .	1
i think this movie goes right heart philosophical question what art artists supposed : they merely present facts/ideas/personalities/images no comment , no moralizing , no personal ulterior motives ( leaving all those things viewer ) , or they need state clearly moral purpose certain direction ( which viewer then accept or reject) ? martin sheen kit , garbageman working south dakota ; he becomes friends 15-year-old holly ( sissy spacek ) . when her father tells sheen he doesn't want him near his daughter again , sheen kills him . two run off together , living while woods like two " innocents " some primitive society . but then they're discovered three men sheen kills them , too . they now head montana , sheen committing more murders way . he empty inside , nothing fazes him ; he imagines he like james dean - misunderstood , alienated . but he doesn't clue what he should alienated against , far misunderstood , he never once gives least hint there anything there understand . we finish watching movie feeling empty sheen . i also felt little angry malick attempt con me into thinking there more sheen vapid character than there really : he truly just non-entity who kills half score innocent people . so back my first paragraph . malick obviously works perspective first half my question posed ( view became obsession , i think , artists , writers , film-makers , etc . beginning late 1960s ); i tend toward believing second half . suum cuique	1
this film hit nerve anyone highschool during mid-to-late 80 , commentary popularity still holds true today . number cliques my school staggering , i meandered group group , never dropping anchor . i stayed sane , while watching everyone else fall apart . lol . i knew quite few " heathers " . all same basically ; school not so much academic social . most adult figures film mindless twits , oblivious needs youth . this still one my top ten favorite movies	1

i singled out this book i felt i'd come fork road my life . i could choose bitter after premature birth death my son or i could try seek out better ways live my now very different life . i started this book dubious its content . i expected lectured . instead i found myself reading open mouth ; shocked how accurately my loss explained . it if this wonderfully gifted rabbi invisibly witnessed events my life , times when my relatives would say dumbest most cruel comments . instead talked , i found i reading book kind friend written just me . i am not religious or spiritual , i guess you could say i'm confused , however his book opened my eyes different , kinder religion than one i always felt judgemental . i since purchased anniversary edition this book one my most treasured possessions . if you feel life let you down , if you feel every door once open slammed your face , if you feel alone your sorrow nowhere else turn relief , this book you . it won't make pain go away , but it make pain sorrow less personal . you no longer feel `why me ' , you just realize it what it itself make your pain easier cope . this certainly how i feel upon it ending , i hope you experience same comforts	1

there dozens don't drugs flicks feel like after-school specials , their sluggish morals predictable endings . well , i say ending this movie predictable , but build-up it , acting finesse which special effects implemented ( voices going out focus , characters fast forward , teeth grinding ) me spun beginning end . though brittany murphy gets most cover , story really ross ( jason schwartzmann ) , part screwed-up extended family all hooked methamphetamines , including secondhand dealer spider mike ( john leguizamo ) , spaced-out game geek frisbee ( patrick fugit ) , others . when ross meets nikki ( murphy ) , he gets hooked up real deal : man calls himself cook , who wears boots spurs cowboy hat spits , fights , tweaks like man . movie , most part , follows ross exploits he becomes cook errand boy , ferrying nikki around exploits like taking her dog vet ( who turned green too much inhalation ) , otherwise taking cook out score , buy beer porn , etc . best part this movie dead-on behavior junkies . they hug kiss you , they reassure you pretty lies , they make you feel right home - but second they're short drugs , or you say wrong thing them , they scream throw things around . next day you're friends again until next fight , which never very far off . though you led believe through whole movie cook head cheese , it interesting ( accurate ) discover he reporting someone even bigger . yuck , personal hygiene right nose these characters - their teeth gritty , their clothes dirty raggedy , through few days we follow them it doesn't appear any one them ever takes shower . all they want - no , need - their next fix . part sold me beginning words came onscreen film started up : based truthand lies	1

this not movie you background while knitting or gutting fish or something . but those who focus it rewarded one most under-rated films all time . there isn't lot action or sex or any things appeal most movie-going crowd , but it some best acting ( serious comic ) writing imagery any film you're likely come across	1
i want two hours my life back ! after all talk what cult classic this film ! what waste time ! maybe this movie novelty american moviegoers 1973 . time past ( even then , " robots attack people " concept hardly new ) . now this just boring movie bad acting anticlimactic action . this film only good academic or nostalgic purposes . unless you doing research paper american sci-fi cinema , or you your 40s enjoyed this movie kid , or you just like boring anticlimactic movies , avoid this dull piece drivel . i feel cheated !	-1
pretty hard take well written book likes john grisham bring it all onto screen . they pretty good job . matt damon plays rudy , student law school who smart , broke , make history . meantime his partner him working hard case against scamming life insurance company never paid out boy who cancer . policy covered it but they would just not pay . meantime damons character deeper than ever , he falls abused woman whose redneck husband soon find out . read novel , then watch movie . it really very moving story characters book movie alive thriving . danny devito plays damons partner film it one better roles i've seen him play .	1

this surely one most seriously underrated mystery thrillers around , which shame since director sam raimi , just before hitting jackpot " spider-man " franchise , assembled wildly improbable cast inhabit admittedly lurid though constantly involving 2001 movie . i town southernmost tip chile when i first saw this movie hotel room which just happen hbo . not even outside splendor midnight sun could tear me away watching movie tv set back then . co-written billy bob thornton ( upon whose mother psychic gifts story based ) tom epperson , plot revolves around disappearance jessica starlet , daughter wealthy resident georgia backwater town . tired blind alleys , police begrudgingly recruit annie wilson , single mother three sons , who lost her husband factory accident now earn living tarot reading psychic/fortune teller . annie thinks she finds suspect donnie barksdale , abusive , white-trash husband one her most devoted customers , valerie . complicating matters annie her attraction wayne collins , her eldest son teacher jessica fiancee ; buddy cole , annie customers , suicidal mechanic traumatized parental abuse he received child . while it not perfectly constructed , sometimes excessive screenplay contains lot layers but remains true characters ' voices motivations throughout . raimi expert direction full sumptuous southern gothic visuals genuine tension escalates over course story . credit needs given jamie anderson cinematography neil spisak production design establishing such heady atmosphere perfect labyrinth plot . some actors really surprised me strong turns , including katie holmes spoiled , baby-faced debutante jessica ; greg kinnear seemingly stalwart wayne ; keanu reeves especially visceral chilling unrepentant wife-beater donnie ; giovanni ribisi deeply troubled buddy . smallish role valerie , hilary swank makes her moments count she cringes donnie scarifying dominance over her . but it wondrous cate blanchett who pulls it all together her multi-dimensional performance annie . convincing southern accent , she reveals hidden layers her character beautifully she tries recover loss her husband , protect her children make sense psychic revelations traumatize her us . dvd short extras - fifteen-minute featurette which includes cast crew interviews , movie trailer video neko case " furniture room lullaby " which perfectly reflects haunting soundtrack . definitely seek this one out if you looking atmospheric , character-driven thriller not condescend viewer	1

fresh horses , paper , would seemed perfect hit script . you molly ringwald , her porcelain skin delicately curly red-blonde hair . you andrew mccarthy his boyish charm but also male strength beginning come through . you romantic triangle . you " class divide " . brat pack loved millions . how could this fail ? problem really seem come down actors themselves . there very little " energy " all this story which supposedly passion overcoming logic . molly 16 yr old girl rural kentucky . when her stepfather begins fondling her , her mother little help , molly tries only escape she find - marrying older bad-man-in-town , viggo mortensen . she claims she never slept viggo - only used him escape . then viggo father began fondling her , now she wants out this house well . get momentary relief her homelife , she hangs out friend home , which 24 hour party . here she runs into andrew . andrew very serious student who just gotten engaged his high-class , wealthy girlfriend . girlfriend rambles china patterns , children living perfect life . andrew goes flow until he sees molly - instantly lust . molly leads him believe she 20 , single , interested him . it takes maybe 3 days before he sleeping her . his credit , he tell his fiancee promptly , breaks off engagement . you'd think everything wonderful now , right ? however , andrew learns friends molly lies . he decides keep seeing her anyway . however , he doesn't want introduce her his family , no intention marrying her . he says he loves her - but his feelings seem more related sex . one point he even gives her wad cash buy her off . there telling scene near end when andrew thinks molly publicly stripped her husband . andrew storms off their house talk viggo . andrew deliberately rude - laughing viggo artwork putting him down . but it viggo who calm one here . when molly shows up , viggo points out molly doing all this lying scheming so andrew would knight shining armor ride off her . he asks andrew - if you're saying i'm not good enough her - it seems you think you're too good her , right ? andrew finds himself agreeing - he won't take molly himself . he wants get molly away viggo , but then going abandon her her own means . how could he figure molly would better off nobody all , vs viggo ? fast forward year later , molly fact found herself " wealthy college boy " take care her taking classes again . she happy , andrew sad . i suppose you give them credit no t-t ypical hollywood ending story . landscapes often gorgeous , various details high class , low class , city , country all played nicely against each other . so problem really comes down main actors . molly andrew maybe gotten too used playing ensemble roles where each person just stereotype without lot depth . you really get sense shallowness when you're watching this movie . andrew entire life including long-term romance , he set . just 3 days he thrown it all away molly - but you never get any real sense he cares her . molly supposedly taking some quite desperate steps find safety her life - including seducing lying andrew order convince him rescue her - but she never seems care much either . intriguingly , only 2 people really seem depth this movie . one ben stiller , andrew best friend . it ironic because ben character shallow cares more himself than those around him . even so , ben really seems authentic someone who isn't used worry others - but who really try his best , many times , get andrew wake up reality . other viggo mortensen . you only glimpse viggo once until end movie - he just referred " rough guy " who many bad things . when you actually encounter viggo ( after andrew essence broken into his house confront him ) you're prepared worst . however , viggo very patient , very well spoken , quite intelligent his commentary . he doesn't thrash andrew sleeping his wife . instead , he lays out situation makes both andrew molly face their failings . molly deliberately lied used andrew tool getting better life . andrew , his part , knew he'd never actually rescue molly but led her repeatedly time her . some said this worst movie ever . many sections it very painful watch . however , i find glimmers meaning - especially ending discussion viggo . even there , though , you would think this would moment great soul searching andrew molly . instead , both seem think , " yeah , i guess that true . oh well , see ya . " i don't mind gloomy movies all - fact i really appreciate them sometimes . however , if movie no depth character or quality acting , it just makes whole experience fall flat .	1

... most original screenplay since citizen kane . least that my take . how i describe this movie ? i can't . it bizarre extreme , but i mean good way . it like nothing you've ever seen before . it takes screenwriting new level . maybe sounds tad pretentious , but sorry , it true . i can't imagine how they sold it . suits , i mean . i can't even imagine how script reads , how one make sense it paper . but i'm glad someone , because result stunningly-original film . but how i describe it ? i can't . i'm not only one this problem . i read back box video store : it made no sense . i read some capsule summaries internet movie database : they made no sense either . it very stream-of-conscious , proceeds more gut instinct than logic . basically , but not entirely , i [ heart ] huckabees philosophical discourse where various existential elements personified characterized . these existential elements get into arguments each other . if you're type person who thinks matters importance through only your own brain argue itself , hear little voices competing your psyche attention , then you'll understand this movie . if you aren't type person , you may find yourself , like many ( roger ebert , james berardinelli ) feeling outside , frustrated you can't crack code get " into " this movie . first frame i no trouble identifyinjg these extremely strange situations . but many , it understandable . i'll skip all obvious jokes how maybe right drugs help . this movie like drug . you may bad reaction it . or not . but how i describe it ? i can't . just rent it . performances joy , except maybe oddly dustin hoffman , who never really seems find unique voice match his unique haircut . paired lily tomlin , she blows him off screen seemingly without trying . jason schwartzman mark wahlberg wonderful screwball main protagonists -- schwartzman particular shines this sort offbeat role . isabelle huppert made me laugh just her what-is-she-doing-here presence , but i couldn't tell you why . ditto naomi watts . you read all reviews you want this film , but they won't it justice . you'll either hate it or it blow your mind . ebert didn't like it , but he didn't like brazil either , many same reasons . him , neither film " made sense . " me , they come deep within our psyches , owe more irrational than anything neocortex . how well you respond either might determined your imagination , how far it go , how many different ways you see something . but how i describe it ? i can't . go see it .	1

i knew akira kurosawa " kagemusha " ( 1980 ) some basis history , but i didn't know how much until i listened this dvd audio commentary film scholar stephen prince ( " warrior camera : cinema akira kurosawa " ) . according prince , virtually entirety film story based historical events -- major exception character thief who acts double shingen , warlord . however , shingen , historical figure , employed doubles real life , so kurosawa fictionalizing title character isn't much embellishment . what makes prince commentary so outstanding his in-depth knowledge japanese history . historical events chronicled film well-known japanese audience , but they're unfamiliar average western viewer . so , kurosawa often unconventional depiction these events frequently lost non-japanese audiences . example , according prince , wounding gunfire shingen he listens enemy flute marks monumental event japanese history . but kurosawa portrays event only oblique manner : sniper who shot shingen re-enact shooting ieyasu tokugawa ( historical figure , eventual winner wars kurosawa depicts ) . just imagine film abraham lincoln dramatizes his assassination it re-created secret service agents , you'll get idea kurosawa inventiveness . prince discusses some off-screen historical events going same time incidents film , giving listener much broader understanding both history kurosawa accomplishment . also , prince talks depth some artistic license kurosawa taken non-fictional events . after listening commentary , i came away much deeper appreciation " kagemusha . " since so much already said film itself , i only add this : it unfortunate shintar� katsu , who originally cast title role best-known starring zatoichi film series , fired kurosawa before filming began earnest . tatsuya nakadai , who replaced katsu , superb actor , but his screen presence doesn't comic warmth katsu could brought role -- i think would enhanced film . ( risk infuriating nakadai fans everywhere , i would also prefer seen his lead role kurosawa " ran " played toshir� mifune . ) i can't watch " kagemusha " without wondering how film might looked if kurosawa katsu hadn't quarreled . otherwise , " kagemusha " among kurosawa best period films . even if you already own " kagemusha " tape , this criterion dvd might worth renting prince commentary alone . ( disclaimer : i not know stephen prince personally , nor i any vested interest his work . )	1
this great movie plenty twists turns . only thing i think should creation sequel it could still now , especially now . ending leaves you wondering sliver doubt that why sequel should made . this one robert redoford better movies fayle dunway remarkable job . max von sydow cold calculating . rest cast blend naturally . i've seen this movie so many times but plot so real chances probability well . director excellent job directing actors . i recommend this movie after growing up working drive-in theatre i seen my share	1
i cannot get thru this one . i started fast-forwarding but there didn't appear any good spots . when i saw christian cammpbell this , i thought , this good . i just finished movie where he starred . can't remember name it . i guess person should never buy movie because who stars it . tori spelling well known , but not me . someone should put her out her misery right start . she not play flake very well , i don't know what call her except flake . i stopped this dvd first 1/2 hour go back give it shot , but tori spelling one leads , i already know this one not prayer . i would say ; save your money this one unless you under 13 . i ton straight gay movies tell story couple or few don't . this one falls into this category . one came this one " broken hearts club " while not my cup tea it far superior this piece garbage .	-1

i am math teacher myself so i always special interest this film . i think it very well it very inspirational . however , anyone who wants know true story what happened escalante his students , purchase book " escalante : best teacher america " jay mathews . film leads you believe escalante took students who didn't know how multiply then course one school year made those same students score 5s ap calculus test . this far what really happened . escalante spent years developing program he made sure he proper courses led understanding calculus . there one other noticeable bit fiction film . movie portrays it testing company ( ets ) accused students cheating simply because company racist they felt students garfield high school couldn't possibly known material . true story some answers ap tests garfield noticeably similar . 12 students made same exact errors one particular problem , what made ets suspicious . so once again , well film , while it " based true story " , it far true story	1
this great book . john robbins starts one farm animal time tells how animal sentient , characterized what we might call human qualities , then tells how animal treated factory farm . each chapter begins quote you use further your campaign against factory farming . middle section environment impacts factory farm environment . this useful sway those who think they saving world environmentalists , without concern " humanity " animals . final section covers nutritional aspects vegan diet . i believe robbins beacon light animal welfare . he might not achieve vegan ideal , but i think he definitely worth look , those who new movement , words he writes earth shaking . only thing , factory farm unfortunately become even more brutal animals , workers , environment , our health since this book written	1

this movie loaned me , ( thank god i did'nt rent it ) biggest waste few hours my life ever ! acting so horrible it made me cringe , cuts movie where it seemed like it edited tv . this supposed black comedy ? it not funny , so called violence it made me yawn , seriously , i've seen more gore simpsons . there so many things movie amazingly unbelievable , . sutherland walks miles hospital bullet through his neck , head , two bac k.r. witherspoon overpowers sutherland ( second time ) strangles him , pretty good 90 pound teenage girl huh ? but , i think everybody should watch this movie once so you see what movie should not .

critics lambasted kirk douglas ' performance " hammy " . i don't see all . this , without doubt , vincent van gogh we read " letters theo " miraculously brought life . van gogh actual life , whole thing kind creaking bipolarity it ; he periods creative bliss , happiness fulfillment , but they too short his almost unbearable intensity gets him into trouble too often too many people who help him . anthony quinn paul gaughan would seem like strange fit , but he pulls it off pretty well ; you feel arguments crashing them like thunderstorms , vincent unwavering belief their friendship so innocent enthusiastic one cannot help but feel heartbroken when it ends so terribly . douglas communicates vividly what we suspect van gogh reading his correspondences , his paintings ; he far too visionary ever really make it practical world , or overcome his restlessness long enough allow his art mature . beginning film more than any other sequence shows how violently alienated van gogh coteries social mores . his doomed-from-the-start mission minister ends ironically -- he too christian christians . while there explosion underground poverty-stricken children die very miner who introduced him their real hellish existence , he reprimanded his spiritual " superiors " dressing incorrectly . van gogh so enraged this he screams just what he thinks them , loses all chance path life . throughout film he remains christian , but he too much self-absorbed passionate artist always retain his ethics . douglas ' van gogh stick no situation or person very long : only constant thread his life his passion painting . sometimes performance so good we feel van gogh landmine madness coarsing through screen even empathize those who reject him because fiery nature could really scary times . we get chance see van gogh paintings way we never before , which probably best part this movie . his relationship his long suffering brother theo , played superbly james donald . he should gotten nomination best supporting actor , not anthony quinn , who turns roughly same performance every movie happened get lucky this one . somewhere inside him he knows his brother genius , but he still flesh blood van gogh deal financially otherwise . ending could not remotely powerful it without him . this film , despite concerning man titanic imagination , also good realistic attack myth tortured artist something romantic envied . barring his moments vision , van gogh life hell sorts led him miserable death . this nothing envy or emulate this movie communicates . still , beautifully must see anyone who wants understand one greatest painters ever live .	1

logan run belongs class old school science fiction films which popular early mid-1970 , prior beginning star wars franchise . these films not rely non-stop action or dazzling special effects , but rather thoughtful , intelligent stories , intriguing " what if ? " scenarios , astute social commentary . they included sci fi classics such soylent green , omega man , andromeda strain , westworld , others . while shopping mall setting some special effects logan run pretty cheesy , it still interesting film its themes may even more relevant today botox era than they 70 . i heard they doing remake would like think it improve original . unfortunately , given recent history hollywood , it more likely they drain every last bit intelligence out story , replace it more explosions , perhaps smith .	1

true ... this not quot ; bestquot ; documentary film ever made , although it pretty darned good , part criticism may come because most us who would want see this would just happy just one long uncut take concert film ... but we cd ( thank goodness ! ) . what concert it !!! this near dream cast one could hope . course there endless quibbling over opinion , endless comparisons obc ... that glory theatre ... many opinions . but overall arc energy this concert amazing cannot disputed ... cd classic ... one those rare few quot ; i wish i therequot ; events captured recording . said , documentary offer delight backstage glimpses it gives , especiallly after several ( hundred ? thousand ? ) listenings cd . instance ... i went into this already worshipping adoring barbara cook ( me there no other sally durant ) , but after watching , i really hooked onto lee remick too . there lots discovery moments like because documentary ... so it indeed , bring me someplace concert cd alone not , i truly value this dvd . so , perfect ? no . ( franky , what ? ) but it worth watching re-watching , especially if you total follies junky , or learning become one . how many other backstage stories you say ? me , darned few ... this one keeper . highly recommended	1
ignore all those harry potter nerds who say it wasn't like book , i mean who cares if it wasn't exactly same book film still turned out good great follow up series . missing scene involved house elf book but it not important , its great seeing all characters grow up onscreen they grow older films become more serious but still fun watch . this film concentrates more tri-wizard tournement harry tries prove hes most qualified experienced wizard even though senior wizards giving him hard time , you also get see harry , ron harmione prepare ballroom dance so there alot humor it well some dark scenes when voldemort played ralph fiennes finaly makes appearence ( person not something else ) confrontation harry potter . overall i would say this film great but not my favorite i still prefer prisoner azkaban	1
when kerouac , ginsberg , burroughs set out their writing , they no idea what it would create - whole movement . this film , including interviews taken when ginsberg burroughs alive , assembles clips media , film , personal account show beginnings beats up passing-away ginsberg burroughs . large assembly other beat writers poets they influenced ( carroll bukowski ) , it extensive study misunderstood movement . it interesting see beat propaganda sixties , how negative mocking media treated sense quot ; coolquot ; movement ; they painted false portrait . this film lovers beat or people genuinely interested . however , if you not like documentaries , you won't like this one . also , i disappointed see depp , hopper , turturro reciting long pieces work when actual writers could performed it . honestly , i skipped these parts . i wanted see ginsburg doing quot ; howl . quot ; disappointment dvd version , which slapped together fly . i envisioned additional clips useful information ( let face it , you put tons dvd ) , but only 2 or 3 screens names credited making movie trailer ( this case , not exciting ) . however , all disappointments aside , this film good few viewings . it conveys better picture beats than other films before enjoyed alot material	1

ever since i saw " fahrenheit 9/11 " ( which i thought ferociously hilarious ) , i trying check out michael moore earlier work ( both books films ) . i finally got around see " big one " this weekend . i felt like i could really relate michael disdain corporate america spent time working major corporation myself . i could relate employees various corporations who continually gotten screwed over corporate machine . i think it hilarious how random house tried reign michael shenanigans during his book tour their escorts . while there lots hilarious moments when michael tries confront various company ceos why they laying off their employees when they making good amount cash , there also good mix drama . one my favorite moments film when michael went capital wisconsin talk then governor tommy thompson his welfare reform policies two women who living below poverty level . apparently new welfare reform policy tommy signed when he governor doesn't work everyone . i love politician michael women confront state capital equivalent snake oil salesman , no one buying his schpiel because those women went through process new welfare reform they still living below poverty . one most personal touching moments when michael book signing borders ' bookstore one people line woman who recently laid off ford co .. i moved michael concern woman . i also liked his conversations other people like diners iowa ( i think ) just getting their overall opinions presidential election ' 92 . like his other films , " big one " mixes biting satirical humor real-life drama . michael moore movies me like mtv show " punk'd " socio-political message without talent-challenged ashton kutcher	1

this become one my favorite movies late . i always love it ? not sure , but now its sort film i watch watch again . many other reviewers noted much interest film intellectual , fact comedy , however sophmoric one perspective , depends upon intelectual underpinning probably not shared most viewers . i agree . trust me , there much more than surface farce going here . i would note many other reviewers seem over focused existentialism philosophical school . i think this taking notion " existential detective " too narrowly . fact , greatest philosophical influence film seems me buddhism , which director long involvement . i once recommended film fellow teacher textbook intro zen . on-going tension affirmative vision totality nihilistic vision captures zen motif , " sudden enlgihtenment " balloon scene . i could go one great detail . nor i think film simply making fun intellectuals or philosophical seekers ; it far more subtle than . suffice it say me film powerfully moving , even uplifting , same time it acknowledges " manure human existance " . i doubt real difference those who " get it " those who hate it intellectual per se ( number " students philosophy " posting here hated film ) . its more matter one sense life , one attitude towards it : passion depths , complex thought , same time joy simple , including simple truth one own limitations . not film those too serious see their own absurdity , nor those uninterested taking time look beyond absurd serious	1

this movie gave us brat pack , staple certain 80s cultural set . term brat pack derived article writen journalist out one night most men starring st. elmo fire boozy night partying . since then gals movie well few others who weren't movie ( anthony michael hall , example ) suffered bit ripple effect . here we see all them their prime their peak heart throb success every teenage girl bedroom wall . out all dramedies john hughes movies , this one i liked least . maybe it fact all characters so vain self centered . maybe it fact it all so idealized seeing all them trying adjust their lives after graduating college . it trying next generation " graduate " movie , i didn't relate when my time came . maybe it fact i let down many people didn't network friends similar situations , isolation i felt during first year adjusting outside world left nest academia . i guess i just little more bitter . plus , my life surrounded work little else , i didn't all dramas going they . kind sad , one scene where rob lowe goes back his old frat house they tell him they need someone like him couch their team . it proves you really can't go home again there some clinging past . not mention embarrassing one gal who managed hold onto her virginity so long one attempts releive her it rob lowe finds those enormous granny panties . this caputed more time fashion music than it mindset . it not bad story , but vain self centered antics main characters left me cold .	1

although it might seem like odd starting point , first time i heard kurosawa rashomon when i read iris chang rape nanking first time few years ago . within this book she alluded film because various stories detailing atrocities committed nanking differed greatly depending source information . anyway , couple years after i read akutagawa ryuunosuke short story " rashomon " noticed it really not fit chang brief description movie it not until i read later short story collection , " grove " , i find actual short story film based . film rashomon western film audiences ' first real exposure films kurosawa akira it ignited flame interest kurosawa films decades come . good reason , because rashomon truly excellent film it still tops best films ever made lists constantly . during terrible rainfall three men , priest , woodcutter , bandit , duck into ruins rashomon gate escape massive downpour . priest woodcutter just returned court case detailing murder samurai bandit tajomaru . listening tajomaru testimony it seems like pretty cut dry case . he wanted samurai wife his own after raping her he killed her husband she asked him . however , after listening wife story even dead husband story through medium , it hard say what truth ... isthe old saying goes " history written victors " rashomon definitely displays not only how different people view same events , but how lies thread their way into truth corrupt it . kurosawa depicts scene samurai , his wife , bandit tajomaru four times within film 88 minutes , resulting juxtaposition quite enjoyable .	1
it long time since american gigolo , but richard gere remains quite ladies man . yes , this movie complicated relationsships , but concept exceptionally well executed . scenery pacific northwest just gorgeous dramatic moods camera perspectives . i thought while richard gere phenomenal primal fear , red corner jackal , this movie , intersection , makes him shine brings out lot his superb acting qualities all kinds emotions . it probably because this movie doesn't typical blueprint hollywood ending , this flick overlooked so far never received any significant recognition , but ending definitely surprise . there number interesting twists throughout film like i said before , director really captured various moods even created expressed right kind emotions . although movie overall sad undertone it it shows midlife crisis architect eastman ( . gere ) , it just one these rare motion picture masterpieces which you want watch least few times every year . it excellent picture	1

highly recommended example how stage sequence complex scene . if you like black comedy , you should enjoy " confessions american girl " . rena ( jena malone ) embodiment old cartoon where guy sitting ground noose around his neck broken rope his hand ; captioned " some people can't anything right " . rena lives mobile home her somewhat " strange " family , suicide challenged , pregnant guy who doesn't want seen public her , blames it all unfair eight year absence her loving father , who prison murder . her dim idealic memories her father somewhat biased . highway its exit ramps metaphors her life her desire end her life . film not quite good " ghost world " but much same tone feel . alicia witt plays rena half-sister . because malone witt arguably most intelligent actresses hollywood , you immediately wonder wisdom casting them moronic trailer trash . but malone special talent playing this kind " slack-jawed " character witt standard sarcastic teen character works fine even this environment . their scenes together best ones film ; their reconciliation scene toward end especially good . brad renfro good job rena brother , o-lon jones ( remember waitress seinfeld " bubble boy " episode ) excellent small role clifton collins jr. great buddy , prison trustee , who quickly sizes up situation sets forces change motion . while " american girl " above average film , its main scene ( picnic prison which actually takes up majority film ) pushes it into cinema classic territory . this scene example way storytelling should , pacing absolutely inspired . it staged perfectly buddy orchestrates sequence revelations changes all four visiting family members . even if you hate subject this film it worth watching just see how wonderfully they manage this climatic scene . disasterous visit over , family leaves prison statement " it went better than it could " . then again , what i know ? i'm only child .	1

regarding review , below , written " crazysunseteacher " , this complete tv series dvd set nothing all like two theatrical film releases . it contains full , uncut original television episodes , they originally broadcast " disneyland " 1950s . these five tv programs included considerably more footage than theatrical film releases . theatrical film releases available previously vhs ( now dvd ) anyone who bothered watch them compare them tv series dvd set would know immediately there considerable additional footage tv series , released this grand dvd set . there even different musical cues " ballad davy crockett " film version specially written accompany new film transitions . starters , very beginning film version omits scene crockett cabin his family . how could you miss if you watched two versions all ? reviewer question clearly not bother watch compare carefully two versions before posting review . please not let this uninformed , inaccurate review dissuade you buying this dvd set .	1

" ) story sounds quite unique intriguing , but story fell short me personally . partly because lisbon sisters really committed suicide reason not much deeper than isolation . movie , places , also extremely flawed . i not believe mr. mrs. lisbon could've removed their daughters school so long without their daughters taken them social services . many parts movie , they should've used upbeat music fill deafening silences . whole movie filmed style i truthfully say makes me rather bored . i would only suggest this film , perhaps , people who like movies such " elizabethtown " which kirsten dunst also . but i personally disliked this movie which not very tasteful not watching it again future	1

teenager once , i certainly understand inner turmoil angst teens experience . however , pump up volume , movie attempt martyrize teens make all adults look like uncaring morons only serves underscore why so many adults look disdain teens . teens this movie seem little respect authority their assignation tortured misunderstood vanquished their juvenile behavior . even our hero ( well played christian slater ) cannot communicate people one one level ; he instead decides become some kind salvation his teens using his pirated radio shows cause some kind uprising among them . proponent truth , he vapid antithesis truth : he fakes masturbation arouse youths ; he doesn't use his real name or voice ; call potential suicide victim , he treats caller someone who isn't serious never really offers any kind consolation . suicidal teen says he lonely we automatically assume he lonely within his familial structure , but isn't he just lonely peers who mourn him after his demise ? adults played almost caricatures teens misunderstood heroes . sorry , folks , there ... living any age requires commitment better yourself what you feel right . questioning authority without any viable alternatives , none these teens , merely escalates generational gap , movies like this merely attempts exploit so called misunderstanding youth	1

given pornography multi-jillion-dollar-a-year business , it sort surprising it hasn't received cinematic treatment more often , but boogie nights provides it sort skewed , darkly comic treatment it almost certainly deserves , becomes certifiable classic process . following story eddie adams , simple-minded , almost impossibly well-endowed teenager suburban california who achieves porn stardom dirk diggler before turning 20 , boogie nights both time-tested star-is-born-and-almost-blows-it-all story loving tribute time place probably never replicated individuals who made it what it . paul thomas anderson directing excessive stylish you'd expect movie centered porno industry , anderson pulling out every trick book -- long tracking shots , underwater closeups , montages , movie-within-a-movie views , some moments approach stream-of-consciousness ( dirk vision his professional name literally exploding off neon sign prominent example ) . naturally , anderson also loads movie up period details , right down farah fawcett poster teenage dirk room , platform shoes , obligatory disco sequences . its visual flair aside , though , boogie nights also sort insanely quotable , watch-it-until-you've-memorized-it movie seemed come out droves nineties ( trainspotting , fargo , goodfellas , swingers , true romance , etc . etc . etc . ) but disturbingly short supply this decade . this movie simply seems everything you think going it , especially its murderer row cast -- burt reynolds ( jack horner ) , don cheadle ( buck swope ) , john . reilly ( reed rothchild ) , julianne moore ( amber waves ) , william . macy ( little bill ) , luis guzman ( maurice rodriguez ) , tom jane ( todd parker ) , philip baker hall ( floyd gondolli ) , philip seymour hoffman ( scotty jay ) , alfred molina ( rahad jackson ) all figure prominently -- even wahlberg ( dirk himself ) heather graham ( rollergirl ) roles perfectly suited their relative limitations actors . said , what really gives movie its resonance obvious sympathy which it treats its characters , who generally easy laugh but equally easy like . main characters almost entirely hopes , aspirations , attachments beyond rather closed world their profession--jack desire serious filmmaker ; dirk ridiculous pseudo-karate reed equally ridiculous poetry ; buck goal opening his own stereo store ; amber attempts get back touch her son , which she blatantly compensates mothering her co-stars -- helping us see them fleshed-out characters , not just plot devices story . since there isn't really plot speak , movie told series episodes , goodfellas-style , several extended pieces -- pool party jack house where eddie/dirk gets introduced whole crew ; new year eve party celebrating start ' 80's; fake drug deal gone bad rahad house -- serving turn narrative new directions . this last set piece -- when dirk , reed , todd head over rahad house sell him some baking soda disguised cocaine it quickly degenerates into laughably misguided robbery attempt -- deserves special mention , it easily one most fascinating single scenes recent film memory . it starts off almost surreal , skinny chinese guy walking around randomly lighting firecrackers rahad ( clad only underwear , bathrobe slippers ) discoursing semi-coherently he sings not-so-classic 80 songs mixtape . there it just gets progressively darker tenser , lighting , acting , direction all perfectly serving ratchet up feeling desperation horror todd kicks his ill-conceived robbery plot into motion things spin way out control . molina over-the-top performance , more than anything else , makes scene , he turns rahad into manic ball drug-fuelled energy , later , shotgun-toting avenging angel determined take his revenge . i wouldn't say molina turns best performance i've ever seen movie , but it it probably best performance i've seen someone who only got one scene whole movie . ' 80 , course , hangover joys previous decade , emergence video downgrades quality product , cocaine suddenly becomes addictive , dirk starts become too big his britches more ways than one . fittingly , disco era gives way tougher times eighties , movie takes darker turn , becoming grittier , more downcast lot more violent , but no less compelling . all unbridled energy creativity first half still present , just decidedly less sunny form . even when people getting beaten up shot left right , movie pedal-to-the-metal pacing makes it all but impossible look away . well , except maybe notorious money shot end , but then i one didn't care .	1

kevin sullivan tv movie " anne green gables " unusual theme it beautiful . surface , this 4-hour adaptation lucy maud montgomery classic novel deals largely everyday events ( everyday , least , canada rural prince edward island , early 1900 ) . but terms fundamentals it richly romantic story values their role human life . talented megan follows plays feisty red-haired heroine perfection . richard farnsworth colleen dewhurst give unforgettable performances their roles matthew marilla cuthbert , elderly brother sister who ask orphanage send them boy help their farm , green gables . instead boy they sent 13-year old anne shirley mistake . anne bright , imaginative , talkative , dreamily preoccupied poetry tales romance . but she passionate valuer , constantly searching " kindred spirit " or " bosom friend " share her values . passed one foster family , no one care her , she known little happiness ; but she loves life promise aching intensity makes her shine out midst her bleak surroundings , makes her seem " odd " most people . marilla , hard-headed " realist " who seems almost given up valuing , meets anne affection nothing but crustiness , first . matthew , other hand , painfully shy , quiet , gentle old man , who blossoms first time his life under warmth anne love . he first realize something it takes marilla much longer understand : they needed anne even more than anne needed them . beginning story anne impractical idealist her head clouds , constantly coming into collision her surroundings , falling one misadventure into . best intentions , she insults marilla friend , gets into trouble school , caught trespassing neighbor cow pasture , falls off roof . marilla shakes her head : " when i said you could stay trial , i no idea you'd take me literally .

samuel beckett play seems endlessly perplex reviewers : they want see it concrete associations it generally denies them . godot god ? didi gogo heroes their seemingly indefatiguable faith he arrive , or fools hinging all their hopes dreams man who never seems arrive help alleviate their suffering ? waiting godot , proper modernist fashion , strips away all layers narrative form leaves nothing but naked husk play , which beckett no doubt felt revealed human condition its most basic . but play power doesn't really come . rather , what makes waiting godot so compelling its wide applicability : it story random oppression , brutality , dreams deferred harsh realities . it performed allegory apartheid south african , jim crow south , horror war bosnia every other possible situation imaginable . why ? because benjamin kunkel pointed out piece new yorker not so long ago , " [ n]ot everyone god , but who doesn't godot ? " beyond metaphysical implications play , though , it popularity stems its near-perfection : all philosophical meaning people see it , action progresses virtually no direct reference it , every line which seems suggests some sort grand significance very concrete meaning action . take infamous opening : estragon , first tramps , struggles pull off his boot relieve his swollen foot . unable get it off , he gives up announces " nothing . " vladimir , wincingly wandering onto stage grasping his crotch ( precious few readers actors matter seem grasp one play running jokes vladimir venereal disease , which causes him immense pain when urinating ) , thinks estragon commenting his own ailment , announces , " i'm beginning come round conclusion myself . all my life i've put it me , saying vladimir , reasonable , you haven't yet tried everything ! i resumed struggle . " one hand , lines relate concretely action play ; other , they become representative modern man ambivalence towards cruel uncaring world , such clever cynicism linked beckett french existentialists whose circles he moved after second world war . but seen merely declamatory statements world-weary cynicism , lines lose all their power ; beckett achievement comes his ability link such nihilistic sentiments extremely comic moments , it humor carries reader or theatergoer through what would otherwise unbearably cynical play . steve martin , who played vladimir famous 1982 production lincoln center new york , put it best when he said he sought serve humor play , because meaning could carry itself but humor could not . that lesson which , sadly , precious few theater directors seem grasp , but which careful reader discovers beckett . definitely must-read , but read it before seeing it , because few productions it justice	1

i saw this movie when i 25 years old , same age michael o'keefe , very good young actor . i agree reviewer his range emotions ... anger , love , compassion , superbly expressed . i think he should won best supporting oscar time , but instead academy gave it timothy hutton ordinary people ( fabulous young actor ) . robert duvall , course , brilliant always . i seen movie several times , each time it reminds me two struggles duvall : dominance over everyone around him , struggle masculinity father son ( duvall o'keefe ) . this struggle interesting study father who very proud but yet threatened , manly sensitiveness , athletic ability , spunk his own son . first indication this when they playing basketball together . o'keefe typical vigorous 17-year-old ( almost 18 ) , expertly dribbling shooting duvall into increased anger frustation . i think very quick whack duvall gave o'keefe butt o'keefe slightly bending over , very skillfully dribbling ball away duvall , first indication he his father .. boss . you don't embarrass boss beating him . i even thinking , because duvall such jerk -- please michael , let your father win ! next , terrible scene performed so well -- when duvall , furious o'keefe not relent giving him two point extension , stadiscally bobs ball o'keefe head , humiliating him calling him his favorite girl . o'keefe retaliates yelling " this girl whipped your ass good , colonel ! " . i thought duvall would start physically fighting his son smart , but retort so smart , it left duvall silent paralyzed . those two chemistry , truly great together . watch it , performances move you much story typical but challenged , military family	1

i just relived my teen years viewing this film yesterday let me say i see similarities bruce lee classic " enter dragon " now . yes , it " etd " clone but " etd " clones go , its pretty damn good stands its own ! other than kickboxer , lionheart perhaps first universal soldier , this easily jean claude van damme best performance ever ! like other reviewers , what kept me glued training montages seeing all those different styles fighting ! while some them overplayed sake film , many these styles exist real martial arts so it fun see them even if they exaggerated bit . while they didn't any dialog , i found other fighters engaging just what they kumate mat ! my favorite non-speaking character , still , real-life fighter paco ! my friends i loved him some reason ! bolo yeung guy most young adolecent boys dream . very little talk but all action ! his portrayal villian chong li wasn't acting masterpiece but it didn't need convey this one bad mutha ..... well you get idea ! while this based life frank dux , story exposed fake recent years . still , even knowledge , its still fun film watch though it toned down violence today standards . imagine if they re-made this film today !? level violence would probably off page ! van damme , who starred other low-budget action films before this ( most notably " no retreat , no surrender " ) , got his first starring role this film enjoyed good run 1987 until mid-90's! still , this one his brightest moments film ! enjoy martial arts action , 80 style !	1
most other reviews printed here i am agreement . there little i need add except i saw film first time eighties when it came out tape . i just rewatched it still find my gut reaction same then some . schlesinger work , three leads marvelous script make engrossing , sobering disturbing treatise how so many people lack values seek " happiness " all wrong places -- especially wrong people . after twenty-odd years first viewing this film , i realized tonight how strong julie christie performance this film . there not one hole this bravura performance . it odd make this statement , especially since she playing such shallow role . it not easy nor desirable part play , but she carries it off if she herself character . selfishness core character well immaturity , she stoops conquers . laurence harvey never played rogue better dirk bogarde perfect jilted lover who indeed possesses heart , but nevertheless gives ( but not completely ) ms. christie empty needs . he , indeed , sees through her throughout most film but cannot help swayed her charms . emptiness served up brilliantly . we must respect talents involved providing us lesson -- well thank them ( two levels least : talent coupled making us examine what should really value us )	1

' we live trenches we fight . we try not killed - that all!'the film totally committed its proposition war evil ; not only first world war which portrayed film , but all war . motion picture , considered among screen most powerful indictments futility war , contains many excellent sequences set-pieces which still keep their power : pair boots continually taken over successive owners killed ; lew ayres talking impotently brotherhood man futility killing he watches his french enemy die beside him shell crater ; ayres carrying wounded wolheim his back talking cheerfully him , ignoring he killed shell splinter ; course , closing scene hand reaching out trenches seize butterfly only fall back slowly enemy bullet falls home ... despite dated moments , this highly emotive war film retains its overall power remains great pacifist work ... film won won oscars best picture best director nominated best cinematography best writing ...	1
movie full twists turns , fact just two minutes before end there twist . this beauty this film . while watching this movie , whenever you try believe something , it turns out opposite only find later it not correct either . this one definitely not typical war movie . it not actions , but script keeps audience riveted throughout movie , critics hard time pointing out moment boring entire run . john travolta samuel . jackson average . i mean their performance good any their other movies . however , real credit acting go connie nielsen . if you liked movie " few good men " , you like this movie too . highly recommended .	1
this movie hard core british humor must watched more than once truely catch wit . through out this film watcher completely satisfied outrageous cast characters who give performances their lives , developing drama which " cold comfort farm " .	1

i teen 1990 i watched " mystery science theatre 3000 " loved it because films where so bad , they where good ( funny ) ... this peace $# ! would right home there ! only watch if your : highdrunk looking something stupid watchor all above . thank you	-1
i thought this beautiful film . little talking , legendary director yimou zhang ( raise red lantern , live , story qiu ju hero ) uses scenery emotions this film , which so rich . i thought story beyond beautiful how girl would wait until guy she love , would pick her bowl food she made special him , i loved she would follow him try somehow get his attention . this film true love story you never really see anymore excellent acting radiant zhang ziyi , now known america ziyi zhang . i totally recommend this film people who love true romance film make you cry	1
going into this movie , i expected alot bs . especially noting two lead characters rappers ; i must give alot props ja rule , he actually pretty good actor ! also , i expected alot gun fights , no real plot . however i pleasantly proved wrong . this movie actually gives us chance audience get tune characters . return giving us ability sympythetic towards them , what they're going through . plot pretty simple , two 20 something black males , trying get over their ' cash-flow ' problem . one , who love music , other just want any method getting ' set life . ' throught movie , we see what obsticles they must cross order their dreams become reality . even though start slow , tone this picture slowly developes so you'll still want sit through til ' end	1

i'll try not add comments others already made . one thing i'll say it not horror flick many make film out . grow up ! yes there some scenes make you " shiver " but this not film just going around maiming animals characters like sm other reviews tend portray . maybe i grew up watching too many horror movies or else reading all these reviews gore violence built up my expectations what i encounter , or else i just watch too much daily news . whatever , reason , don't go watch film thinking it going all out horror show . it emotions conjured up through anger , betrayal , love . it hits sensitive areas relationships . put yourself into character place . how would you feel what would you ? ( maybe not fish hooks . ) far all peta comment , ( which i'm not member ) they cry foul over eating chicken ! worse stuff happens over here us . keep mind it different culture you're seeing film . vietnam other parts asia they eat dogs . other parts world may frown us eating chickens cows pigs . we don't " prepare " our animals . we just buy it packaged ready cook . gross stuff us . so called gross animal scenes fast camera doesn't " loom " animal so it inconsequential part scene . so what , they put it film . i've seen documentaries how steak pork chops prepared no one says it no-no show . frog incident-she knocked out skinned frog eat/feed guys bird . she didn't skin it first when it alive . it not like we don't eat meat over here . her economic status didn't allow her go local shaws market get one skinned trimmed . you see last year what people chickens raised i think kfc ? they stomping kicking them fun it . internet i saw clip kids putting live kitten cage , pour gas all over it then light poor thing fire . fish incidents- if you've ever prepared fish its no big deal . yes , it mean hack up fish ( guys pissed ) or run current through it ( lady pissed ) but it trying convey anger characters them . same lady slapping dog around . she didn't beat it death . she mad it didn't want go out boat boat house , plus she wasn't very happy . ( although it doesn't make it right . ) fresh sushi- can't get it any fresher than . if you watch movie , fish didn't die it caught male main character later , then set free , show his pity it . yes , fish hook scenes not pleasant watch but ) guy didn't swallow hooks far evidenced lady taking them out pair pliers , ) you dont see her inserting fish hooks into any place , just up her dress . there no clear shot what she . she bleed quite bit but wouldn't you if you ? i've seen much worse horror flicks news . anyway , there lots more this film than just gore animal mistreatment . go see movie blank slate you'll like it better . but ending little curious	1
i honestly say , right off bat , this only movie i've ever seen that so creepy , i trouble watching it again ... very psychological some great visuals startling sound make great movie experience . extras great too	1
this film essentially 4 stories woven create equally frightening tales true comic book format . stephen king brilliance shines all four tales murder , tragedy , love , betrayel desperation .

i won't go into plot sypnosis , it detailed previous reviews film ; instead , i'd like address message meaning film . order fully appreciate au hasard balthazar one must understand thematic construction film . literally passive , dumb beast who passed owner owner mistreated shown ( little ) love throughout his life , bresson uses balthazar witness reflection -- or both window mirror , if you -- human nature all its facets . there also clear parallels bresson establishes balthazar his owners , especially his first owner , marie . purpose such thematical tool audience regard balthazar facet human condition , but only spiritual sense ( bresson takes extreme care not anthromorphologize donkey ) . so , balthazar these group characters , film shows entire spectrum humanity : purity ( balthazar ) , good ( jacques ) , evil ( g�rard ) , weakness ( arnold ) , selfishness ( merchant ) , arrogance ( marie father ) self-pity ( marie ) . one or several these characters , we see ourselves since they encapsulate different ways human beings deal their existence . now this most important thing comprehend film : balthazar ignorant , unknowing beast who no choice but accept everything happens him his life due his condition , donkey , creature who no intelligence who no free . he simply lives life way he knows : he used animal burden , he so . he mistreated his owners , he accepts mistreatment . he shown love compassion marie , he accepts it . he even shares his state other animals ( times captivity during his stay circus times freedom during his deathbed ) . if you think it , within oportunities ( or lack thereof ) he given , circumstances ( good bad ) he gone through , balthazar achieved live life fullest ( die utmost grace ) . us human beings different condition balthazar . human beings intelligence , reasoning free make choices . yet all those gifts advantages , humans no peace mind keep attitude towards life making choices more often than not , lead life misery suffering , destroying ourselves lives others process . simple yet profound question film basically begs us ask ourselves : " if balthazar could live life fullest , why can't we ? " . when we realize this reflection balthazar life reflect it our own , sudden feeling enlightenment , trascendence spirituality undeniably invades us . throughout this meaningful revelation , we emerge moral clarity ( especially concerning characters film ) newfound sense spirituality , hope strong transform ourselves . i personally can't think something more inspiring life-affirming than . au hasard balthazar very well might change your life . this one most noble , humane beautiful works art , any medium .	1

one bergman greatest , " wild strawberries " familiar plot -- elderly , successful doctor travels accept honorary degree university , during trip wanders back through twists turns his own life . this film 50 years old -- but it fresh any more modern movie its flashbacks surreal sequences . actors say much little , seeing this film again reminds me beauty black white . dream sequences terrific -- bergman manages capture illogical but so real nature troubling dreams perfectly . it masterpiece	1
even though this 4 years old , it extremely halarious . i've waiting see good stand up comedy . first 15 min just one hilarious hit after . i love this guy	1
first heard his stand-up cd when i worked borders few years back . sometimes he gets bit carried away ( lotta comics tend , though ) , his comedy comes across dopey , yet easy relate . clean ( no naughty words or uncouth situations here ! ) , family-fun comedy ( dirty or clean , long comedian deliver audience well , then he/she funny my eyes )	1
sometimes movie so good thought provoking it stays you long after it over lingers your mind teasing you if there still doors left opened - it must watched again . i found this true ' la notte ' - my favorite antonioni movie . it so striking night i watched it i several dreams relating it once i fell asleep . far its construction - movie me appears flawless . every shot beautiful composition your eyes drawn objects every bit much people . antonioni seems relationship space objects far superior most directors - one gets feeling this man could also painter . acting film nice understated . jeanne moreau easy identify marcello very much ease one his best film roles . i am still just awe this picture i feel i may missed something ! time pull out dvd watch it again !	1
i just love it . agatha christie purely genius . you never guess who murdurer . it seems impossible first , but all clues just make sense after poirot leads us through whole thing .	1

it becoming pretty clear me surrender cinema ahead game compared other purveyors erotic ( all right-soft porn ) movies . virtual encounters impressive effort . look sound movie excellent , way beyond your typical naughty movie . plot holds together , acting pretty good overall , players arena generally pretty attractive . amy ( elizabeth kaitan ) take-control kind woman who apparently somewhat reluctant shift into intimacy overdrive her boyfriend . he kindly gives her deluxe pass virtual encounters her birthday . there she meets disembodied , smooth-talking rob , who guides her through number virtual reality sessions designed help her discover her hidden desires activate wild gene lying dormant inside her too long . she starts slowly , simply observing , but eventually she becomes participant sexual escapades revealed her , taking number different forms ( including man ) course experience . plot works pretty well because moviemakers don't spend whole lot time worrying it , preferring simply jump one virtual reality session fairly quickly . things start slowing down little bit midway through film , but last few scenes pick up pace significantly . it goes without saying virtual encounters definitely adults only . this kind movie make erotic movie fan out anyone who sees it ; basically , there something here just everyone	1
great stuff fantasy fan . it made great tv show also	1
joe clay ( jack lemmon ) up-and-coming public relations agent era three-martini lunch " drinks boys " following workday . while providing client , literally , boatload girls , joe meets receptionist kirsten arnesen ( lee remick ) , good girl stable country upbringing . joe introduces kirsten alcohol form brandy alexander , before long two fall love marry . joe provides good living his wife new baby daughter , but becomes depressed quiet family life baby takes up all his wife attention . truly gut-wrenching scene , joe berates completely degrades kirsten not any fun anymore , throwing temper tantrum while drunk demanding she stop nursing her own baby ( mammary envy ) because its going ruin her shape . very poignant heart braking scene . kirsten deeply love joe , concedes his demands " loosen up little fun again " , which means couple drinks him . it isn't long before kirsten drinking all time , very common women early sixties , kirsten starts smoking ( probably help lose weight , though this isn't mentioned beyond joe comment her shape ) . joe career slides his drinking increases , causing him late work upsetting his clients . his company assigns him lower-level client far away houston . while joe tries his job there , kirsten sets their apartment fire drinking smoking . joe fired , not long afterward joe epiphany . he bum , his wife bum , they need stop drinking . kirsten father takes struggling couple into his home where he runs nursery . after couple months sober , joe kirsten fall off wagon together riotous binge their room . second very poignant incident follows where joe trashes his father-in-law nursery looking bottle he hid . this scene may seem overdone first , but just tune into one episode ' cops ' you see how well jack lemmon played this scene . this time , joe winds out hospital going through some overblown withdrawal symptoms , it here he meets jim hungerford ( jack klugman ) alcoholics anonymous . once aa , joe tries fight his disease , while kirsten remains absolute denial alcoholic . you must remember this movie made 1962 , there quite stigma attached alcoholic , 60 version scarlet letter . there no happily-ever-after this movie . though made 1962 , it still best ' alcoholic ' movies ever made . ' leaving las vegas ' certainly portrayed down-and-out alcoholic , but character ben modern portrayal wanted die . ' days wine roses ' story two people struggle against alcoholism , not their submission i t.t here nothing outdated this movie except fashion ; times change , behaviors don't . kirsten confession she " just wants things look prettier than they " rings so true addiction any form or any era . this movie people disease , not time-period , so it stands up any modern day addiction stories . ' days wine roses ' true classic , timeless piece both sad entertaining . take quick note fact joe kirsten first apartment , bar right outside baby room . i thought bit ironic . if you love addiction movies , modern pieces like ' leaving las vegas ' , ' requiem dream ' , ' spun ' , or ' fear loathing las vegas ' , you love ' days wine roses ' . enjoy !	1

truely speaking , this very hilarious episode . must see every one	1
this 1953 film , i believe third five collaborations director anthony mann jimmy stewart western genre it , perhaps , their best . filmed breathtaking color colorado rockies , cinematography , william mellor , flawless . mellor obviously one best his time , reponsible principle photography such other notabled movies such " giant , " " compulsion , " " bad day black rock , " even " peyton place . " naked spur generally recognized one best westerns all time , though , much debate reigns this subject . it not often viewer gets watch angry , unmerciful jimmy stewart bounty hunter hell-bent bringing outlaw robert ryan , " dead or alive , " not justice sake , but reap benefits $ 5,000 . 00 reward . way , accident , he inherits two diversely different partners whose ultimate fates not his concern least . this jimmy stewart we're not used seeing . his relentless determination throughout entire film palpable . again , mountainous somewhat snowy setting instrumental element film . i wondered where film titled derived . well , you won't find out until film climax set among rocky cliffs which border fast flowing river . all all , excellent film-going experience viewers all kinds but especially lovers western genre .	1
everyone , including amazon , this documentary imagine , which i don't believe it . this " video version " imagine album , each song it own video , includes couple yoko fly . it released 1986 , time , pretty cool , it digitally remastered really well lot then unreleased footage , mostly shot tittenhurst . time , technology releases john lennon : imagine gimme some truth rendered this pretty much obsolete . even excellent sound upped 2001 remaster album . but i still pull it out once while . it got few clips aren't either other videos besides , any self-respecting beatle fan should it	1

orwell novel taking spectacular ideas life o-o peration morphing it fit your own greedy desires , losing all purpose ultimately ending futile , corrupt dictatorship . it made fun dictators then still makes fun dictators today , though easy read it went deep speaking politically man actions against man . sadly , none this film . fact , this movie travesty original novel . one major problem it renders orwell novel cute , probably due release all animal films during this time ( " babe " , " gordy " , what you ) . old major speech great speech , who better perform it than peter ustinov ? unfortunately , this speech ruined talked over julia louise dreyfus horse complaining she lose her ribbons if man overthrown , among other animals their minor problems . imagine katie couric talking over winston churchill " we fight beaches " speech you'll understand how i feel . it gets worst later . main character not farm entire , but instead female dog annoyingly whines complains whole time tries narrate what going . this sound bad ? it gets worst . end she leads animals out farm , then tells us everything lived happily ever after . napoleon animalism fails ( we're never told how or see it happen , they basically throw it us say " take our word it ! " ) then white , middle-class family four moves takes over farm . end . orwell point just fly past these people or what ? orwell always master closing line me , " animal farm " no exception . even british animated film managed sneak orwell metaphor before closing happy ending . this such waste . peter ustinov old major , ian holm squeeler , patrick stewart napoleon ... all these talented names wasted sounds horrible , but it true . such great book serious representation treated amatuerish fashion may not bother some , but others it big deal . if you like orwell , if you loved novel , if you enjoy great stories , if you enjoy good films ... don't watch this movie	-1

even though i am not streisand fan , i astonished just how dopey annoying this movie . plot supposed revolve around big change appearance streisand character , making her attractive - no , irresistible - main male character . problem , she looks almost exactly same before after makeover ! somebody ( probably streisand ) thinks highlighted hair , tight black cocktail dress , baggy-lipped smirk irresistible whereas pink bridesmaid dress , casual clothes , everyday looks disgusting . baaaaaamp ! ( that fallacy alarm going off : men , my experience , don't care much clothes makeup . ) there lot emphasis placed streisand character losing weight riding exercise bike , but she looked exactly same afterward - no detectable weight difference ! yet truly , low point movie scene which streisand , discussing her baby early-childhood photos her mother ( played lauren bacall ) , blubbers , " wazz i pretty baby ? wazz i pretty babyyyyeeee ? " one scene , streisand neuroticism concerning her looks fully revealed . whole movie this issue , it amazing entire cast , crew , production company would devote themselves . . ' emotional issues like . i really think " funny girl " phenomenon somehow ruined streisand thought processes . media buzz her time she kind cute despite light-years away stereotyped , northern european beauty standard time ( think grace kelly ; think ingrid bergman ..... ) . i recall reading how her glowing complexion , thick hair , good figure ( well her energy voice ) carried her through despite her looks : long nose , large lips , slanted eyes . myself , i think she looks like egyptian princess or similar ; but she certainly doesn't look like grace kelly ..... so why can't she accept this ? majority us women , whatever our race , color , or bone-structure , learn live love who we ..... least i hope we ! this movie not . this movie says you certain dress hairdo desirable . maybe i should've given it only one star	1

former film student ardent lover medium this day , unbearable lightness remains one my all time favorite films . it intelligent , well-acted , tender , yet tackles serious thought-provoking internal external subjects such fidelity , authenticity , armed conflict personal freedom . more than anything it always , always great pleasure watch . characters so genuine well-rounded , although they tremendously diverse you care not one , not two , but all them . beautifully shot edited what appear real photos footage time which it set , i would recommend it anyone . it not aged day . i count one hand examples film adaptation where film really adds legacy piece , equals or even transcends power book . that saying lot this case because book also something experienced	1

i'm going assume book " i captured castle " better than movie . cinematography excellent , acting decent all around except lead character played romola garai . her most dramatic scene , confrontation her father , she played out her emotions over-slow , melodramatic manner like bad , bad stage play . i'll give her break because this one her first films , but thank goodness bill nighy carried rest scene . funny thing when you listen romola during her interview special features , you think " why couldn't we get this part you film " ? she intelligent witty woman , but her performance lead character just underwhelming . that horrible shame . lead always sets tone film . this would explain why movie seemed drag . i found this film bore despite wonderful talent .	1

20 years ago , there terrible accident mine valentine day . following year one miners , harry warden , takes terrible revange those responsible accident . since day , there no celebration valentine day little town valentine buff . until now ( 1981 ) . but harry warden seems returned stop celebration . music music quite good , but it doesn't lead film any direction , so it not helping . story recycled , which good , but could much more minimalistic . why not just party let miner kill kids ? trying put twist story " explaining " things seldom very helpful . murderar places human hearts valentine boxes which distasteful but not really scary . variation holiday theme , could bit more focused .	1
i love films which unfold complexities slowly , use color deep intention , don't rely words say everything must said . end affair lovingly carefully adapted film . fit into time , i feel you must allow film like this stand its own . many adjustments made story , what eventually emmerges , me , even more cohesive personal . one thing i particularly love end affair , color pallette sharp attention clothing . i love sarah red suits , her green jacket , her hair ( carefully suited time ) , way colors stand out , but subtlety , every scene she stands until her character begins fade . this movie permanently affected my aesthetic sensibilities . * most * affecting aspect movie me however , able deeply relate character sarah , i think many people . most us our superstitions , even when we work keep them subdued , certainly seemingly " miraculous experience , " or great trauma ( they usually go together don't they ? ) bring those things surface . i thought bendrix henry dynamic played out film fascinating . it created contrast two ways living really : one figure , content live straight line , climbing little little bits satisfaction but no passion , other all passion anger intensity . henry , way , created passion sarah felt maurice . he bottled her up placed her shelf where she simmered , i think " vulgar sex scenes " some called them , extraordinarily necessary if you want understand emotions going . then again , sarah religious devotion followed her commitment henry , which before vow she seemed no intention lessening , so you also see she more than sensual person she maurice , she also practical wife . neither role she playing . every central character this film , dichotomy , more than , they wonderfully spectacularly flawed , which certainly core graham greene insightful philosophic writing . this labrynth film , rich unanswerable questions , contains most brilliant use perspective i ever seen . if you , like me , like watch good film several times , i recommend listening neil jordan commentary least one viewing , then watching it again . -stephanie	1

this movie great actors , great screenplay , great director . i can't fully write how good this film why it considered classic . it won best picture oscar one few winners really deserve mention award-winning film . director made romance low-key , which makes sense considering cynical nature film . billy wilder ( director ) also knew when inject humor when inject drama . very few directors good sense when incorporate humor into dramatic moment . any other time it just distracts messes up flow picture but here wilder kept things smooth . i also love ending which my viewpoint perfect considering cynical mood set characters . this film little romance , mixed dash drama , hint comedy making delightful piece classic hollywood film	1
i first saw this film many many years ago ....... it wonderful i thought it ....... i love shakespeare poetry ..... it just beautiful listen . performances top-notch - leonard whiting olivia hussey absolutely gorgeous ! i think that what zeffirelli going - truly young beautiful people these immortal roles . they just so young gorgeous passionate - just what you need play romeo juliet . this particular disc no extras - merely theatrical trailer , but what i really wanted just see film again after quite some time passed ; extras not important me . it hews pretty closely shakespeare original text story . beautiful cinematography , wonderful costumes ..... i enjoyed it not disappointed	1

you're not going able find dvd all these legendary performers going up one one same stage perform same audience . so if you enjoy " old-timey mountain music " , i.e. bluegrass , then just buy this dvd , prepare watch listen again again . i quite few music dvds , i think quality this one superior : 1 ) it recorded 5.1 dolby digital surround sound . 2 ) reviewer complained grainy video , but they just need get higher quality tv : i flat-screen sony wega tv , picture crisp sharp . 3 ) several reviewers complained placement backstage conversations , even pre-concert footage . suffice say since we weren't directors , then it not our decision . all concert dvds this extra footage ; it what people expect . i music/concert dvds where every song long rambling philosophical sermons band members . it like , hello ! put stuff end instead forcing it people . that not case this dvd . they cut away near end song cox family , but they're " keepin ' it real " , you expect some concert dvd . just glad they didn't slip some studio-shot music videos ! ( like some other music dvds shall remain nameless . ) 4 ) i would buy this just cox family performing " ( there any ) stars my crown , " which pure bonus , since it not " o brother where art thou ? " movie soundtrack ( which i ) . fact this my favorite song performance whole dvd . 5 ) some reviewers complained lack " i am man constant sorrow " performance . my suggestion those who pine song simply buy " o brother where art thou ? " movie soundtrack , you proud owner no less than four different renditions four different tracks , four different blends musicians . bon appetite ! 6 ) lastly , i commend directors , because my opinion screen shots camera angles just right . i don't want camera shots jiggling jumping around like drunk monkey ahold camera , i don't want just see one straight-on view , either . directors find right balance this dvd , nice variety close-ups singers wider-angle stage shots . just buy this dvd enjoy	1

it seems lately john travolta gone extreme rid himself our memories saturday night fever . his role domestic disturbance no different . travolta plays father intent saving his son evil stepfather ; he rough rugged boat builder trying someone hero . his nemesis rick ( vince vaughan ) who two-faced you get - outside he town man year everyone likes him , but inside , he ruthless murderer conman . storyline before different twists . frank morrison ( travolta ) hard time upcoming marriage his ex-wife , susan ( played teri polo ) . their son , danny , ( played matt o'leary ) also issues but relies his relationship both parents get through it . it nice platform which build rest story . few months later , danny finds out his mother pregnant his entire life turns upside down . he stows away rick suv catch ride his father house . instead going straight into town , rick kills old friend who come town cause problems him . this where storyline bit sketchy . seems ray coleman out prison come back into rick life get his share cash some previous partnership . it never really described how they got said money , only rick better lawyer than other three . huh ? gee , he bank robber ? how drug runner ? what could it ? we given vague answer end movie but never really any more than tidbit information . danny threatened rick then when doesn't work , rick threatens danny father . trick danny changes his story keeps his mouth shut what he saw . this time frank knows something isn't right begins his own sleuthing when police won't help . internet search hits past identities entire story comes light . you'd think police would smart enough simple internet search , but not this movie . plot ok ; suspense lacking . but there some glaring errors kept this movie 5 stars . first off , when rick kills ray coleman his chevy suburban , he stabs him . it stab wound kills him almost instantly . ok , so where blood ? there no blood all leather seat very little ray clothing . fact , rick picks him up drags him into brick factory torch body . ok , so where blood trail ? gee , guess guy no blood him ! next big error body cremated brick factory there no bone fragments or teeth when police searched kiln ? i found bit stretch . so if danny hadn't witnessed this murder , it would perfect crime , right ? if so , then criminals would disposed bodies this way years ! saving grace this movie chemistry actors . john travolta vince vaughn perfect opponents . sweetness teri polo perfect balance wickedness vaughn character . danny nice mix teenage angst lovable child . overall , this above average movie . it predictable right down crash through french doors ending fight scene travolta vaughn . yes , predictable but still enjoyable !	1

+++++ " intolerance jews fact 16th century life , even venice , most powerful liberal city state europe . law jews forced live old walled foundry or `geto ' area city . after sundown gate [ geto ] locked guarded christians . daytime any man leaving [ geto ] wear red hat mark him jew . jews forbidden own property . so they practiced usury , lending money [ ] interest . this against christian law . sophisticated venetians would turn blind eye it but religious fanatics , who hated jews , it matter ... " this how this wonderful movie begins above words printed on-screen so orient viewer . this movie based controversial troubling play " merchant venice " ( written circa 1596 ) william shakespeare ( 1564 1616 ) . main plot this play movie concentrates follows : sixteenth century venice , when christian merchant named antonio ( jeremy irons ) must default large loan jewish moneylender named shylock ( al pacino ) his friend bassanio ( joseph fiennes ) who romantic ambitions rich portia ( lynn collins ) belmont , vengeful shylock demands cruel substitute repayment antonio . movie proceeds we hear these famous words uttered shylock : " he [ antonio ] hath disgraced me ... laughed my losses , mocked my gains , scorned my nation , thwarted my bargains , cooled my friends , heated mine enemies , what his reasons ? i am jew . hath not jew eyes ? hath not jew hands , organs , dimensions , senses , affections , passions ?... if you prick us , we not bleed ? if you tickle us , we not laugh ? if you poison us , we not die ? " shylock continues : " if you wrong us , shall we not revenge ?... if jew wrong christian , what his humility ? revenge . if christian wrong jew , what should his sufferance christian example ? why , revenge ! " aware end movie , you may not know whether you've seen tragedy or comedy ( play officially classified comedy ) , love story or tale hate . its infinite ambiguity , movie play said quintessential shakespeare . also , aware movie entirely elizabethan language . if you not used this kind spoken language , i would strongly recommend you turn closed-captioning . ( dvd , unfortunately , not english subtitles . ) one final caution : there bare-breasted prostitutes appear briefly . they not put movie make it more risqu� but rather add some historical authenticity . venetian law time required all prostitutes bare their breasts because christian authorities concerned rampant homosexuality city . thus , this movie `r ' rating because this ( which i think ludicrous ) . acting this movie word -- fantastic . i surprised this but al pacino thoroughly convincing shylock , very complex role . i also give credit jeremy irons ralph fiennes who fine jobs their roles antonio bassanio respectively . cinematography excellent . movie filmed location venice , veneto ( region north italy ) , luxembourg . background music exquisite . i heard lute , harp , other instruments i'm not familiar . i learned later some music contributed baroque string quartet . ( baroque period art period circa 1600 1750 . ) background vocals mesmerizing . finally , dvd ( one released 2005 ) perfect picture sound quality . it few extras . bottom line : this movie worthy addition bard cinematic cannon . ( 2004 ; 2 hr , 10 min ; wide screen ; 28 scenes ; rated `r ' ) +++++	1
movie i liked critics hard . film great until you get closer ending . i thought ending bit lame " mutant " son not all believable . scary but not totally believable . despite some problems i ending creature , i loved sense mystery , suspense , creepiness i got early film . i can't explain it well , but there something carnivals people who work them little dark criminal . two teenaged couples obviously out night fun . typical teenage stuff . this movie made over 20 years ago , but our culture changed little since then . best part movie me when four teenagers hiding funhouse , they happen witness murder . they become trapped funhouse realize they extreme danger . me , most scary part film when one kids ( who hiding others ) drops his lighter " mutant " his father father son talk murder how fix problem . course gets attention dad he realizes there someone else funhouse ... someone who knows murder . he tries coax them out hiding says he just wants give lighter back . doesn't work , course .	1

this movie brilliant entertaining fresh , but sadly most reviewers this movie totally missed point . if you thought this just romantic comedy , then course you'd think this just run-of-the-mill , predictable movie . if you weren't exposed and/or no concept what hip hop before it crossover period , circa-1990 fake , gimmicky artists no skill like vanilla ice mc hammer who put out anything would sell records , don't watch this movie -- someone else only break it down you later . like amazon.com review ( jeff shannon ) says above ( please read carefully ) , least entertaining aspect this movie dre sidney relationship . gist movie how dre sid relationship written direct parallel commentary music business how hip hop lost its soul when it crossed over became commercial . every scene movie metaphorical attests this commentary . dre sid friendship innocent young kids 1980s parallels birth hip hop its innocent period . dre sid outside ( dating ) relationships parallel hip hop selling out just enough mainstream survive . dre ultimate marriage reece , fake , money-grubbing , status quo symbol , parallel hip hop crossover mainstream going commercial . dre sid hookup end ( pay close attention hotel scene dialogue when sid tells dre she can't review his cd ... dre lines " one moment you say you want me change next you're saying you want me stay same ... " ) . whole scene metaphorical true life debates music fans today ... everyone wants hip hop grow change , yet those unhappy changes ( such overcommercialism rise southern hip hop ) longing " pure days " when rappers real skills put out great music represent their intelligence , their skills their personal experience instead puttin ' out whatever flava-of-the-month style music sell most ( thus , selling out hip hop ) . finally , dre sid hookup official couple angie martinez hot97 like this film writer personal commentary ultimately , hip hop return its roots move forward ( kind like hip hop sankofa concept , looking back/understanding past order move forward ) . like i said , if you don't know what hip hop music pre-1990 , you won't understand half movie thus you won't appreciate what 4 5-star reviewers this movie see its creativity . this film written purpose i hope , despite meager sales , we get more like this one instead stereotypical , dumbed-down stuff hollwyood keeps pushing	1

demetrius gladiators very good movie , classic sense term . many people his time adored victor mature , while critics sometimes claimed he melodramatic , but mature impressively right majority films which he cast . studio system smart way . this case , mature brings drama life almost single-handedly , certainly carries off this cast-of-thousands sequel robe beautifully . mature well suited 50s sword-and-sandal trend , i'd say this film , demille equally good samson delilah , among his best performances period . this film respectable interesting sequel robe , unequivocally worth seeing . what more , i can't agree jay robinson " over top " -- he just fascinating villain he robe , we're lucky more him role this movie . considering robinson became , all accounts , mentally obsessed his character roman emperor these two films rest his life , i'd say this movie even more fascinating regard . robinson one those actors who proves old saying it only takes one stand-out performance secure actor place history forever . robinson performance easily best roman emperor ever committed celluloid up until now , i claudius notwithstanding . short , don't sell this movie short , or you'll worse it . movie tone certainly different robe , but it genuinely satisfying hollywood entertainment fairly high order . budget generous , cast excellent , movie looks very good all most important aspects result . feel free bring popcorn , i'd recommend kleenex well .	1

nutshell : mutiny during failed rebellion re-enacted graphically ! cast comprised people looked part rather than actors , film divided into five acts . each act focused incident graphic images , story line illustrated 1905 uprising , its convulsively violent consequences . power " battleship potemkin " maximized dramatized amplify impact historical incident balancing docu-drama like realism shrewd orchestration visually graphic images timely editing . what its all : save russian proletariat gentle stalinism ? stalin become " general secretary " soviet regime lenin became gravely ill . after lenin death 1924 , stalin commissioned this film , which significant , their depiction czarist government mob baby killing cossacks needed replaced regime would care nurture common peasant . theme salvation via stalinism pervasive effective throughout film . so effective , it also films weakness history not thought much stalin humanity toward russian peasants during his 31 year reign . [ 1922-1953]here specific example propaganda scene [ plot spoiler warning]for instance , depictions russian orthodox priest aboard battleship potemkin , supporting officers who slaughter crewmen refused eat maggot infested meat not believed . fact , priest shown mauling crewmen none other than his crucifix . honestly , such scenes tough swallow maggot infested meat , there many them . very obvious crude stalinist propaganda . bottom line : okay its propaganda -- but .... images theme powerful clear . emotions viewers inevitably provoked . this very good stuff . not honest -- but great cinema nonetheless ! dvd : image entertainment editionincredibly well preserved print eighty-one year old film ! transfer contained excellent video audio elements very clear mostly unflawed picture .	1
scenes marriage swedish film ingmar bergman . me , this one best films ever . it not only captures great story , but it so well . what makes movie so great you relate how they feel , act , generally take care issues . this isn't one those american films where person breaks off someone they start yelling throwing objects them . here , he telling his wife this other lover , she without emotions , just staring off , no real reactions whatsoever , way most would respond . this basically 3 or 5 hour film wife who believes their marriage great/perfect . it later she finds outs perhaps , marriage isn't so great when she listens patient decribe her marriage why she wants divorce . there , wife wants plan trip her husband try improve their marriage . he later says he woman while now , shortly there after , leaves her . after year so , they get together sign divorce papers , which turns out rough end . after some time , they get together again , some way , fall love once again , even though both married other people . there , movies ends . great film ! hard watch some american films now , because most just seem horrible , ways , corny . i'm glad i got see great film like this .	1

i agree one reviewer who said read book ... yes , all means , read book then watch this incredible film adaptation . yes , this film little dated - but aren't we all . it little cheesy spots , sure . but i feel truffaut really bradbury justice especially making sure only things we actually saw print titles books burnt . both book film powerful commentaries society . we really becoming more more society who wants everything spelled out us . all our technology , we allowed our minds , our hearts , our souls grow flaccid weak . we pledge our allegiance things really not serve our spirit ... things slowly gnaw out our insides make us hollow inside . i friend who recently bought home very nice set built bookcases built into wall den . he took sledge hammer them , resurfaced wall , put up his 72 " plasma flatscreen . i almost cried . i guess it because i love read . i guess it because i like feel . i guess it because i truly feel pit my soul this journey we call like such magnificent thing , i am disheartened all callousness we , society , allowed ourselves individually well collectively become . i put up review not too long ago where some people attacked judged my enthusiasm film . it really kind bothered me bit . almost point where i wanted stop writing reviews things i enjoyed wanted others also enjoy . you see what i doing ? i letting other people opinions made weight more validity than my own . that how society crumbles . that how " futuristic society " fahrenheit 451 allowed law establish ban reading . we must allow ourselves rise up out ashes our past decide who we want , what we want , what we want , where we want go . we must this individually we must this collectively . life much too precious simply go auto-pilot . i invite you watch this incredible movie . i invite you see it group friends . i invite you think it , stirred up it , then decide yourself ( while you still ) what kind life you want bring forth . change you wish see world ..	1

i would like begin saying this one most bizarre films i ever experienced my career movie buff . i seen some twist endings , some passionately bad french films , even some stalker films , but nothing compares cinematic genius i just witnessed . bunuel " virgin " , i didn't know what expect coming into this film . i ready anything , but interestingly enough nothing prepare you this film . deeply rooted cinematic symbolism , we watch two very interesting devises used bring forth overall theme this film . two devises i never seen used movie , until now . first obvious . bunuel successfully uses two different actresses play same role conchita . first i thought perhaps it going one those " twin " double-cross films where these two girls used this older wealthy man all his money . i wrong . similar title this film , this film passions desires . it divulges emotion obsession , reaction man someone he desperately sexually desires . mathieu our possible victim this story . while both not most interesting characters ( both flaws troubles ) , they provide some structured characters . mathieu willing give up everything this woman he hardly knows , but physically attracted her . it hard say he loves her , but he lust her . dual role conchita this film used two purposes . first distraction , while second emotion . both conchitas different their own way used push forward story . whenever bunuel needed convey different emotion , he would bring actress best represented emotion . first it confusing , but film progressed you began see less less separate actresses , but instead one character . it impressive how bunuel created this illusion . i mentioned above , there two devises i never seen movie before . i explained above use two women one female role , but second bit subtler . i briefly mentioned it above how these two women ( one character ) used distract . if you pay attention film terrorism big part universe surrounding mathieu . while he pines continually conchita , world around him falling apart . bombings deaths all time high , yet he doesn't really seem notice this . he so caught up conchita it seems like nothing else exists . he oblivious his surroundings . fact , i would go so far say we also oblivious surroundings . bunuel this job keeping our eye focused interchanging women we sometimes forget or miss actions surrounding this film . i believe bunuel trying prove point obsession obscure your vision . it blurs your eyes forces you miss crucial elements your surroundings . it isn't until end when we reminded violently truth surrounding our characters . i felt bunuel slapping me face final scene . i nearly forgotten myself terrorism outside , but easily he reminded me . this spectacular film really opened my eyes completely new way filmmaking . it reminded me some early works favorite director mine francois ozon . both these talented artists their own way creating world emotion , both it some most beautiful strokes their mechanical brush . i would recommend this film anyone willing experience radical , yet provocative filmmaking its best . you impressed . i cannot wait include this film my collection watch over over again . thanks criterion , they provided beautiful packaging this obscure film . grade : ***** out ****	1

this 31 minute holocaust documentary tells you more sufferings jews hitler evil empire , than even 1000 page book same subject matter . this perfect example how excruciatingly inhumane , humanity could . gruesome graphic images captured this documentary beyond any reasonable person imagination . documentary focuses exclusively many atrocities directed third reich jewish during one most turbulent times anti-semitism european history . this documentary may not good study sense it doesn't get into whys why-nots what happened not happen ; however it indeed terrific rendition circumstances surrounding holocaust invokes gigantic appeal conscience those power who apparently end up abusing it . note caution - some graphic footage this documentary tremendously disturbing , so just beware showing this movie children . this perfect examplification human beings ' callous indifference sufferings other human beings	1

this film course now somewhat obscure considering all since time film life christ . jeffery hunter most handsome christ you ever see screen . apostles all clean cut . movie features very colorful clothing catch eye . great musical score miklos roza , which particular favorite classical music fans request radio even today ! gospel rather compressed ministry christ particular . however , not say it ineffective . sermon mount scene actually encapsulated all comprehensive review christian philosophical points boiled down one mass meeting . movie not adherent bible events contains lot fiction , especially respect activity aristocracy romans . it tries tell several stories , such barabbas , roman officer , mary mother christ , john baptist definitely most beautiful salome you ever see dance screen . taking cross , whipping , death , all handled very delicately . not too much blood or grief . jeffery hunter seen after easter rising shown symbolically end very well apostles gathered beach his shadow overwhelms them he tells them depart preach gospel they leave 2 2 . really effective scene movie so entrenched 50s culture . seen this movie child sixties seeing it again now this century , i think it should not too criticized our 20/20 perception now . back then it after all different time culture , one not exist today should viewed perhaps nostalgic way , worth viewing , but don't depend it filling you biblical truth .	1

this album pure energy , pure lyrics , pure beats . everything went right this soundtrack . public enemy seldomly puts out any bad albums . title song this album quot ; he got gamequot ; pretty weak song . beats nice though , but this song leans little towards blues jazz catogorie . only song i disliked out 12 tracks . album starts off song ressurection , track so beautifully produced it sounded way beyond public enemy music . masta killa dropped verse so so tight . track 3 wit krs-one one best , number 5 cool beat . rest tracks just public enemy style . this great album public enemy fan	1
i thought this film title . i wanted french film called le papillon , older gentleman who becomes grandfather-like figure young girl , but i wasn't too careful selected butterfly figuring it english translation title . when i viewed it saw little boy instead little girl , discovered older man teacher not grandfather , dialogue spanish , not french , i realized i wrong title . i decided keep title watch it , discovered beautiful moving film . story begins idyllic time setting : spain days prior fascist revolution . it appears simpler time colorful village life not unlike two french films my mother castle its companion my father glory . story revolves around young boy named moncho his first year school . he taught gentle don gregorio , wise man who also knows importance training young minds . we also see loving older/younger brother relationship develop moncho andrea , budding musician who believes he one saxophone lesson away becoming musical dom juan . he also close friend rocque . whatever teacher cannot teach him , moncho believes rocque andrea . we see moncho grow under his teacher guidance , yet film progresses , we know something terrible happen which occurs when tremors fascist revolt touch their town townspeople become divided based more fear than conviction . film poignant largely because way its innocent beginning changes tragic end , reminding us how strong self preservation , how easily young minds learn hate . i've ordered le papillon know i'll finally see film i wanted see first place , but i'm glad i also butterfly my collection . enjoy !!!	1
although given short shrift few critics who watched it , this worthy effort , marked good acting , direction , technicals , intelligent script . although state undress through much film , kelly lynch given opportunity display full panoply her acting range there essentially only two actors . , so often independent films , all involved opportunity truly creative . desert setting enhanced starkness extreme emotions which viewer exposed .	1

20 years ago , there terrible accident mine valentine day . following year one miners , harry warden , takes terrible revange those responsible accident . since day , there no celebration valentine day little town valentine buff . until now ( 1981 ) . but harry warden seems returned stop celebration . music music quite good , but it doesn't lead film any direction , so it not helping . story recycled , which good , but could much more minimalistic . why not just party let miner kill kids ? trying put twist story " explaining " things seldom very helpful . murderar places human hearts valentine boxes which distasteful but not really scary . variation holiday theme , could bit more focused .	1
i love it when two my favorite actors movie together . when one off screen , you other keep you entertained . when they're screen together , it movie-making its best . plot itself leaves bit desired . film production stop-and-go so long , i heard director changed direction before it finished . my guess some what lost what missing movie , particularly regards understanding benicio character properly . nonetheless , tommy lee jones benicio del toro shine throughou t.p.s. animal lover , i love two leads movie pro-animal too	1
this movie defies normal conventions much storytelling visually . plot easy follow but real meat movie contained visual scenes . much like foreign films , cell much more ambiguous non literal than mainstream american films . you could even say plot pedistrian cliche , but heart movie how visuals executed . you drawn into serial killer , carl mind . d'onofrio persona disappears you left madman lost , vulnerable abused human . vince vaughn compelling enough carry his scenes doesn't overact . . lo also low key although i don't think she convey complexities her character . she her job but doesn't go deep enough make it outstanding performance . beware strong violent images . if you stomach it though , you may see original , beautifully designed film . i'd rather see gore this context rather than low brow slasher/horror type flicks	1
great actors/acting . seen it previous purchase wanted add my collection . lots twists turns	1

few reviewers seem disappointed perplexed this movie " unresolved " ending , all i say " i felt same way when i first saw this masterpiece " . advice : watch it commentary after you see film then wait couple weeks watch it again , you blown away . synopsis : rich girl travels some friends yacht , they stop island , she disappears . one her friends goes searching her missing girls boyfriend . you see way movie studio or viewer today might say this film . yet it isn't really . it really " adventure " or quest young woman ( rich girls friend ) into full womanhood . i remember watching this film one day getting end thinking " i don't get it " . whirlwind questions came mind , then i thought i should watch it commentary , see if would help . it . imagery so well explained you think how it you didn't see . way director used nature say so much his characters . examples : island they all disembark dry lifeless lives they all live . boyfriend always seems surrounded background incredible architecture , yet he sold out his dream build great things . close-up rich girl boy-toy sex , you tell she couldn't care less . last scene where broken boy-toys side screen all you see blank wall , but our heroines side there volcano . i mean how you go wrong scenes like these ? those just few . but then again you go this film mentality it not just bunch nonsense screen like unfortunately we see too much today . you actually watching work art , like all works art different people different points view . so give it chance don't go thinking you find easy answers questions it makes . life full questions , would it real art if it didn't make you ponder these questions	1

if you think any s**t walt disney made pinnacle american animation , think again !! heavy metal crushes everything adolf disney made ( he anti-semetic , hence " adolf " ) . i don't know why this only gets 4 star average while there virtually no criticism overrated pile dogs**t nightmare before christmas ( tim burton sucks ) . i recommend this fans alternative animation . this movie , this guy lands space give his daughter green orb , which absorbs him tells girl its stories how it wreaked havoc throughout galaxy . there many different worlds ranging futuristic city hover cars world reminiscent mayan civilization . however , all them , there lots violence , profanity , bare female flesh , tour de force guy his late-teens . soundtrack great , it songs groups like black sabbath , blue oyster cult , devo , grand funk railroad . if you want something different terms animation , this you . if you're die-hard disney fanatic , stear clear this !!	1

even if you haven't read book you'll probably get message this film . most ideas filtered into consciousness western man , especially phrase big brother watching you . surely everyone knows what this means . cast perfect : burton , cusack , hamilton , hurt seem fit their parts exactly . it shock told location shots filmed areas london actually existence 1984 . i recognized battersea power station , london university senate house . those places reflect totalitarianism 1930s , decade produced wwii . book written 1948 ( obviously ) , which only 3 years after ending war . fact conditions post-war britain almost worse than during war itself . austerity watchword . rationing prevailed . bombsite rubble everywhere london . russia , former ally , now enemy . orwell working bbc , he must developed sensitivity potential ways which public could deceived manipulated . it didn't take much projecting imagine how things threatened develop , especially history pre-war communist show-trials executions , rantings nazi oratory draw . all this very well depicted film . warning book these things weren't happening eurasia ( nazi germany ) or eastasia ( russia ) but oceania ( us uk ) . airstrip one uk re-named : place transatlantic bombers land take off . national anthem titled : oceania , ' tis thee . so orwell satire targeting home territory . threat everchanging enemy meant way keep home population under control . vision utterly bleak . however , if film flaw , it visual shabbiness almost too much . it just little over top : if settings fraction less threadbare brutal , then thoughtcrime its cure could perhaps even more chilling . difficult tell . john hurt --- what name part .	1

i bought this movie when i serious vampire-story kick , it got here kick waneing . so i put off watching it , because frankly cover looks like every other silly sex-kittens-and-bloodsuckers vamp flick out there , just today teenagers instead last decade teenagers . i nothing against s-k -- b-s films , but i specific mood want watch them . today , i decided get off my behind ( or rather , sit * * my behind ... ) , stop stalling because i afraid how bad it might , actually watch it . my expectations very , very low . i pleasantly surprised . it fairly well - characters mostly hold together . bits where they go all " natural born killers " filming lame every other film that used them , but rest decently competently acted . all all , it pretty darn good job . they could gone screwed it up but they didn't . hollywood , that major achievement . if i say anything plot i might give something away , would actually shame , because there sort plot it doesn't go strictly according standard script . it sticks close involve bunch pretty , pimple-free early twenties kiddies wearing little possible but still ; it manages few shreds originality . it maintains what integrity it while conforming formula script pretty kids bad situation vampires .	1

honors thoughtful well little " slice life " moral we've all heard before : what makes you happy take time live your life . director alex keshishian screenwriter william mastrosimone , however , don't knock you over head its theme and/or morals . there some scenes where you're expecting probable happen they don't: e.g. , after simon cooks gorky , rooster , you expect his master furious --- when simon finally meets up son he abandoned , you expect some kind tearful reunion ---- you certainly think monty going graduate honors . end results these scenes , however , avoid usual cliche . joe pesci delightfully understated his role , although he never really becomes coochy coo loveable , you understand his pains shortcomings ; brendan fraser starts out pretty snooty insufferable but he matures his relationship both pesci moira kelly ( who delightful courtney ) , fraser becomes more sympathetic character ; patrick dempsey adds some lightweight humor gorky master , josh hamilton eschews usual pain butt role believable touching change hear t.t he movie definitely manipulative , but its heart right place its cast takes it seriously , so it ends up charming little film strong reaffirmation human spirit	1

bollywood loves churn out action films , but indians could learn some lessons jewish-american cartel hollywood concerning story construction this classic sport melodrama presented traditional three act format - three 40-minute blocks produce 2-hour movie . much brilliantly construction film its story . opening scene , antagonist introduced hooks viewer when she reveals premise plot - rotten season where attendance falls below 800,000 year allow her escape her lease city relocate her recently inherited cleveland indians baseball team miami , so she invited has-beens screwballs training camp aim composing team stinks enough cause attendance drop . remainder scenes first act introduce protagonist ( catcher played tom beringer ) all main characters : team coach , born-again pitcher , voodoo man , pretty boy , willy mays hayes , wild thing . nice subplots tensions introduced these unforgettable characters , after which main subplot presented catcher his ex-fiancee . all these characters no idea team new owner expects them stink - they're all playing coaching determination . but act one ends them playing their first game losing 9-0 . act two opens scene office where owner complaining general manager team bad , but it doesn't stink . she complains there even some improvement . so she increases complications characters taking away their perks making them fly propeller plane rather than jet . while they continue lose , subplots tensions continue characters . however , they also continue show improvement especially when coach notices wild thing pitching would improve if he wore glasses . owner responds more complications - their propeller plane replaced bus . end act two , their record 60 wins 61 losses . that when plot given its turning point - coach finds out none them job baseball after season ends because they hired lose . after coach shares this players , catcher says there only one option available them - win whole darn thing ( winners , they could work team next season ) . players need 32 victories stay baseball after this season . act three begins 31 victories later when they play yankees championship , who they've struggled against all season . this act 41 minutes inning-by-inning action , conflict , suspense . melodramatic fashion , they win ! it awesome climax succession dramatic suspense scenes . hollywood subplot fashion , catcher gets his girl	1

reviewer rightly pointed out , this film one most influential films cinema history . masterpiece editing , cinematography , all around directing . it shame , then , because subject matter - much like communism " battleship potemkin " racism " birth nation " - it film doomed always taboo , guilty pleasure film buffs . i sincerely doubt it kind movie you'd watch your girlfriend , but historical piece it still recommended . 1934 : nazi party , now control germany , holds party rally nuremburg . leni riefenstahl hired adolf hitler film it " documentary " show young germans . it opens shots clouds , flying over city nuremburg , finally showing adolf hitler plane landing . then it collection cheering crowds , hitler youth festivals , military parades ... lots military parades . it , however , feast eyes . riefenstahl sees it every single shot serves purpose , every scene flows together nicely . some my personal favorite sequences include : 1 ) cat looking down hitler car it passes ; 2 ) addressing workers ; 3 ) great bit cutting which men bring their torches together close , we cut firework going off . most amusing , course , propaganda value film . there long sequence beginning showing hitler youth laughing , playing , eating food just young boys . watching scenes like this makes one almost think , " wow , it must've cool nazi ! " this complex , fact , still exists today , which people watch documentaries may intended or unintended falsehoods readily believe it . this film important three reasons . first , it obviously classic if not respected then should least studied terms filming . second , it outstanding piece history , showing regime seduced nation would eventually move onto its own destruction . third , it important see nazis they wanted see themselves , realize how they could seduced whole nation . not everything out hitler mouth " purge jews . " dr. anthony santoro explains his commentary ( which , way , excellent listen , especially when he points out few bloopers ) germany just gone through their own great depression lived under chaos weimar republic . this film meant show germans , " look us now : we united , we strong - we better than ever ! " most all , it faith party . santoro makes excellent observation german army itself only two or three minutes film ; rest units paramilitary units under direct control nazis . film portrays united germany not mere power german people , but under leadership direction one man : adolf hitler . some people sensitive subject matter , so this film may not them . however , if you want see history , or you're interested examining filmmaking ... or you're just curious , i would definately suggest watching it .	1
this amazing service ! only 2 bucks i watch what i like moment . this case it hg wells . great biography	1
great military movie . it shows what airmen during vietnam war ( or american war , if you're reading this vietnam ) wanted - take fight enemy . great wish airmen come true big screen . retired air force member , i laugh all naval antics shore leave because today military makes them verboten . carrier landings bars angeles city or olongapo no longer exist since us military ordered out there . still , guys great fun letting loose this movie then faced death when time came . scene where willem dafoe his pilot avionics failure , it made me sit edge my seat , because former avionics technician who worked f-16s , i could feel fear subtle panic they facing during battle . i always ensured my avionics components worked so our aircrews would not experience sensation . note : captain , who trying aircrew disobeying orders , fred dalton thompson ; he wasn't mentioned credits some reason . great movie storyline , superb antics troops shore leave , really cool aerial footage . must add your war film collection	1
best way describe best best 3 4 say they solid action films nice display martial arts spread evenly throughout each one . phillip rhee terrific job pulling off punches , kicks , throws great mastery . fight sequences very believable exciting fun watch . most fights phillip rhee against multiple attackers , these scenes all very well . camera angles offer good glimpses each technique hits all look quite real . rhee definitely very adept martial artist , it very clear screen he knows what he doing . however , those you expecting intricate one one fights jet li/jackie chan hong kong style you may disappointed . but if you're merely looking quick paced action story well written enough serve links action sequences featuring actors who actually act , you'll happy checking this dvd out . it great , solid action fun , i would recommend it , especially fans best best best best 2 . best part you get two films one dvd , so you really can't go wrong here . one last thing : gina gershon best best 3 . girl not only great looker , but she very fine actress well . so not only you get great action , decent story good acting , you get great looking women too . i highly recommend this film	1

playboy asks why this movie hasn't become cult classic . i'll tell you . first all , painting cover not look like actual woman film . one or two reviewers liked way she looks . okay , each his own , but don't surprised if you find her unattractive . second , nudity . no , she not nude all time . nor half time . nor fourth time . nor ... she nude few seconds now then . no more than any other movie . third , movie only 79 minutes , first four them skippable . movie mostly man fighting neanderthal survivor . both behave more childishly than primitively . you'll see more convincing behavior clan cave bear . there no explicit sex scenes . also , no effective sex scenes any kind . even fight scenes disappointing . oh , i mention dialogue joke ? bottom line : almost every viewer , this movie not worth watching even once .	1
reading other reviews this film , it certainl seems if nobody really luke warm young guns . it either loved because it relatively accurate or disliked because it so fictional . or viewer enjoys it because estevez other cast members solid or it disliked because it " brat pack " set 1880 new mexico . well , let me throw out my 2 cents . firstly , i've read alot books billy kid while movie not 100% accuarate , it relatively close . i'm going alittle bit my memory here , but i don't recall singlen incident movie complete piece fiction . billy taken john tunstall - english gentleman , who john chisum , " butting heads " murphy -dolan faction lincoln , new mexico . this small group who worked tunstall eventually become deputized regulators who , unfortunately , killed sheriff brady after , became wanted men themselves . now i read one review said kid essentially " loner " his involvement " gang " regulators couldn't more wrong . well , this reviewer clearly doesn't know very much billy kid . kid may many bad qualities ( personally i don't think he ) , but disloyalty not one them . fact , his loyalty john tunstall his decision avenge murder his boss - one man who really gave bonney home - eventually cost him his lfe . there would many opportunities very early lincoln county war kid get out area , but he chose not . estevez depiction kid wasn't far off mark . it said he always smile his face didn't carry gudge too long . but make no mistake - he cold-blooded killer any who resided west late 1800 . fact exception bell , deputy who guarding him who chose resist kid when he retrieved gun left him privy , i don't think kid killed single person who didn't deserve it or wasn't trying kill kid himself . regulators interesting assortment characters i think actors who portrayed them pulled it offreasonably well . today , i would problem seeing charlie sheen dick brewer - leader regulators - but when this film made , he fine . jack palance his usual great self his portrayal murphy , " bad " guy who responsible tunstall murder . terrance stamp fine tunstall - fact , he very convincing man who commanded such loyalty few very young men died avenge his death . keifer sutherland very entertaing doc scurlock . fact , i can't think anybody who really didn't stand out their performance . this movie not red river or man who shot liberty valance - it never going mentioned when great westerns all time discussed . but like silverado , example , it very , very entertaining provides reasonably realistic depiction one west most enduring characterts - billy kid .	1
although i'm labeled " horror buff " , i just write review this film depicting life famed dr. dian fossey . heads up warner brothers giving us glimpse into world woman who ultimately gave her life save protect few mountain gorillas remaining africa . dian devoted 18 years her life researching understanding these wonderful primates . this film shows dian vunerable side her determined side what ever it took save gorillas who supposed protected parks . sigourney weaver shines her role perfect choice this movie . she approached it reckless abandon . although dian lost her life trying save remaining gorillas , we get see how one person responsible doing so much gorillas . heartwarming scenes her her beloved digit , heartbreaking scenes like when she turn over pucker , infant gorilla she nursed back health , zoo horrible death digit , this movie captivates you beginning end . anyone who interested few remaining mountain gorillas , this movie really open your eyes make you route dian . although tragic ending dian death burial next digit , it true love story not only her bob campbell , but her gorillas she loved so much . i wish i could give this movie more than 5 stars !! definetly movie own cherish ... her memory never forgotten her work carries thru dian fossey gorilla fund international this day	1
this movie touched me so many ways . see talented sigourney weaver play part dian fossey treat . raw emotion conveyed when " dian " goes after vanvecton stolen baby gorilla still gives me shivers . you see fury portrayed weaver eyes .	1
relic movie form suspenseful entertaining romp through one most interesting locations pseudo-techno-thriller . first viewing , there many good elements gritty cop homicide investigation meets intelligent yet homicidal creature flick . archetype evil universal constant all cultures no matter how primitive coupled innate look superstition legend all cultures perfect mixture plot setting make this enjoyable movie . i say " first viewing " , because quite bit movie devoted figuring out " what " going " why " . once you learn reason , movie shifts more standard horror survival role until end where it reverts back trying explain itself . there several entirely enjoyable sequences plain old scariness tension if you able successfully suspend your disbelief go ride . fact , several these scenes enojoyable enough their own cause me watch them over over time time . however , disclaimer fans douglas preston lincoln childs ( like myself ) this not exact same plot , ending , character development ( or even all major characters ) novel(s ) movie based . movie suffers rushed pace several " by-the-book " horror movie cliches . however , if you not planning reading books looking one-time enjoyable thriller , or enjoy reading want compare notes , i would highly recommend this one it just enough different unique .	1
gritty little film bare-knuckles fighting champion coming terms his sexuality . this little indie feels becomes , something far more than routine gay love story big , impressive performances everyone involved . roger daltry creepy delicious hoot gay , aging , vain , bitter , music producer trying retain illusion youth beauty . it may his best acting performance yet . streetfighter , craig , steve bell simply terrific , believably combining into cohesive entity numerous seemingly disparate qualities : tough street urchin exterior , desire better life , realist his capabilities , charmingly na�ve , more than bit prone towards hotheaded violence . his small town blackpool , he meets falls music producer matt ( ian rose ) before long finds himself moving matt his roommate , disturbing , ultra co-dependent , paula , who takes instant dislike craig . what could meander into either soft-core porn or worse , stagnation soap opera , deftly avoided director oremland , who believes these characters blessed cast same . not without its problems " like it " nonetheless flies far above trite-too-cuteness often associated gay cinema . it successfully entirely avoids oversentimentalizing its subject , remaining gritty true throughout its storytelling .	1

admittedly this film propaganda produced during occupation fascist germany , but it very educational explaining why more americans probably killed french during wwii than saved them . but this film shows us what vichy government producing way propaganda , not what germans made them . including northern africa campaign serious battles where allied forces attacked french military loyal petain vichy government , well millions frenchmen who assisted nazi war machine their munitions factories , there no question french more enemy allies than they would ever willing admit today . anyone who thinks french diplomatic treachery new phenomenon war against islamofascism , they should see this film . no wonder chabrol widely condemned france shining light this ugly chapter french history . it something any nation should ashamed . but unfortunately they learned nothing their ignominy well documented their own propagandists . hollywood great job fooling world into thinking " free french " majority fighting german occupation , but fact vast majority supported petain his fellow collaborators until tide turning favor allies . but what new ? if you interested this subject robert paxton book " vichy france " even more eye opener .	1

professionalsi recently watched rerun this entertaining action-packed movie cable tv . i remember i watched it theatre during late 60 while i still young college student . it my second movie lee marvin lead cast . first point blank . since then , i always impressed him seen most his action movies , including dirty dozen . professionals definitely one kind movie which i truly say : they don't make them like this anymore ! yes , me , it truly great western classic . it relatively simple plot terrific story , even though there some twists surprises right through very end : four solders fortune , each regarded specialist his own chosen field , hand-picked rich texan businessman rescue his wife , who captured mexican rebels . ransom us$ 100,000 . setting aftermath mexican revolution . four soldiers fortune rico ( lee marvin ) , cool principled tactician gunnery expert ( he really cool his pump shot-gun ); bill ( burt lancaster ) , wise-cracking adventurer dynamite expert ; hans ( robert ryan ) , sensitive compassionate wrangler ; jake ( woody stroke ) , sharp scout/tracker archery expert . it obvious these brave men who lived their tactical expertise sharp instincts . they paid handsomely - us$ 10,000 per head - carry out mission . vast scenery movie magnificent : colourful rocks , barren desert rugged terrains . against this enchanting backdrop , many action sequences took place , four specialists skillfully out-manoeuvre bunch mexican desert marauders /or rebels . dialogue often crisp witty . there some very memorable lines e.g. bill putting load dynamite rock , he said others : " you light this fuse , you got thirty seconds run like hell , then dynamite - not faith - move mountains into this pass . peace ! brothers . " most cruel scene when four specialists witnessed gang mexican rebels , led raza ( jack palance ) massacred train load mexican soldiers . [ movie , bill explained hans rationale rebels ' merciless attack . soldiers sadistic torturers . ] most exciting part movie probably surprise attack , planned military precision , raza fortress rescue mrs grant ( claudia cardinale ) . it this scene rico bill , seemingly bewildered , began realise something wrong . their astonishment , mrs grant turned out raza mistress . they caught moral dilemma : rico bill apparently fought alongside raza during mexican revolution . both respected raza his ideals . other hand , they honour their contract letter rich texan businessman , mr grant ( ralph bellamy ) . rico quickly stopped bill killing raza eventually rescued mrs grant , raza his rebels hot their heels . ensuing scenes beautifully choreographed bill set out diversionary measure slow down their pursuit , while rico , hans jake rebellious mrs grant took off texas via different route . most touching climactic scene movie actually closing scene , when rico , hans , jake mrs grant eventually crossed border into texas rendervous mr grant his men . next scene showed bill appeared out trail dust rendervous wounded raza . mrs grant rushed forward raza falling into her embrace . mr grant then told rico , bill , hans jake they fulfilled their contract asked them leave . instead , amidst short scuffle mr grant men , they quickly put wounded raza wagon mrs grant taking off into mexico . they then rode off into sunset , their professional code honour intact . i really enjoyed watching this entertaining action-packed movie once again . four specialist-characters played very well movie , especially lee marvin rico burt lancaster bill who stood out . jack palance , fine actor ( i enjoyed watching him bronk tv series ) , raza his part well too . claudia cardinale mrs grant provided some eye candy movie .	1

i want give toys 5 stars , it one my favorite movies , but something it makes me say it only 4 star movie . i'm not sure what it . continuity seems bit jumpy parts , but just because film so imaginative fantastic , continuity doesn't really seem matter . imaginative visuals alone make movie great . it doesn't need anything else . this movie high quality all way . i recommend everybody see it least once . i think it perfect format . it perfect movie screen , but wouldn't work all if it book . it artistic endeavor uses strengths its format produce best entertainment possible . watch it , just soak its creativity	1

perhaps they should released this film two installments , like tarantino " kill bill " series . course only thing it common qt film exquisite blonde leading lady . like many french films , there just overabundance random , pointless " quasi-journalistic " everyday stuff should left cutting room floor because they nothing move plot , develop main characters , or expound underlying theme . my guesstimation good hour could cut this movie it would still very good ( i wouldn't cut out any ms. beart divine nude scenes course , would sacriledge ) . this " art " film literal sense word : you get see not only psychological/inspirational/interpersonal process painting human , but also nitty gritty physical/craft side well . if you generous interest such things you'll no doubt savor every one film 240 minutes . if not , i suggest either sitting down pot strong coffee or seeing it 2-3 sittings	1
i always loved cross-overs , especially animation . first teamup batman superman expected : filled tension both over lois lane , especially way things . both heroes take some time find some footing each other , learning work together before their super-villains try take them out . this character development accomplished amazing degree ; watching movie you could really feel emotions coming them ! why voice-actors get little respect this country ? there should award them specifically . kevin conroy always batman my mind , mark hamil joker . even tim daly fine job superman . dana delany lois lane always terrific makes this lois sexy personable . animation superb , it almost good some japanese animation . batman " cartoons " far best american animation i've ever seen . batman brought best out superman , joker , well , always scene-stealing ever . i never felt lex luthor much super villain , no offense those who like lex superman world . i mean , he ruthless genius all , but he no joker ! one character i felt sorry mercy ( lex assistant ) geez , she got beat up lot this episode ( harley , batman) ! unfortunately , music not good it could , considering this first meeting man steel caped crusader . it should more intense fiery . oh well , otherwise , i no complaints . whenever superman crosses over batman world , he becomes better hero .	1

wow . this movie bad . but it good laugh if you're mood some brainless fun . patrick bergen gives one great over-the-top performances all time psycho husband . among many major plot holes : hubby smacks julia because he thought she checking out their new neighbor his boat . then few days later he arranging them both go sailing same guy , his boat ! ( wouldn't psychotically jealous husband try keep his wife away man he thinks she lusting after ? )also , fact she would fake her drowning ocean - but flush her wedding ring ( halfway ) down toilet - not smartest move say least . might wanna just ditch ring ocean while you're faking your own death next time , julia ! gotta admit though , i loved psycho hubby would sneak into julia house actually take time rearrange cans cupboard before he hides . what neat freak . final plot hole involves her new boyfriend iowa , who would likely more interested patrick bergen than julia , if you know what i'm saying	1

i saw few scenes couldn't even continue watching . i like lot charles bronson movies . examples include " death hunt , " 80s " death wish " series , " white buffalo . " but his acting this movie unrealistic . he not act like real apache . bronson seems overdo it " stoic . " relative i watched few scenes just switched channels . bronson out his element trying portray real apache . paul newman much more realistic job when he portrays apache-raised white man " hombre , " which i purchased amazon . i applaud bronson trying portray movie more sympathetic plight apaches trying avoid reservation confinement 1880s . given time period , perhaps bronson should hired roman gabriel instead . he realistic job portraying cherokee indian " undefeated , " which also released around same time ( give or take couple years )	1

this fantastic film , writing directing score acting . peter gallagher superb conveying torment guilt felt widowed husband . this situation occurs all over world all time-losing loved one probably most trying event any person ever go through . it perfectly paced . david kelley such great writer , it just joy let him take you this ride . people compare this film play too much . they're completely different , theater much more dialogue , film much more visual . i read play after seeing movie first , although i'm always tainted what i see first , i still feel film better . characters aren't shallow film-they're just what needed how many them there . i can't imagine what it like lose someone you love . i'm sure i someday , but after watching this film you'll see how it drive someone nearly mad trying move their lives . beautiful achievement	1

after all , this very simple : you should this if phil hartman made you laugh . yes , some reviewers correct , this dvd could better . maybe there missing , funnier , sketches ; maybe finale too romantic ; maybe ... ( that why it gets 4 star rating me ) . but still , this make you laugh remember good old phil . among others , you find him impersonating bill clinton , frank sinatra , phil donahue , alm . stockdale , donald trump , jesus , barbara bush , frankenstein , ronald reagan ed mcmahon . he also appears unfrozen caveman lawyer , russian weightlifter , anal retentive chef , other funny characters . again , if you hartman fan miss him , get this . it might not perfect but it good enough . hopefully they make second dvd more sketches	1

this typical kind entertaining 1950s adventure film all family , kind " they don't make anymore " . so if you liked " elephant walk " ( 1954 ) or " king solomon mines " ( 1950 ) , this one most definitely you ! what stands out , imo , besides special effects ( good 1954 ) scenes dealing marabunta invasion , great chemistry sultry , elegant , appealing eleanor parker ( joanna leiningen ) , her prettiest most ladylike , but same time , full passion , ardour desire love real man ... there he , charlton heston ( leiningen ) , peak his macho-man magnetism ladies ( my mother told me she absolutelly swooned over him around time he made this film ) . he conveys very well character contradictions his insecurities man his desire this wondrous woman ( parker ) , chosen his wife his brother . first part film plenty scenes fully display , elegantly 1950s style , sexual tension characters played both leads . they make one handsomest couples ever paired . william conrad ( " jake fatman " fame ) good friendly comissioner . abraham sofaer plays similar role than " elephant walk " , but this time more sympathetic towards heroine . some footage must filmed location , but almost all scenes involving leading players obviously filmed paramount backlot . good entertainment ! dvd no extras though . print quality very good !	1

divergence opinion among reviewers regarding this film interests me - reflects changes media itself undergone , inspiring me add my bit dialog here what its worth . first , i confess not seen dvd . i saw under capricorn 20 years ago nuart , revival theatre los angeles , where it played late night feature double-bill strangers train packed house . showing memorable . middle film , tension absorbed audience point where you could literally heard pin drop there - cliche goes . feeling truly amazing - energy watching one great cinematic masterpieces - under capricorn , great it - hardly one greatest film masterpieces . yet , many reviewers here would surprised know surprising number most respected critics consider this rather musty treasure golden age technicolor - 1945-55 - one hitchcock greatest achievements ! part problem " action " this " costume drama " hails age when ne plus ultra special effects stuff like charlton heston parting red sea ten commandments ( several years after 1949 release this film ) . there really no viable action speak film - which , if films academic subtitles , could called : under capricorn : hitch meets henry james . really , it jamesian novel film , before movies james ' novels came into vogue , although heiress , one most lauded popular films 1949 , hollywood first major adaptation james novel . one see flashes under capricorn more droll moments french new wave cinema 1960 - many whose makers nursed hitchcock . but , calling this rather serious film merely slow-paced would euphemistic . film bombed box office back 1949 , would probably not fare much better , if well , today . then what exactly earned this glorified rather messy soap plaudits some most selective critics , enduring cult following , standing ovations revival showings ? not storyline , trite even melodramatic 1940s . not visuals . there not whole lot commend under capricorn any technical category . what great , making film appear larger than perhaps it , surfeit elusive combination awesome acting on-screen chemistry ( could it hitch really great director actors some claimed ? ) . these actors don't need script or props - , truth , they don't get much either , yet - they cast big-time spell . other reviewers concentrated performances central characters - beautiful , strained couple - played joseph cotten , gorgeous ingrid bergman one her most fetching screen appearances - if her character , played hilt , seemingly somewhat vapid heart . these seasoned pros brilliant , subtlety their portrayals , which their characters show truly lifelike , complete unconsciousness what going around them , their bittersweet devotion each other , catalyzes dramatic tension . but center stage this film belongs without doubt , moral battle it evolves protagonist antagonist drama , played respectively magnificent michael wilding , what must simply called larger than life performance , " aunt clary boy " who comes australia " make his fortune " , great british heavy , margaret leighton . action here , which unfold - moral . under capricorn , essence , old fashioned morality play , wilding character , urbane , polished deeper sense , puts `shining armor ' altruism engages furious , yet utterly muted combat , leighton . latter flawlessly projects probably less twenty minutes screen time one great evils age , character fueled entirely envy , desperate , nasty have-not , little or no formal education , utterly lost fury her blindly narrow , furtive , conditioned scheming . escalation this conflict gives film its noted ballast . moral extremes us played out against usual banal , superficial , prosaic social contexts , ponderously crafted sets , costumes finally retired , our real faces revealed what they . wilding character says bergman his incredible farewell scene : " i suppose i'll first man who ever went australia , not return fortune " , she never know how much he loved her , how much he'd sacrificed . sublime .	1
i consider myself pretty big horror fan . i enjoy many different kinds horror movies usually find one or two things movie make it worth watching . sometimes it actor , sometimes it just one gory scene , sometimes it atmosphere . like i said , i usually find something enjoy horror movie no matter how bad it . sadly , i can't say same my friends or other horror " fans " i've met . most time they're typical horror fans who hate anything isn't serious . personally i think it self image thing most people . they're afriad someone might mistake them " mainstream " or corny when it comes down their horror opinion . if you judge horror movie weather or not it scared crap out you , most time your going left high dry . horror movies come many styles , key understand just enjoy ride . friday 13th part viii - jason takes manhattan one those few 1980 gems i hold close my heart . it classic example how dark gritty 80 horror scene back then . jason take manhattan chop full dirty , brooding scenes city it really helps set stage jason what he best ! chop , hack stab his young victems ! looking plot ? you won't find one here ! this your basic big hair , bad acting , 1980 slasher fest ! nothing movie corny , back when they made film thought serious perspective . times change ideas change . sure it might outdated but it classic my book . long live jason voorhees !	1
movie good story it it action pack begining end . i like all people play it . this one those movies you sure enjoy whole way though . punisher worth buy	1
amazing film , much less humor than your average kung fu flick . film brilliant scenes physical strength when san te training excellent fight scenes towards end . also much deeper story . i definetly recomend this film ( one best genre ) , but maybe not this version . i myself got vhs version , what i tell these reviews , its good , if not better than quality this dvd	1

this short finds stan ollie hapless stable boys who doing their job usual incompetence when they hear valuable blue boy stolen . they resolve ones bring him back claim reward , since they know blue boy name one horses stable . millionaire whose mansion they arrive throws them down key tells them take blue boy inside . he can't come down person because he middle bath . first stan questions wisdom this , but ollie tells him what man says goes . both baffled when millionaire tells them put blue boy piano says he always up there , but resolve get down it right away . this illustrates their childlike innocence ; first they question seemingly bizarre request , but ultimately go it utmost seriousness . there also racy ( time ) sight gag when ollie falls top nude female statue breaks it , putting it back together again middle piece facing wrong direction . gentleman he , ollie puts his jacket over middle section he picks it up puts it back where he thinks it belongs , but since he obviously can't see which side which , it goes wrong . he doesn't think he this ; he explains stan statue looks way because millionaires eccentric twisted , not like other people , things odd ways . however , police discovered real blue boy before horse came mansion , deliver it mansion after horse finally put top piano . millionaire mother also arrived police , shocked flabbergasted see horse emerge behind curtain . furious , owner takes off after stan , ollie , horse , but ends up shooting policeman instead . there number funny gags titlecards , though i wouldn't consider this one their strongest or funniest , i would say it one their strongest second-tier silents	1
ohh no , please mr. corny demon-thing , don't hurt me ! this movie just seemed really suck . while it scare me ( mainly because only thing scary this movie monster growl , then you see monster feel better ) it still stunk usual smell b-rated monster flicks . watching such flicks almost hobby mine , i'd say , triple threat match among this monster ( whose name forgotten or not even mentioned ) , rawhead rex , grim ( similarly named film ) , i'd say rawhead would go all way , but going back movie , it pretty cheesey what all ho-hum acting , ho-hum story , ho-hum characters . i advise you stay away this movie . just ignore it maybe it'll go away	1
it fun watch first episode scooby doo ( high rise hair raiser ) my computer download my kids . we go back watch it time time . i am glad amazon gave me this free download , so i could try this feature	1

nyc living downtown 80s , i found this movie true nyc experience new year eve exception never able find taxi . i love cameo david johansen bartender well . it very fun-filled movie	1
storyline movie simple one : two soldiers captured people who live mountains . leader people mountains wants trade them his son , who prison . so leader tells two captured men write their mothers tell them come get them they make deal , so so forth . movie not one greatest movies i seen , but it not terrible piece . ending great completely unexpected . , i'm not sure if it just me , but plot character motivation seemed derived viewer common sense rather than any real motive movie . example older soldier kills sheep herder ; whole exchange seems like something out monty python . throughout movie there sense humor , me person i watched it laughing hysterically few scenes ( most notable when prisoners get drunk ) random times throughout . overall film gave off surrealist feel . it never quite seemed real all . exchanges characters just keep getting more more unrealistic ( i'm not sure if writer planned or not , but it seem lag near end ) . movie definitely loses points front . also there never seemed any real connection things . beginning threw me off , when they attacked them brought them back horses threw me off . it somewhat difficult get into movie , but once it got going it easier watch , then it drug then it over . not recipe success my eyes . although i'm not sure if way russian cinema , but certainly isn't way american cinema runs , least not kind deemed good quality . but overall i would recommend watching it , it good movie . but sure you're watching it someone else so you able laugh them share few raised eyebrows plot how doesn't seem realistic .	1
well , lot said , but myself , i not really preapred watch this movie my 7 year old . i think he handled it pretty well , but this not movie children , specifically . you really not want go sleep right after this movie . make some time watch something else . tricky part cartoon used here make 100% wwii movie . you think you watching anime , but movie could made any other media , such poignant experience same . moreover , there very little action this movie . this movie not you , if you think war necessary evil , unless you ready change your mind . war never , never , never , necessary . if you think americans fought " good " war ( wwii , course ) , again , watch this only if you ready bend your vision little , or lot . fire-storming big metropolis no military value , no matter who bombing whom . fire-storming crime agains humanity , just like nazi gas chambers , russian concentration camps ( gulags ) . thankfully , movie spares us atomic bombing japan , maybe greatest war crime ever perpetrated . but , honest , this movie really not touch politics , or historic revisionisms . it really simply shows you sad story two orfans , trying survive defeated japan , end world war ii . you cannot watch this your kids . you watch it your little man , or woman	1
dr smith robot go hog wild , switching personalities swapping insults . this great episode	1
this 1999 film directed istvan szabo , although three hours long , lot going it . set hungary movie covers three generations hungarian jewish family , sonnenscheins . late 19th century , ignatz ; his brother gustave his adopted sister hannah ; who his natural cousin whom he marries , change their names " sors " order " assimilate " into hungarian society . ignatz son adam even converts roman catholicism wins medal fencing 1936 olympics . after silently witnessing his father die hands nazis , third generation sonnenschein/sors son ivan attempts avenge his father death joining stalin communist party . ralph fiennes ( lately " constant gardener " ) plays all three ignantz/adam/ivan characters through three generations it admirably . young hannah played jennifer ehle ; older hannah rosemary harris , mother ehle real life . william hurt plays ivan friend knorr . both score filming beautifully . many war concentration camp scenes shot black white . sad theme easily stated . eyes oppressors it matters not if you change your name or not . if you choose hate whole nation people because who they , nothing stop you . even though film all awfulness anti-semitism , there sunshine here resiliant character hannah who " breathed freely " always looked beautiful photograph . even through three hours long , this film well worth your time , both all-to-relevant theme fine acting	1

one robin williams more sentimental films , what dreams may come universally hated held up example just how rubbish he nowadays . i'm sorry , but it great film - filled brim imaginative , huge-scale special affects depicting heaven hell , following ( i think ) very moving storyline love stuff . even if it robin williams his soppiest , what dreams may come one great special effects films all time should seen reason alone .	1

although i enjoy 2005 remake , it tough best greer garson lawrence olivier 1940 original . it wonderful cast script transends generations . must all classic movie buffs	1
i gave this movie 4 stars not because i enjoyed movie but because i think it important see it . it bit like when you're little you're parents allow you something they know hurt you ( like touch something hot ) . it painful maybe even cruel , but you learn something it stay you rest your life . watching this movie hard me . although i friends didn't dress quite so oddly , main characters story very true my school experience . i see some reviewers believe movie ' campy ' , ' melodramatic ' ' exaggerated ' i am here tell you it not , it entirely realistic . i also see many people found it funny . i suppose if you'd never through things main character it may seem funny , but those us lived life it really wasn't . movie left me terribly depressed ( i've out school 8 years ) . it ended abruptly no resolution or any kind closure , you're left feeling utter futility hopelessness . isn't necessarily bad , just hard bare . who should see this movie ? parents anyone who works children . sadly , most adults no idea what school really like modern day children they need wake-up call . however , if like me you grew up abused , forgotten , lost alone . don't see it , it only dredge up painful memories things can't changed . this just my personal opinion , others may disagree feel we should ' face our demons ' , but i've dealt my issues see no point pouring salt old wounds	1
great family film , just depends what type film you like , my opinion , this suitable film any age . if you don't like this sort film then this isn't your type . even so it brill film see it	1

first off let me say this review vhs version movie . i hoping purchase dvd would correct problems evident vhs . it appears problems remained .. grateful all those reviewers who saved me buying just format same problems . it seems disney just copied film exactly like vhs nothing more . way , one great benefits amazon reviewing ... it hopefully prevents us wasting money . problem now how rate it .. 5 star movie 2 star format . perhaps it money issue disney ... they felt effort wasn't worth return . whatever reason it really corporate shame treat this movie so poorly . movie one those old disney family fares conveys magic disneyland when walt running show . it stars great peter ustinov who carries movie lights up screen his humor presence . he so many great lines pirate seafaring dialogue treat hear(no swearing ) . he plays off dean jones , who way great job himself college coach who unwittingly releases blackbeard limbo .. heaven hell . blackbeard now good deed set free his just reward ... ' help old lady across street ? that silly ! " . movie typical disney formulaic they try help blackbeard descendants save old boarding house . suzanne pleshette stars romantic interest several standard disney stock players fill rest . my favorite scene when ustinov jones lock arms head off take silky boys singing revised version " heart oak " joined pleshette .. " i'm not letting you go there alone " . no cgi here but lots physical comedy great performance ustinov . here hoping disney get their act together tranfers this movie widescreen .. getting aspect ratio right .. it deserves . even if nothing more than letting younger generation enjoy work great peter ustinov .	1

simply put , this movie rules . you've got james spader . you've got lori laughlin . you've got sean . cunningham directing , he not only produced house iv : home deadly home , he also produced last house left , directed some movie called friday 13th . but kicker , reason i really sought it out , novelist harry crews ' involvement . after some research , i've found it difficult determine exactly how much he script . he not credited , but thanked end credits . stephen gyllenhaal brian taggart get screenwriter nods , but old crews interview , he mentions , quot ; i wrote this script called new kidsquot ; ( but that all there interview , snippet posted his website ) . so who knows . actually , i'm sure there someone fatter uglier than me out there who knows , assuming person surely doesn't anything better , they should contact me more information . new kids nothing crews novels like quot ; feast snakesquot ; or quot ; carquot ; or quot ; knockout artist , quot ; all humorously grotesque ( sometimes stomach-churning ) portraits bizarro southern life , which makes his direct involvement even more suspect . but it better-than-expected genre picture . just look what you get ! 1 ) james spader speedo underwear . 2 ) james spader doing really bad , on-again-off-again southern accent . 3 ) james spader snorting cocaine his van while his gang cretins run around outside , dousing lori laughlin lighter fluid taunting her lit matches attempt get her submit good , southern-style gang rape . 4 ) some dude named shannon who plays character named loren . 5 ) death ferris wheel . 6 ) death bumper cars . 7 ) death house mirrors ( super-lame lady shanghai quot ; homagequot ;) . 8 ) death roller coaster . 9 ) lori laughlin shower scene where you clearly see , numerous times , her flesh-colored bikini hiding her wares filmmakers . 10 ) eric stoltz getting called quot ; faggot . quot ; still not convinced ? well , there nothing more i . if you require plot description , you're already internet , so why don't you take some initiative	1
strange intro , i know ... but musician guitar player ... ' how ' ' whys ' create haunting arrangements magic music so incredible discover . this film , amazing story perseverence , ambition , love devotion , takes viewer exciting journey glenn miller traveled uncover develop his magic sound . so many crital intersections life seem happen ' chance ' ( although there no random chance ) huge incredibly important events shape our world life come those little ' ah-ha ' moments this film so full depicting glenn life music . top recommendation	1
this insipid remake takes far too many liberties story , butchers its source material , unsurprisingly ends up quite mess . furthermore , movie doesn't even really make sense when you think it . protagonist this time wants travel past save his love , finds he can't alter what happened . he then goes future where he alter events . remake entirely forgets point eloi supposed human cattle . they're not kind entirely destroys whole point book , film greatly suffers result . character played jeremy irons dumb addition story . ironically , special effects used depict morlocks better 60s film	-1
i never liked dogs when i kid , mostly because i runt they could pretty much eat me whole . which didn't preclude me liking idea dogs , or loving this film way back when . nostalgia kick i bought it again expected aspect my childhood destroyed upon reminded how horrible some things i liked back then actually adult perspective ( few examples come mind , but least i won't contend liking few things tv nowadays definitely future adults cringing ... ) . surprise , it actually even more enjoyable now " adult " . it all good i remembered , or better . when i child i never percieved it particularly " dark " film so many claim it ... truthfully , thing stuck me over years songs . they really engaging well written , not squirm-fests populate most children films any era . while certain things stick out not acceptable today children pictures ( drinking , straightforwardness topics such gambling murder ) , i definitely don't think that attitude defines film . " clean up " this movie would suck life it , make it just like any more modern children film . i no qualms showing it my nieces nephews . i think it shame movies nowaday shelter younguns anything resembling reality . besides , core it great , touching story love friendship , i think that what shines through most kids , most adults upon watching film . anne marie absolutely adorable , charlie , voiced burt reynolds likeable scoundrel any . characters all dimensional believable , despite dogs . thing sticks out when viewing this film comparison more modern children offerings . it now seen , unfortunately , throwback when kids movies didn't need rely flashy graphics or super-hip characters settings entertaining . current studios could use dose this adventurousness	1
reading movies discription you should somewhat know what you getting into . it hard find this movie listed anywhere without word dark front comedy . dark generally means some unpleasant material covered movie . within this movie genre you also grosse pointe blank which goofy comedy should hardly construed dark schmidt which virtually no comedic value but dark . this isn't laugh minute comedy , most dark comedies aren't . it story starts out somewhat serious plausible meant funny shear absurdity remaining events . this violence , gore some disturbing moments . if you watch this movie idea it movie meant fun take very serious situation . cast great portray great characters . cameron diaz great crazed bride determined perfect wedding . it over top depiction bride-to-be who her wedding not it ruined any reason , but it funny standpoint . watch it more than once because second time around you'll more numb shock some scenes able enjoy parts supposed funny instead dwelling very bad things	1
i agree some reviewers here , this dvd needs upgrade . it too great funny not time investment make this dvd worthy film . however , until new dvd comes , i settle what i . this film discussed length , i would just like add if you never seen this film , yourself favor buy it . not rent it . buy it . it good . tim burton made classic ghost story [ he made many great films ] but this film where i first became really interested his work . film stars young ( geena davis ) ( alec baldwin ) husband wife who recently died . they don't know they dead first , but come realize they never survived their accident . however , they new people home they once occupied : they don't like it . ( jeffrey jones ) funny this film , his character his wife ( catherine o'hara ) delightfully funny . dark broody daughter portrayed ( winona ryder ) who befreinds two recently departed ghost . however , main character ' beetlejuice , ' who portrayed very funny ( michael keaton ) . he helps rid ghosts pesky intruders : but cost . film funny well worth purchase . highly recommended . [ stars : 5+	1
i seen many historical war dramas far east ( mainly china ) most them not only historically inaccurate but strong bias toward enemy . yi soon shin , however , rare exception . not only drama very historically accurate but it also very comprehensive detailing meticulous battle planning admiral leads each victory but also political in-fighting chosun political factions ( second-guessing nature king ) which causes his eventual death . also , special effects great . battle scenes ( whether sea or land ) realisitic outstanding quality . only problem i find dvd not placed sufficient focus contribution ming china . then again , this not unexpected since this korean drama focusing great admiral . also , entire selection should 104 episodes . i don't know why it stops 101 . if you want more comprehensive knowledge subject , try samuel hawley imjin war ( which portrays yi soon shin more accurately quoting original sources ) . any who only intered fighting may also want check out stephen turnbull samurai invasion ( which more colorful maps detailed description battles japanese perspective ) . lastly , anyone who fan samurai warfare may want check out shogun : total war creative assembly ( now gold version ) .	1
bert i . gordon masterpiece , " beginning end " features wooden peter graves waxing philosophic effects radiation locusts ( not grasshoppers ) , which grown varying sizes maurauding through oddly-mountainous illinois , dispatching entire towns . graves accompanied plucky female journalist ( briefly ) deaf-mute gardening assistant . add half-hearted special effects ( shot after shot locusts crawling up postcards buildings ) some leery directing ( opening car sequence takes forever end ; lascivious locust staring into apartment freshly showered woman towl ) , you've got your typical d-grade schlock . this one first episodes mike nelson season ( back dvd box features joel friendly mug ; don't fooled ) , such , there some hesitancy jokes , some ground feeling . opening host segment -- where mike receives bizarre phone call trailer trash mom who thinks he someone else -- sets great tone show , invention exchange ( " re-comfy-bike " new playing cards ) , but movie such dud riffs often repetitive rare . host segments inject bit life into dullness . one them though , deliberately non-funny stand-up routine tom , so deliberately non-funny it ... well , it really isn't funny , mirroring sad way status entire film . joke show hinges movies so bad they're funny , but every once while mst3k crew finds movie that so bad it , well , it nothing but bad . " beginning end " comes close ; after all , there only so many jokes made long , ponderous silences recycled dialogue/scenes . mike bots best they here , but end result just so-so . die-hard collectors only	1

i am appalled greed disney must milk out classic like " absent minded professer " . i found this one worst if not worst remake any movie . i found plot too embelished it made relationship characters played robin williams marsha gay-hayden one where it either tried remake safe easy happy ending that throughout all disney movies , or it showed one where parties wear their hearts out their sleeves . i also feel character " flubber " it waste time considering i don't remember any merchandising character . they should've stayed bouncing rubber balls original . i also feel promotion flubber substance it all shallow , commericial where original it going put good use military , here it make buck . i feel there some movies best just left original state , not remade , this one them .	-1

documentaries tupac shakur tricky business . one hand , he fascinating subject , other hand , filmmakers rarely get hold his music or interview important people needed tell full story . tupac music controlled his mother she hasn't sanctioned official documentary thus far . it only 5 years since tupac murder , most important parties associated him reluctant talk . " before i wake " makes valiant effort but hindered same things i mentioned previously . warning spoilers ahead : this film basically interview tupac bodyguard somehow stretched out into 90 minutes . film maker cannot use any 2pac music , his videos or concert fotage , so they rely still pictures they repeat over over again . credit must given editors though who use moody instrumental score , creepy sound effects dark visual style makes impression . essentially , " before i wake , " boils down brief bio tupac followed recap his legal problems . main focus documentary his murder 1996 . we get blow blow , often minute minute summary his final day before shooting . bodyguard interesting story tell . unfortunately , his story drags . which add some suspense but it gets overkill . like filmmaker teasing audience big revelation never comes . nutshell , film reveals tupac security detail messed up big time day vegas las vegas police terrible job investigating shooting . no big surprises there . nonetheless , " before i wake " indispensable document pac murder his troubled last years . film make you miss him terribly . wonder just why he seemed destined die young	1
i always fan batman tv series , this movie basically overlong episode minus cliff hanger . this movie not psychologically provoking like tim burton series . but it fun your whole family watch . it features cast tv series . only casting change lee meriwether catwoman instead julie newmar ( or eartha kitt ) . one last comment : this movie proposes possible solution tension nations . one may say it not realistic , but nothing else seems working	1
i picked up this movie because i like harrion ford i thought it might funny . my oppinon , watching it waste time . language really bad , harrison character very low morals . there few funny parts , but nothing stands out	1

i rented this film immediatley after seeing first bride white hair hoping fluid entrancing continuation story . there perfect setup sequel i couldn't wait watch it unfold . after first half hour i knew director ronnie yu abandoned feel first film it seemed he didn't really give damn how interesting story . poor dialogue , inadequate story , there nothing satisfying or even interesting this film . if you enjoyed first bwwh you'll probably still tempted watch this movie just make sure you rent it before buying	-1
i didn't high expectations this movie , yet it still managed completely disappoint me . i adore robin williams , his performance best part movie . but script abysmal sara , played marcia gay harden , completely one dimensional character . antics sidekick robot " flubber " itself just plain embarrasing watch . too bad , because idea great - but frankly , original pretty bad too . they really could so much this story either first or second time around	-1
friday 13th , part - new beginning worst series so far saying allot . acting much worst then prior movies . script awfull like police academy parts 4 onwards level nothing short terrible . special effects looked cheap even time movie made budget like nothing close first couple movie . music outrageously bad probably some worst 80 music i ever heard . i love 80 hairdoes , tacky cheap looking clothes , make up atrocious . dialogue so bad one wonders if it highschool project gone awry . killing scenes also kind lame they seem run out ideas . movie only 92 minutes long but it sure feels it like least twice long plot makes no sense all . this movie no redeeming qualities should avoided all costs	1
back cover : miracles happen ! award-winning actress mary steenburgen ( tv joan arcadia , hope springs ) gives solid performance ginny grainger , young mother who rediscovers joy beauty christmas , thanks unshakeable faith her six-year-old daughter abbie ( elisabeth harnois ) gideon ( harry dean stanton ) , ginny very own guardian angel . ginny wonderous experience touch your heart warm your soul timeless tradition past disney favorites . one magic christmas fulfills all your most treasured christmas fantasies . share it those you love . my review:i'm such sucker christmas stuff . i probably own more christmas books movies than regular ones . so this review not " bah humbug ! " scrooge . i don't expect all my christmas films " happy happy joy joy " all time . my absolute favorite all time it wonderful life , which very dark places . first off , i don't think acting bad this movie . cinematography pretty good well . i made my judgment based content storyline , which , my opinion , flopped . what i really found annoying way ginny , heroine , constantly villified . example , let me paint you picture her life : her husband laid off hasn't worked six months . they two young children . she making minimum wage , they're barely scraping . they've also evicted their home ( since it owned her husband previous employer ) forced move her father-in-law . they very little saved bank , yet her husband wants take out $500 buy christmas presents kids . she understandably balks idea . first all $500 way too much spend presents just two kids , even if you're rich . unless you want your kids become spoiled ! ( remember , this movie originally made 1985 , so number even more outrageous . plus , they only one meager paycheck live no house their own . i think she reasonable . but she painted bad guy not blowing bunch their savings toys . then her husband wants sink what little money they into his own bike shop , possibly go into debt own his own business . again , she villified only responsible one , telling her husband he needs get steady job steady paycheck . after all , they may need their savings survive . this not time blowing it dreams may never pan out ( usually don't , since most small businesses fail first year ) . but no , she shown mean , cold-hearted witch saying this . grr . it just so irritating . yes , you want give your kids magical christmas , yes , husband always dreamed owning his own shop , but you responsible , especially when you children feed clothe . i don't think she scrooge wanting responsible adult ( she buy her kids resonably priced gifts , after all ) , but film painted her such . this film so depressing . it felt like world constantly kicking this family while it down . happy ending long time coming . also , i'd very hesitant show this movie impressionable young children . i certainly wouldn't want one my children think they constantly disobey me , run away home middle night , or talk creepy-looking strangers trench coats . that how kids end up abducted or killed ! not really realistic . i really expected better disney , especially when i really loved one their other christmas movies , santa clause . there way better christmas movies out there . see my list " christmas movies i watch every year " movies worth your time money . i don't recommend one magic christmas . if you're still determined watch it , try rent it first , or you might find yourself upset you wasted your money , like i .	1

sure , first tmnt film classic , but i've always prefered tmnt ii , it one my favorite movies my childhood . it coolest/greatest opening sequence out all tmnt movies , foot soldiers , paige turco april , most all , super shredder ! let not forget vanilla ice " out nowhere " performance himself , performing " ninja rap " . what more could young tmnt fan ask ( especially early-to-mid 1990's!) ? this film , turtles find substance made them mutate into humanoids , they find out where it came . shredder finds out it well , he uses it become super shredder , well create two monsters defeat turtles , rahzar tokka ! so , basically turtles recover ooze , defeat shredder his monsters . sure , film seems " sooooo 90 " . sure , tmnt fad my childhood over . however , this film holds up well , first film . today , i'd consider this great b-movie , or even guilty pleasure . if you fan tmnt during late 80's/early 90 , check this out if you haven't already ! oh , yourself favor avoiding third tmnt film . it atrocious	1

i watched hollywood action film , theater , day before i watched this dvd . what difference . i'm not saying there no place die hard or kung fu hustle or movie like . but people who've only seen sort movie should see power slow accretion details precisely added way bresson tells story man escaped . lack extraneous entertainment perfect presentation main story forces viewers appreciate building drama . i wonder if constant visual distractions some films aren't because director knows he can't what bresson . tension fantastic time fontaine escape it tremendously moving when he succeeds .	1
download takes awhile , but picture quality great , even full screen . it played all way through . , boot , it excellent show	1

it fun watch first episode scooby doo ( high rise hair raiser ) my computer download my kids . we go back watch it time time . i am glad amazon gave me this free download , so i could try this feature	1
after reading all these 5 star reviews i confident i myself some real , sick , perversely arousing my macabe taste this over-priced movie such bore i didn't finish it . maybe when it got good , but i doubt it . there lot human waste shots , but , it obviously fake , " torchered " youths seem enjoying themselves , there no attempt penitration , no terror , no reckless tastelessness . i don't get it i guess , i literally bored sleep .	-1
first all , i would like start off saying this movie sucks . here few things supports my decision . 1 . dacascos not know capoeira . he played berimbau ( insrument used capoeira ) wrong , he pronouced many terms incorrectly , he no flow his movements . 2 . acting horrible . while watching this , you kind get picture director wanted finish this movie soon possible . most lines just stupid . dacascos character no real history . apparently this mysterious past you really could care less because plot so predictable . 3 . fighting laughable best . capoeira only martial art outlawed so violent unstoppable . you don't need corny fight scenes show it usefulness . most fight scenes where repeated movements shot different angles . dacascos doing meia lua ( spinning kick which both hands ground you strike ) knocking out three people once . one ridiculous scene , saverio ( drug lord ) pointed where he wanted dacascos stand so he could miraculously appear behind him perform unchallenged jumping kick back his head . i wish experinced capoeirista would fight scenes . although this movie horrible , it only movie which capoeira suppose main artform used . while watching this movie , one only hope this poor performance dosen't hurt capoeira chances cornerstone movie .	1
most fundamental level , i.e. , sexual/semi-erotic level , l'ennui most definitely its moments . total film , however , it stutters more than few times . technically , subtitles occasionally flash too fast or offered no contrast so they become almost unreadable . camerawork quite good , however , definite european style . story itself also intriguing , but once point made , it nowhere go . problems begin actors plot . not actors bad ; they actually very good . but you understand minute one martin isn't wrapped too tightly ( his treatment fan , example , early ) , so his bizarre behavior once he meets cecelia isn't surprising least . more simply , guy evinces no sympathy least viewer ; none . he complete ass . he comes off needy , selfish egomaniacial , one those boors who so deeply personally insecure they become outwardly obnoxious nasty hide it everyone . you really don't care what ultimately happens him , also understand if he get what he wanted film , he would immediately reject it once he , just hurtful . cecilia , more you get know her , just bad way . she doesn't come off stupid ( someone else said)or obtuse , but almost totally uncaring unfeeling , not mention far more immature than her few years . she simply whatever she wants whenever she without lot regard how it hurt or affect people . she understands how they feel things , but unless it touches her directly negatively , doesn't really care . look how she regarded her father . all all , it hard feel sympathy her well . she not opaque but almost completely transparent . say film point hammered home way too long or ending ridiculously abrupt putting it mildly .	1
this good movie watch whole family . it may also spark some interest baseball those not already interested . all all movie entertaining , realistic believable far families emotions concerned	1
" prom night " my favorite early slashers . i love disco soundtrack whole late 70 feel movie . ever since i saw halloween i craved more jamie lee curtis this gives you healthy dose . plot pretty usual but killer wasn't predictable like lot slasher movies . it horror/slasher classic , not much gore but still effective . i say woman i would never take ride fat boy van ~ !! jude ~ ! what you feelin girl ? 70 80 slashers jocks usually didn't any musclesbut girls always big [ ... ] . go figure . anyway .. buy movie it slasher royalty .	1

this probably best hoffman video . domingo his peak here , best hoffman i've ever heard singing best i've heard him sing role . particularily good ballad klinzach " amis ! l'amour tendre " , which acted excellently domingo features some really great buisness anges balsta , domingo chorus . conducting pretre speedy , most time it works , but , some places ( like baracolle , sung beautifully ) it seems singes hardly keep up . production values nothing short increadable . late john schliesinger shows himself capable operatic director , several nice touches production , such lindorf appearing end each act , mocking hoffman laughing . i would prefered see roles acted one man , but seperate apperances lindorf just well . begining venice act very impressive , gondolas floating ominously writhing orgy taking place banks cannal . designs maria bjornson willum dudley utilize three-story stage excellently , give each setting different feel : tavern place grity reality , paris zany victorian invetors lab , venice c.b. demille nightmare , munic feeling derilict , clostrophobic mansion hell . singing , other than domingo almost uniformally good . luciana serra , olympia fine acting-wise her voice pleasent enough , but i don't like her phrasing . balsta guiletta increadeble , real stand out . she looks terrific , too . ileana cortubas ' antonia sings well enough , but could act part better . still , you warm up her eventually , she very good final trio . villians , robert llyod ( asways reliable ) memerable lindorf , though he speaks rather than sings stella letter takes his aria much fast . sir geraint evans amazing coppelius , both zany extreamly creepy . seigmund nimsgern extreamly hypotic dappertutto , gives best vocal performance out four villians . nicolai ghiuselev miracle production biggest letdown , he overpowered his two trios easily acts rather woodenly . claire powell excellent masculine nicklausse , makes ravishing transformation into muse , where her sdialouge not good . smaller roles , robert tear memerable spalanzani gwynne howell excellent touching crespel . bernard dikerson very funny frantz , giving best acting performance ( if not vocal ) " jour et nuite " i've heard yet . paul crook execellent conchinelle , but not andres . chorus orchestral work both excellen t.t his production i would highly recomend under any circumstances	1
i pleasantly surprised this film . i happened catch it israeli television while tel aviv business . nothing better i left it , fully expecting treated one half hour festival hedonism celebration hedonism . what i found instead hedonism but additionally honest portrayal consequences lifestyle . it amazes me some people who give this film one , two , or three stars criticize it its hedonism completely totally fail recognize film anything but celebration it . if anything it warning young people life lived service self often lead pain , anguish even death	1
this movie not well theaters , it got bad reviews , even leguizamo apologized it . i don't care : this one funniest movies ever ! it jeffrey jones , guy " howard duck " " ferris bueller day off . " now you know film hilariously corny if he it . great thing this movie how leguizamo acts like live , human version bugs bunny . this type slapstick rarely seen modern films . further , leguizamo mocks all people who think race solely blackwhite terms his ethnic drag all cultures . too funny . " latinus s___ticus " gag rollover funny ! i hated homophobia how gayness rendered white only ( if miami doesn't many latino , black , asian gay men ) , but still this movie great	1

disney released certain evidence new " masterpiece edition " this timeless classic should expected somewhere 2007 , whether it single or 2-disc edition not known yet , but " masterpiece edition " likes 2004 alice wonderland dvd re-release , it quite possible rescuers too see two disc set ! i'm so excited , i can't wait , it well time . like i said , don't waste your money this poor standard edition , print looks horrible , colors dark , murky unbalanced , nothing like they supposed look like sound nothing extravagant . 2007	1
i child insomnia when i first caught this movie channel 56 late night , horrified see my president shoot man i wanted this gorgeous sleepy-eyed girl . recently , again , i wanted see this movie order watch ronald reagan villain especially satisfied because this late his acting career so he looked much like he looked time he became president , so it interesting hear him say stuff like quot ; i believe larceny , but i don't condone murder . quot ; he stiff criminal who can't even satisfy his girl , orders cronies most his dirty work , ... ( no i'm talking character , though i suppose you might think not ) . furthermore , angie dickinson absoloutely gorgeous this fact kept me ! why she not famous marylin monroe , etc .?? her sleepyish eyes , her body , whew . plus lee marvin great , film interesting , shot some neat angles which add quot ; weirdnessquot ; it . something like watered down hitchcock film , almost . i recommend movie fully , but it almost nothing hemingway short story it supposedly based upon	1
" no way out " applauded tackling subject racial tension time when it probably wasn't fashionable or commercially viable . said , despite moments searing truths , film only treats it subject matter superficially . my mind it never gets root causes institutionalized racism . makers seem slough it off class resentment blacks white underclass who depicted here wild eyed yahoos , none worse than over-the-top richard widmark . never mind real power wielded elites like industrialists , medical profession , film industry . despite these quibbles there alot recommend here , not least all towering performance young sidney poitier intern caught middle racial maelstrom . despite his youth , poitier radiant screen presence much evidence here suggests greater work yet come him	1

this film tells powerful story , " crime punishment " -esque recovery soul , except without ending dostoevsky his novel . after neel auguste committs murder , madame la ( juliette binoche ) , much like dostoevsky sonya , takes monumental task recovering lost soul succeeds . those who suggest this film unrealistic no grasp eternal , christian values compassion those who call this film ideological propaganda no appreciation beauty , acting ( all three , especially kusturica auteuil , whom i discovered through this film who almost eclipse talented binoche ) , cinematography , directing absolutely brillian t.t his must-watch many different kinds people , those interested st. pierre miquelon ( i look up islands map surprised learn they french , not canadian ) , those who would like illustration why there never soul , lost forever , those who would just like receive aesthetic pleasure beautiful film . finally , some commented character neel auguste , saying he " retarded " not running away . not let comment like fool you . it would not made reviewer understood character or even picked up direct quote madame la , " you so fatalistic ! " . never trust someone who tells you not watch movie . watch it decide yourself . i cannot envision you wouldn't like it	1

i seen many historical war dramas far east ( mainly china ) most them not only historically inaccurate but strong bias toward enemy . yi soon shin , however , rare exception . not only drama very historically accurate but it also very comprehensive detailing meticulous battle planning admiral leads each victory but also political in-fighting chosun political factions ( second-guessing nature king ) which causes his eventual death . also , special effects great . battle scenes ( whether sea or land ) realisitic outstanding quality . only problem i find dvd not placed sufficient focus contribution ming china . then again , this not unexpected since this korean drama focusing great admiral . also , entire selection should 104 episodes . i don't know why it stops 101 . if you want more comprehensive knowledge subject , try samuel hawley imjin war ( which portrays yi soon shin more accurately quoting original sources ) . any who only intered fighting may also want check out stephen turnbull samurai invasion ( which more colorful maps detailed description battles japanese perspective ) . lastly , anyone who fan samurai warfare may want check out shogun : total war creative assembly ( now gold version ) .	1
this movie i think people either like lot or dislike lot . i've seen it twice movie houses now three times dvd . it cool film , decadent core only one really likeable character , 14 year old boy . i'm one those who like it lo t.t he boy brought shanghai ( 1930s ) his gangster uncle work " family " powerful , aging drug boss . drug lord mistress , nightclub singer , played gong li . boy assigned fetch carry her . gong li plays her willful , beautiful , selfish perhaps overly confident courtesan . gong li sings dances several times star nightclub , she wonderful part . nearly everything seen perspective boy -- which means you don't get full picture any one time . there brutal gang attack boss his key henchmen , his mistress boy flee isolated fog-bound island regroup plot . there betrayal merciless , calculated revenge , practical killing . ending , needless say , not pleasant ... except , perhaps , boss . boy , least , survives . film gorgeous look beautifully lit photographed . dvd transfer excellent	1

see this comedy classic 43 years later revelatory . many reviewers here find this introduction bumbling inspector clousseau , extended pursuit jewel thief , too slow . pity , but entirely understandable . even those who remember 60s , since then , conditioned speed-up all entertainment , especially film . subtracting fame pink panther series sellers , whom this break-out movie , many younger persons just puzzled . bottom line comedy here much closer chaplin than us , now . world changed fast also give edge sadness watching movie some us . what triumphs , however , innocence , charm , visual beauty . international sets lovely starlets sort thing added pizz-azz time , but if we more jaded all now , beauty remains beauty . then too , always professional david niven delivers necessary ground let sellers ' gags -- invariably physical dumb -- develop . where sellers got his facial expressions god knows ; man inspired , inimitable , gift . 65% what he comes silent film era ; rest marvelously tuned comic pitch his voice , perfect any situation . so sure , what would take 15 minutes screen now extended 2 hours . what funny , then , you see ; it acquired taste today . comedy , unlike tragedy , very particular time place . almost any shakespeare tragedy pumped up re-mounted modern audience ; he wrote many comedies but only very top ones , such midsummer night dream , redone any era . film , so accurate unflinching , really press issue this ephemeral nature comedy . so why see it ? peter sellers . david niven . capucine young claudia cardinale , young robert wagner . they here , preserved fresh day this deceptively low key comedy shot . what would we give 5 minute clip , even silent , great 18th century shakespearean actor david garrick ? priceless amount , course . film such this asks appreciated sort homely , poignant light	1

war flicks go , this one pretty decent ; no overdramatic , sappy acting , cast playing belle crew pretty cohesive , just like you would expect . most part , film reasonably realistic ( i've known lots b-17 b-24 pilots ) . it impressed me they even got belle model ( b-17f ) right ; i didn't know there any flying f still around , most g-models . there some inaccuracies though . why they glamorize belle name nose , when it actually made up plain block letters ? " little friends " ( fighter escort ) would not made up p-51 early 1943 , more than likely p-47s ; i forgive this one because there only couple flyable " jugs " left . belle 25th mission actually " milk run " over france ; they fly once over bremen but i believe around their 20th mission . smoking not allowed , or anywhere near , bombers . i could list several other things , but you get my point . still , it one better bomber movies many ways . i would agree reviewer though " twelve o'clock high " . it doesn't much action this movie , but totally accurate much more dramatic	1
i used like this film back late 80s but after purchasing it , reading book watching it again i realized there isn't much say redeeming this film . sure it low budget , but story characters so cheesy not good movie way . i guess this film still it fans but after reading book ( i dont normally compare books films because its downright impossible compare ) i found characters just not likeable ending very ridiculous . film achieve cult status isn't too hard if its movie but whether its good film or not real question . me i rate this low because i find it atrocious but it fans , ones out there really love this film call it " classic " i must say i hope some day they remake story better actors , effects plotting	-1

i thought this might only interest science enthusiasts or real film buffs , but acting chemistry greer garson ( mrs. miniver ) walter pidgeon ( forbidden planet ) really make science romantic . there other stars supporting cast , they all great job bringing this slice science history life , including robert walker ( strangers train ) , van johnson ( 30 seconds over tokyo ) , henry travers ( it wonderful life ) , . aubrey smith ( beyond tomorrow , five came back ) , margaret o'brien ( meet me st. louis ) . my favorite movies this type edison man spencer tracy , young tom edison mickey rooney ; but sheer quantity raw talent makes madame curie just good those favorites	1

i never smiled sooo much through ' mystery film ' . this very cool movie . many labeled it " artsy " movie , my artsy usually means abstract or undefined . this movie straight forward , guy dead begining movie detective trying find out who killed him or if it suicide . very basic , but what not basic suspects / witnesses . each one living his own world , you mentaly challenged , [ ... ] artiest , one who thinks he 5th beatle . so enjoyment seeing how detective * who just strange other charecters * tries get information out them . so you get little romance , alot smiles through this experiance . i personally enjoyed it , espcially fact you hear bono singing almost throught whole movie :d why i give it 4 not 5 stars ? i not too happy extra features , they not title anyone when they speaking , so if you don't know names actors , producers ect .. then your out luck . also audio extra features bit unstable , low high depeding who interviewed .. i very disapointed not find least one music video movie bono , there songs movie bono written movie , it would helped if they actually interviewed bono , since he co-writter film give us more insight inspiration this project . other than , it very cool movie , very believeable cast , i mean you actually believe this guys nuts , its fantastic . murder/thriller , it actually dosen't much violence or blood it ... but alot smiles	1

there something fact this vampire uses or needs airplane fly around place place just takes away any horror this film could really create . stephen king " night flier " very poor plot even poorer cast characters . shame you stephen king !! moreover , there not one character entire movie you relate or even sympathize slightest . movie centers around selfish crass newspaper reporter who trying track serial killer who flies his plane airport airport search victims . it becomes increasingly apparent this serial killer not human . now , only reason this film not get 1 star rating vampire rather horrifying looking ending slightly creepy , but everything else this movie fails evoke any interest me whatsoever . if you really want see good vampire flick , you should watch original " salem lot " , directed tobe hooper ( not " new " garbage came out recently tnt ) , which one , if not scariest movie all-time . quite frank , i'm reluctant give " night flier " even 2 stars , but , i said above , there couple creepy/scary elements it . if you see it tv , you should check it out yourself , but it not worth penny me .	1

before he helped craft fodder like gone 60 seconds remake swordfish , dominic sena directed this slick looking psycho thriller , featuring wonderfully twisted performance brad pitt , who verge becoming household name . pre-x-files david duchovny stars budding author who , his photographer girlfriend ( michelle forbes ) , make trek west coast advertise riding partners . what they get white-trash sociopath early ( pitt ) his whacko girlfriend ( juliette lewis ) , soon enough terrifying trip begins slowly escalates point no return . though it narrative something we've seen before again , kalifornia more than worth seeing thanks pitt psycho performance , which showcases he indeed unique versatility actor , which shown spades here . if there any real weak point , it duchovny comes off rather drab , but what else would he ? all all , if you dig films like natural born killers or anything tarantino , you'll most likely want take trip kalifornia	1
oscar winner roger avary ( creator " gold watch " segment pulp fiction ) directed this adaptation novel bret easton ellis like avary directorial debut " killing zoe " , this movie highly original good but lags some parts isn't really movie i'd watch again . don't get me wrong , i'm happy i watched it ; avary talented film maker , but ... movie college kids doing exactly what college kids . means get drunk , get high , get laid . every one our characters this pretty much throughout entire movie . one keys this movie success it cinematography film editing , both which oscar worthy . scenes reverse thing great . but , we meet all characters party they ; sean bateman ( james van der beek , who very far away his former creek ) , senior college drug dealer who desparate win over lauren ( shannyn sossamon ) when all while he recieves love notes his p.o. box . lauren virgin , whom we meet she loses her virginity , who wants win over victor ( kip pardue ) . then there paul denton ( ian somerhalder ) who gay desparately wants sean . also involved this triangle lauren slutty roommate lara ( jessica biel , who middle trying shed her " 7th heaven " image ) . movie weaves through events transpire their lives eventually bring them back each other very skillfully . ending , which ends abruptly movie stars , really good . one thing i've noticed while watching avary movies , dialouge his strong suit . both this movie " killing zoe " dialouge very smart quick witted . also both movies , story lag . but , this pretty good movie it worth renting . dialouge : b+movie : b-overall grade :	1

i say i surprised when i first saw this . this why bridget fonda used big star . there no reason she should able kill like 20 people restaurant , yet she sells it so well , she could killed 100 . if you not seen french movie le femme nikita , don't worry , this almost good . beign action fan , i liked it even more . story gets little stupid couple points , but those minor becsue movie so freaking good . i don't wanna give nothing away cause it easy follow i promise you enjoy it least one time through . but i say fonda sheeit , harvy keitel awesome playing jean reno role , sadisticly i might add . gabriel byrne best part me , writer didn't come up greatest dialogue but gabriel just man , he turn any role into fittign himself . so awesome movie doesn't any special features . anyone know fo special edition coming out	1
like review i just read , tarkovskies ' andre rublev movie i keep coming back over years . it my favorite film until something special comes . more than any filmmaker any country , any language , this movie imparted impressed it viewpoint into my perception . i incorporated it into my vision . i resonate it ... it plays me like bell . it not entertainment really though much it entertaining . this film transcends both entertainment mere artistic success - images themes so spiritually charged archetypically strong one may sense while watching it , he or she remembering half forgotten dreams . like person whose review i just read , i often pause simple wonder after chapter just let it ring . film chronicles life spiritual development russian artist , icon painter andre rublev . epic unfolds 6 chapters last which introduces artist , young church bell maker . chapter reveals aspects components creative process both literally allegory ... one senses filmmaker tarkovsy young bell-maker may great deal common he may written himself into this section .... this last chapter " spring " shot through narrative vitality , energetic quality expression simply colossal - there joy unfolding discovery this bell-makers own creative powers ... all which witnessed aging jaded andre rublev who , witness , transformed what he sees , anyone who eyes see apprehend naked wonder this last chapter . andre tarkovsky made this film what used ussr during period rigid scrutinizing censorship . he used artistic restraints hoops he jump through brilliant advantage carefully codifying individual artistic spiritual themes into chapters this epic . constraints seem served discipline streamline narrative ... result golden ... more truth per foot film than any i compare it . i saw it first video college russian art history class , later bought dvd , more recently attended screening disney studios colleague given invite but couldn't make . i brought someone who just didn't get it . tarkovsy not everyone though you should give yourself benefit doubt because , if he you , you may very well changed touched rewarded again again this truly timeless gem	1

yep , like many viewers i watched this when i too young scared like weeks end couldnt get tall man image out my head . well , when this got re-released i just " " it figuring it would bring back memories really allow me get into once again . unfortunately because i am now older hopefully little wiser , film ends up rather cheesey horror movie mix-mash plot no tension or scary moments whatsoever . hey , i wasnt looking dustin hoffman like performance horror movie but geeez acting pretty rough forced . plot started off pretty cool but then began not know what itself got almost silly towards end . mausoleum itself eerie but dwarf guys ( star wars jawas ? ) pretty funny whole thing just didnt add up . always horror films quick call police all it would taken stop this tall man , but no .... lets grab trusty shotgun take care it ourselves ...... c'mon . scene plastic bug jacket made me laugh outloud i rewound it just get laugh . film makers know how silly this looked .... didnt they ? i hope scene supposed tongue-in-cheek or film makers need rethink their film careers . course , thought process characters just didnt make any logical sense . i wont go into details , you'll see what i mean when you watch movie . oh yeah , mustard-covered fingers also classic laugh momen t.t he silver fyling ball still cool hell alone earned movie extra star rating me . i like jody , he tries right things most part waaaay cool ' cuda he drives around . little mike just young kid you almost felt bad him losing so many people he cared .... it tough . however , doesnt excuse inherent silliness movie or plot just doesnt unfold correctly or logically . maybe i expected too much , maybe i've become overly-critical movie watcher , but nontheless , i cant recommend this other than quick watch . rent it , dont buy it since it really zero redeeming qualities or multiple-viewing value . this could soooooo much better proper direction little more time put into films flow . it great concept horror . sci-fi thrown mystical elements well . great starting point it refershingly different opposed usual " 10 kids go camping get hacked ax murderer " [ ... ] you always see . again though .... it not polished all just didnt work well enough . sorry if i've burst proverbial bubble movies fans . but , its " cult " classic reason . much like rocky-horror picture show , event real attraction fans ... movie itself horrible pointless but fans dont want face fact so they hide behind " cult classic " label . hey , whatever .... :) way : dvd quality only average . i expected better transfer but my plasma based home theater , it pretty grainy not up par what re-release should , imo .

lawn dogs surprisingly original exceptionally well independent film . mischa barton devon amazing . her face pliable ultra expressive , even though she strangest little 10 year old captured film , her adult mannerisms dialogue show us little girl who treated like china doll her parents ; she rough life heart problems , which she explains dippety dit , etc . she wants show she still person quite capable doing things her parents trying spare her . sam rockwell equally effective " poor white trash " who mows rich people lawns , put upon young man , surprised his friendship this odd little girl . when watching film , though , watch subtle portraits painted : when devon wants give trent glass water , she reaches one better glasses whereupon her mother tells her there glass him under sink --- when trent takes devon meet his parents , mother offers them iced tea -- her best glasses ; when trent interrupts barbecue devon house , daddy offers him couple hot dogs while rest guests eating steak baked potatoes ; when community fancy lantern shades stolen , they blame trent , when it really nasty little boy who doing this ; when cds stolen golden boys ' car , it trent who blamed , when again , it our little cowboy/indian/monster . supporting performances very good : kathleen quinlan , devon mom , who messing around one golden boys ; christopher mcdonald her dad , lost political workings development ; eric mabius one golden boys obviously interested rockwell body well . there no real dramatic big scenes it leisurely film , but barton rockwell remarkable movie sense realism counteract fantasy elements	1

this movie great several ways - all audrey hepburn fans would love it . she shows her talent more than just beautiful face . it also front runner , because it shows artistry great filmmaker , who build suspense tension merely use light , staging , without resorting cheap tricks excessive violence . film use light shadow amazing . timing characters exits entrances like watching finely tuned play . ( this play actually . ) this one you edge your chair . famous ending scene take your breath away every time , even if you've seen it before ! when suzy husband finally gets home realizes what happened , his reaction lame - they should rewritten one . but only 2 minutes , so don't let keep you watching this one . rent this movie your teens who like suspense thrillers - they enjoy it .	1
story conventional , idea isn't new ( it remake , fact ) , but true victory this film lies creative power talent behind it . george cukor behind camera , judy garland front it , moss hart penning words ; one could hardly go wrong . mix it dazzling performances lead supporting characters , plus magnetic pull judy garland mere presence , you've got yourself instant classic . film opens all glitz glamour hollywood provides , annual benefit academy . ester blodgett performs number her band suddenly interrupted when drunk superstar norman maine staggers onto stage . ester makes most situation comically incorporates him into her act so audience wouldn't suspect he drunk . this opening song shows sheer performance power judy garland makes it clear why she labeled " world greatest entertainer . " norman quickly seeks her out pushes her pursue bigger dream her remarkable dream , soon she huge star , eclipsing his own . his alcoholism bitterness , not towards ester but industry , soon gets better him . ester norman , meanwhile , fallen irrevocably love , it strength this connection much plot centers around . garland innate vulnerability , she so often described , so fitting this character i found myself moist eyeballs many time throughout film ( i'll concede my eyeballs loathe get least bit wet ) . her quavering voice large dewy eyes ring up host emotions makes you wonder how heck academy could overlooked this performance . musical numbers this picture also memorable , most important which " man got away . " judy garland doesn't look like she singing camera , but herself herself alone . audience almost feels moment too private intrude upon . but we quickly forget we're frozen , riveted garland magic . " born trunk " sequence elaborate looks like it took quite bit green . i must say it pleasure see garland perform " swanee " stage , complete dancers singers . one those ' little jabs pleasure ' norman maine would say . oftentimes when creative heavyweights mixed together venture , end result not miraculous . ' star born ' however , none voodoo . it sensational artistic achievement every department .	1
koreans honor their greatest military hero this epic drama which takes place late 1500s . career tactics this admiral still studied u.s. naval academy , doubtless those other nations . screenplay based couple novels , so there some fiction , but life yi soon shin well documented , so there plenty fact supporting story . if you not familiar korean drama , it good keep mind this not hollywood product , but they very well special effects such considering non-hollywood budgets involved , it easy see past all enjoy tale told . it long series , but presents epic power , depth dimension well worth watching it unfold through each every episode . it would great also see kbs make other dramas available viewing through amazon , such " seoul 1945 " .	1

read tons books articles subject evolution i understand this film very much . i know some who understand evolution far less well certainly confused intricate plot concerning big . other complaints amazon reviewers i'll say this : 1 ) i find acting this film anything but hollywood-like . this film reminds me lot fatal attraction other rather realistic 80 hit films . this movie very realistic acting . 2 ) dialogue this movie profanity true --- but it delivered very sophisticated , educated , realistic way . not cheap like 80 rambo movies . realize most characters professors doctors such therefore it extra-cerebral dialogue . 3 ) blair brown much sexier than william hurt . 4 ) hurt character big scene goes back beginning mankind discovers how without love , little anger , happiness otheremotions life unbeliavably drab , indifferent purely technicality . that why he quits search . why so many insist it cheap ending ? 5 ) hurt character quits happily embracing earlier stages mankind upon realizing man not actually , ultimately god just single cell there no feeling all , no control , etc people . people better off their current , multi-celled state . therefore he successfully fights all regressions off end ( power he really all ) because it no good this realization makes him appreciate his loving sexy wife all more . 6 ) hurt character goes mexico --- not south america like some posters think	1

no this isn't courtney friends , but once you get past - this must watch tv ! while show content shocking , it so well written edited it all fits . it definitely sequential drama makes much more sense watching episodes back back . fleshes out characters so you start care understand them . courtney shows her acting chops best those moments when she silent lets her expressions say it all because sometimes her dialog bit stilted . best character functional schizophrenic photographer , don konkey . he exhibits endearing combination weirdness , loyalty , insight sweetness become break-out star this series . if you only watched one episode wrote this one off - go back watch few back back you may just find yourself addicted .	1

it takes hbcu graduate write hbcu experience , period . just look " different world " how bad first season . debbie allen ( howard grad , i believe ) stepped gave show authenticity it sorely needed . so it no surprise spike lee , morehouse man , would make movie sparked so much emotion both sides coin . i'm not saying you attend hbcu understand " school daze " , but you attended one get real " flavor " what it like . you open mind . any hbcu alum saying this film wasn't realistic flat-out lying . yes , it hit some things old folks call " dirty laundry " ( such hazing , color issues , those who think getting education makes you " white " , so ) , but those things real hbcus - yes , even today . ( major props spike one dark-skinned sista gamma rays . isn't always way ? ) there no " good " people or bad people ; spike leaves decision up you . julian his good points ( his intelligence , leadership pride his town , school , etc ) dap his bad points ( his blatant bigotry bullying ) , both them legitimate points . one thing spike nailed right confrontations students tended regular basis . no offense whites or anyone who graduated pwc , but my experience predominately white high school , i noticed students there lot more subtle their dislike ; they particpated more " destroying within " kind system , grew wide-eyed offended when confronted , even solid proof . ( " i would never spread rumors you/sleep your boyfriend/steal your term paper ! " ) black students , other hand , take anyone head-on , whether person school president , captain football team , richest kid campus , crippled ... doesn't matter . your " status " doesn't count if you go hbcu . i friend who saw sd said " so unrealistic ! since when college kids go fighting each other all time ?

this movie lavished praise when it first came out , but after number viewings over years i find its intense mysteriousness less less appealing . holly hunter plays ada , mail-order bride who goes remote new zealand meet her husband ( played sam neill ) . we learn choice she not spoken since age six , though why never disclosed ; indeed , point made she doesn't know why , either . her one solace piano , which she plays well . but neill refuses instrument brought his home man , george baines ( played harvey keitel ) , uneducated , but morally decent , takes piano lets her play it his place . but he wants something her return - sexual favors . gradually they fall love movie end gone off together , sans piano , which they thrown into ocean . there lot unanswered questions raised : why ada voluntarily mute ? why she so repulsed her husband ? why she fall baines ? - fact these mysteries linger after credits roll annoying . main theme seems revolve around love triangle , but devoid purpose . heroine , hunter more freak social outcast . movie poetic sensual , but expense all reason . piano itself interesting symbol lots implications , but wildly lush settings extremely odd behavior principal characters overshadow its significance . although quite eyeful ( earful ) , movie leaves too many important questions unanswered	1

you talk disappointed , this icing cake . all i hear how scary cutting edge this . not even close . whatever big shot film critics say truly wrong . i love older movies too am open minded change times such . there actually some scary or least entertaining horror flicks during 70 , but this not one them .... seriously , don't buy this . i don't know why it so highly regarded . acting , story , especially music el terrible ' . it like porn quality acting , story written 25 minutes music disney movie . it could good movie if they would taken out attempt comedy , through some disturbing music , made bad guys , well , more bad . it could remade ( which i'm usually against )	-1

... this ultimate scary thriller blood black lace . i already preordered new edition which also unrated uncut but much less expensive then original . mario bava smoked us unbelievably stark dark black sunday which featured buxom beauty barbara steele her dual roles evil good . now , blood black lace takes new turn . murderer hunting beautiful fashion models house fashion quickly turns into house pure terror . killings this movie so exquisitely filmed color delightful cinematography they become ultimately argento-like : horrible things happening people beautiful way . only letdown you never see face killer most film , but that what makes it so unbearably suspenseful ... who masked fiend behind these grotesque murders ? only you , viewer , guess who committing these heinous crimes . mario bava one best italian horror film directors ever , blood black lace beautiful , creepy piece filmmaking further proved he , liked many directors horror genre like carpenter romero , essential horror director remain so years come . thank goodness we his films remember his powerful legacy italian horror film genre	1
koreans honor their greatest military hero this epic drama which takes place late 1500s . career tactics this admiral still studied u.s. naval academy , doubtless those other nations . screenplay based couple novels , so there some fiction , but life yi soon shin well documented , so there plenty fact supporting story . if you not familiar korean drama , it good keep mind this not hollywood product , but they very well special effects such considering non-hollywood budgets involved , it easy see past all enjoy tale told . it long series , but presents epic power , depth dimension well worth watching it unfold through each every episode . it would great also see kbs make other dramas available viewing through amazon , such " seoul 1945 " .	1

`beyond borders ' starts off brilliantly , it continues down turf quite sometime before veering off beaten path heading straight into generic hollywood fluff . prose established outset young socialite named sarah jordan ( jolie ) who her eyes mind opened relief worker named nick callahan ( owen ) caught my attention , most part film initially played out like coming age film woman who unaware horrors others face became determined help everyway she could . me angelina made this character part her , since i truly believe this character part her , thus made sarah very believable person . sarah married henry bauford ( roache ) but their marriage falling apart years . they mostly stay together sake their son jimmy . sarah since her initial visit ethiopia become member un , when nick his partner elliott ( emmerich ) need supplies sent them cambodia she takes this opportunity escape her philandering husband venture off this country help those need . it while there she realizes her attraction or love nick two them begin struggle thought their future since sarah son needs her family where nick so attached his work normal life something he'll never . much i not looking forward romantic nor dare i say tragic love story i alright sudden change pace when these two star crossed lovers began switch focus dying children each other . what threw me sudden shift into action adventure thriller when nick hot head gets him kidnapped sarah rushes out chechnya save him . me this movie would better served if it kept its focus its humanitarian side left action out it somewhat robs movie its dramatic nature turns it into generic hollywood blockbuster , which my opinion it shouldn't . `beyond borders ' lot important things say , if it kept focus those important matters then outcome would better film , but instead it feels too compelled add romance add adventure make it appealing every audience it loses audience would normally embrace it . i say acting all fronts elevates this film delivers bit realism . every tear angelina jolie clive owen shed feel real genuine . nothing feels forced or out character . some said they feel angelina miscast , i admit end when she goes her humanitarian care giver lara croft tomb raider i felt she stepped out character created new one , she still every bit convincing . i just feel this movie forgot what it trying prove allowed pressure box office blockbuster , draw large crowd , cloud their judgment caused them sabotage what could dynamic film . said i still very impressed most likely enjoy this film again ; i'm just disappointed such brilliant original start i would liked see less generic more focused ending	1
seen " stormy monday " many years ago , i completely enchanted this small interesting picture . nowadays , it commonplace every self-aware " cool " british crime drama embraced american audiences . but 1988 , this stylish film mike figgis bit more unorthodox . where else you get sean bean , sting , tommy lee jones , melanie griffith together ? it such weird amalgamation acting styles , yet somehow it works . this , i suppose , gangster flick heart . but what i like " stormy monday " familiar crime elements downplayed . there action when needed , some brutality -- but you've also got credible romance , peak polish subculture , commentary american commercialism , loving tribute jazz . music plays just great role setting tone " stormy monday " plot . it cool leisurely picture flows over you comfortable waves . this movie doesn't try too hard , it not designed your face--it subtle smart . sean bean great lead . bean someone i've always admired , but he never really connected american roles leading man . forever villain or sidekick here -- you turn his british resume his greatest performances ( check out sharpe saga ) . melanie griffith subdued believable somewhat sketchy part -- we never know quite what she . tommy lee jones provides his usual bravado . sting surprisingly good . someone who only flirted acting , this picture show you potential went unrealized . " stormy monday " definitely small picture , but very worthy . it effective mood piece -- one may initially seem bit slight , but it effect lingers you . kgharris , 11/06	1

before fulci earned his title " godfather gore " , which enhanced(and some , ruined ) his reputation , fulci made this very entertaining giallo film . i'm not 100% sure , but i believe this film actually got him blacklisted or something back 70s . duckling story young boys who murdered small town . who doing it ? it peeping tom village idiot ? local wizard ? witch who sticks pins in(and spits ) wax figures boys ? priest ? priest shady mother ? sexy annette o'toole lookalike thing drugs 12 year old boys ? reporter ? or maybe police themselves ? you'll watch it see , fulci decent job keeping us dark . those buying this trademark gore we all love disappointed . there only two real scenes violence . one identical whipping scene opening beyond , other killer demise which looks pretty silly , but still cool . this film shows what talent fulci , proves he wasn't complete hackmeister .... only mostly . i think there quite few critics who actually like this one . though low gore , it far p.c. subject matter unsettling enough , but there quite tantalizing scene every boy dream come life . leading lady one point throws herself one boys , but boy pesky mother interrupts . young boys allowed act scenes naked women ? i suppose they could italy early 70s . watch it , good flick	1

dead again slipped into theaters kenneth branagh while he emma thompson married working very well together . film mystery several levels : 1940s murder mystery , present day identity search , even whether reincarnation happens . branagh blended black white flashbacks modern day action seemlessly . plots twists superb , yet quiet . entire movie gives you time think what happening form your own conclusion what happen ; yet you find your conclusion wrong . although mysteries usually lose something after first viewing , when you find out how it ends , dead again actually gains . once you know how it ends , you want watch it again again look subtle clues missed first time through even try find mistakes , although i warn you , i seen it least 20 times still not found any mistakes	1

poet his early ages , enjoys singing death , but when he aged finishes after crossing all adversities hopes makes supreme tribute life . youth death just abstraction , remote presence , invention those who die . golden age something more than iced air : it ' tangible figure , almost human invited it own final ceremony . old poet , who exalted death age irresponsible joy simply oversmiles enjoys like any one else when bird sings or before perfect structure falling leaf intends tolisten rumor trees when wind ceases . idea death scares us . let ' honest any school we learn live , worst still how die , extend our live after supreme moment . young advertiser dying cancer . picture tells change attitude before life familiar relations operated small affective circle . he decides immortalize through video all new experiences life legate next son who born after his imminent absence . film whose own identity emerges its apparent banality , because offers unexpected way reflection life itself . beautiful reading death , posthumous love , life love .	1
this not shoot-em-up western . if what you after , stop reading right here . what this , real heartfelt tribute cowboy . genuine article cowboy . particular , it charts group cowboys through decline golden age cowboy , near end 19th century . almost whole first half movie , there no plot speak , just character exposition building up picture life character these men . nothing rushed , yet it never dull , thanks intelligent script . there humorous moments great lines , but plenty pathos melancholy too , characters all deal end era their own ways . we see cowboy-turned-outlaw , cowboy-turned-storekeeper , cowboy-turned-floor sweeper ... but most all we see cowboy turned into legend . plot kicks , there nothing contrived it , but it all feeds into central idea examining what men when their purpose taken away them . movie benefits some great performances some classic character actors such william devane barry corbin , well brilliant star turn tom selleck who never better . it also benefits stunning scenery - ironically not wyoming movie suggests , but shot canada . sweeping vistas , free any trace civilization , set against backdrop rockies , stunning superbly photographed . what pulls this above it tv-movie-of-the-week origins sincerity poured into it all concerned , not least prolific director simon wincer ( lonesome dove , quigley down under ... crocodile dundee los angeles ! ) executive producer tom selleck . this fills movie those little , almost subliminal moments which make it feel real . result no classic big screen film , but perfectly judged understated homage bygone era . it leaves us notion , though golden age over , there always real cowboys .	1

small gem made danny devito ' 80s . it made tv movie mocks tv itself . one wonders if corporate media would let anyone get away this today . devito plays small time mafia man aspirations sit com writer . fired tv exec , get revenge his network , signs devito contract his last official act . devito sitcom rip off threes company . premise hunky guy who lives two big breasted blondes . however , devito casts himself lead . network horrified deal tells devito contract null void if ratings [ bad ] . so they schedule show run up against all star game . devito realizes he [ trouble ] . so he gets his gangster buddies abduct key neilson families send them horrifying " cruise " . he then gets some low level thugs sit their homes watch his show . sitcom wracks up record ratings against all star game . suddenly devito hailed creative genius given free creative control network . all his tv shows , however , seem based his limit life . he creates saturday cartoon kids called goombas , couple guys spend all their time wagering over pool farting ( " who cut flounder ?

it seems many us who taking time review this very good movie came away same feeling disapointment weak title lack promotion . i didn't realize until reading others ' reviews movie three hours long because it didn't seem long me . end journey , you understand building wealth , reputation , political idealism ... things which seem matter so much moment , mean very little . possesions mean little . who we , ultimately , means lot ... what left after world takes its toll . i'm usually very attached characters , but perspective this movie wasn't characters . it through larger lens character perspetives seemed small comparison .	1

very powerful , all means . i think it movie enjoyed many . cast amazing redgrave fry . i think this far one best performances jude law lover wilde . i always thought all his performances turn out powerful , honest , but very similar each other general . but here , he molds himself around such different personality , it very hard pass his existence influence story even scenes he not present . both jude law , jennifer ehle ( wife ) could turn out 2 dimensional whatever characters , but they much more than . they not dry , their relationships fry just written , acted , depicted wonderfully . good script , very powerful performances , never loses momentum , decisiveness , or its artistic strength . plus , many young talents orlando bloom , ioan gruffudd , adam garcia , tom wilkinson etc . seen small roles which makes movie seem even more decadent rich .	1

les miserables always wonderful , but dream cast concert surely deserves special mention . i seen dvd five times , still am held spellbound exquisite music amazing performances . it truly dream cast . colm wilkinson delivers his songs beautifully perfected panache . he manages portray valjean both veiled threat ex-convict softened repentance philanthropistic mayor . phillip quast epitomy javert , managing create inspector who both law-bound human once . alun armstrong performs most hilarious thernadier i ever seen , expertly backed jenny galloway . michael maguire passionately fierce enjolras , michael ball performs marius just right touch good humour . ruthie henshaw fantine suitably poignant , while lea salonga clear voice superb acting skills make certain her eponine never forgotten . while i found singing acting fantastic , after few viewings dvd , discerning watcher becomes more intrigued what performers doing while sitting down . interaction javert valjean especially intriguing . it satisfying , too , all those who wished two redoubtable characters could friends . also worth mention heart-stopping rendition you hear people sing end concert performed 17 valjean some world productions . i highly reccomend this production .	1

life great lenny bruce who paved way so many great comedians come . dustin hoffman plays bruce greatly realistic , well valerie perrine bruces stripper wife honey . movie slow going could put anyone sleep , especially those unfamiliar bruce . i suggest watching documentary " lenny bruce : swear tell truth " first get more acquainted bruce comedian . lenny bruce really important figure our american history he tried all his might beat hypocritical system . unfortunately he lost but his work some most important fullfilling any generation because he spoke truth informed all how screwed up it really . i want give this 5 stars because it important film but i said most film drags , especially first half . but i recommend it those who want see great dustin hoffman work those who want familiarize themselves bruce all hype surrounding him . bruce surrounded himself strippers , sex drugs this film documents side him.so those looking comedy very disappointed this full out drama , eventhough their moments bruces routine funny . those looking laugh should check out some bruces work disc . all all i recommend this non-republicans(he he ) open-minds alike	1

if you enjoy music oasis , blur , pulp , verve , this dvd entertaining . granted some its theories revolving britpop movement seem overextended , it still provides bit entertainment . you might not agree some theories , but its still worth listen . anyway , dvd devotes most its time 3 biggest bands time : oasis , blur , pulp . ( well , i guess verve should also included , but i doubt reclusive richard ashcroft willing give interview ) . dvd worth go just great music , hilarious ( on-the-spot ) gallagher bros . interviews , jarvis ' insight . btw , damon albarn comes off real tool . its also interesting they interviewed two delusional members oasis tribute band . i'm still baffled one .	1
yes , that right , if andy kaufman black american , he'd richard pryor . just like andy , this dvd set made me happy , sad , angry , confused , even scared bewilderment ! i laughed " star wars bar , " well , his " white head cage " skit . i cried when i saw sincere heartwarming love shown pieces like " satin doll " even more so endearing " day circus came ghetto " skit . i got angry his various skits where he uses racial slurs , like " " word , etc . but oddly , i almost got panic attack watching probably wierdest thing i've ever seen video which skit ( if you call it ) where richard pretends he little richard singing piano , then suddenly , we see sort pirated signal insanely weird monologue (?) self-confessed lesbian apparently talking herself living room , yet telling string fibs first victim sexual stalking , but then finally admitting she actual stalker herself (?????) . whoah !! jesus christ , weirded me out ! somebody explain one me ? send me e-mail please ! i see alot weird 70 movies shows , let me tell you ! well , regardless , i recommend this if you want know what psychotronic t.v. like ! get these dvd's!	1

tommyknockers one more unsuccessful stephen king adaptations hit screen . originally 1993 tv miniseries , movie suffers lackluster direction , mediocre performances no sense true suspense or horror . typically set homey little new england town , plot centers discovery mysterious object woods local writer ( marg helgenberger ) who her alcoholic poet boyfriend(a poorly cast jimmy smits ) decides keep it secret until whole thing unearthed . meanwhile , ghostly green light emits object , causing townspeople go bonkers one form or , whether it inventing stupid gadgets or wandering around glowing green eyes . three hours , tommyknockers definitely overstays its welcome one problem watching miniseries one take ; it become redundant . tighter direction more focused cast could helped but aside john ashton , eg marshall joanna cassidy supporting roles , most performances seem phone , traci lords ridiculously hilarious postal slut . real misfire	1
i absolutely love atlantis . ronon dex , sheppard , all faces . i'd cry if atlantis cancelled . seriously though , steve should never died , he should also put command sg1 . you imagine ...

my family i saw this movies when it came out 1971 . i 17 . it stuck all us since gone my single most enjoyed film . before it came out vhs much less dvd i only able see it local art house movie theatre . good part , course , i could see it big screen . i always made it point invite someone i knew who not yet seen it . they would always amazed beauty , uniqueness story , tone film emotional music . my wife bought me vhs tape few years ago it perfect gift . i've listed my favorite 280 films it remains firmly entrenched #1 despite other great films made over years . it should probably rated pg or pg-13 due two scenes , neither which graphic but place film above level otherwise excellent movie family . i'd say any kid over age 12 would appropriate . i never tire seeing this movie . it reminds me film version reggae or listening ray charles distinct tone he set , particularly his early years heartache songs . this takes you instantly different pacing life once characters out city outback . core film merging two very different cultures . what becomes clear when this happens anywhere earth what we share common each other , regardless our upbringing . australia also revealed all its raw beauty , enough major element film , almost character . director sense his subject , proper tone set this film very evident . he control , he our guide into this world , trusting him , we rewarded story love , loss , cultures clashing , wild australian outback , native australian merging uk root australians all hands three individuals who child teenagers . innocence boy great treat this film . he able bridge two cultural worlds little effort while his teenage sister aboriginy youth virtually unable cross divide . i've just ordered criterion dvd can't wait see director cut . i can't recommend this film enough anyone 12 or older . it filmed snapshot our world , fresh 1971 but all same lessons fully applicable today . chrisbct@hotmail.co	1
seen dead man walking , i became interested seeing more movies death penalty so i got hold this movie .... i hated it . acting corny cheesy . sean penn performance condemned prisoner facing imminent execution vastly superior definitely more convincing than sharon stone . it beats me why this movie released shortly after dead man walking . fact , it beats me why it released all . stick dead man .... don't bother this extremely lame ripoff	-1

i think if you're going self-respecting zombie , you'd much prefer ability buy canned baby brains delicacy store than bite it out living human . i mean ... you're tired , your muscles feel like sweat socks you don't just suddenly get this urge gnaw living bodies . so that why i so excited when i saw zombies heading mall . hell , yeah , they got baby , right ? wrong ! this just some sick excuse hire your special effects pot buddy who took everything black sabbath sung literally . think it , george romero -- his sick , twisted way -- merely editorializing we should kill all those who aids , just line ' em up row pick ' em off like bottles fence . if they're going around biting peole infect everybody . maybe george just plain hates zombies	-1
amazing , amazing band this dvd really drives this point home . live club performances show their incredible musicianship -- dj bonebrake billy zoom phenomenal ! studio performances show what incredible songwriters artists john exene . video montages throughout put it all into context , made me feel really nostaglic , there nothing quite like superimposing cruise missile over ronnie reagan face bring tear your eye . there also this groovy , artsy video exene white girl really sticks you . no band last 20 years comes close x--x real thing , luckily there unheard music remember them . buy it , watch it , lend it your paperboy , afterwards two you burn all his emo cds start band together	1

i first saw this movie 1956 country town cimema australia . i still enjoy video 2007 . good story line , marvellous ' aluminium overcast ' convair b36 peacemaker intercontinental bomber it sucessor , boeing b47 stratojet very realistically portrayed . june allyson looks ' smashing ' gen . james stewart , he dutch holland lead story character . top it all , jimmy stewart actor air force reserve pilot qualified both starring aircraft . vintage aviation movie i recommend it all aviation buffs .	1
it really seems trend look back past decades ridicule just everything " come before " . it makes me laugh people so smug think " present " perfect . well , i news you . present far perfect there whole lot past much better than it today . movie " valley girl " wonderful example how cool early 80 ! i won't offer review film itself , because that already much better reviewers than myself . i simply say this great youth movie very positive time america . it always great young ... but it totally awesome young early 80's!the dvd features great transfer few nifty " extras " ( 80 trivia track audio commentary director martha coolidge ) . noted few other reviewers , few songs removed film ( this not noted anywhere dvd package ) . also , some reason sound remixed some music placed " background " when it originally quite loud " up front " . since music such integral part this film it shame it altered any way . remember : if you should ever find yourself making fun 80 fashions or haircuts just put valley girl your dvd player so you reminded how fun cool time really . those who truly understand what 80 all make no apologies no regrets . 80 total blast , valley girl wonderful testament fact ! -j	1
`the greatest story ever told ' magnificent . it classic sweep splendor lives up its title . while there some questional interpretations , some scenes unnecessarily plodding , performances strong crowd scenes often rousing . filmed utah , cinematography gives grandeur match film . max von sydow provides proper transcendence jesus , charlton heston demonstrates both passion prudent understatement john baptist . honorable mention goes telly savalas who gives right ambiance pilate . furthermore , judas portrayal conflicted betrayor proper subtlety even if his lines don't always match character . ( " i don't want money , " apostle known robbing common purse , says . ) sal mineo , sidney poitier , donald pleasance myriad others also guest star . even john wayne makes token appearance centurion measured seconds , making ' greatest story ... ' ' bridge too far ' christian cinema . george stevens wrote , directed , produced this epic . his technical aspects solidify masterful treatment . however , one could quibble his directing making it too tame places his screenplay discrepancies . ( example , martha chastises jesus , but bible she says , " even now you could bring him [ lazarus ] life . " ) while stevens ' interpretations substitute scripture places , raising lazarus , jesus triumphal entry into jerusalem , his crucifixion give spark passion this venue deserves . furthermore , implementing handel messiah key scenes masterstroke . all said , ' greatest story ever told ' reverent relevant portrayal jesus his life .	1
when i first saw this movie shelf local video store , i quite bit trepidation . yet , i rented it . now i own dvd , i can't count number times i've seen it . no , it not original concept , no , it not animal house . i don't think they're really trying animal house , though , even if they give quite few nods movie . what this movie , something light comedic you sit back enjoy . comedy crude times but well , play relationships dildo fencing match . i said , you'll either love it or hate it . if you're type person who think any movie you see , you should probably move movie takes itself more seriously , because this one nothing sort . if you're looking animal house , try searching under " animal house " . just suggestion . beyond mere comedy movie , they actually some messages hidden underneath , we're not talking boxers or briefs . it common theme gender perceptions , peer pressure self-esteem . so maybe there something think after all	1
good god , i love media blasters ! every time you turn around , these guys unleashing yet depraved classic years gone past . it seems most stuff they release japanese anime flicks , genre i haven't gotten into serious way yet , but they also make sure release tons gooey gorefests send horror fans into paroxysms joy . they go out their way ( usually ) stuff disc plenty supplemental materials like trailers , interviews , commentaries . doesn't sound like big deal since lots dvds today contain extras , but it lot easier find someone like oliver stone than it uncover whereabouts ruggero deodato or umberto lenzi . heck , these guys actually locate cult favorites like george eastman ivan rassimov order interview them camera ! if you love films delve deep into inner recesses shock cinema , media blasters place you . one film definitely plumbs depths umberto lenzi 1980 gutmuncher " mangiati vivi , " better known " eaten alive . " forget tobe hooper lame alligator flick same name ; this one real deal . " eaten alive " one sicker entries much beloved cannibal genre . helmed director responsible massively entertaining giallo " seven blood-stained orchids , " " mangiati vivi " follows exploits one sheila morris ( janet agren ) she attempts find out what happened her sister diana ( paola senatore ) . dear diana fell jim jones knock off named jonas ( ivan rassimov ) fled new guinea all her money . first , we don't know anything morris dilemma , but we know something isn't quite right new york city . film opens stock footage big apple we see native assassinate some guy blow dart coated poison . few more poor souls eventually suffer same fate , which stymies best efforts new york finest . then morris arrives scene hooks up professor carter ( mel ferrer , who also appeared hooper " eaten alive " ! what chances ? ) , guy who seems know all natives , poison darts , jonas . he directs sheila jonas compound somewhere asia , also puts her contact american expatriate mark ( robert kerman ) , guy who help find diana morris right price . what follows pure italian sleaze mark sheila tramp through jungle find jonas compound . after short stop off abandoned village , where two nearly perish nasty encounter cobra , they finally stumble into jonas " purification village . " then film gets nasty . it doesn't take too long discover jonas unbalanced cult leader who stop nothing protect his flock outsiders . there also tribe dangerous cannibals nearby , tribe nearly finished off mark sheila their journey into village . jonas cannibals don't get all , but there benefit bunch flesh eaters hovering around perimeter ; they keep followers perpetual state fear , which keeps them inside camp further mind control fun games . how jonas keep his followers line ? he makes them drink some sort juice turns them into mindless automatons , starters , then moves tried true methods torture , murder , banishment dissenters into cannibal camp . soon , sheila morris falls under jonas wicked enchantments , leaving it up mark diana plan inevitable escape . it bit frustrating review film like " mangiati vivi " because you can't talk depth atrocities . lenzi throws out bit everything , not only recreating jim jones massacre small scale , grape kool aid all , but also subjecting us cannibal atrocities . final scenes , diana morris cannibal film regular me me lai falling prey cannibals , ranks right up there anything you see deodato " cannibal holocaust . " good reason -- because lenzi stole chunks it deodato " jungle holocaust " feature . he also borrowed footage sergio martino " slave cannibal god . " oops . plagiarism aside , this stuff so deeply disturbing shockingly realistic , least certain parts , one boggles over how something like this ever got made . answer probably lies fact these movies largely appeared 1970s , time when almost anything went cinema . there no way something like " mangiati vivi " would play theaters today , definitely no way lenzi could secure financing such extreme film . if anybody hollywood tried pass this one off studio , his or her career would permanently suffer . extras disc include interviews robert kerman , ivan rassimov , umberto lenzi ; poster film stills ; five awesome trailers such schlock classics bruno mattei " zombi 3 , " " zombi holocaust , " " jungle holocaust , " " zombie 4 , " " mangiati vivi . " listening these interviews lot fun , especially robert kerman . i would never suspected he went lengthy career adult film business after this movie ! unfortunately , rassimov talk less interesting because he doesn't seem remember much making movie . if you feel like jumping into gory cannibal genre , you find plenty here wet your whistle . make sure watch " cannibal holocaust , " " jungle holocaust , " tamer " slave cannibal god " soon after .	1
none three young stars this film - norm macdonald , artie lange or traylor howard - ever became movie stars but they combined make this funny film , albeit what i call lame-brain ( somewhat low-class but effective humor ) one . this not untypical comedy today : tons sleazy jokes , sightgags , lightweight romance story , generally stupid story happy ending ..... yet this one far more appealing than most i've seen .... more i watch it , more i like it ! macdonald very likable guy lead . he just friendly face demeanor him . he makes film . lange bit loud . i'm glad film wasn't longer because lange constant shouting begins become grating . traylor , she acted well pretty face . after watching this twice , i wondered why she never made it , but least she now found tv fame new partner hit tv series , " monk . " two veterans actors here - jack warden chevy chase - play irreverent sleazy roles , something they certainly before ..... well . warden brutal ultimate dirty old man chase smug always . don rickles makes short appearances his normal obnoxious character john goodman makes cameo near end . main story this movie familiar one : revenge , but this time it played strictly laughs , there plenty . movie shows revenge isn't just sweet , it funny . what you say ? movie crude , it sentimental , it fun 82 minutes .	1
i remember seeing this movie years ago college continued like it ever since . movie starts off 1988 calgary olympics . doug dorsey ( d.b. sweeny ) talented hockey player kate mosley ( moira kelly ) pairs figure skater . both mishaps during their big moments , doug suffering career ending injury kate falling during her performace failing meet her own expectations . movie picks up few years later kate trouble getting new partner doug skids unable fulfill his dream becoming star hockey player . added mix kate russian couch anton pamchenko ( played great roy dotrice ) who decides rick kate new partner they struggle get back 1992 olympics . first glance this sports movie figure skating , but not entirely so . scenes involving leads ice surprisingly abstract neither professional skater . truth this character driven story most action takes place off ice . it absolutely charming watch two lead characters go dislike one , extreme rivalry finally ending up love . thing absolutely makes this happen chemestry leads sweeney kelly . they magic together screen , so much so i am surprised they never paired up again movie . i highly recommend this light hearted romance everyone . side note dvd , only special feature theatrical trailer . there no deleted scenes . this where i question , because version film this dvd i've scene tv recent years not one i remember seeing college . i distinctly remember end scene medal ceremony . i somewhat like version because what doug kate won version so much more . so where version alternative ending ???	1

" preachy " ? " self-important " ???? good grief ... some people just feel need throw insults anything . this movie rock solid story family conflicted many different levels , but love still remained . togetherness still remained , no matter how far apart they physically , or depths one them may fall . what great movie this . also , cinematography music outstanding , capturing every moment . it shame some people forget entire scope film , just want jump negatives . you'd really go out your way come up bs like " self-important " , or start jumping " hollywood liberals " rate this any less than 4 stars	1

although it some time since i last saw this film , it my " must " list based wonderful musical score , charismatic leads , its importance vehicle black american talent time when racial discrimination rife . dandridge would true hollywood success story her years hollywood today . america still hesitant give black performers key roles motion pictures . true , we films such cabin sky ( 1943 ) but where film go ? otto preminger must credited taking big chance making this all-black picture concerning carmen jones , who works parachute factory , soldier , belafonte , who must escort her magistrate when she broken law . dorothy dandridge nailed this role carman jones . she catty , seductive , her men wrapped around her finger . harry belafonte sensational joe , naive soldier who becomes prey carman . it interesting watch joe trying tame wild tendencies carman , while love triangle grows outside their relationship . it like watching cat hot tin roof . ( oops , great movie . ) added plus wonderful production numbers dance choreography songs . costume , wardrobe , props reflect culture city slickers country folks , presenting differences lifestyles among characters . these differences became evident dorothy dandridge performance , earn her academy award nomination best actress . halle berry oscar acceptance speech best actress monster ball reminded me just how far we come how long it taken reach this stage journey ! if you haven't yet seen carmen jones - take time view this milestone american cinema history - you won't disappointed .	1
i seen this movie several times videotape am eagerly awaiting criterion collection issue , which it richly deserves . movie set burma ( now myanmar)at end wwii , just after armistice . troop japanese soldiers created very tight-knitted solidarity among themselves through efforts captain inuoe , music teacher . one his soldiers , muzashima , built mastered burmese harp plays it when unit sings chorus . captain inoue troop surrender british , muzashima offers himself negotiator persuade rogue unit japanese soldiers cornered cave give themselves up ; they refuse bombarded killed ; muzashima , however , escapes disguises himself buddhist monk . movie becomes very touching because he tries unite himself his unit , he treated honor moank , he begins behave like monk -- he starts burying proper rituals orphaned , exposed corpses japanese soldiers . he eventually finds his squad ; he stands outside fence prison compound ; soldiers , who believe he killed , recognize him even though they see he become very different person . he serenaded their haunting music , he replies wordlessly playing fareweall song his harp -- but he cannot become one them now , because he found mission : give proper burial all japanese war corpses burma . i cannot justly articulate how deeply touching it see this man , japanese , renounce his homeland his tighly-knit company men he shared deepest experiences -- become solitary , itinerant undertaker completely alien land . there transcendence abandonment self breathtaking . i've seen many movies life christ , but oddly enough , this japanese movie , no theological or ideological intentions , seems capture spirit better than any them . just case you missed point , i'm standing my tiptoes give this movie highest rating i : real masterpiece .	1
like review i just read , tarkovskies ' andre rublev movie i keep coming back over years . it my favorite film until something special comes . more than any filmmaker any country , any language , this movie imparted impressed it viewpoint into my perception . i incorporated it into my vision . i resonate it ... it plays me like bell . it not entertainment really though much it entertaining . this film transcends both entertainment mere artistic success - images themes so spiritually charged archetypically strong one may sense while watching it , he or she remembering half forgotten dreams . like person whose review i just read , i often pause simple wonder after chapter just let it ring . film chronicles life spiritual development russian artist , icon painter andre rublev . epic unfolds 6 chapters last which introduces artist , young church bell maker . chapter reveals aspects components creative process both literally allegory ... one senses filmmaker tarkovsy young bell-maker may great deal common he may written himself into this section .... this last chapter " spring " shot through narrative vitality , energetic quality expression simply colossal - there joy unfolding discovery this bell-makers own creative powers ... all which witnessed aging jaded andre rublev who , witness , transformed what he sees , anyone who eyes see apprehend naked wonder this last chapter . andre tarkovsky made this film what used ussr during period rigid scrutinizing censorship . he used artistic restraints hoops he jump through brilliant advantage carefully codifying individual artistic spiritual themes into chapters this epic . constraints seem served discipline streamline narrative ... result golden ... more truth per foot film than any i compare it . i saw it first video college russian art history class , later bought dvd , more recently attended screening disney studios colleague given invite but couldn't make . i brought someone who just didn't get it . tarkovsy not everyone though you should give yourself benefit doubt because , if he you , you may very well changed touched rewarded again again this truly timeless gem	1
