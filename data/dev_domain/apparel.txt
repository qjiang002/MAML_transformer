this jacket worst outerwear i ever seen , although image might look good here . my size usually medium large , i ordered size medium . however , when i received tried it , i end up look like wearing xxx-large jacket . also , craftmanship very poor , jacket feel uncomfortable not smooth due its uneven cut badly sewing . i hate return anything i order online because i waist my time go post office i pay shipping handling fee . nevertheless , i returned it yesterday . please don't waist your money this order , it not worth it all .	-1

this wallet fifty-fifty . inside great holds cards wallet should . outside , well ... ... uncovered metal clip not press against leather so you need 10 folded bills get right thickness close gap inside clip leather - less than 10 bills expect bills separate wallet - your pocket ( ok ) but not good open . maximum number bills - 20 folded . occasionally press down metal closer leather it gets farther apart it used . metal clip outside not good your trousers . if clip facing out - before too long trouser horrible looking mark rubbing part your thigh against your hand or even worse , other objects . so i started facing clip , resting against my thigh - not very comfortable but not too harsh leave mark your thigh . but `facing ' very awkward when seated , like driving . definitely not designed back pockets . why buy : second wallet ( one should least two wallets - separate credit cards , ids so all not lost if one wallet lost/stolen . put small bills one or two only small limits credit cards your back pocket wallet - pull back pocket one out bandits run away this other wallet you ) . gift any guy - romantic or non-romantic	-1
box it came looked like it torn apart pack wild dogs when i received it . fur falling off coat i pulled it out box . i tried it just see if i'd like replacement since it not perfect condition , it not cute . i immediately returned it	-1
after wearing betula birkenstocks hour , snap button kept coming undone near buckle . happened pretty much every 10 minutes when i walked . midwest wont take them back since i wore them .	-1
item pictured item i wanted ordered . however , item described i received ( halfpant ) , not what pictured . what pictured hi-cut pant . i not realize this until i received order , greatly disappointed . i send everything back . you misrepresenting what you selling incorrect picture item . i actually would give this 0 stars , but computer would not allow .	-1
i ordered what should my size what my size all my other lingerie . there there zero stretch this , it difficult get panties over hips then waist big . since they're short crotch waist anyway , it doesn't much matter . top fits better , since you adjust it . cut still quite poor , again , there no give silk so it feels tight across shoulders . it one thing lingerie snug hips or bust . it when cut so bad shoulders problem . if you're narrow through hips , shoulders or bust , this combo probably nice fit . if you're curvy , you might want rethink this . it shame since it comes plus sizes . maybe i should ordered up two sizes but it should better made truer fit imo	-1
these waste money . they not properly designed cover anything , much less my backside , even though i order what should right size . i realize i lot cover , but i ordered size supposed trick . i've still got pair white i haven't even opened ! won't! it would waste energy !	-1
i bought this shirt last yr my husband . it lasted 6 months . much pilling ( those horrid dots all over fabric ) , seams coming un-done . after 3 washings , it looked like i bought it goodwill , used . i wouldn't even give it 1 star rating . plus , you get advertisments your snail mail this company forever . their advertisments/photos cater gay men . get ready see some very unusual attire . not there anything wrong . ( loved seinfeld episode	-1
my case , boots not quite true size definitely not wide enough . my feet size 14 eee width ( but some ee made wide lasts fit ) . boots i received marked 14 ee but wouldn't even allow my feet half way . i wish they fit because they look good , quality good , price unbeatable . however , i lost $8.50 ups when i sent them back	-1
i looking fingerless gloves wear while i type -- they keep office i work very cold temperatures . these gloves seeemed perfect -- because many fingerless gloves- don't fingerless thumbs -- but these gloves . cost only 2.99 pair black or navy gloves . i ordered black pair . well , knit gloves began fray first wearing- there many stray strands fingers -- they snag easily . they warm i would love them if they not snag fray so easily . but i only pay 2.99 them so i guess it case you get what you pay .	-1
i purchased dopp money clip card holder specific vacation cruise . it nicely constructed but two negatives exposed : one , it only hold six bills two , it demagnetized my room key card twice over eight days . realizing this could also demagnetize my regular credit cards , i removed them card holder . i am reluctant use money clip again .	-1
i bought these shoes wore them my first fitting . end my fitting , my feet throbbing , red , pinched . literally , my pinky toe purple . i bought my true size , but i still don't think these shoes would've wearable even size larger . they must just really narrow	-1
i love colts , but this sweatshirt supposed large , it wierdest fitting sweatshirt i efer seen . shoulders big neck tight . i wear large but i cant wear this shirt because it looks so awkward	-1
it horrible item . if i could given this hairagami no star rating , i would , think i wasted almost $20 this junk . it snaps unexpectedly all time , always while you twirling hair . it totally tangles hair . it nightmare get out your child hair . my oldest , 12 , really wanted this hairagami totally disappointed . she told all her friends not buy it	-1
this seller fails state snap inner lower corner each cup which probably why its so cheap . when i opened package unsnapped cup entire snap fell off . when i emailed alys customer service they said only unopened merchandise returnable . needless say , i don't recommend this bra	-1
i got two problems this here lingeree : 1 . model top page sparkin hot , how come it never looks same my girlfriend ? eh ? false advertizing if ya ask me . their shold law all lingeree models hafta weigh 250 bit hair their legs like my woman . or warnin label " objects inside this lingeree uglier than they appear . " 2 . i paid $14.95 there aint enough there blow yer nose . my suggestion : go crotchless or bustless or fishnet , but all three just not enough lingeree too much girlfriend ..	-1
i agree other review . i love tag-free feeling , but all i liked this bra . fabric seems really cheap . after maybe 6 washings , my barely there cc tagfree feeling flimsy , fabric outside cups started pill . what they charge even basic bras these days , i definitely expect them stay decent shape longer than couple months ! i would not buy one these unless they significantly improved fabric .	-1
i would not buy this product again . it hurts my heeles badly because it so narrow end	-1
maybe i'm naive , but i never could figure out how hooks came out keycase . they spring-loaded , they turn . certain combination push or twist or pull seems necessary get them out . i got one out sheer accident but it . there no directions included . so i'm back keyring that not so bad .	-1
i am great shape . however , i cannot get over so many men underwear products waist bands constrict exasperarate blood flow muscle tension . obviously they made china where average waist 25 inches . idea " medium " marketed ridiculous healthy american standards . my body fat low . i am not profoundly muscular bound . common men my age , lower back problems not unusual . i 32 " waist . not " medium " sized ? i think we simply need get rid elastic waist band altogether . one size fits all doesn't work it dangerous those many us fight our lower back problems . draw string fine . it allows flexibility . so what if your pants fall down ? it seems fashion , anyway . just give us option pulling shorts back up instead pinching nerves static elastic waist band causes ridiculous lower back problems because unnecessary , uncontrollable constrictions . also , these boxers don't hold up well any kind washing . they looked like crap after first time i washed them . i wish i could get refund because i won't wear them again . my life partner told me they looked like " old men " underwear . sad embarrassing because i agree they looked like crap after one cold wash light dry . i am not mean hearted kind guy . so , i am going shut my mouth now not business you again .	-1
this definitely not something i would want wear while working out . even mild exercise lining feels sticky , fabric not appear breathe . i'd rather wear cotton jersey pants than this . cooler weather , i'd prefer something like good pair tights ( sugoi example )	-1
i am tired companies making money off fakes . u.s. government not buy their field jackets china . these m65 o.d. green field jackets not real -- they mid-grade reproductions	-1
you get what you pay , i guess , but i really don't like these boots . they look fine , construction ( appearance ) seems sound ; however they not comfortable . i several pairs skechers sneakers expected these boots comfortable ( least nearly so ) . yet right boot footbed clearly not manufactured correctly , i barely go 8 hour workday wearing them . it feels though there hump under my smaller toes . my foot also seems pronate markedly . left boot doesn't seem suffer same defect . they also very " hard " cushioning ... i can't imagine them worn work environment -requiring- boots . also i've boots less than month laces starting fray where they contact eyelets . i should probably return them defective , but extra shipping fee makes cost prohibitive	-1
i love these socks . they fit great ( my 15 month old daughter thick ankles ) she zoom around kitchen floor not take nose dive into things . :	1
awesome shoes . not necessarily worth outlandish cost but 4 stars nonetheless . i'd recommend them anyone who takes running seriously , who likes look even cooler when doing it .	-1
single style , good shoes . i think nice choice every day work	1
presentation product claer attractive product durable , comfortable goodlooking	-1

not all bras created equal . but what makes it so special ? fuller figured female , let me explain merits : 1)support - it great job . this bra not sag over course day . your figure looks just great evening when you put bra morning . 2)coverage - this gives modest more coverage so people don't see what you don't want them see . starters , fabric thicker than any bra i ever owned . no , this not padded bra , material just thicker . since material thicker , it means it truly opaque . not even thinnest whitest t-shirt you embarassed . 3)comfort - this bra quite comfortable , especially considering it underwire . i not experienced sensation underwire digging nor straps gouging my shoulders . but occassion i feel some pressure one straps ( hence 4 star rating ) . now there few things may give you pause . 1)price - this bra averages $60-65 department stores , not cheap undergarment . 2)size - this bra larger compared other bras same size . what i mean bra defined shape ... it not lie flat cups molded . there more fabric connects cups together . good descriptive word " substantial " , but don't think bulky . this bra disappear under t-shirts giving you beautiful form rather than body marked undergarment lines . this undergarment i intend buy again ... again ... again	-1
i love this bag ! i purchased pink/chocolate color i get alot compliments how cute it . i am my early 20 i 2 half year old this bag hold what i need him well my things still not look bulky or overstuffed same time , very stylish . i really like those trendy baby bags those young moms , but they very expensive . this lightweight , made cotton , so very easy clean . i chose standard shipping it came so quickly . i am very satisfied my purchase	1

my first pregnancy i tried several styles belts , most which wide band back . i am short , short midriff , am overweight , so wider belts would roll top down . i never problem this belt . unfortunately , this pregnancy i am entering my 3rd trimester finally out grown 1x belt , store i purchased it now closed . i thrilled when i found this amazon.com larger size . i recommend making it little snug mornings then loosening it throughout day needed . most appealing feature me this band completely adjustable give you support you need different activities you doing throughout day . any time you start needing extra support , just slightly tighten side straps . when you start relaxing or if belt starts feeling little tight , just loosen it up bit . it quick easy work , if one side needs more support than other , just make one side bit more snug . it awesome ! i am technology education specialist , so i'm my feet , many times , 16 hrs day training supporting hospitals their new computer programs . i couldn't survived even my first trimester without this belt . i raise it little higher back so i complete lower back support belly support . there days when i forgot wear my belt i almost couldn't walk after only 4 hrs work due lower back pain would eventually extend down my fanny legs . my legs would litterally give out underneath me until i could rub relax my lower back while . when you working doctors surgery room or doing rounds them this not good thing . long i wore my belt , i never problem . i strongly recommend this product	1

nicely designed assembled , this backpack great buy . everything works . leather good quality - looks like calf . it comfortable wear back but also top strap carry one hand . strap part armband adjusts ordinary sort nylon strap . i would preferred all leather , but this price ( under $30 ) it quibbling point . inside places your wallet , cell , pda , lipstick , etc . brief shopping sortie , it may carry home all your purchases ( small things ) make you look good while doing it . after all , most people use those cheap nylon backpacks garish colors ( or black , yuk ! ) so you stand out some class . note it best think this equivalent large handbag rather than backpack large enough extended camping trip . look closely description dimentions . you don't want like reviewer who ' thought it would bigger . ' i feel i really got my money worth this . it ships west coast , so expect week or ten days east	-1

i bought these shoes yesterday some research online , unfortunately afterwards , see what people say fit . i originally bought my true size , 7.5 . i tried them store throw-away nylons , my foot slid right , no problem . when i got home tried them again , without nylon sock i would normally wearing them , it way tighter fit , especially across toes . my pinky toe killing me ! i even waited until my feet cold tried them again , walked around bit house , still felt tight started hurt ( didn't hurt heel though ) . i didn't bother trying 8 store because 8s usually way too big me , especially high heels . i'm pretty much always true 7.5 unless i'm wearing narrow-cut ballet flat . i wouldn't say my feet wide , but they not narrow either , maybe if you narrow feet you could wear these easily your true size , everyone else -- go up half size ( especially because patent leather stiffer than regular leather) ! i noticed huge difference feeling width across toes size 8 - my pinky toe no longer strangled . i went back store this morning , tried 8 ( without nylons ) they fit perfectly ! so much so i would say they really comfortable shoes , i wear lot heels because i'm only 5 ' tall .	1

these sandals got best i every worn . they go any outfit . they look great khaki , jean , or shorts . they worn during hiking trips without fear soles punctured brush . it rare see , but betula spinoff birkenstock comes goes every couple years or so . pair im replacing betulas i bought them 3yrs ago . it turns out , you birkenstock sandals repaired over time long cork isnt too badly damaged . all one take them liscensed dealer 25.00 later , you repaired pair sandals . other brands come up knockoffs , but nothing matches true anatomically correct birkenstock . i suggest going store sells birkenstocks seeing what size your largest foot before buying online so avoid hassle mail back sandals trying get correct size . once you all necessary info , you set buy them your feet content . you wont regret buying these sandals . comfort unmatched . it doesnt matter if you using them around house or taking them tour big city . they wont let your feet become weary	1

cheaper variety walmart ( $8.92 versus $19 up ) , no boundaries brand , better me due fact they harder more firm , more like birkenstock cork sole which i also find very comfortable , me anyway . they last longer too not affected heat any way . walmart also real color explosion going . you get some really wild color combinations which give shoe little personality those occasions when you feel need express yourself . so , cheaper price walmart offers , i feel value quality exceeds more expensive brands out there . if you looking firm birkestock type sole , no boundaries brand croc shoe-in , no pun intended .	-1

you always take chance when buying shoes off internet . if they don't fit you go trouble returning them vendor , i , one , really don't want bothered doing . i also hate buying shoes store dealing no customer service , crowds , limited shoe selection . i research before buying shoes internet really examine size i'm getting before purchase . these sauconys fit me very well . size true ; i ordered size 8.5 wide that what they . i them now , they give me very good support . they lightweight give me support ankles i need because i stand work all day . my ankles really feel sore end my shift without proper shoes . also , toebox tapered but there plenty space my toes . shoes provide enough room without looking clunky . i just hope i able buy exact same shoe when time comes replace them . why shoe companies insist discontinuing perfectly good style ? this makes it so much harder purchase shoes internet	1

slippers themselves good quality unlike many current styles flatter level ( which i like ) . they not built-in arch support ( i not like built-in arch supports so this plus me ) . they washable which plus because my opinion too many slippers marketed today not washable i not purchase slippers i cannot wash . even sizing appropriately my opinion , you should able order whatever slipper size you comfortable without concern . only drawback ( it big drawback ) plastic cords inserted into product keep them together : one inserted incorrectly result plastic could not totally removed . because i cannot wear slippers . plastic inserted through bottom middle slipper after removing plastic we discovered portion it coming up through slipper bed there no way remove it . so , if you're looking decent slippers these fulfill but quality control plastic inserts might pose problem . frustrating but product itself five-star .	1

hane comfort briefs my husband favorites . first pair he came free multi-pack regular briefs . i then sought out comfort waist brand bought colored " mid-rise " style he didn't care much he prefers fit regular waist . only similar comfort waist style i could find these white briefs . he loves them . i wish hane would make colors this style , but i find it even somewhat difficult find these white ones . i can't imagine they no market men enjoy comfort , would appreciate variety tastful colors , but like normal waist fit . regardless minor frustration , i highly recommend these . my husband never mentioned they too loose around legs , though he quite muscular thighs .	1

when i first saw dress , it $18 , then next day it $22 . they would not sell it me $18 , lady phone said it might even go up higher . i bought red blue . then , week later , they went back down $18 before i received dresses . dresses not look like picture site . dress longer than site . site shows it above knee , two i received , below knee , almost mid-calf ... i'm 5'9 . it " halter " top . site , i think they just rested straps over her shoulders not tie behind her next . also , i knew dress cotton , not t-shirt cotton sundress . now , i two dresses i'm not really happy w/ . i haven't time return them . i bought them looking sundress wear out ... this , i would probably only wear beach cover up or pool . haven't decided . once i get around getting post office , i plan returning them . i keep trying them , thinking , " ok , it only $20 , i should keep them . " but i most probably would not bought them if i tried them store . they would look cute if they shorter , but more money i would spend shorten dress . so it really worth it ??? haven't decided yet . fact i can't decided what w/ them , makes me believe i need return them . if i loved them , i would already worn them , but i haven't . only nice thing i say , pattern colors ( both red blue ) really pretty . i would happy if dresses above knee , not t-shirt cotton . very disappointed .	-1

some reason , parasols photosensitive hard find -- most hideously expensive not very good looking . house rice silk parasol , however , exception rule . they manage pretty , useful surprisingly sturdy . except white , painted handle , parasol frame entirely made bamboo . it looks fragile , but surprisingly sturdy , especially since it bound together colorful threads bamboo pegs . over asemi-transparent pale yellow silk canopy , matching ribbon top hang it . how it stand up sun ? well , silk technically transparent , but when unfolded it provide certain amount shade -- same pair sunglasses . aesthetically , it also very good , simple unadorned except few extra scraps silk , but very elegant understated . only problem keep parasol open , you essentially shove it up onto jutting wedge bamboo . it bit pain close . house rice silk parasol meant look pretty , but it also used parasol origina function . definitely good find , if you get it closed easily	1

much more confortable than i thought , i'm used wearing pumps every day . they may run little snug , so if you're going wear w/out hose , you might go up half size . i'm very pleased this purchase	1

i love calvin klein shirts . they fit slim tight so they're not everyone but if you like fit then they you . careful thought because ck makes some cheaper shirts don't hold up well , but these stretch ones terriffic worth price . spread collar nice because it not too huge -- i read if you long face ( opposed round ) then spread collar best , seems true .	1

if you're tired one-color dri-powers ( which very functional ) this adds bit style keeps original functionality . particularly if you huge expanse shoulder-to-shoulder area , this breaks up monotony little . monocolor dri power tees work fine but these make wear interesting enough not look like something you'd wear shirt , not under your shirtthe material just good , wicking away sweat fast . i've realized wicking keeps dampness creating gym sock smell . fresh sweat , gross it sounds , doesn't sickening odor . when it gets evaporate fast , you last little longer before smelling like socks . i find dri-powers most valuable if you go bike get coffee or small groceries you don't want people store maintaining perimeter around you	1
i bought these shoes go black dress i recently purchased . i hate get new pair shoes one outfit but there no way around it . i'm short but hard time shoes any kind heels because my feet fairly wide somewhat flat . i'm usually mindset you get what you pay but this case its not true ! these shoes not only inexpensive but extremely comfortable wear they're adorable !	1

these slippers wonderful . they really warm , they strong supportive enough you go outside them ... like get mail .... soles thick enough , so if you step rock you won't get hurt . when they get dirty you throw them wash all your other clothes , theyu come out like new . i recomend puting them dryer though , bring them back their " brand-new " quality , even though they dry just fine without dryer . only reason thses slippers not 5 stars because they tend hold smells , so inside footbet get kinda smelly after while . but despite this i strongly reccomend these slippers .	1
i just got this shoe it awesome . it comes 1/2 size too big though . nice leather sooo comfy . there actually little padded arch support . great shoe	1

well , why not ? you've got very decent amount colour choices , you pick brass silver buckle . i picked silver black combination , when it shipped it more then i expected ; same exact thing local mall you would pay twice much that not considering tax . only difference this one other belts similar design i've seen they all seem logos , either engraved or cut out . i don't enjoy sporting i giant logo my waist . i much rather get what i want pay less it . buckle not design opens closes , rather you slip belt through buckle tighten it sliding metal bar foward . if you close it tightly enough , it hold lot weight , far more then open/slip belt through/close buckle belt design . i carry bunch things mine , including heavy multi-tool , knive , phone , several pouches filled various manner junk , tape measure , occasionally heavy construction tools . granted belt wasn't meant this kind weight but ... normally after few minutes my old buckle would just pop open weight ... no such problem here . it opens closes without trouble fit large waist easily . what more you want belt ?! =) andrew christian speedy enough shipping it ; it came few days after my amazon order , which 3-5 business days . great deal	1
