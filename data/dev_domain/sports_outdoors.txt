first i very happy this stroller . i love big wheels , front one which swivels . cup holders convenient both parent baby . adjustable handle awesome because i'm short i push stroller comfortable height . also it maneuvers very easily up down curbs , steers easily even one hand everywhere mall , museum , park , or city streets . one biggest drawbacks me reclining seat back . there drawstring you must adjust . this requires two hands difficult times if child fussy or uncooperative . despite this , i still loved stroller until recently . however , after only two months use , my stroller not lock . it actually folded up my son while pushing it . i now cannot even seem lock it into open position use . i not found any levers snap place hold it open . because stroller folds outward , not inwards like umbrella stroller , it actually pulls childs body backwards when locks give out . this very dangerous . i am contacting manufacturer this defect	-1

i've always loved victorinox swiss army knives , but i must admit i when i purchased this one , i not sure if i made right choice , but my expectations soon exceeded . it right before trip boundary waters canoe area wilderness minnesota , i lost my other swiss army knife ( tinker ) , i looking versatile knife locking blade . i not need dozens other tools my pending stay wilderness . i settled this one because it sale , i not disappointed . handle mild contour made it very comfortable handle . its size , it just right heft , but it not too heavy weigh down my shirt ( where i kept it my buttoned breast pocket ) . 4 " locking blade worked wonderfully . i could close it either one or two hands . when closing it , blade pauses halfway point , reducing risk closing it your fingers when closing it one-handed ( said , it not eliminate all risk , so close knife one hand your own risk ) . during my recent canoe trip , i lost my fillet knife portage trail surprised cleaning 24 " northern pike this blade quite painless ( though it take some skill ) . beyond blade , i've always found leather awl screwdriver handy , but opener blade primary reason why i prefer victorinox swiss army knives over those produced wegner . knife shipped simple cardboard box . sheath or pouch would nice , but i able fabricate one duct tape before my trip . since i kept it my shirt pocket most my trip , sheath wasn't necessary , but it one accessory you should consider purchasing if you choose this knife . i recommend getting one . you not disappointed	1

experienced cyclist who relocated manhattan summer `04 , i wanted purchase most theft resistant chain available . my ambition use my trek 3900 both exercise transportation , while not constantly worry it it stolen . experienced several bicycle bicycle part thefts boston chicago , i decided thoroughly research bicycle chains locks . stories vulnerability u-locks clearly stated kryptonite null-and-void-in-new-york warranty steered me towards hex chain made onguard . previous owner kryptonite master u-locks , i initially wanted stick tested brand . however , lessening appeal kryptonite locks widely publicized story 2004 explaining how design flaw certain models allowed them compromised bic pen (!) , causing recall . chicago , i frame destroyed when one thief attempted break master u-lock long pipe . while this failed attempt slightly bent u-lock , it collapsed main tube bicycle . hence , i thought using chain manufactured slightly lesser-known brand without publicized vulnerabilities would good idea -- much like purchasing mac would protect against windows viruses . after one year use , i very happy 12mm beast chain . 9.5 pounds , this chain upper limit what one affix bicycle still able ride it . my case , i am able rap it around seat post enough clearance my legs . typical bicycle , chain adds 40% overall weight . when i purchased this lock , i unaware 14mm , 15 pound version existed . even so , i would not purchased this model , which more appropriate motorcycle or piece construction equipment . design beast chain exemplary . addition very long , thin keys complementary keyhole , there sliding keyhole cover , making mechanism very corrosion pick resistant . thick polyethylene coating may serve similar purpose while preventing freezing , which used savvy thieves make lock more brittle . record , i used commonly available electronics freezing spray embrittle earlier-generation kryptonite lock when i lost key . five hits over-sized hammer , protruding barrel lock supporting metal cracked right off . pretty scary . while no chain eliminate possibility bicycle theft , i still my trek . it impossible tell what tactics thieves employ next . it seems unlikely conventional pair bolt cutters could cut this chain . when i emailed onguard customer service , they no straight answer its cut resistance . my impression only oxyacetylene torch or hydraulic cutter could break links . both techniques would attract great deal attention . hence , secured beast chain , your bicycle safe one get public area .	1

purchased christmas present 12 y.o. daughter . two positive things first all : we little late ordering , so scheduled ship after xmas , but actually arrived 5 days before ; also price excellent amazon -- local stores selling exact same product twice price -- free shipping . assembly : i read other reviews little apprehensive , but i also checked owners manual online ( always good idea ) check out step-by-step before i purchased , it seemed doable . it definitely challenge effort , but not horrible . instructions say you need 2 people , but it definitely helps more -- often one person needed just sort through parts while other two hold assembly . we 3 adults 12 year old everyone kept busy . biggest problem there lot steps , but you can't intuitively figure out where directions leading you until you get end--it lot like doing your taxes . one very important recommendation : parts come numbered bags -- numbers correspond steps assembly--don't take pieces out bag until you need them . confusing aspect : one bag parts might used 3 or 4 different steps some bolts nuts look very similar so you check , double check , triple check before using them . one step , size bolt needed not match size-matching template printed instructions . it took us 4 hours put it together -- this definitely process you not want rush through . once put together , it nice product . those looking purchase something like this , i would definitely not get anything smaller 50-inch backboard -- it not big . it sturdy portable , height adjustment works fine . we filled it sand , which performs better , but which we probably regret when day comes take it apart we figure out what 350 lbs sand . however , this out cold weather so water out question . i ultimately purchased this model because it seemed like value performance made it worth rigors installation . i knew what we getting into when we ordered it , it worked out exactly i anticipated . so , get some friends , patient , measure-twice/bolt once , make sure you someone analytical mind managing parts , few hours , you nice hoop .	1

i rather lost my love swimming since i cannot see well without wearing contacts , chlorine irritates me twice bad while wearing them . i used several different brands goggles my contacts over years overjoyed when i ran across these . i debated brand i am familiar but reading reviews , i admit i wasnt really liking them many reasons mentioned product , so , i took chance . you cannot go wrong money these , they fit comfortably , could substitute my regular glasses pinch , after small amount adjusting they very leak proof wide field vision . strap adjustment bit tedious manipulate , but definate good thing , once you them ' dialed ' there no chance they slip or move out adjustment it uses very clever locking mechanism lock straps place , rather than double strap through buckle design seems all prevelant . my eyes available powers offered so , i went closest step down my prescription , figuring additional distortion water would even things out , but , i see quite clearly them both out water . if you need some vision correction , don't like fiddeling contacts pool i not , you simply must own these goggles	1

i this trailer 5 days used it 5 days row . 3 days jogger stroller 2 days bike trailer . * it easy set up take down . yes it take little time but i am getting good it . i don't feel like you need " strong " either . * we live apartment carry this item our back patio through our apartment front so compact light issue me since i one mostly using it . i am glad we went aluminum , it light . it fold down nicely even wheels i still get it through apartment without hitting furniture . pros : * bike trailer it pulls smoothly . * easy put my mountain bike . * i feel it made well safe . * my 2 � yr old seems comfortable it loves pockets her treats/drinks . there even compartment my backpack . * it simple transition into jogging stroller . * stroller it light easy push until .... cons : * it seems there not enough weight up front so front wheel wobbles uncontrollably which makes it impossible push . i lift it then set it down again get it go straight . i end up jogging front wheel held up , which not fun . however , i guess i could buy jogger stroller really meant jogging but they shouldn't promote it stroller if you can't push it . i am going contact company see if there way fix this problem . * 5-point harness no different other trailers i seen . they seem flimsy little stiff attach ring . * today i got home ride realized flag missing . i am guessing it flew off when i going down hill . * i hope canvas holds up . there already two very small holes where flag inserted rubs . * rubber clasps stroller handle already coming off . all all i am happy product price . just few concerns mentioned above . i am not hard-core rider but intend use product frequently so i hope it holds up . it seems sturdy well made but time tell .	1

if you bamboo floors i highly recommend this stuff . it erase all tiny scratches seem accumulate so easily these floors . it works pretty well masking deeper gouges , but it isn't perfect . someone looking still able spot gouge , but it usually good enough get your security deposit back . yes , price shipping more than price product , but it not like every hardware store carries this stuff . i checked my area , no one carried it , so i ordered it online . even shipping costs , it still worth it	1

two amazon statements this product absolutely misleading : 1 . " usually ships 24 hours " . it actually took 1 week ship it . 2 . when i finally received package it turned out watch didn't " leather band " . band made artificial materials ( nylon rubber ) or something like . i return it	1
our three year old twins received two these cars christmas . joystick control broke one cars one hour after they received them christmas day ! my husband ordered replacement car then shortly after , other cars ' joystick control broke ! so , now we stuck two broken cars one work , but wondering when one break too ! i need mention kids not particularly rough cars ; we right there when other car broke not witness any rough behavior . controls cheap break eventually . cars very loud , but positive side , kids love them provide fun entertainment them . i would definitely not recommend this product	1
it best price around when it finally showed up my door i couldn't wait put it together until it harder than it looked . you should use more than one person put it together maybe it my fault but net not fast nor easy set up , just like box says it challenge . extremely ! i would not recommend this product someone who no time nor patience hour long set up process . i recommend anything folds up quick pops up into position . but extreme deal would actual 10x10x10 cage you could get online less than 500$ . you might spend money but not deal headaches over over again putting this together well worth it . find your self area out side build your real cage enjoy it all year long . nets not worth time nor money , balls still fly up out net , you really close fabric just like tent . much force im hitting balls it wont long till material damaged . dont waste your money even if you get it 60 bucks . wind always win , once it catches sail it tumbles like sage grass . get bigger better deals real cage	1

very lightweight , fragile , poorly finished . not sure what " hardwood " actually . it looks oak-like , but far too lightweight it size . it came bit rough splintery only got worse over time . lacquer or whatever it they finished it developed spiderweb cracks almost immediately then began flake off . i only used it kata ; didn't feel safe actually hitting anything it let alone using it defend against weapon tandem drills . after few months very little use , mostly sitting rack , it began develop cracks . perhaps it wasn't dried properly when they applied finish ? regardless , one i received ( 50 " model ) cheap junk . you get what you pay ... not only not recommended , but downright dangerous if you hit anything it . spend little more get better quality	-1

this imported ' sword ' actually long dagger , size wwii-era bayonet . scabbard it all 15 inches . construction , fitment parts , finish , overall quality poor . definitely mass-produced , low quality item . blade plain stainless steel would not hold edge . it would properly labeled " masonic-ish " sword symbolism handle , guard , scabbard not strictly conform those any branch masonry . there prominent red crosses few knights templar-ish symbols but no one knows anything masonry would mistake this genunine implemen t.t he blade sharply pointed so this not something children should play ! it looks okay hanging wall ( scabbard ) but all it good . price not bargain , it right chinese-made import this size quality . long you don't expect more what i described , you might like this item	-1

i bought this watch one design sailboat racing , it many thoughful improvements over other watches/countdown timers . it countdown timer sync button reminder beeps , tack/gybe angle calculator benzel like " one-wheel " musto compucourse or citizen sailhawk or navisail . it fits nice niche below expensive full function regatta watches like citizen sailhawk suunto regatta would shame beat up while racing , more features than inexpensive timex ironman or optimum time series race watches . pros : -countdown timer beeps minute every 59 seconds , every ten seconds last minute , every second last ten seconds . -count up or repeat option after countdown complete . repeat doesn't stop after seven times unlike casio watches . -long hold required stop countdown timer . electronic lock sync button manually activated . -countdown particular time so race committee start gun exact minute ( like 11am promptly ) . -tactical benzel click stops every five degrees so less likely drift lose track wind direction during race . -reasonable large numbers countdown timer-nice euro look isn't fugly imho unlike old musto competition watch or ronstan clear start watch so it worn outside race course . -left out silly sensors such electronic compass , barometer , altimeter useless day racing makes watch more afforable than suunto sailing watches these functions . -one design class legal because it doesn't built gps . still love my foretrex 201 races which allow them , but this looks like good pre-start timer strict od class regattas don't allow gps . cons : -benzel only click stops but no lock so drift during normal sailboat operations . -no 5-degree markers benzel interpolating 15 degree labels result errors . also no 70 degree or 80 degree tack angle marks watch inside benzel . why doesn't someone come out cheap digital tack angle computer watch help us joes poor memory remember tack angles ? calculation tack angles easy . its hard recalculating tack angles detect headers/lifts because you forgot numbers while steering boat puffy , choppy conditions while simultaneously looking air , looking mark , jostling dozen other boats going upwind . -non-intuitive buttons menus strange short or long press certain buttons different functions requires time spent instruction manual scratching one head . -not all functions documented instructions such logbook . -silly designers mixed up starboard port tack angle arrow colors . arrow pointing 45 degrees left north would port direction , but starboard tack should green . gybe angle colors correct .	1

this heavy bag stand pretty good piece equipment . heavy bag part it definitely requires add'l weight ( hint : bags sand much cheaper than amount barbell plates you'll need keep this thing moving - i use 200 pounds bags sand keep it place . also sure you get double end heavy bag too ( i.e. one bottom d-ring ) , otherwise you'll get too much bag swing . you also put true double end light bag this portion unit , which nice change pace heavy bag . ( light double end bag small inflatable two bungees holding it chest level reverberates like mad when you hit it . ) speed bag platform bit flimsy , especially earlier models where " drum " or rebound board two pieces ( latest versions this model use single piece drum ) . if you become moderately proficient speed bag any amount time you'll outgrow this aspect unit . part problem single vertical pole which speedbag drum attaches flex when you get bag moving really fast , throw off your timing . use smallest size speed bag possible minimize this inertia . lastly , speed bag platform doesn't really adjust high enough people over 6'2 " height , if you're over 6'1 " or so you're going need use small or xtra small speed bag it hang correct height ( i.e. belly bag mouth/chin level )	1

any sword only $15 fact very dangerous . these swords called wallhangers because they only designed hung wall , not swung . reason underneath handle very small piece metal connects blade itself . ( called tang ) real martial arts sword , tang normally thick piece metal almost thickness sword itself . if you swing wallhanger too often or too hard it break tang , fly off hurt someone . if you want learn more how dangerous these wallhangers google search words : anatomy wallhangerany sword designed real martial arts practice- like iaido , starts $250 not $15 , should bought reputable iaido store . ( sorry i am not allowed recommend web sites here ) . so smart , either hang this sword back wall , or throw it out before your baby brother/sister hurts someone	-1

past couple decades , only real name pocket flashlights maglite minimag . used police professionals alike , even honored design awards , minimag pretty much ran show since it introduction 1984 . sure , light output just decent , " beam focus " feature gimmick no one really used , but well-engineered flashlight , it couldn't beat . until now . it classic david vs goliath tale - fenix p1d-ce small even small flashlight scale , keyring small , silly small ; picture cylinder roughly half height aluminum soda diameter nickel : that kind small we're talking here . it doesn't even look real ; size combined perfectly smooth exquisitely faceted exterior gives impression this perhaps 1/2 scale mock up actual flashligh t.t he disbelief continues you remove fenix it slightly-larger-than-a-cigarette-pack box . p1d-ce without battery weighs 27 grams , or weight 27 paper clips . more precisely , that less mass than ipod nano . that * less than one ounce * . but feel without question cold unyielding touch heavy-gauge type iii aluminum , lens not just actual glass , but perfectly flat coated optics-grade glass . size might not serious , but engineering certainly . yet all dimensional absurdity just prelude light itself - this where real ridiculousness begins : light phosphor-white ( similar hid car headlight color ) , but plainly speaking , there more it than physically possible object this size . it would make more sense if someone standing behind you spotlight , or perhaps if fenix nuclear-powered . p1d-ce produces * more than twice total light output 4 cell full-size maglite * . point fenix ceiling unlit room area lit more ambient light than 15 watt light bulb . license plates street signs hundreds feet away blaze life night . shine it your eyes you're legally blind next twenty seconds . course , unless you turn it down ... if fenix engineers weren't content alien-technology light source , p1d-ce also includes " modes " which give you range lighting options . you probably don't always want walk around flashlight blazing full-tilt , so there low , medium , high settings . twisting head flashlight turns it , twisting it off again moves it into next mode . there also " strobe " mode , which flicks light off quickly stroboscopic effect , sos , allowing you send emergency signal automatically without further touching flashlight all . all this powered - ( drum roll ) - one battery . no fumbling giant family packs box store batteries just get some light , single 123a lithium battery ( sold overpriced your local store " photo batteries " section , find them online less than $2 each ) powers everything . battery life varies wildly modes - low mode net you over 10 hours , while high suck cell dry less than hour . but key here " intelligent " circuitry ; unlike flashlights old , where you could determine battery life how bright light , fenix employs power regulator circuit - no more slowly fading light over time , leaving you wonder if flashlight really bright it could ; p1d-ce just bright when batteries first installed nearly all total runtime . means low setting , ninth hour beyond just bright first few minutes . since it lithium battery , months shelf time doesn't make difference . so what fenix secret ? it all comes down led technology , durham , north carolina-made cree led p1d-ce fine example . just you buy led light bulb your house which uses less than tenth energy incandescent bulb , same concept works just well flashlights , people starting notice - these super-small , super-efficient led flashlights all rage nowadays ; police departments actually doing away old full-size maglite replacing them newer better mini led lights , which p1d-ce large margin brightest most versatile . you're only $70 away dumping your vintage incandescent antique joining them . five tiny but beaming stars fenix remarkable introduction 21st century lighting technology . ( addendum : what new led minimag ? maglite new led series minimags less than half light output fenix , their " energy management " circuit doesn't quite live up it name , so light gradually dims over time like most other flashlights . led minimags also larger heavier than incandescent originals , still use plastic lens prone scuffing , still use type ii aluminum collects nicks scratches over time . powered regular aa cells [ no brightness options ] , battery life most four hours until completely dead , plus there no polarity protection ; should you accidentally place batteries backwards , light destroyed . led minimag definite improvement over original , but not quite par fenix .	1

i've got relatively small knife collection ( maybe 15 blades ) , but this one i tend carry every day . i've got few kershaws , speed-safe opening what initially attracted me brand . said , while it cool way open knife , i've ultimately decided it mostly gimmick . i find it just fast , somewhat easier , open knife thumb stud . my collection 3 other kershaws : two chives avalanche . leek best size carry/defensive knife . blade long without cumbersome , shape sleek manageable . knife also good chores , although anything really heavy , i'd use bigger blade like avalanche or blur . black finish nice -- although truthfully , my leek titanium oxide ( rainbow ) . one my chives black , though , finish sleek holds up well . this knife definitely worth price	1

i carry least one swiss army knife me every where i go ( except plane , course ) . this 3 1/2 inch all-purpose tool suitable your pocket , glove compartment or tool box . this knife dozens uses do-it-yourselfer , gardener or camper . this little wonder large small knife , corkscrew , punch , opener flat blade screwdrive end , bottle opener flat blade screwdriver end what purports wire stripper side ( i never used ) , key ring , tweezers toothpick . this knife water resistant made high quality components . i tend use knives pocket knife more than any other tools . after i find combination one knives tweezers useful splinters thorns , thus tweezers often become third most useful tool . i must admit occasionally i use toothpick , particularly when real toothpicks not available . smaller screwdriver blade small enough it also fit into phillips head screw . i even able use flat blade some small internal hex head screws . i never used corkscrew , i used punch awl . opener blade yet used this knife well . difficulty carrying tools they fill your pocket very quickly . this small swiss army knife small enough fit into purse or pocket yet large enough useful . while larger swiss army knives even more larger tools blades , they also harder carry . course this particular knife not replace tool box , but i find it amazing how many tasks i accomplish simple tools available this gem .	1
used this pedometer several weeks i found it not always record your activity . like previous reviewer , i noticed my first usage it may not record your steps when you not walking quickly . but past few days i also found it not always record vigorous walking either . it simply stops recording entirely times . i pedometer , costing less than half what this one cost , without all bells whistles , but it accurate dependable . this product not only not worth price charged it , but given its inaccuracy , not worth any price	-1

i'm very satisfied this lifetime basketball system . amazon free shipping great , but somewhat slow . i assembled setup unit myself , but times two people would convenient . if assembling yourself , just sure you few things like garbage cans or boxes support it when needed . i even raised hoop myself , which pretty easy . i found instructions sufficient , not terrible , but not great either . first thing i inventory parts nothing missing . there no extra parts either . i recommend you inventory parts if no other reason than become familiar many parts . some readers felt optional drill bit needed . this isn't case because all screws self tap also self drilling . i never used drill bit . but sure you good power drill drill drive screws where needed . i careful took my time assemble unit . i guess my assembly time 6-1/2 hours , i assembled it multiple times . there few confusing steps but little thought it fiqured out drawings . instructions mostly assembly drawings rather than step step detailed explanations what . hoop mechanism raises lowers ease . i filled base water system seems sufficiently stable . i spoke lifetime they recommend not using antifreeze . they said base designed withstand freezing water expansion contraction . i didn't use sand because fill opening so small i imagine it would quite problem emptying base sand if i move unit someday . i think this system excellent value , but i noticed amazon significantly raised price since i purchase mine 1 month ago	1

resident pacific northwest person new sport triathlon , i confronted unfortunate truth this winter - there not many good biking days after september . work , weather , sun deprivation , i finding it hard regularly fit trip gym ride , much less get my bike . minoura hybrid trainer tops my christmas wish list . i looked into other options , minoura seemed like good point entry . fluid/mag hybrid touted low noise " road-like " , but overall cost i still found affordable . i quite happy since i first unpacked it . my observations : 1 ) instructions simple actually written english ( welcome change over all-graphic instructions all too common ) . one point unclear use skewer ( crossbar through rear wheel ) . skewer provided , but my bike fit fine using skewer already rear wheel . 2 ) once assembled , it quite simple attach bike . i spend more time getting my shoes , shorts , towel my workout than i putting bike trainer . 3 ) balance stability good . i not any concerns , even when listening ipod or otherwise not devoting full attention . 4 ) most important aspect , workout , exactly what i wanted . i'm able get my heart rate up whatever training zone i want . resistance provided magnet smooth proportion effort i expend . need simulate intervals ? no problem . resistance changes nicely each shift gears . when workout ends , my thighs " feel it " like they would after similar length time effort road . 5 ) riser block nice touch ships same package trainer . 6 ) consider getting training aid encourage you vary workout . otherwise , it too easy get steady cadence not vary it through duration workout .	1

first , this beautifully designed built machine . rowing action smooth closely resembles feel rowing shell . it quiet easily adjust people differing heights . while machine large foot print when use , it easily fold into compact size storage or simply clear floor space . due quietness this device , it joy listen music or watch movie while working out . other exercise equipment i too noisy this . others stated , it easy under estimate amount exercise you're getting . even though i often end hour rowing feeling like i really haven't much , feeling my legs when standing up afterwards lets me know i've good workout . assembly time consuming , but not really difficult . other reviewers stated , parts high quality , finish fit excellent . three minor problems i've encountered easily fixed : 1 ) smooth cement floor , machine tended drift during long work out . carpeting or rubber pad under machine fixed this . 2 ) hard plastic handles become slippery when wet sweat . wearing pair cotton work gloves resolves this problem extra benefit protecting your hands friction handles . 3 ) shipped , foot straps tend work loose during exercise . this due assembly problem factory . when straps properly positioned , they don't slip . fix this problem , remove two screws ( one each foot plate ) hold straps position . while you're it , you might want reverse one straps so both buckle outside your feet . when you tighten straps , position them so back buckle touches foot plate . this leaves end strap going through buckle pulling same plane buckle . loosen strap , pull end buckle away your foot , increasing angle which strap enters buckle . straps loosen during exercise because factory setting leaves end strap pulling angle buckle . very slight change this angle sufficient loosen strap . note i didn't try replace two screws . replacing screws buckle properly positioned may make it easier tighten straps . despite minor problems mentioned above , this excellent machine well worth expense . it clearly deserves rating five .	1
this fine weapon average citizen who not inclined carry knife or handgun , but it cannot effective cane or police baton , two other alternatives consider . cane perhaps most innocent seeming yet it reach advantages over kubotan deal most damaging strike . above review good one , but please ignore advice sharpening keys using kubotan flail . this unlikely provide any real stopping power determined attacker . kubotan excels loadfist weapon , so use it enhance your hammerfist punch strikes . you also use point ' stab ' your attacker body points bony targets like back hand excruciatingly painful when struck . other words use kubotan like it intended so . nowhere any traditional yawara training it used like mini-flail like above poster suggested	1

rechargeable flashlights sensational idea - essential part any family emergency kit ( ecologically smart boot ) . while this product satisfactory , say , science demonsration faraday principle , its usefulness flashlight considerably more limited . its credit : this flashlight meant last , stand extremes water temperature . when dropped into water , it float beam-side up easy retrieval . it so sturdy tha , it likely last lifetime user - you can't say too many products . shake this light while , disk rare earth conducts enough current sustain light small amount time . while you may read claims up one or two hours , faint but workable current only lasts ten minutes , then you shake again . again . long you don't mind repetition , wan stream bluish light serve your purposes blackout or some other emergency . but don't entertain thoughts you'll able read , find small objects , or perform any kind detail work . if you don't chance compare this its better competition , you might not know say , sherpa xray offers well-focused beam you read . while no rechargeable give you kind illumination you'll find traditional flashlight , your options brighter if you stay away diamond gen . invest something more powerful you'll find flashlight usefulness becomes considerably greater . this flashlight disappointing , useless any practical context	-1

ok , i really thought this ball would great considering overinflated price since it endorsed nba . not so ! this ball feels very similar cheap $20 balls you get your local department stores ! feels similar wilson ncaa solution game ball , but slightly less tacky , but since it pumped up so much inorder it actually bounce it feels almost like rubber . i personally not like . this ball supposed able played out box , without break period . well , i hope it gets feeling better over time , but since it supposedly not break period , i am very skeptical . i honestly not feel " crosstraxxion " design anything improve feel or grip ball . if you like feel leather , this not you . i am not impressed ! search reviews this ball before purchasing ! only thing you this ball you can't others , say " well least this official game ball pros use !

i am personal trainer i asked friend check this " elliptical " strider out them . i suspicious price thinking it really couldn't elliptical machine but checked it out anyway . i suspected , this simply glider similar what infomercials years ago . except tony little tv glider most those 20 or more gliders market all gone . there simple reason true elliptical machines so popular health clubs there no gliders health clubs . ellipticals treadmills users lift their legs each stride which course more like natural motion walking running . this course engages many more muscles than gliding or swinging machines past . also ellipticals flywheel allow user add resistance while still keeping smooth motion . i've read other reviews this machine realize certainly any movement better compared doing nothing . but it question time . you could swing one these machines hours while it might kind fun some people it never come close true elliptical . i'm not promoting any one brand i no ax grind , except it somewhat annoying when companies like sharper image continue intentionally mislead public because they know it sells products . reason elliptical machines called " elliptical " user foot goes through elliptical path . gliders just swing back forth like pendulum . if you don't believe me ask any trainer or exercise physiologist . this misleading marketing no doubt they know they using name cash popularity real ellipticals . my advice my friend save little more money get elliptical .	-1
idea behind this propane stove grill fantastic . you regular burner , small grill same time . execution , however , leaves lot desired . fit finish this product extremely poor . out box , paint flaking , various pieces required adjustments pliers just make them fit . igniter mechanism my unit worked very well grill part but very badly burner par t.t he grill plate aluminum some kind coating already scratches when i received unit . reading other reviews i can't help but wonder if there two different grills sold under same stock keeping unit number : bad kind good kind . if so unfortunately mine bad variety .	-1

drishti yoga strap just great ! i've tried lot straps my time practicing yoga . ( several different studios , borrowed friends ' , etc . ) this one excellent . it 2 feet longer than standards straps , but it offered same price standard straps - what deal ! it also thick sturdy . i would certainly recommend this product	1
this mat great . my advice all you yogis can't keep your hands reenacting starsky hutch during downdog little patient or just creative . you two options other than getting upset throwing your new ( expensive ) mat back corner your closet . first , i recommend you buy organic degreaser . give your mat couple sprays ( not too much ) , give it scrub brush , hose it off , hang it out dry . this should help . option two put your mat washer delicate cycle cold water baking soda . don't use soap unless you really want embarrassed next time you start sweating your sun salutes . i put my mat washer haven't any problems , but i'm not sure if manduka would actually endorse . , little bit wear tear , you should end up solid mat .	1

this inflatable kayak functional easy transport given it light wheight . once inflated , it easy carry just one arm when empty . it also very sturdy feel once it completely inflated ( i would recommend electric pump you plug into your car battery charger ) . both seats kayak , there suffient room storage space two adults gear . i using this kayak mostly fishing my four-year-old son small lakes . we generally carry two fishing rods , gear box , bottled water , other related items , dry bag . even all this " stuff " boat there plenty room inside , seats place i plenty support elbow room paddling . i haven't yet taken this kayak down creek or river so i'm not able comment its use scenario	1
it always satisfying see determined manufacturer significantly improve even simplest devices . it pleasure hold use this bottle . i like : * not tip your head up drink , since mouthpiece connected straw inside goes bottom - i've never seen this design before * easy flip open one hand , yet you don't pull hard your teeth like standard designs * absense taste compared plastic bottlesi don't like : * diameter bottle too wide fit standard cage all way . it takes lot force push it 2/3 way it doesn't go further . it hasn't flown out during riding yet , but i am looking wider cage now ( not easy find ) . why not make it standard diameter bike cages	-1

first thing i thought " this lot equipment money " . it comes well wrapped easy assemble . took me hour . it relatively sturdy , although there some minor movement frame when changing exercises ( eg , frame move slightly forward when moving leg lifts dips ) . overall , i not see how they make money selling it this inexpensively based good quality this machine . keep mind , order use chin up bar , there needs enough clearance top machine ceiling , your chin touch top machine . most residential ceilings 8 feet	1

first i want make slight correction previous reviewer text : size/weight gloves doesn't change according size your hand but , rather , size you , user gloves . if you average sized male you hard pressed find sparring partner if you only 10oz gloves : nobody their right minds would agree spar you because such small gloves risk injuring receiver blows goes way up . hence 16oz standard size sparring gloves . women use 14oz children 14oz 12oz depending how big they . point heavier/bigger gloves protect your training partner . anyway , review : these good , all-around sparring gloves . their over-all quality quite good even velcros well so you could use these thai boxing well without scratching your partner neck shoulders when clinching . however , i found when you put more power behind your punches your knuckles tend come through bit so they're not safest gloves around . still they good enough pretty much anybody who looking good pair gloves sparring . i recommend you get separate pair bag gloves or 10oz gloves bag mitt work since hitting heavy bag focus mitts harden leather which , again , makes gloves more dangerous use sparring . remember wrap your hands wrists when hitting heavy bag order avoid knuckle , wrist , shoulder injuries . everlast good company most part they make quality products . these gloves what they supposed	-1

i bought this item after much research this particular model suggested me friend . no problems all shipping ; package perfect shape though only delivered my back steps . i opened up box brought pieces individually , flywheel heaviest ( though i able bring myself ) . it took me 2 hours put together . instruction book better than most i seen , only problem misprint bolt sizes , but you figure out easily ( everyone noted their reviews ) . elliptical size smaller size fits well my sitting room . easily moved if need . regards workout . i cross train my treadmill found this workout effective . there variety programs so you vary your workout . backward motion little awkward me ( i am 5'3 " ) but found holding onto lower handlebars works well ( versus movable upper ones ) . machine very quiet , only slight squeeking coming upper handlebars disappeared little wd40 . it very smooth movement you definitely tell difference increasing level , which i worried it doesn't incline some gym machines . heel rise occur when you not sit back your heels when working out , so you just need aware your foot placement . foot pads comfortable good size . most all , those who monitor their heart rate , i polar f11 heart monitor ( chest strap ) this monitor within 3 beat difference most . i recommend let monitor read minumum 45 seconds before you follow rate . this held true me even if pacing 70 rpm or above . i listen my ipod when i work out , so i not used book holder . water holder holds 24 oz polar spring bottles without any difficulty taking out replacing bottle . i highly recommend this anyone who looking increasing their fitness level comfort their own home . it very well built/solid , quiet , effective , affordable ($599 , free pad , free shipping )	1

i wonder why other reviewer leaking problems - perhaps bad silicon seal ? i compared this store other products thermos , no-names , etc , it one most solidly built food carry products i've ever seen or used . i should bought it years ago , it would saved hundreds dollars via home-made lunches . jeez , worry every time you put tupperware/ziplock lunches your bag , something going leak - how much worth put rest forever ? i used wrap my food-carrying plastic wear two plastic bags case inevitable leakage . never again . this thing solid . i must admit , it appeals my guy side , ( see my bachelor-style typical lunch dinner , below ) hammered green siding shiny metal parts . i think i sprouted few extra hairs my chest after i bought it . it looks like something you might dig out basement your parents ' house , which they would say , " oh , used your grandfather , i used it too . it still works .

( ladies , don't afraid , thermal properties gender-blind , green this fall)if you got dumped recently your girlfriend ( or wife , or mom , or whatever ) , this jar help you your process manly rediscovery . despite fact spending money something i generally discourage , this jar actually help you save money long run . you could carry it home late night subway weapon . heck , my cooking pretty dangerous payload . technical stuff : i put heated hamburger patty microwaved ( prev . frozen ) vegetables into container , thermometer . started 180 deg . , arrived 140 deg . four hours later . i bought it before 7-day road trip , living out cooler back my car . i didn't eat single crappy fast-food meal , i didn't spend dollar anything but gas . * all healthy , pre-cooked , home-style , k-dog-style stuff . get yourself corning wear microwave bowl heavy-duty fridge plastic cover , you home-cooked meal every rest stop . i've put boiling water it , let it sit overnight , top off , it still warm morning . * hotel . speeding ticket . i musta so excited this food bottle . damn ohio pigs	1

pros : good value price , awesome amazon service . cons : nonefor right user , this great bike . ( i just see bicycle snobs rolling their eyes ... ) this case , right user - me - his early 40 recovering knee surgery . i am not yet able jog tired elliptical machine gym . i wanted bike sort rehab wheels . i wanted heavy fixed gear bike push my legs knees strength flexibility . i know there some amazing bikes market . i am not one these people who best " whatever . " nor am i looking impress anyone bike . work family obligations , i would lucky ride bike once week . i checked out bikes target walmart , but purchased it amazon one reason only - color . although i am not fashion conscious , i just can't purple or lime green bikes obnoxious stickers images skull , flames or word " extreme " it . i realize all us want look appear younger , but some point , it gets ridiculous . huffy cranbrook men came black , which always cool my book . i check out local independent bike shops , but i couldn't justify paying premium price same simple bike . however , they provide full service carry bikes incorporating latest technology . when i am ready one those technological marvels , i certainly give them my business . anyway , i placed order amazon . when bike arrived , it very easy assemble . it took no more than 20 minutes few simple tools , which everyone should their home . i notice some parts such seat fenders not made best material , but price , i live it . bike bent front wheel rim , i called amazon customer service replacement . my surprise , amazon sent whole new bike , which arrived 2 days . i simply replaced front wheel ups took spare bike back amazon . additional cost me : $0 . i wish all my business transactions smooth . i bike few weeks now . i met some neighbors , while getting some exercise . my legs knee feel better . my son joins me time time . casual rider , this perfect bike	1

now i this bike , i love biking ! i bought it few reasons .... so i could fast way get my classes my college , so i could learn more biking ( relearn , essentially ) while getting some exercise , so i would chance give mountain trail biking try . so far , i've really enjoyed this bike very little problems it . few downsides tips : 1 . it not lightweight - actually it fairly heavy , i'm told , comparison other mountain bikes . ( but i guess upside you get better workout ! )2 . handlebar grip covers keep sliding off . this very dangerous . if you buy it , you should figure out way secure them so they don't slide off while you're biking ! 3 . paint job very nice ( i've gotten lots compliments other people soley how pretty bike ! ) , but since it light-colored , scratch marks bike racks may show more easily . 4 . brakes " loose " when i first got it , but they easy tighten soon i learned how it . so don't make judgment brakes unless you've learned how adjust them . few great things upsides : 1 . bike seems versatile both trail roads . 2 . gears easy change , i like this feature lot . 3 . bike seat comes it very comfortable easily adjustable . 4 . front wheel also quick-release easy remove . this makes it easier me put bike back my car take bike trail or elsewhere ( i.e. i don't need buy bike rack my car . ) 5 . price very reasonable when you compare it other mountain bikes , i feel it really good deal . since i'm just getting started sport biking , i didn't want spend $600 bucks or so . anyways , good luck it if you decide get it !	-1

valeo neoprene waist trimmer help slim your waist . while using it exercise ( sensible diet ) help improve your outcome it help you sweat more but exercise not necessary if you just want slimmer waist why ? neoprene waist trimmer works concept training you suck your gutt . wear neoprene waist trimmer just few hours you notice immediate results . longer you wear it ( it takes 21 days form habit ) , easier it become suck gutt giving you look slimmer waist . i not recommend wearing this 24/7 or while you sleep ( give your body chance adjust sucking it itself)and each day you put it you try pull it just little tighter .	-1
after reading drawbacks this stroller , i hesitant order it without first testing it myself . i received it few days ago pleasantly surprised . many drawbacks listed other comments not major . 1 . re : size stroller when folded - my car 2000 honda accord , stoller fits fine trunk if i take off rear wheels . other jogging stroller model i considered also required removal rear wheels . 2 . re : stroller reclining too much - angle inclination adjusted adjusting straps back seat almost any angle you want . 3 . re : difficulty folding stoller - yes , stroller hard fold completely only one hand , but it mostly folds itself . i think most non-umbrella type strollers require both hands fold . overall , this great stroller . traveling though , stoller definitely required	1

ok , so let me start saying i am little older than middle age i am not training marathon . i bought this jogger running 30-40 minute range , few times week . i little concerned there whole series joggers $300 up category , but i thought i would try this model . i only used it few times , but find it very functional meets my needs precisely . i nothing compare it too , but it assemble easily tracks smoothly . i think documentation could bit better , but very small gripe . jogger arrived within few days my ordering it - even super saver shipping . i saw some consumer report complaints joggers would not track straight , i definitely say this one just fine . it pushes smoothly , adequate room your feet when either running behind or alongside . i am sure there some qualitative differences really expensive ones ; but i would definitely say if you want good jogger , good value , this may one you looking . jogger who out there several times per week , but maybe not training marathon , this seems excellent choice	1
knife blade very functional . don't know yet how well blade hold edge . carabiner seems well pu t-t ogether . one more small , straight-slot screw driver would nice . internal opening needs 3/4 " wider form better handle . i really like finger contours . hole base would also nice secure keys sliding up down gate ( maybe place bottle opener ) . overall , i like it carry it everyday my key ring	-1

we got rid our standard queen-sized bed make room our kid wanted replacement since . i finally pulled trigger after lot research i couldn't more pleasantly surprised . let face it , buying airbed bit craps shoot . so ymmv , even this one , but i'm going lay out my impressions : good : * sturdy construction . held up despite wedged against two chairs other side steel filecabinet . it hasn't leaked yet , though it include patch kit . * fills fast included air pump . i would say 2 minutes . * deflates fast using pump reverse air flow . you also pull pump out . * comfortable . pillow top nice feel it fairly firm . * comes nice carry bag really isn't too heavythe bad : * pump little loud . fill it up before you put kids sleep or dampen sound pillow ( don't cover pump ! ) . volume , you would think it would fill faster too . * could use more firm fill setting . * cord could little longerokay , so " bad " pretty much picking nits . i'd say this easily rivals queen aero i've used before friend house . price , i didn't expect anything nearly rugged aero better pay attention new competition . even lowest prices i've found aero , wenger better deal . i've seen mixed reviews aero quality . all airbeds faults i'm fully expecting this one not last forever , but repair kit it should well worth cost until i replace it . money , i surprised quality construction . don't hesitate buy it instead competition spare bed holidays or emergencies . i figured sure it would spring leak when it rubbing against steel file cabinets or caster wheels chairs my office ( 2 nights ! ) . it nice surprised quality good way now then	1

this knife wonderful ! i'm one last people get something looks this " girly , " but there something it appealed me . it looks cute innocent , pinkish rainbow sheen ( mine lot more green blue than picture ) , but it wicked sharp . since it spring-assist , it opens lightning quick deployed instantly opening boxes or what-have-you . i like carrying mine pocket clip , but it comes safety lock so you carry it your pocket without fear it accidentally open . very essential times when i'm wearing dress pants can't knife showing . it very small though . it perfect kids or someone like me who very small hands . though i problems opening knife thumb stud . it just small enough my thumb slide intercept edge blade . fortunately , it index-opening one flick my index finger , i open it . i carry larger knives my jeans pockets daily basis , but if you need something discreet stylish , you can't go wrong ken onion rainbow chive . it certainly looks inconspicuous , but it incredibly useful many applications	1
i owned my s610i monitor just under year now i firmly believe this heart rate monitor delivered features exactly described polar company . bundled software , though basic nature , allow you view several informative charts graphs , which gives you extensive workout history base your progress . realize full potential s610i monitor , you definitively need read reread owners manual , well software help section . alas , such torments technology . i like s610i monitor several reasons , one large amount exercises you track , 50-meter water resistance , finally multiple user features . however , dim display leaves lot desired old pair eyes like mine , hence four stars rating out five . far any durability concerns , i only replace red button , which expeditiously sent me free charge polar after simple customer service e-mail . nonetheless , this very solid performing monitor basic level scientific device gives you some invaluable information your overall health provides tangible feedback achieve your exercise goals . my exercise plans now take me level , which include incorporation jogging then running . s610i monitor not really geared type workout , so i upgrade s625x monitor 2007 . s610i monitor go my wife , not blue color pleases her , but we workout home so it should go unnoticed .	-1
you just break bank buying your dream gun but no dough optics ? never fear ! leapers save day ! $30 , you get decent red dot get job w/o bells whistles . i use it my remington 11-87 it still shoots 3 " slugs accurately after approximately 150 very punishing rounds . i got second red dot ak-74 scope more accuarate then rifle . this great scope if you plan messing around range but i wouldn't put it test if you plan hiking/hunting it days end . green dot option lost me so far but i guess it usefull if your " tacti-cool " night or something . my only problem so far pin one flip-up lens cover worked its way out i used picture frame nail replace it . otherwise , bang buck , you can't beat it	-1

my way thinking , there only two factors which keep vector receiving full 5-stars here . #1 watch face . it not very durable . it isn't even glass . it made out very easily scratched plastic . i own several watches , even plain glass face models scratch drop hat , but this one takes it whole new level . i'd worried sneeze too close fear it may implode . #2 fact despite promises water resistent 100 meters ( ie 300 feet ) this watch isn't ... far it . you danger ruining this watch if you even enter bathroom while someone else taking hot shower . humidity alone may cause problems . pretty sad when watch advertised very least capable pool cannot honestly pull off basic shower bathtub . now , said , if you take care avoid moisture whenever you , vector fine wrist computer works quite well variety areas . it'll tell you temperature ( under right circumstances , course ) , help you predict weather , give you bearing where you need go then ( after proper adjusting ) tell you your altitude . i found altimeter actually rather accurate -- oh , those reviews i read on-and-off folks bragging telling altitude inside pressurized passenger plane bogus . considering what this watch , it limitations , i believe price bit high ( you buy casio watch that'll same thing -- solar-powered , really water-resistent , all less ) but vector one thing not all suunto watches , or altimeter/barometer/compass watches come : little bubble face which allows more accurate determination specific readings . if casio add one their model , i'll probably become full-time convert . if you looking something similar , but smaller , try looking suunto observer . it dang-good-looking watch , but price considerably more , so may rather important factor you ( i know it me ) . all all , suunto makes great products , but water resistent models unfortunately not one them ( unless you going one their products actually designed underwater use )	-1

i over 7,000 hours experience teaching studio quality , spring-loaded pilates equipment . last years i taught professionally , i cut down my insane teaching schedule teaching group classes these machines . they safer than spring-loaded reformers because bungee cords -- springs snap back . bungee cords move , but not kind propulsive , really dramatic force you see springs . over over again , i watched students things these reformers would injured them spring-loaded equipment . my own practice , lack attention caused moment or two real danger ; worst thing happened flying bungee cord cutting upholstery . safety aside , these provide enough resistance really good workout . they big enough anyone under 6'2 " all exercises , exception semi-circle , which more intermediate exercise anyway . students knee hip injuries reported they more comfortable these machines , possibly because bungee cords provide less resistance . also , these reformers what reformers designed : two hour-long workouts week , these machines increased flexibility , improved back pain dramatically changed shape bodies , just like studio quality equipment would . ( yes , virginia , there way get rid saddlebags without lipo . ) finally , unlike some other pieces non-studio quality equipment , i unequivocally recommend these even very fit men . runners , bikers hunters my classes really found machine workouts challenging . cons : i never able get replacement parts . you need two people or one man over six feet move each machine . attempt fold them up again your own peril . lock them away children , or vice versa -- even bungee cords cut	1

over weekend i bought stanley thermal bottle . i've wanting thermal carafe while now , this one capacity liter coffee , tea , soup , etc . i really jazzed this specific bottle , because it aesthetically rich testosterone . design seems straight out first half 20th century . so you know geeky-old-me , i perform thermal performance test . i first pre-heated bottle several minutes using hot tap water . i filled carafe brim boiling water , checked temp using my probe thermometer . 205 degrees . this morning , exactly 8 hours after my initial measurement , i cracked bottle second reading ... astonishing 177 degrees ( i woulda thought 150-ish ) . probe thermometer showed temperature room 73 degrees , i ac thermostat constant entire time . if you run numbers through newton law cooling , you find k-value 0.029801 per hour given my environment observations . empirical calculation , means bottle contents would cool down 150 degrees 18 hours room temp ( temperature i would still consider beverage or soup pretty hot ) . 24 hours after filling near-boiling water , contents would likely near 137.5 degrees ... still pretty hot , still somewhat capable fighting off some foodborne illnesses . it would take 53 hours bottle contents cool 100 degrees . your mileage may vary , but this thing appears winner	1

i'll break this review into parts : shipping : #1 ( see previous review ) - horrendous , disaster - paid new machine/rec'd trashed , used one . sent it back . ups . received #2 - new machine via dhl . box torn again some parts came out . dhl tried dump it porch , but caught them fleeing scene . everything new wrapped plastic this time , so i decided inspect carefully see if any damage . i believe box damage occurred when dhl picked it up edges lid . this heavy box . inspection : i unwrapped all pieces opened plastic small parts bags . only slight scuff marks present one piece machine . laid all parts out floor checked them against parts checklist . all parts present accounted . assembly : after parts inspection , it took me 2.5 hours . not use your power screwdrivers i tempted , but you might want get your own socket/wrench set phillips screw driver . tools included : allen wrench , nut/socket wrench (?) , spanners couple little rods insert through spanners . ( i thought these parts originally ) . directions primarily german other languages including english or ( gb ) great britian . assembly instructions pictures which confusing . cut out parts list page keep it reference so you don't flip back forth . important : keep all connections " loose " before proceeding next step !!! if you tighten nuts loosen them , you break locking feature kettler says this safety issue . tighten all nuts bolts hand , feel how firm connection . also , there left right well up down things . study diagrams carefully !! quality parts phenomenal . nuts bolts machined beautifully gleaming . no cheap , pot-metal - just fine german steel ! ja !! you don't worry cross-threading or stripping , everything fits perfectly . caution : pinch points arm/piston area during assembly not cut your fingers like i !! after assembly , i tried it out first time , it like heaven ! motion similar what you see dr. jarvik doing lipitor commercials during news , where he rowing across lake . you feel like you're flying , it whisper quiet ! what great stretch !! it felt fabulous , go slow first assure proper rowing form . keep your back straight - read book ! if you're tall like me , 5'10 " - this machine you . also , my boyfriend - who 6'5 " ( german ! ) plenty legroom spare when he uses it too ! also , resistance adjusted turning pistons , it little tricky sure install number " 1 " top . computer loads features , but haven't checked them out yet . after usage - i folded arms up . it very compact when folded . i don't see how one stand it against wall when folded , but i small , dedicated room gym equipment i push it against wall folded position floor . allow 65 " full extended " wingspan " machine when planning floorspace . overall , i love machine !! i wish kettler provided photographs finished machine rather than drawings . if you don't want mess footstraps loosening during workouts , get some black velcro add . i plan doing . one final note : there warning printed rowing arms , i asked my boyfriend translate it german . here basically what it says : " don't use rowing arms means support yourself/weight ( getting up , because machine tip side ) " . it so nice german around house !! you won't disapointed if you buy this machine , i would buy it new , rather than used . i think you'll love it it true , sculling motion opposed back forth cheaper types .	-1
