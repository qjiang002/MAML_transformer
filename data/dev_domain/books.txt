carr provides stirring indictment belief it brings it promise competitive advantage . instead , he posits it merely cost doing business , cut same cloth other innovations once held lot promise like electricity railway system . though no company ever hope operate much less compete without above , its homogeneity prevalence somehow blunted its value . search elusive silver bullet found ceo bequeathing so much power it good number expected it rescue bad business plans . carr mentions specific examples it inability mask business problems but rather makes them more apparent earlier . one major point i find hard believe window innovation it closed . though lot strides made , lot work yet . however , i fear carr would proven prescient even seminal this particular point short term . though it people continue churn out next line killer applications , there danger customers may simply refuse upgrade or purchase thereby sealing it fate commodity . interesting thought gleaned book it ( automation ) frees people far more important tasks . however , what those important tasks not clearly defined . granting most tasks automated , it lead more unemployment , surplus products ( assuming productivity rises because it ) , low prices profits until next new thing discovered disrupt balance once again . but this hasn't happened ye t.t hough i don't agree some carr ideas , i believe it good read dissenting opinions future it .	1

tropic cancer henry miller . not recommended . his 1960 introduction tropic cancer , karl shapiro said , " i call henry miller greatest living author because i think he , " " . . . spiritual example he stands among great men our age , " " . . . he [ orwell ] predicts miller set pace attitude novelist future . this not happened yet , but i agree it must . " shapiro not support any these points his essay , nothing tropic cancer supports them , either . tropic cancer consists 318 pages recounting miller experience american expatriate paris expounding his personal philosophy , often ways rambling painfully nonsensical . miller stories his friends tedious , pointless , catty ; like miller , they seem talentless hacks whose belief their own artistic abilities makes them artists writers , though believing . miller writes , " year ago , six months ago , i thought i artist . i no longer think it , i am " -- which type arrogant pretentiousness he mocks virtually all his acquaintances . when they not creating , or talking philosophy or creating , miller his circle seem spend nearly every moment picking up women ( disease ) . they rarely use neutral term such " woman " when there so many obscene , demeaning words which objectify gender . women miller friends find invariably portrayed stupid , drunken , irrational , loose , sly , deceptive , good primarily one function , which miller turns into squalid , cold , joyless act . spite all vice " living , " no one seems fun , some characters , notably fillmore , find themselves nearly trapped into bourgeoisie life . miller expresses contempt machine , industrial age , money -- although he schemes keep 2,800 francs fillmore mistress revels so much his pocket . often hungry , miller obsesses food relies his friends support him . when he describes his indian friend kepi " . . . scrounger , sort human tick who fastens himself hide even poorest compatriot , " he could talking himself he bitterly complains those his friends who stingy money , accommodations , food , wine . miller logic working world facile ; he writes , " if you want bread , you've got get harness , get lockstep . " surface , this true , but it never seems occur him , if you want bread , someone must cultivate , raise , harvest wheat produce other components ; someone must transform these components into bread ; someone must deliver it shops cafes . other words , if most people weren't " lock step , " miller could choose starve or set himself produce bread , joining world harness . he makes his choice clear , then whines it . he may despise those who support him , whether they friends or workers , but perhaps because he , misanthrope who finds fault everyone but himself , needs very people he denigrates ( including " grocer , baker , shoemaker , butcher , etc . -- all imbecilic-looking clodhoppers " ) , reliance which he resents . he hates machine machine mind , but offers no alternatives . seemingly incapable sincere feeling , miller finds human emotion amusing . when friend says , " boy break your heart . . . he so damned beautiful ! so cruel ! " miller writes , " we laugh this . it sounded preposterous . but collins earnest . " when acquaintance whom he owes money dies , he writes , " any rate , he killed automobile accident shortly after my arrival , circumstance which left me twenty-three francs good . " shapiro claims miller poet , but his attempts poetic philosophic ramblings often make little if any sense . speaking buildings statues , miller says , " . . . they must saturated my anguish , " kind bad metaphor which he frequently indulges . he describes artists such himself " inhuman ones . " " i am inhuman ! i say it mad , hallucinated grin , i keep saying it though it rain crocodiles . behind my words all those grinning , leering , skulking skulls , some dead grinning long time , some grinning if they lockjaw , some grinning grimace grin , foretaste aftermath what always going . " whenever these attempts poetic philosophy appeared , rambling pages , i found myself yearning return his insipid stories prostitutes , disease , friends , hunger . tropic cancer perhaps worst book i ever read ( i promise myself i would read tropic capricorn ) . shapiro says , " there not many these emancipated beings left our world [ emancipated what ? -- dls ] , these clowns clairvoyants , celebrants soul flesh still-remaining promise america . " if miller , his whining , his criticism , his holier-than-everyone attitude , his " art , " his two-dimensional view people , his obsession excrement , " greatest " these souls , may i never meet least . note : if there 0 stars option , tropic cancer would earned it	-1
it through alistair cockburn earlier writings i ' got it ' good people , not methodologies tools , deliver successful projects . although crystal clear meant only small teams ( there crystal color every size team ) , properties , practices , principles , examples techniques this book would benefit any software development team . subtitle begins " human-powered methodology ...

unlike most science-related books , there only few pages within this biography dealt diagrams equations . majority novel consisted stunning information regarding life mind james clerk maxwell , who often forgotten general public favor more prolific figures such joule farraday . although i'll go far admit high schooler , this type literature not my favorite , i surprised find this book captivated imagination allowed insight not just into work but into mind maxwell . research purposes , this book contains very useful index efficient easy fact-finding . furthermore , technical diagrams equations explained very well , sufficient time patience could understood . most amazing maxwell life career . his early entry into science math ( age 16 ) both awesome inspiring . basil mahon brings maxwell achievement into plain view ease language interesting style writing so rarely found science books today	1
all poems smooth clever slightly ( or more than slightly ) ironic . they sometimes make me smile , but they seldom make me feel much . i recently poetry reading collins gave , where he greatly applauded . he mentioned sentimentality cardinal sin poetry . that true . but i couldn't emotionally connect self-consciously witty voices speaking out his poems , end this collection i didn't really want . when i first read collins , i hoping find accessible poet illuminating everyday world i promised . instead , i found extremely polished poet whose engaging tone almost makes up his persistent lack emotional depth . sentimentality may poetic sin , but sincerity isn't . even funny poems should display little emotional risk . but collins never seems risk anything . because he takes small risks , we get small rewards . go ahead get this book . read it . smile bit . appreciate cleverness talent collins displays . these poems likeable , i wouldn't surprised if you liked them . but if you looking poetry feed you , go somewhere else	-1

i love victor conte . you know , way you love bad guy great movie ? you don't actually love him , but you love character , kind " best actor nominee " thing . two san francisco chronicle reporters lay out their case against conte his giant client , barry bonds , bonds passes babe ruth eyes hank aaron all-time home run record ( josh gibson sadaharu oh ? ) . conte himself alleged source much material . investigations continue : spring 2006 , bonds ' ex-girlfriend , kim bell , allegedly asked fbi not cooperate investigation major league baseball doing ; greg anderson , bonds ' trainer , jailed july 2006 refusing testify grand jury . authors present extensive evidence use steroids track field , provided olympic athletes conte under cover his nutritional supplements company , increasingly sophisticated efforts mask such use . but it barry bonds allegations ( accompanying details other major leaguers , efforts explain mark mcgwire glory bonds ' motivation ) sell book . this book makes bonds look much worse than i thought it would , i no fan already . reader learns , example , his " control freak " his teammates , women , staff " friends . " my own judgment authors easily surpass " preponderance evidence " probably " beyond reasonable doubt " , even if they don't video bonds syringe labeled " clear .

king certainly lends high-profile this collection latter-day noir writing tough-guy procedurals , but i believe he created something little too far outside readership expected genre this series . setting characters recognizable ( now trite ? ) staples his beloved maine coast , he works bringing their " down east " mannerisms life language rings " bert i " lobstermen . i wasn't particularly caught up aged newspapermen tale their quest identify mysterious dead man found local beach . ending ... well , um ... ending definitely open-ender . king cleverly covers himself adding disclaimer sorts story won't appeal many readers . yep . you got right , stephen . no gunplay , no boozers , no saucy dames , no double-crosses , no slangy patter , no real satisfaction me . i suggest hard crime afficionados skip this entry look some heavy-hitters past	-1

this sermon all grace -- inconceivable grace holy patient god . we live " god love " age , where loving father grace would never ever put someone hell because their " weakness " . that what jehovah witnesses believe , that what modern christians come believe too . we adopted this ultragracious innocuous image god , i believe , two principle reasons : 1 ) we like selectively read scriptures . negating hell judgment passages more tolerable " god graceful loving " ones , we reconstruct our own likeness into god who now become eternal " good god " no emotions but love giving helping blessing -- god who advocates our carnal lifestyles , only worthy notice during christmas easter holidays , when devastation hits our lives . 2 ) we rationalize his character our own human standards . we ascribe certain attributes god logical us , what we deem fair . after all , isn't god all justice ? mercy ? no earthly judge would ever consign man fiery torture lifetime -- nevermind eternity ! this , we therefore decide , no way accurate image god . we'll often recite scriptures where jesus forgave woman caught adultery , or compassion multitudes , or ate dinner sinners , or preached sermon mount loving your enemies not repaying evil evil . yes , he all -- jesus christ , prince peace . many say here , " yep . jesus ' sermon mountain didn't scare people , it all love grace good things , blessings givings so forth ... " just like moon " dark " side , there also side god . jesus talked , warned , pleaded , wept it . awful justice holy eternal god . jesus talked more his father justice punishment wicked than his love righteous . god doesn't fool around sin . if he annihilated sodom gomorrah fire because their sexual immorality , his own son nailed cross , you really believe he'll spare any man or women who stands before him " awful day " unrepentant sin ? all throughout old new testaments , his prophets warned impending day fire wrath . joel called it " terrible day lord " , paul called it " judgment seat christ " , john called it " lake fire " , jesus called it " place eternal torment " , john baptist called it " day wrath " . david spoke it pslams ! every one " love scripture " you throw me , i give you three which warn god reserved wrath wicked . you tell me god loves sinner , but hates sin . but bible says god hates sinner well ( see psalm 5:4 ) . bible also says god angry wicked every day ( see psalm 7:11 ) . if you've read my review thus far , you're probably angry . this may indication you either : 1 ) don't know full character god , or 2 ) sin doesn't grieve your heart like it grieves holy spirit , or 3 ) you've never born again spirit desire holiness purity which , according bible , only acceptable lifestyle before god . jonathan edwards puritan preacher . these guys after purity ( hence , puritan ) holiness lord . today , 250 years later , we lost sight this . today , gospel jesus christ politically-correct , inoffensive , recreational powerless motivational philosophy success gain . gospel no power change lives because we refuse live holiness reverential fear awesome terrible god . we've instead created our own god our own ideals contructed his character out our own acceptable worldly attributes centered around our own standards success , comfort , tolerance . we need truth come back pulpits . away all unctionless motivational speaking passes gospel preaching today . when jonathan edwards preached his sermon 1741 , people fell out their chairs cried out , " what must we saved !

i love clif bars , especially " carrot cake " flavor ! when i saw this book ceo founder company , i picked it up right away . it always insightful read people who founded or run companies get inside look how they built organization what they value . where most business books focus financials , strategy how successful their market , it rarer find company very successful financially while still placing their values higher priority than profit-at-all-costs culture plagues many organizations . book describes detail founding company , almost storybook beginnings his moms kitchen . what started desire create " sports bar " didn't taste like dirt , turned into quality well known brand . while these types rags riches stories may sounding familiar , this path actually quite different . gary describes his passions biking , travel climbing , how he learned value environment focus his company sustainable growth . when his competitors becoming part large conglomerates resources outspend out market his brand , he resisted lure millions sell company chose remain private . i found myself marking pages , pondering quotes , admiring spirit values gary brought organization . he describes difference " red path " " white path " . developed through analogy taking roads less traveled , traveling light his numerous bike trips europe , he discovers real joy journey not destination . those who take " white path " play it safe , make kinds business decisions accountants love . those who take " red path " stay true their values , must sometimes take risks others would fear order ensure vision upheld . those who enjoy business strategy , book contains plenty . steps business sustainability values hiring right people creating right culture employees outlined described . also , like howard shultz few others , gary chooses honest his doubts , his mistakes , his fears . this way , book more inspiring than typical academic controlled business planning tools most consultants business leaders use replace passion leadership . i recommend this book highly . if you feel there something missing your company , workplace become unending unsatisfying grind , then prepare inspired encouraged . it refreshing know there still business leaders who understand life more than their balance sheet . great example company willing give back community try make world better place . company leader who not only believe their employees inherent value human beings , but treat them such .	1

despite president bush declaration he wanted bin laden " dead or alive , " hunted world mightiest military last five years , osama remains large shrouded mystery . nor osama become " " - 2003 saw more significant terror attacks than any year within past 20 , while 2004 brought doubling again . thus , bush 3/02 claim bin laden marginalized no basis fact . nor osama accomplishments limited 9/11 . within four years osama cnn declaration war against u.s. his organization bombed two u.s. embassies africa , attacked u.s.s. cole yemen , helped drive u.s. out somalia , course , wtc attack - more damage u.s. than soviet union during nearly five decades cold war . every day osama remains large propaganda victory al qaeda . we need understand bin laden , not confused our own propaganda - eg . he never expressed interest attacking west because our " freedoms . " ( fact , bergen book includes direct osama quote refuting point - suggesting if so , one should wonder why he hadn't attacked sweden . ) peter bergen draws interviews over 50 individuals who known bin laden personally , plus his own interview . number written video materials , including ten years jihad magazine , also utilized . material presented objective manner , invaluable one wanting better understand bin laden his motives - both prior 9/11 , through iraq war . " oral history " begins osama early days . his father very , very anti-israel . he educated good school , very polite ( attribute maintained into adulthood ) , but not stand-out student . osama also quite religious , even his youth . rather than inheriting $200-$300 million fortune , bergen believes more credible figure around $20 million ( there 53 siblings which share ) . 1979 soviet invasion afghanistan shocked bin laden , thousands other devout young muslims - it first time since wwii non-muslim power invaded muslim country . bin laden involvement began donor , then holy warrior . most who knew his military involvement scornful , seeing he no military skills probably simply creating martyrs . further , bergen concludes osama impact very limited - number afghans fighting soviets varied 175-250 , 000 , while number arabs involved any point no more than few hundred , split several groups . thus , " real " outcome determined afghans themselves , together aid provided $3 billion u.s. aid ( no evidence any it went afghan arabs ) , additional support saudi arabia . bin laden victory vs . russians jaji ' 87 only p.r. accomplishment involving 50-60 arabs ( including bin laden ) over 22 day period . osama also spent six months building road through tora bora mountains ' 87 ( jaji jalalabad ) , gaining familiarity undoubtedly benefited when u.s. invaded 2001 . ayman al zawahiri , bin laden chief deputy , radicalized three years ' imprisonment torture egypt , part reaction sadat assassination ( not involved ) . he got osama focus not only afghan jihad , but also regime change arab world ( ousting repressive secular regimes , which also supported u . . ) . after soviets left afghanistan ' 89 country slipped into civil war - first drive out communist regime left behind , then various afghan factions . osama washed his hands area moved sudan . while there osama journeyed back saudi arabia made speeches against both u.s. ( its support moving one million russian jews israel ) saddam hussein . he even volunteered services his afghan arab veterans , plus new recruits , repel hussein kuwait - turned down preference more americans " last straw " osama - he turned against saudi royal family , ultimately his citizenship revoked . drug monies offered support osama efforts - he declined , not wanting " profit " blood innocent people . this point osama four wives - three university lecturers spinsters whom he married support islamic principles . osama opposed ' 92 landing 28,000 americans somalia food relief , seeing it part larger american strategy take over islamic world . same time , ramzi yousef masterminded ' 93 wtc bombing - he trained al qaeda camp . bomb itself cost $ 20,000 ; rationale u.s. support israel . osama repeatedly challenged actions killed children other innocents . his response reference u.s. atomic bombing nagasaki hiroshima , well purported loss one million iraqi children due u . . -supported sanctions . bergen also reports prior 9/11 afghan used gofer both osama british cameraman wanted help tell u.s. al qaeda planning hijack jets u.s. secure release " blind sheikh " held wtc bombing . fbi ended up both delaying his movement thailand meeting him - until after 9/11 . bergen states bin laden not involved 9/11 details ( nor those cole , etc . bombings ) . nonetheless , he ultimate commander , knew plans , supported effort . bergen also believes bin laden made serious error projecting u.s. reaction - he hoped , based prior u.s. actions eg . lebanon , u.s. would withdraw middle east , or invade afghanistan become bogged down protracted guerrilla war . instead , u.s. used 300 special forces troops ground , massive airpower , northern alliance forces quickly defeat al qaeda . " osama ... i know " also presents credible information knowledgeable sources refute rumor osama suffers form acute kidney disease - just low blood pressure foot wound incurred fighting soviets . bergen rather critical u.s. vs . osama escape afghanistan . sources clearly place bin laden there ( including bin laden himself ) only 300 others - yet he got away . bergen claims there more american journalists scene than u.s. soldiers . " acquiring nuclear chemical weapons religious duty " - osama , ' 99 . bergen sources , however , doubtful than osama any success acquiring nuclear capability , though he apparently scammed effort . osama opposed efforts foment civil war shia sunni , reports bergen ; meanwhile , zarqawi not join al qaeda until ' 04 - two years after sec . powell claimed iraq harboring zarqawi major al qaeda figure his effort justify invading iraq . bergen sees greater danger future iraq " foreign fighters " after iraq struggle than their afghan counterparts . rationale - their experience fighting stronger u.s. army focus urban strategies ( ieds suicide bombers ) . bergen also makes strong criticism u.s. intelligence efforts . he notes there over 30 audio videotapes bin laden his chief deputy post 9/11 , one guaranteed method finding them tracing back their chain custody . even knowing tape would likely delivered al jazeera pakistan bureau prior 2004 election u.s. failed stake out scene . thus , our $30+ billion proven totally inadequate . finally , bergen also quite critical bin laden strategies-to-date , noting his efforts remake muslim world not succeeded - u.s. more involved than ever . further , taliban ahs destroyed . bergen believes without u.s. invasion iraq fragmented islam militant movement would imploded year or so post 9/11 . bottom line : al qaeda no attractive vision world it seeks create - best it associated creating taliban-like control over other muslims	1
i admire ishiguro writing risk-taking book , most unlike any i read befire . unfortunately , this novel fails its objectives , except itself unique piece fiction . protagonist english detective , who appears completely delusional his current circumstances , who willing take these delusions great lengths . because this , plot eventually becomes irrelevant reality . this when book shows its signs brilliance , when plot recognized meaningless major themes take over chinese battle . unfortunately this brilliant culmination hardly makes up rest novel . besides poor/meaningless plot , novel not single character reader cares . thematic sequence , during which book finally seems something , all too fleeting . soon after plot returns even more absurd than before . it truly frustrating experience	-1

coming panzer leader , i didn't know much eastern front . after reading it , i great grip what happened why . guderian writes short , succinct , declarative prose , which makes reading breeze . readers not interested fine details may put off sheer depth guderian account , but those passages dense only because sheer volume information guderian relays , not his writing style . german high command gets once over , particularly interesting guderian character sketches hitler goering . i not know enough guderian judge his flat denial any knowledge pertaining final solution or einsatztruppe , but sheer military point view you can't any better than panzer leader . guderian walks reader through conquests poland france , through army group center involvement operation barbarossa . he never hesitates point out where he disagreed general staff , describes detail his frustration okh okw . especially interesting early parts book where guderian describes his efforts get tanks accepted german command viable force battlefield , subsequent formation panzer divisions . this easily one best books i ever read , definitely one most informative . i learned ton reading this , loved every page it . those not interested military history probably find it dense hard get through , though . i'm giving it 5 stars despite drawback - this book simply indispensable military history enthusiasts wwii buffs	1

i hate alex portnoy , protragonist novel , yet i couldn't stop reading this book . me , that sign talented writer . main character few , if any , redeeming characteristics . he egomaniac . he inconsiderate . he obsessed sex . he nasty human almost every way , yet ( long you're not easily offended ) you can't stop reading him . " portnoy complaint " written if it words patient confessing his shrink . portnoy wants know what wrong himself , but before he find out he shares his life story childhood his mid-thirties , vast majority his story revolves around his relationship his parents , jewish , his obsession sex . i think what makes portnoy fascinating there probably little bit him every man , though few us may comfortable admitting it . so it interesting read him male perspective . female perspective i'd imagine he would interesting character if only because he shows just how depraved man . i guarantee after reading book you'll able identify least one portnoy your life -- someone who wasted their talents selfish pursuits , yet they so egotistical they blame their shortcomings everyone else , including their parents . this book ridiculously funny because no matter how absurd it gets , you can't help but realize it all too close truth	1
here it , final book creator/writer grant morrison invisibles series . books 1-3 collected volume 1 , books 4-6 collected volume 2 , book 7 collects volume 3 its entirety . previous two volumes over twenty issues each , but volume 3 only 12 issues , something which seems spark much debate , these days . i seen many claims volume 3 only 12 issues due low sales , dc/vertigo requested morrison wrap up his series half time , cut costs . this simply not true . volume 3 morrison full vision ; nothing cut out due editorial constraints . here morrison exact words , shortly before beginning volume 3 : " volume 3 appear three four-part arcs-`satanstorm ' ; `karmageddon ' `the invisible kingdom'- 1999 . then it all i go off my mid-life crisis tibet . there some fears this may not work `sales ' dealt permanent blow , but i prefer faith all you wunnerful people out there who've stayed bus so far , i'd like think you'd rather see invisibles completed intended than me hack it out meet monthly deadline . " it final book series , you might expect invisible kingdom answer questions end long journey . unfortunately , you would mistaken . fact , most volume 3 doesn't even feel like invisibles we know love . where volume 1 slow-paced focused characterization , volume 2 focused action metaphysics , volume 3 seems like totally different series . main cause this invisibles themselves relegated supporting-character status ; mr. six his division pals archvillain sir miles delacourt instead get most " screen time , " king mob , jack , fanny reduced small parts . make things worse , when morrison feature invisibles , instead using characters we already know , he instead tortures us new invisible named helga , who probably most annoying character series . morrison obviously doesn't think so , however , he gives helga just every " cool " line " outrageous " action he think , attempt make her cutting edge . instead , she comes off annoyingly pretentious bore , it doesn't help morrison fails give her any sort background or emotional makeup . what makes this all more frustrating he uses this character so much , totally ignores more interesting female invisibles ragged robin boy . it like morrison ran out ideas main characters , come up someone new carry plot ; problem , he couldn't chosen worse lead character . said , book 7 picks up mr. six division , last seen book 3 : " entropy uk . " they're still hot trail miles delacourt monstrous " future king " england . meanwhile , mr. six strives help his teammates remember they're actually undercover invisibles agents . addition this , six helga attempt deprogram sir miles . while this going , jack frost africa jolly roger , where he comes closer realizing his buddhahood . king mob mostly out picture , off meditating india , trying rid himself need kill . after laying rest 99 year-old invisible edith , king mob et al reunite final showdown miles delacourt demonic archons he serves . this culminates satanic crowning monstrous king august 11 , 1999 , horrific ceremony which entails butchering children homeless victims . instead action scene volume 2 , events play out more lines mystical denouement volume 1 , jack frost once again proving he most powerful human alive . above two paragraphs make events volume 3 sound rather simplistic . this not case . i mentioned , since this final volume series , one might expect morrison answer questions . instead , he chooses make volume 3 opaque difficult possible . even dialog doesn't help sort things out ; characters don't talk each other , they trade " i'm too cool " banter . what makes this all more grating morrison so obviously taken his themes plots works robert anton wilson terrence mckenna ; but unlike those authors , who always guide reader through their labyrinthine visions , morrison instead tosses everything into blender hopes it all comes out " cool . " therefore , chance any emotional impact pretty much lost . volume 3 saved final story series , " glitterdammerung . " fully illustrated frank quitely , this possibly single best issue invisibles . previous 11 issues volume 3 wrapped up series storyline , but it up " glitterdammerung " explain what series itself all . set 2012 , story operates more metaphysical look back series than linear tale . it tie up several subplots , also ends series defiantly anarchic note , jack frost frees himself confines comic itself . this story alone gives book 7 4-star rating . secret revealed book 7 this ( avoid this paragraph if you hate spoilers , though if you know this , it probably wouldn't " spoil " anything , anyway ! ) : invisibles game , one played someone ( john a'dreams ? jack frost ? you ? ) . toward very end series , several characters begin figure this out , most notably john a'dreams , white-suited former invisible who disappeared before events book 1 : " say you want revolution . " idea invisibles reality-model experienced those who wish gain gnosis ; hence many , many times phrase " remember . it just game " stated throughout books 1-6 . this entails characters realizing they not only works fiction , but each them might even same person , only playing different characters , or " suits , " one enlightened character calls them . i've always felt this morrison skewed way interpreting gnostic " all one " belief , all humans share one collective , unconscious soul - aka " god . " art volume 3 mess . volume 1 invisibles plagued succession artists , some good , some terrible . volume 2 corrected this big way . unfortunately volume 3 goes back volume 1 territory , only it worse . instead different artists handling different story arcs , multiple artists work same story . this terrible idea morrison part , i think it backfired him , art so underwhelming some places dc/vertigo certain pages re-illustrated this collection . book 7 starts off promising enough , philip bond warren pleece cartoonish art , but then it quickly falls pieces when " multiple artist " scenario rears its head . quitely saves day end however , his art " glitterdammerung " just phenomenal his work morrison " flex mentallo . " special mention must also made brian bolland cover art this trade paperback . he " remixed " 12 original covers he volume 3 ; one particular , " sgt pepper " send-up , would make perfect poster . even though this review mostly negative , book 7 still required reading all those who made it this far . morrison finishes series fashion he intended start , character arcs unique inspiring . example , what other work fiction would feature character like king mob , who realizes over course series he degenerating into killer ? bruce willis kill umpteen terrorists " die hard " films not once question if he himself becoming murderous his enemies ; king mob instead gains enlightenment , realizes all life precious . course , if something like this happened mainstream action film , audiences would write it off tree-hugging schlock . but here it works , mostly because morrison aimed something higher invisibles . most time , he succeeded	1

teacher perspective , it hard find " perfect " italian book or audio cd recommend students , because i often run into these two situations : 1 ) book too in-depth too focused grammar ; 2 ) book too superficial more phrase-book travelers , therefore not sufficient . so , what i usually use combination books , including audio cds , this one them . it some useful information culture , well practical expressions brave traveler . however , my recommendation take basic course before traveling italy , because even knowing few simple sentences get you long way . also , group setting you'll able ask specific questions practice others . i'm sure if you check your local community college , there some short continuing education courses foreign languages . non dimenticare ! don't forget : trick learning language repetition , so any audio cd gets you repeat words over over again , great practice . more you repeat , more you'll remember ! it like learning song : you can't sing song you've heard only 1 time , but if you hear it over over , you'll able sing all lyrics !! so , keep up good work ! if you need information traveling italy books learn italian , you also contact me : nada@nadasitaly.co	1

" one thing follows when economists go : occam razor wielded ruthlessly . occam razor principle associated medieval franciscan monk , william ockham , which extols simplicity over complexity : his words , " plurality should not posited without necessity . " this , over time , become important principle distinguishing good less-good science , useful less-useful descriptions reality . acemoglu robinson take this cu t-t he-chaff exhortation heart . few simple sharp answers provided even complex difficult questions heart book : why how democracy arise ? why how democracy take root some places some times , while making only cameo appearances others ? acemoglu robinson daringly reduce determinants democratization three or perhaps four : level inequality society ; structure economy ( i.e. whether it predominantly agrarian or otherwise ); kind assets owned elites ; extent globalization . it remarkable how many historical experiences-in latin america , europe , africa -- explained simple theory put forward authors . example , argentina frequent lurching various forms democracy autocracy follow neatly high levels inequality , which made elites very resistant democratization consequent redistribution wealth away them political change would entail . sure , fit theory historical experience not perfect , authors candid this . some cases book not discuss-india ability maintain democracy face overwhelming odds , example -- traditionally defied easy explanation , even political scientists . there surely cases where non-economic factors such ideology , individuals ( leaders ) , randomness , unintended consequence , significant role determining path political development . example , if sir sewoosagur ramgoolam , mauritius ' first prime minister , responded referendum before independence entrenching majority hindus rather than assuaging minority guaranteeing minimal political participation latter , mauritius might well like archetypal , strife-ridden , ethnically divided african country rather than durable democracy . quibble book structure . while there considerable rewards reading book , patience deft maneuvering through thicket mathematics , required reap them . authors could demarcated more clearly greek english allow mathematically challenged obtain benefits one continuous flow . way , book could more accessible curious generalist addition required reference specialist . but these minor shortcomings ultimately swamped , perhaps even unavoidable consequence , sheer ambitiousness effort : nothing less than provide simple unified explanation democracy . here additional bonus , theory taken data , even falsified . so , skeptics naysayers their go , refute or validate . either way , inquiry furthered stock knowledge enriched . most memorable rendition occam razor due einstein : " everything should made simple possible , but not simpler . " book certainly meets standard .	1

you might define field scientific investigation amount material very smart person process working around 20 hours per week . " process " i mean reading literature doing new experiments , i say 20 hours per week because most scientists spend more than half their time administrative junk . course , days when scientists like . copernicus i . newton their prime , there much less administration much less knowledge , so one scientist could meaningfully contribute multiple fields still time hobbies ( like practicing medicine ) . nowadays scientist might spend his entire career working one small part one small problem , progress so incremental it only noticed his immediate peers . that sign real progress , because it means many big problems long ago solved . but it also means very few scientists luxury looking big picture . so what happens if big picture where all answers ? what if there few laws stretch across disciplines , our modern-day isaac newtons spend all their time working details ? it possible , if it true we would need approach spans fragmented fields science , that what e.o. wilson calls consilience . book very well-written , it provides interesting survey many different aspects science humanities . idea certainly makes sense abstract , although i'm not really sure what author calling practice . i agree it would great if scientists educated more broadly outside their immediate disciplines , but i'm not sure how this without sacrificing some rigor drives science forward . maybe i missed something . wilson often criticized his suggestion methods science used study humanities . some reason this really bothers people , i don't understand why . all he saying scientific method great way understand how things work , there no good reason think music or poetry exceptions . last week there article journal science describing mathematical structure musical chords . author found chord sequences people find attractive occupy clusters non-euclidean geometric space . math allowed him detect patterns music certain composers , even certain styles music . all accounts very exciting discovery , one deepens my appreciation both music mathematics . why anyone would feel threatened this mystery should studied state-of-the-art neuroimaging methods	1

kapuscinski born poland 1930s lived through world war ii . he would go write poland national news service ( their version ap ) foreign correspondent . he covered " little wars , " insurgencies , revolutions , coups barely reported western media . his point view fascinating : man living behind iron curtain serves his country reporting terrifying conflicts most inhospitable parts world . when you read kapuscinski work you may first feel like something missing , then you realize what missing western perspective presumption detachment comes it . kapuscinski , like no other writer i've read , able delve into psyche his subjects produce remarkable insights their nature nature their oppression . which isn't say his writing dry . more often than not , episodes he relates quite harrowing . shah shahs no exception . quite unexpectedly , i found this book shah his overthrow ayatollah khomenei very relevant today conflicts , specifically , difficulties inherent replacing brutal oppressive regime without falling prey extremism . his discussion horrors shah secret police , savak , astonishing , his insight into vulnerability iranians they attempted move decades oppression fascinating . assessing difficulties undoing damage regime like shah , parallels today struggles iraq hard ignore , , such , book especially interesting read this moment history . i one book kapuscinski left read , after , i only hope some benevolent publisher decides put out more his work	1

this fascinating buying guide classical music recordings many positive attributes . it full interesting historical context composers their works fascinating performer trivia , making it quite entertaining educational addition comparing many recording choices . compared penguin or gramophone , it gives much more in-depth backgroung each work history significance . also , there lack any " british bias " ( since published usa ) some cite gramophone or penguin ( both uk published ) . case point : american pianist , garrick ohlsson superb eight volumes chopin arabesque label . third ear only guide extensively review each ohlsson arabesque cd while there not one mention 2003 penguin or gramophone . bias ? perhaps more likely brits just not familiar all musicians " across pond . " its really impossible any one guide " end-all " guide . notable unique feature third ear guide many pages great biographies famous musicians instrument back ( pianists , violinists , violists , cellists , wind players , percussionists , vocalists etc ) . so , here you find legends rubinstein , horowitz , pires , perahia , grumiaux , oistrakh , casels , starker , bain , holliger , graham , pavoratti many other admired musicians/vocalists thoughout past century . addition some curious history career milestones these well-loved performers , third ear guide also cites some their better recordings - real valuable feature i found . however , this guide waxes hot cold depending composer/genre . example , listings available performances huge category like beethoven 32 piano sonatas , there several entire pages covering nearly two dozen musicians who recorded those works compelling insights into their styles , historic performances careers . really great stuff conoisseur ! but , other categories it different story . most frustrating some many cases , obvious top recordings major performers not mentioned , leaving reader incomplete information . but , bottom line no one guide end-all resource , serious collectors this guide gramophone penguin guides each really something valuable often unique contribute study finest recordings . style side , commentary not dry academic but full human interest spicy opinions - revealing " nuggets " fascinating information music you most love . additionally , editors not always prim-and-proper , saying only positive things ( like penguin guide ) but actually give critical insightful comments which truly helps one sort out pack . this respect , third ear guide probably most interesting read compared others . so , this guide much more than just guide look up ratings - it fascinating journey into classical music , its vast repertoire its performers . if you serious collector , multiple guides area always best way go get wide variety opinion . if you really only pick one guide , most people would go legendary penguin guide . but , my second guide would definately third ear ( over gramophone ) it often lists recordings suprisingly not listed penguin . also , it just plain fun fascinating read random	1
admittedly , my education area american history somewhat lacking -- so my review going bit less critical than others , simply lack much compare it . however , i say schlesinger writing style witty , academic yet unprententious , almost lyrical flow it--it not dry reading though subject matter . if you don't know much american history beyond major events or what occurred over past 60 years , you learn things american politics you won't hear discussed any talk show , news program or editorial section newspaper . example , schlesinger points out " unilateralism " favored bush administration nothing new american history -- fact , more internationally involved stance maintained during cold war anomaly . this crucial point almost never brought up debates current events ; most people argue administration standpoint egregious break " american " foreign policy . author personal political viewpoint , i think schlesinger quite honest where he stands ( liberal ) , but i don't think this problem . he frank reader his own beliefs ; i think it better he this than pretend none all , which virtually impossible any historian ( though , obviously , there more or less blatant ways doing so ) . all historical accounts or analyses filtered through author individual lens . i don't think book suffers all because this . there few times focus book seemed bit all over place , but generally i feel i learned lot reading it . i would definitely recommend this anyone who doesn't read lot history normally but who curious nonetheless . schlesinger great writer easy get into -- additionally , text quite short history book , so this also makes it ideal beginner .	1

saying goes : " if you give man fish , you feed him one day . if you teach man fish , you feed him life .

i recently thumbing through overview book philosophy , writers made passing mention how theism viable intellectual option , simply virtue defense theism mounted great christian thinkers . author three examples descartes , reid , plantinga . alvin plantinga philosophical work spanned half century influenced whole philosophical world , among theistic non-theistic thinkers alike . books like god other minds , nature necessity , god , freedom , evil not only stood test time , but their influence continues felt across variety disciplines . analytic theist ( hereafter tat ) , editor james sennett collected most forceful significant his writings . one benefits such anthology it shows development philopher thought over time . here roots movement now known reformed epistemology , plantinga argument belief god no more unjustified than belief other minds his monumental essay , " reason belief god , " where he begins laying groundwork his later work why theistic belief legitimate epistemic warrant . but there more plantinga than epistemology . sennett includes his " free defense " problem evil , his modal version ontological argument god existence , few chapters philosophical theology , even review book new testament criticism . all these selections plantinga trademarks evident : his sharp wit , his use humor , his lucid writing style , most importantly , weighty clear-headedness mark any good analytic philosopher . those unfamiliar analytic philosophy or type meticulous logical argumentation plantinga utilizes , there some chapters seem difficult , if not downright opaque . case any highly specialized academic field , this expected , but general reader - especially general christian reader - should not turned off plantinga rigor . there other selections tat much easier going casual reader but equally important some more technical chapters . only potential complaint i tat it contains no chapters plantinga work area epistemic warrant , either warrant : current debate or warrant proper function , both which published five years prior tat . no study plantinga complete if it ignores his notion warrant , but minor quibble . tat essential reading any christian who endeavors intellectual faith . there something here not only christians academia but every believer . most christian scholars writers - if they worth their weight paper - already familiar plantinga , but it shame many christian leaders teachers seem not discovered his inestimable value . pastors , knuckle down pick up anything alvin plantinga . begin either analytic theist or warranted christian belief . it time move into big leagues .	1

review under mine ridiculous . this person obviously knows nothing tennessee williams . incidentally , i no interest his email address which he egomaniacally implies one should look . characters this play not hysterical ( except shannon once when he goes off deep end , that not hysteria come think it ) . this beautiful , moving , perceptive exceptional play . i won't give away plot case anyone wants read it . williams wrote lots good some great plays . this great one . i came upon this review ( one under it which just inaccurate , reviewer apparently hard time grasping what he reads , if he read it ) because i just saw movie this play want reread it again . i've read it many times , i love it . i think ( though i'm not sure ) bette davis played maxine original production , unlike ava gardner ( who perfect part ) , her " ha ! " ( described stage directions ) explosion , occurred frequently . one scene i give away . shannon tells hannah place where animals go deficate . place so poor people so hungry , people go through dung looking eating bits undigested food . hannah goes behind tree throws up . left out movie . this very kind gentle play . emotionally ( all williams ' plays i've read , he used hero mine , i've outgrown him , except this gem ) intellectually ( not so customary ) deep .

james robert parish " fiasco " interesting read anyone penchant hollywood film history . but it review some worst pictures ever made , he seems repeating himself - pictures fail only when they don't bring requisite amount dollars . everything else secondary whether or not film makes money - not just ( relatively ) small profit . movies make many , many times their cost not failure . pretty high hurdle . ultimately , causes all same : lack studio or producer oversight ; inflated star egos ; unplanned ( costly ) over-time ; bad press reviews . some hollywood truly awful films not reviewed here ( " heaven gate " primary example ) some arguably fair movies ( just not big money makers ) . example , " cleopatra " opening chapter sets stage all follows . you'll get no argument me " cleopatra " trial make . however ( my humble opinion ) final result lush tale fails only last third picture . given , i laugh one contemporary reviewer comment " [ elizabeth taylor ] screeches like ward heeler wife block party " last half film . so true ! mr. parish also refers number vanity films made promote liberal political views actors involved ( " chase " , " wild party " " reds " example ) but never explores possibility audiences go movies entertained - not lectured . i know it currently popular criticize entertainers using their platforms promote their personal political views i'm not trying join band wagon . but it fair suggest movie made primarily criticize traditional american mores ' not going big hit vast majority traditional americans . each chapter begins brief overview state theater going , i.e. , attendance numbers , ticket price , etc . this interesting itself . it also contains some few surprises . example , who knew song dance numbers " ishtar " intentionally bad ?! i just thought natural product fact beatty hoffman , while talented actors , neither singers nor dancers . all-in-all , mr. parish book entertaining read fair accounting some worst films ever made , though he offers little hope studios , talent or corporate owners learned anything way lessons their checkered past . book certainly breath fresh air traditional tinsel town history trumpets silver-screen successes bypasses its flops	1

proust great novel not need read all one time . i read it one volume time usually took six months year off volumes . i always able pick up right where i left off nothing lost , like visiting old friends . i think it ok think remembrance things past series novels . i know proust would disagree this . it very important him his readers consider carefully unifying theme symmetry which he aspired novel , but i think aspect became less less tangible his manuscript grew 1000 pages originally 2000 , then 2000 4000 odd pages it ended up ( he continued expand manuscript right up until time his death ) . any event , grand theme he designed not lost you if you stay novel until end it wonderful when you consider it , but it not reason i love novel so well . swann way , within budding grove , guermantes way decisively best volumes , fortunately , they first three order . if you like swann way but intimidated gargantuan size entire series , then plan read least first three volumes . this way you experienced proust best material . entire novel essentially fictional autobiography or memoir . it narrated man whose name we never given , although he hypothetically suggest name " marcel " himself one occasion three-fourths way through . story inspired events people proust life , but it strictly fiction . swann way only volume which narrator not central figure story . it , ultimately , conventional story several fascinating characters humorous , razor sharp dialogue . there several recurring , ingeniously depicted themes novel , not least which involuntary memory , it often reads like deeply philosophical essay , proust wandering off one his famous digressions . philosophical digressions best part me , but i could see why they could distracting or tedious some . proust sentences quite frequently stretch 10 , 20 , or even 30 lines , multiple subordinating clauses . it dizzying . some claimed this makes him stream-of-consciousness writer . i flat out reject this notion . it never , ever pretentious or unnecessarily wordy . literary historians love bracket proust same category joyce ( like art historians like couple , example , van gough gauguin ) , but two writers different night day . every sentence worth time proust , there no word games , there no obscurity , it all essential rewarding . only complaint i he spends too much time theme jealousy later volumes , theme he covered quite well swann way . those volumes worth reading too , but they tendency drag out way first three volumes don't . things pick up bit final volume , time regained , where everything comes full circle	1

" meat " preparation ( test strategies section ) only 62 pages long , easy enough read . although , there probably too few drills practice , you need take practice test get real sense what questions like . i noticed quite few typos thoughout book , which seems ironic book focused engligh literature . i took practice test #2 , scored 580 ( which isn't great ) , looking over answer explainations , it seemed me like lot questions two or more very legitimate , equally arguable answers . other words , topics questioned too subjective , open interpretation , more so than actual , official , sat subject test , which i just took found easier than practice test this book . but i not recieved my score back yet- so we see . also , book talks tests lot what it calls " roman numeral questions " , question format where you given three choices must choose combination roman numerals answer . it heavily stressed these confusing prevalent ... don't worry , i only encountered one these actual test . overall , i satisfied preparation this book provided , although i think it little too subjective questions it asked , which may frustrate you when taking practice tests . recommended someone who fairly good interpreting literature anyway ( " enlgish " person ) , who wants know what they going tested , especially people who not any specific preparation panicking wednesday before test ( me . ) not recommended someone who not " enlgish " person , or no familiarity literary terms/devices ( case , you probably shouldn't trying this subject test ) , or anyone who wants lot preparation becuase they feel really uneasy taking sat literature subject test .	1

i am actually reviewing both parts one two this since they should read together . reason why i enjoyed these plays so much because we see falstaff both them . he my favourite shakespearean character - big , bawdy , rough , liar cheat , but again we know what he right beginning , shakespeare keeps him so true character . these plays bit different some other histories . there more comedic parts them one thing . plays certainly used medium introducing young hal ( who become king henry ) . we see him young man , watch him grow see influences his society people it his development . he doesn't appear growing up well according his father because he so irresponsible . king henry iv not england strongest ruler . he haunted his guilt over death his predecessor , king richard ii . part two , comedy still plays big role , we still see falstaff influence young hal until shocking moment falstaff death . best part part two though deathbed scene old king henry iv his son prince henry . play leads us " king henry " . prince hal finally grow up he becomes very strong leader . actually king henry iv , parts one two should read before king henry . it correct sequence we see prince hal grow mature .	1

this wonderful recreation shakespeare time place . evocation england , it much superior ackroyd overly diffuse _albion : origins english imagination_ . ackroyd shakespeare actor poet first storyteller second , if all . ackroyd cautions us view theater elizabethans , highly-stylized rhetoric-festooned spectacle , not we now , attempt create naturalistic world miniature . ackroyd also great job portraying shakespeare he must seemed his contemporaries . he all rage while , undeniably talented , fast worker , but also frequent borrower other writers , even using verbatim passages sources his history plays . this he not unique his contemporaries , just moreso . magnitude his achievement would not become fully apparent three-quarters century . shakespeare here very much unseen seer , able take all guises never disclose his own true self . since all we really plays few legal documents , temptation infer shakespeare personality out his writings strong . ackroyd handles this pitfall-dotted terrain masterfully , reader never feels author climbing rainbows . neat surprise oft-parsed biographical material ackroyd assembles record lawsuit which shakespeare called witness . ackroyd points out this only surviving transcript shakespeare actual spoken words . perhaps typically , he noncomittal his testimony . latter fourth book only slightly less fascinating , plays finished biographical trail winds through miscellaneous legal materials contemporary allusions . but whole work great . ackroyd makes great tie-in end shakespeare life lines his last play : let us thankfulfor which , you leave disputethat above our question . let go offand bear us like time	1

poor , poor pere goriot ! this story tragic tale pathetic , old , doting father his martyrdom . goriot spoils his awful , frivilous , vain , ungrateful daughters throughout this book while they ignore manipulate him . daughters so terrible you can't help laughing little goriot pitiful way fawning over them putting them above even his most basic needs . they demand all best life while allowing their father live poverty need . they ask him luxuries when he barely enough survive . his concept paternal duty nothing less than inspirational , even though he pitiful , we can't help loving him admiring him despite his irritating messanic complex . balzac just such fun , rich , witty writer his characters so engrossing . he so adept pointing out self-absorption frivolity so many figures his time , making you feel bad their victims . i think any modern reader would enjoy him much they would-really more-than most contemporary writers . i think there should revival popularity books like these because they're just so much more intriguing than so many present day stories	1

problem pop-tune anthologies song lyrics heard , not read , only their music . especially so irving berlin , who nearly all his work theater films , whom presentation important song . ( picture " pretty girl like melody " without ziegfeld beauties -- impossible . ) fact berlin lines could flat-out flat-footedly corny . " melody mellow/played cello " only provoke giggles those unfamiliar songs , which i fear norm these days ; his worst he downright clueless . ( his proposed jingle unproduced nbc spectacular : " everybody step , /have drink coca-cola -- /it finest pepperola .... " pepsi-cola ? ) but this problem comprehensiveness . there too many " rag " songs " coon " songs " step-step-step " songs , too many singing musical notes dancing edibles , too much high-flown love treacle , too little poetry wit marked golden-age pop songwriting its finest . even most interesting ones like " sadie salome ( go home ) " , fresh their impudent suggestiveness , only hint their marvels . chronological layout inevitably sets up drab finish decades verbal noodling , reclusion despair . yes he wrote catchy tunes early days , but berlin didn't really come into his own until late , his thirties revues , fred-and-ginger scores , " holiday inn " , " this army " , " easter parade " , his one true masterpiece , " annie get your gun .

" mort " fourth book terry pratchett hugely popular discworld series . he gone win carnegie medal " amazing maurice his educated rodents " awarded obe 1998 . death - tall guy , somewhat underfed , big grin , carries scythe - appears more discworld books than any other character . however , " mort " first where his appearance anything other than very brief cameo - though , admittedly , he remains one book support characters . book hero mort , youngest son farming family living ramtops . he doesn't quite look typical hero : although tall overly-helpful , he also red-haired , freckled largely built knees . his family specialises distilling wine reannual grapes - you plant seed this year harvest grape last year . ( wine , you tend get hangover morning before need drink quite lot get over it ) . mort lack talent agricultural field ( boom boom ! ) , however , causing some concern his father . hoping someone hire him apprentice , lezek takes his son hiring fair sheepridge hogswatch night . although mort last one hired , he probably most aptly named apprentice - given his new boss death himself . despite mort initial discomfort position - he doesn't dead himself bones look entirely optional - he decides accept position . death also makes it clear he doesn't killing himself - that up assassins soldiers , example - he just takes over when people die . ( he , however , known murder curry ) . life ( if that what you call it ) death very strange . his home designed , unsurprisingly , varying shades dark much bigger inside than outside . he also daughter called ysabell butler called albert - both human not just skeletons - horse called binky . all also very much alive . problems start when mort starts shadowing his new boss work - specifically , when they due escort king olerv sto-lat into afterlife . king just assassinated his ambitious cousin duke sto-helit . unfortunately , princess keli next duke hitlist mort youthful hormones aren't too happy this . soon mort starts interfering , other questions start coming mind - like where death get daughter why he need apprentice ? despite his profession , death one funniest characters discworld . although it first book give him starring role , it may prove slight advantage read one or two other books .

admirer noel kingsbury prolific work , i initially put off this book . some passages , it reads like manifesto new approach gardening . futher reading , however , i found it stimulating , valuable , full hard-to-find information cutting edge work ornamental gardening , particularly europe . its emphasis design plantings reduced maintenance parks public areas not all off point home gardener - certainly this home gardener . i am 61 , only weekends gardening , weekends often interrupted other life demands , i garden difficult site heavy wet clay lots deer . so any gardening approach holds out way beautiful , sustainable garden , using plants suited existing conditions , i create maintain minimal effort time certainly value . moreover , kingsbury introduces me some exciting names gardening exciting gardens i've not known : work cassian schmidt hermanshoff germany only one example . this book window into world planting design gardening most us no access ( much published literature german ) kingsbury brings it light . i heartily recommend this book . it serious book , gives more more successive readings . if your time limited , you reread sections interest you find more value each time . i'm not sure what part piet oudolf actually played this book , but he certainly preeminent practitioner this style , his apparently loose association kingsbury should continue . they doing exciting work , this book puts their work into larger context gives it theoretical framework	1

let me start saying i thoroughly enjoyed this work . if you haven't read michener before , this great place start . typical michener , he tells story region over course centuries this book . michener selected particular river feeds chesapeake , choptank , his primary locale , but populated it geotypical persons , plantations , towns , rather than any specific actual persons or towns eastern shore chesapeake . grown up maryland , i experienced great deal nostalgia areas he describes . characters he creates believable complex . stories he tells across centuries compelling . i three concerns . first minor -- green-covered paperback word " scow " ( flat-bottomed boat ) replaced word " snow " every instance save one . this makes some odd reading , especially early chapters . second seems petty -- i actually believe there not quite enough information nearly 1000-page novel . he mentions guano trade , which significantly affected eastern shore , only one sentence end book . he doesn't explain some early economies very clearly . ( what salt purchased tortuga ? there no cash available , credit fithian seems unlikely extended there . ) islands other than fictional devon island ( e.g. tighlman island ) suddenly become important end book , referenced " old rivals patamoke . " if they old rivals , why didn't they appear before ? this get cut out book ? my third concern very strange charge levy against michener . anyone who seen musical " south pacific " knows , michener strongly opposed racism . certainly this book there whites , blacks , indians full range character talent . however , book still seems strange racist undertone i can't shake my mind . it comes how michener ties his story together across centuries . every janney feckless ( except one who becomes steed ) . every steed enterprising , although not necessarily industrious . every turlock craven . every cater proud , even if this expressed differently across generations . every paxmore upstanding , even sad-sack pusey paxmore believes he acting upstanding manor until he looks back what he . one steed even refuses acknowledge her own grandchildren because they turlock blood them , praised author doing so . i realize michener using shorthand help reader keep characters straight across centuries , but result rather too " geneticist , " arguing genes determine destiny	1

try imagine you write sketch comedy lines " saturday night live . " you trying come up skit parodying snooty intellectuals . no matter how talented you , you would unable create fictional satire effective real live harold bloom . bloom certainly pretty proud himself here . he gives us his insight into what makes these geniuses so brilliant . it gets laughable times . example , bloom argues dostoyevsky genius typified his tedious portrayal fyodor pavlovitchkaramazov , while he lacks any notable religious or philosophical genius because he anti-semite . yes bloom , anti-semitic really bad , but believe it or not , person some extremely warped ( or even evil ) views still make outstanding contributions our religious philosophical make up . abraham lincoln said some nasty racist stuff during his lifetime , but still laid out idea american civil religion beautifully gettysburg adress . i certainly find way socrates comported himself young boys more than bit disturbing works such plato " charmides , " but hardly detracts his apology . likewise , dostoyevsky fact religious philosophical genius , despite anti-semite . you'd think ivy league professor would demonstrate some understanding fact people need not morally one dimensional . then there bloom treatment " yawhist . " i think there few areas literary criticism better reveal one character than forays into biblical analysis . you're self described radical who loves foist your utopian political opinions everyone you meet . you decide study bible what you know , you discover jesus st. paul really radicals who really wanted stick it roman empire . you're rigid , uptight moralist . you read bible wow ! you find god really all rules regulations , people you resent aren't living up . your primary interest buisness , you read bible you discover jesus best salesman ever lived , really encourages capitalism ( investing talents all ) . you're harold bloom you read torah discover ... surprise ! yawhist pretentious , snooty intellectual who loved irony . even more sexy intriguing , she sophisticated lady royal court . no doubt one who would charmed harold bloom brilliant conversation , sharp insights into her writing . this book wavers bloom painfully self-satisfied , bloom so self-satisfied he hilarious . thankfully , there more latter . i understand some people might want give this book higher marks , because regardless what it says these geniuses , he good taste . really though , stop think arguement . how hard it compile list geniuses would pretty acceptable anyone know ? i'm pretty sure anyone literature classics course catalogs few universities could patch together something comparable simply cutting pasting . all said , bloom writing good , even if ludicrously pretentious . i can't really knock him stating his opinions . ater all , i zero credentials , write reviews amazon .	-1

let face it ... much we'd like linux oft-chosen alternative microsoft windows outside it environments , fact remains you still need geek get everything work " just right " . michael jang written very nice book help both you users you support overcome linux annoyances his book linux annoyances geeks . contents : configuring desktop environment ; configuring user workstations ; optimizing internet applications ; setting up local applications ; installation annoyances ; basic start configuration ; kernel itches other configuration annoyances ; system maintenance ; servicing servers ; user management ; administration tips ; indexin some ways , this feels bit like one o'reilly recipe books . each chapter series " problems " ( this case , annoyances ) dissected resolved based author knowledge advice . writing very person-to-person , problems like " my cd/dvd locked " , my hard drive too slow " , " i can't boot because kernel panic " . you get feeling author talking * * you , not * * you . result , some problems could very intimidating ( like kernel panics ) treated calm rational manner . information also not restricted single distribution . he covers solutions major distros , like debian , suse , fedora , red hat enterprise linux . solutions desktop issues most cases cover both kde gnome . you should able find * something * here relates your particular setup ... like many books try cover range issues or scenarios , your impression book going dictated whether he covered annoyance(s ) bother you most . but even just getting two or three really good answers make book extremely valuable you . overall , i thought this one best troubleshooting linux books i've seen , one should given serious consideration if you regularly work linux	1

master terror , science fiction mystery genre , richard matheson work inspired many classic ( not so classic films ) . why ? because he one best writers working genre never quite good respect it deserved . his best work inspired people like dean koontz , stephen king , dan simmons other current masters terror . matheson shrinking man ( original title way -- incredible part novel what i recall added after movie made)begins simply enough ; scott carey out boat his brother when ship enveloped fine mist gently stings his skin . he wipes it off , goes down below tell his brother marty it thinks nothing it again . until he begins grow smaller each day . this simple beginning we immediately jump carey fighting spider basement his house ( although both novel film begin same way , after introduction matheson novel veers slightly different direction telling us most story flashback . smart choice novel it would bold choice film but universal-international veoted idea ) . marvelous novel deals themes sense self , loss control , ultimately , loss identity carey shrinks smaller smaller , it also marvelous story terror ( elements science fiction thrown well ) . finally back print after long slumber , incredible shrinking man fleshed out number stories ( novel only 200 pages)including " duel " ( basis steven spielberg film same name ) , " nightmare 20,000 feet " (the basis classic " twilight zone " episode featuring william shatner remade director george miller " twilight zone movie " ) , seven other short stories . warning readers order . " duel " " test " both appear 2 other matheson anthlogies published tor books but there also lot other gems books duel nightmare 20,000 feet well . if you enjoyed this book , i'd suggest matheson marvelous novel i am legend ( which , again , fleshed out 10 matheson short stories novel fairly short . novel made into two films neither one which captures novel very well . " last man earth " horrendous " omega man " . it also provided uncredited inspiration george romero " night living dead " trilogy ) . matheson hommage shirley jackson haunting hill house , hell house also good read ( made into movie " legend hell house " featuring roddy mcdowall ) .	1

if you system or network administrator , then you're concerned security . if you're concerned security , then you want copy " linux firewalls " handy . spite its title , " linux firewalls " more than just firewalling . after introductory material firewalls , how packet-filtering firewalls work , suehring ziegler dive into creating firewalls iptables : enabling services , blocking attacks , optimizing firewall rules , etc . they spend decent amount time looking forwarding nat . they demonstrate some possible network setups varying complexity , show how write iptables rules those environments . remaining third book explores other security tools , such tcpdump , snort , aide . kernel " enhancements " selinux grsecurity discussed briefly . if sounds like lot material cover , it . book weighs over 500 pages , but it laid out such it pretty easy get information you need quickly . authors good job presenting such large amount material clear , easy-to-grasp fashion . also , book includes links further resources highlighted boxes text , collected appendix , if you need go into greater depth particular topic . book full useful tips . example , discussion log target , they explain technique extracting iptables messages noise /var/log/messages directing them their own log . this question comes up repeatedly iptables mailing list . trick use " -- log-level " switch configure syslog write items come through specified log-level seperate log . you still get occasional false positive this way , but it sure beats slogging through all noise /var/log/messages . i couple criticisms make book . example , start firewall boot time , authors recommend ieither using " iptables save " function ( red hat ) , or adding line rc . local . problem former " iptables save " , authors point out , not terribly reliable . furthermore , if you're using script generate your firewall rules , then your rules already saved . problem rc . local then firewall start after network up services listening . i prefer write init script use chkconfig utility ( red hat/suse ) bring up firewall rules before network . biggest omission book any information bridge firewalls . bridge very useful putting transparent firewall onto your network . i am surprised there not even mention bridging , or ebtables ( userspace bridge tools ) , since bridging now part standard kernel . iptables also made work bridge module . pointing out this omission may not completely fair criticism : i yet see firewall book covers bridging linux ebtables ( or iptables ) . nonetheless , " linux firewalls " very nice addition my library . this book live either my desk , or any easily-accessed shelf nearby . disclosure : publisher sent me copy this book review .	1

employed where many maps kept , i always make sure i one these around . i picked rand mcnally atlas upon consideration these important features : 1 ) state maps must enough color contrast able make instant distinctions different roads highways , well municipal boundaries ; 2 ) inset maps cities should depict major attractions , buildings monuments , indicate one-way streets downtown area ; 3 ) driving distances , scale miles , clear legend should appear alongside each state map ; 4 ) index counties , cities towns should located separately maps , so give more room state/city maps main pages ; 5 ) inset maps national parks should also included . rand mcnally atlas all these features , plus other bonuses i like : state-by-state auto rules , important phone numbers ; good overall maps u.s. canada , time zones ; even map telephone area codes . my only criticism map mexico should cover two pages instead one , but this not enough reduce top rating	1

this book revealing typical young earth creationism ( yec ) . these people good great zeal defend christian faith . i commend them . but i must say loving way their method unscientific . it misleading untruthful . we cannot defend truth using par t-t ruth . either way , this still lying ! how anyone defend good cause bad tools ? this destroy christian witness gospel . theologian scientist i must refute young earth creationist movement . many christian leaders theologians opposing young earth creationism because their lies . scientist community ( including christian scientists ) rejects kind pseudoscience promoted distributed yec . today , evidence against young earth creationism ( yec ) continues accumulate . this leads inevitably general conclusion against all christianity . i am so grieved when i see atheists laughing kind science propagated yec . christ name hurt . why young earth creationists twist facts lie so much ? well answer simple . they not any evidence science whatsoever ! then , they invent it somehow . this how they it . they say god created universe ( this right ) . using usher genealogy they believe bible says earth young . ( bible not say ) then they say : " we prove what we believe means science ( after all god created science ) " . but science not helping them . then they forced dig around find any flaws science they use abuse . they continue accumulating anything they find make case ( bits pieces unresolved issues , like little discrepancies scientific data so ) . using scientific language ( their degrees science ) they go out their fields expertise continue their propaganda misinterpreting manipulating scientific data , twisting ignoring facts , misquoting various writers , using wrong tools different kinds measurements , etc . this lying . if they find one discrepancy out , lets say one hundred , they choose ignore 99 order stress one fits their theory . this not integrity . you call this science ? doing sound apologetics we need bring unbelieving scientists faith christ . unfortunately this kind yec propaganda doing exactly opposite . one day they held responsible before god . zeal not enough ; you need wisdom too . yec not any ! this sad .	-1

i agree other reviewers this title this re-hash her previously released books . they all pretty much same , quotes famous not so famous thrown around if she some kind scholar . anyone really care quotes her husband , peter ? " ms witherspoon " review , believe me when i say i am one person who doesn't resent ms. stoddard lifestyle all , frankly i could care less what she or not . i just find her somewhat pretentious . you think she would schedule one her " happiness weekends " harlem preach her message " joy " " love " ? i doubt it very seriously because she would never associate " those kinds people " . ms. stoddard sprinkles " higher power " theology through her book but never she once mention god . who her " higher power " anyway ? who she thank many blessings she , believe me she quick tell you them , i.e. - her two homes , her collection paintings , trips abroad , etc . i borrow this library so i am thankful i didn't spend my money it . if you want alot fluff no real substance then this book you . ms. stoddard living glass bubble ( waterford , no doubt ! ) due serious reality check ! hopefully this last book she publishes long , long time .	-1

seeing some these reviews confirms my notion how general public praise crap like " da vinci code " or brain dead housewives weep over terrible " lovely bones " or think pretentious , cliched narratives like " time traveler wife " worth exploring . this 1st cj book i ever read , there i read every one since . his best book oxherding tale , but this comes close second . 1st all , i must respond rather biased nagative reviews claiming " how would ex-slave speak so intellegently kant , etc ... " well , point here " i " used book isn't necessarily rutheford point time , but perhaps years later , or even after his death . " lovely bones " awful book attempts narrator who dull s**t speak after she murdered . one reviewer commenting how certain railroads didn't exist until after civil war probably closest hint yr gonna get show this story told after his death , or much , much later . it while since i read this book , but descriptions poetic rich , it just sad how yet again cliche confirmed : take great book like middle passage , reviews middling good . but take yr average sappy , bathetic oprah pick , housewives rolling floor . if you like real literature , this you . but if what you want crap , then you won't get it	1

eugene o'neill play " long day journey into night " pulitzer award winning , autobiographical play his family . i must admit though eugene o'neill considered some father american theater , i not enjoy reading this play . tyrone family insane dysfunction their constant bickering apologizing very annoying frustrating read . i also disliked fact after four acts continuous yelling tension o'neill offered no conclusion . day life tyrone family gets progressively worse until it finally peaks play just ends . no happy ending , no hope future , just despair . " long day journey into night " wholly depressing read i really could without . however , after learning more eugene o'neill background , extent which play based his life , i began greater appreciation this play . o'neill lead very hard life , therefore frustration despair i felt while reading this play demonstrates o'neill talent engage his audience convey emotions characters very real manner . while o'neill depressing end not satisfy my craving happy ending , it appropriate play eugene own family never got happy ending . i like clever way o'neill showed tyrone family desire but inability forget their troubles through dialogue . beginning play audience presented normal , loving family . audience soon however , gets suspicion something isn't quite right , family tense . slowly family skeletons exposed through arguments family members , but characters always feel regretful bringing subject up . thus showing no matter how hard tyrone family tries pretend all well , their skeletons always them resurface continually remind them truth . although i still believe " long day journey into night " thoroughly disheartening read , reader emotional response this play leaves no doubt o'neill exceptional writing .	-1

" unlike jk rowling who , first pages harry potter philosopher ( or sorcerer ) stone , provides reader vivid description harry skinny , unruly mop black hair , startlingly green eyes , , course , lightning-bolt scar his forehead , cooper not describe stanton all . result reader , after read 244 pages , still cannot visualize what looks like !! i also find quite annoying cooper approach this good vs . evil tale . she vague abstract till end who exactly old ones , who or what exactly dark . dark evil , all reader succeeds gleaning dark means cold , snow , -- course -- darkness . excuse me : but this best cooper ? this what this book ? -- druid pagan worldview light vs . dark , summer vs . winter , warmth vs . cold ? what happened conception evil moral evil ?	-1
i agree reviewer who said this work boring . it seems roth trying glorify philip roth not characters . he goes describing overwhelming feelings zuckermann " swede " , without letting us know who swede really . roth should let characters tell story or try use less erudition his narration . it gets point where reader loses interest finishing book . i loved plot against american because it more character based than philosophizing historical context times	-1
expose power hungry woman not give hoot civility compassion . riveting its revelation anna wintour icy personality even sun cannot melt ! though it not official autobiography , it well researched consistent views given most 200+ interviewees who worked or contacts anna directly good enough sound judgement anna character report card minus 100 anna personality traits !! those who think official autobiography would it more justice , i would say anna wintour would probably give very skewed account her favor would make it more " unofficial " than this unauthorised one . it makes you more determined than ever never work these abnormal people who show such traits . if earth needs sacrifice some human beings aliens invading solar system , anna wintour would surely make it top hit list people get rid !!! :)))))) i find it incredible there willing sacrificial lambs willing work this woman hell ! i just think those who work , constant contact or live her their morals twisted beyond belief , they no longer differentiate what right or wrong ! good example this would bee shaffer , daughter anna wintour , who recently remarked british newspaper , daily telegraph , which bee monthly contributor , her mother nickname " nuclear wintour " just myth ???!! excuse me ??, bee this sayquote bee daily telegraph , uk dated 5 oct 05 : " but it such myth me . she just comes into office she goal : she wants produce great magazine , which i think she . you work very hard she very direct what she wants . i don't think makes her ' nuclear wintour ' or whatever they call her .	1
i very much looking forward recieving this title amazon.com after reading first few pages online . , admittedly , i like first few chapters ; however , tone style presentation changed very quickly , became almost smug self-aggrandizing . authors seemed far too pleased themselves , , approximately halfway point i felt if i reading some kind bizzare conservationist manifesto . i like think - self-appointed conservationist vegan - i try mind mother nature all living creatures , but after i finished reading this repetitive , pedantic bore , i lost care . maybe i am too harsh , but this book seemed peak first chapter ; then , it became exasperatingly preachy redundant . others liked book , that fine ; but i disappointed	-1

this book excellent explaining labyrinth arabic grammar . it wisely introduces verb forms groups consistent vowelling participle formation which easiest format i've seen so far . it explanations remarkably clear . i think advantage since one authors not native speaker they able explain clearly other non-natives what native speakers probably take granted . it also consistently scrupulously vowelled ( essential grammar text book . ) other users remarked however , book not without flaws . conjugation charts wretched . everytime i look them , i get confused forget how conjugate verbs . print quality , others said , not greatest . vocabulary end each chapter bizarrely not alphabetical order ( english or arabic ) order seems quite random so looking up words pain ( there decent root-based dictionary back however . ) indeed sentences exercises quite stilted . check out this gem : " we described all these events you so you may know piety preferable despair , we put our ideas our many letters you during period two years . " come again ?? ( this before translation . ) still , they designed illustrate reinforce grammatical concepts they quite well . interestingly my teacher , who native speaker , hates book because stilted wording bad examples- e.g. illustrate 10 verb forms , they use some verbal variants don't actually exist . finally , it really bugs me they use egyptian style printing final " ya " which means they don't put dots underneath . thus , it looks identical character alif maqsura . there whole chapter defective verbs ( those end wow , ya or alif ) authors actually say " look how ya changes alif maqsura some these examples . " well , actually i can't tell guys because you didn't dot your letters . absolutely unacceptable grammar book designed non-natives would make this omission . despite this book flaws , this excellent guide arabic grammar especially considering other options amazon price you'd hard pressed find better deal . if you studying your own , there also teacher manual available	-1

although anne made some excellent points , it still one-sided . she still speaks republicans general better which wrong because many them just hypocritical democrats ( some worse because they know what god commands but don't actually care ) , although she gives some explanations why republicans better party , they deceptive wrong . example republicans better because they promote chrisitianity specific their arguments : yes , true some ways , however many promote false christianity make it look bad because many them not truly christians but putting up show . needs said otherwise people get impression often all christians hypocrites it all financial gain or vain glory . merely specific argument doesn't make argument better . example i say , " democrats out get your kids poor because they want raise taxes poor give tax cuts rich want force children learn white wash " but so called republicans like george bush want too . i would like say this good book give young girl , because it shows you still fememine , wise , christian , yet not fool or knowledgeable emotionally immature ( other words nerd ) , but it too many big errors . it helpful howewver everyone general who wants know what wrong some type arguing how argue constructively . although she doesn't give thorough explanation subject , it very good concise . i just happened comforted her words because day before attacked vagueries pastor aog church	-1

it mark twain who popularized aphorism benjamin disraeli there three kinds lies : lies , damned lies , statistics . i kept hearing all these marvelous things freakonomics , book steven levitt stephen dubner , so when i ran across it 25% off , i stupid freakin ' thing bought it . i thought , what freak , i've got pretty inquisitive mind i'm open seeing things differently , discovering new viewpoints . doubt started early when i got book home i first noticed glowing comments dust jacket likes time , new york times , washington post , los angeles times . when all liberal news agencies lining up tell me how wondrous certain publication , i'm immediately going freakin ' suspicious . author malcolm gladwell tells us cover , " prepare dazzled . " well , evidently ol ' malcolm dazzled whole lot easier than i am . ( i won't even mention smug mug stephen dubner taunted me book dust jacket because i don't want you get idea i judge book its cover . or this case , writer his physiognomy . so i won't mention . ) if you're kind person who amazed learn 70% auto accidents occur within 10 miles driver home , then you just might dazzled freakonomics . if i tell you company issues its 5-day-a-week employees only 3 uniform shirts , thinking it cutting costs , probably increasing its overhead , this fact astounds you - if you must ask " but how ? " - then yes , buy freakonomics dazzled . mostly what freakonomics offers ( when its conclusions trusted ) just what we used call " common sense . " but since america reduced bunch corpulent , brain-dead zombies staring vacuously box survivors , american idols , lost knuckleheads , good old-fashioned common sense now appears dazzle dead ( when you sever them box put real book their hands , ) . i dove into freakonomics hoping find my purchase worthwhile . i got no further than page 13 when my fears realized : everything would require second-guessing verifying . page , smug mug tells us ( based single report institute medicine ) " drinking eight glasses water day never actually shown thing your health . " fortunately , i read your body many cries water doctor . batmanghelidj over decade ago so i already knew what bunch bunk . chapter 4 , smug mug " proves " legalizing abortion 1973 roe . wade decision responsible national drop crime rate . this represents centerpiece his book , both literally ideologically . first thing reader must accept there really significant drop crime since early 1990s . page 92 , author acknowledges police atlanta discovered underreporting crime early `90s hopes landing 1996 olympics . well , would police forces nationally incentive underreport crime generally if it actually dramatically increased since `90s predicted ? true , honest might means increased budget , but it sure would make your department appear inept unable maintain control . surely chamber commerce big business interests would frown public perception . let me ask , you actually feel you're less likely victim crime now than you early 1990s ? that funny , me neither . there so much crime now some what once reported police agencies goes unreported , recently , ex-police officer friend told me cops no longer engage some micro-policing they able `80s `90s because crime so out-of-control now . dismissing other possible factors responsible huge drop crime ( if this claim verity ) , dubner states increased police personnel accounts only 10% drop . bit more insight into nature police work than average civilian , it funny i find myself even contending stats smug mug uses actually work against his theory : i believe wide-scale hiring police officers since early `90s could impacted crime rate only minimally - less than 10% - while actually increasing municipal coffers via traffic citations significantly . dubner concludes righ t-t o-carry firearm laws " simply don't bring down crime . " ( sure read utterly fascinating book , gunfighters , highwaymen vigilantes roger . mcgrath , decidedly different scholarly viewpoint ! )in dismissing all explanations unexpected drop crime except legalized abortion , i didn't notice any mention tremendous increase homeschooling proliferation private schools since early `90s , i wonder if might some statistical bearing . ya think ? yes , i think smug mug selective . he calls some abortions " crude drastic sort insurance policy . " not " immoral . " not " sinful . " but then i didn't expect smug mug call sin sin . even if levitt dubner hypothesis correct , abortions lowered crime , fact remains not every aborted child would eventually murdered innocent person , but every aborted child innocent person murdered . so why we even discussing this ? i'll tell you why : because pro-choice folks feel slightly shifting consensus , now they're pulling out all stops , trying " statistically " convince masses they're safer all those unborn potential criminals missing . i find this repulsive ! ( there studies indicating those missing people , continue , negative economic impact society . ) i won't even go into chapter 5 , what makes perfect parent ? suffice say usual ( surprise ! surprise ! ) all statistics dubner employs nearly always seem confirm rightness liberal dogma each issue . funny how those crunched numbers always crunch conservative beliefs . just know if you're working mother , you haven't cheated your child least , but if you're dad who thinks occasional spanking order , you " unenlightened . " if your kid watching lots tv , it isn't turning " child brain mush . " ( no word whether or not it turning his/her morals mush though . ) studies ( we called pay attention ) show " child character wasn't much affected whether or not he sent day care , whether he one parent or two , whether his mother worked or didn't , whether he two mommies or two daddies or one each . " ( i've often wondered what might happened me if my mom , who home most time , hadn't there hammer dangers drugs into my head day after day , year after year , while i growing up `60s `70s . ) i've given freakonomics two stars because i find section naming children very interesting , well story stetson kennedy fight against " three ks . " but if you're smarter than i am , you'll borrow this book your library rather than paying money it . economically speaking , that just " common cents . "	-1

far shakesepare comedies go , " comedy errors " always my favorite . while this " you like it " never quite obtained popularity " midsummer night dream " or " taming shrew , " one probably could argue " you like it " best shakespeare comedies . this play contains several plots shakespeare cleverly intertwines it offers happy ending love triumphant . but more important than triumph love , theme reconciliation carries through virtually everyone story . story begins sibling rivalry orlando his older brother oliver who hoarded family inheritence . after brief fight , oliver hopes orlando may accidentally die wrestling match against charles . this where 2nd plot comes . duke frederick ( who daughter celia ) banished his older brother ( true duke who daughter rosalind ) . but now , rosalind allowed stay she made good friends celia . orlando meets these 2 girls falls into favor rosalind . after wrestling match , things start go bad . orlando learns his brother oliver planning kill him , rosalind banished . but all not lost . orlando takes his loyal servant adam flees while rosalind ( male disguise ganymede ) , celia , comical touchstone flee look rosalind father . here where play becomes mostly comical . ( good comedies often sad start . " comedy errors " shows this well . ) moving , we meet rosalind father his crew who made exile into paradise . duke sr party , we meet melancholy jaques . but he arguably most interesting character story . ( fact , most famous passage this play belongs jaques . 7 stages man which end nothing . perhaps macbeth took lessons jaques : ' tomorrow , tomorrow , tomorrow . ' ) duke sr welcomes orlando adam , it isn't long before orlando rosalind run into each other . shakespeare maintains comedy when rosalinde keeps her male disguise tells orlando he must practice wooing him/her . touchstone some comical romantic moments audrey . there interesting triangle where shepherd silvius loves phebe , but phebe loves rosalinde ( seeing only ganymede) ! we may recall this " 12th night " when olivia loved viola her male disguise . but after this comical moment , all begins resolve . oliver comes scene he celia fall love . ( so much so oliver willing reconcile orlando grant him all . ) play ends not only reunion rosalind her father , but joyous weddings rosalind / orlando , celia /oliver , audrey /touchstone , phebe / silvius , but more good news comes . celia father mends his ways returns all rosalind father . jaques offers crowning touch . despite his cynical nature , he not villain . ironically , this hermit type man converses more characters than anyone story , while he not take part play final happiness , he wish everyone well . i said , my favorite comedy always " comedy errors . " but don't make mistake overlooking this comedy	-1

if i didn't know any better , i'd swear this book written satanist . author seems rejoicing prospect armageddon , including mountains blown up destruction all world cities . i bought tatty copy one penny i somewhat surprised see 1973 it its 27th printing . it seems reasonable then assume mr lindsey views fairly representative mainstream america . if that case then suggests plenty americans keen armageddon erupt middle east so " good christians " may whisked off private audience . christ while rest population burns . i would recommend this book all israelis . his book last days israel , zionist author barry chamish declared israel main enemies european socialists . well , i reckon hal lindsey his fans present greater threat . it seems likely if supposed temple solomon not rebuilt israel isn't annihilated then lot committed christians going most upset . bit " good news " lindsey book surviving israelis convert christianity such passion they like " 144,000 billy grahames " . it seems committed christians charge both uk us governments us government could described theocracy . i wonder if theocrats share views mr lindsey , who states this book each arab generation hates israel more than one before , which would good news it would mean they would more likely attack initiate armageddon cause return jesus christ . russia portrayed villain book , but " red china " " red chinese " get look-in chapter entitled " yellow peril " . book however contain one true statement , page 120 : " religion great blinder minds men . " frankly , i hope " rapture " happen soon . sooner people like hal lindsey whisked off face earth , greater likelihood peace world	-1

i've software industry quite awhile , i've watched personal computer industry evolved one where there dozens machines sold consumers down two primary platforms windows macintosh . while there no doubt macintosh minority platform , there also no doubt its continued survival engendered unexplained amount hate those who not fans machine . this book , summary , longwinded rant one such user . someone who knows first hand number situations covered book , who generally solid understanding situations not covered book , i believe author this book sat down wrote it out himself without any fact checking , without any real interviews ( or he ignored or misunderstood people he interviewed ) . there so many factual errrors this book , its not funny- -from little things like years events happened or locations companies or person who held particular role particular time , grossly innacurate assumptions things author could not possibly know -- such minutes boardroom discussions . this smear job , thru thru , like most smear jobs its repetitive , self-contradictory , downright dishonest . i think only reason author not sued doing so would give this book far more attention than it deserves . windows fans like kick apple mac , even when they down . windows seems engender some sociopathic sadism people . if you want learn more apple , find book ... this book just windows fan bashing steve jobs taste	-1

okay , this book out long enough there more than one review , so show my support , i add one here since i missed his book tour sf mere two days . i can't believe it . i just don't read newspapers all anymore . didn't book come out august ? but they wouldn't tour him august . it like december : business shuts down like jewish girl after her wedding night . just well . what would i , anyway ? lurk ? smile ? try say something unusual charming ? not gonna happen . book tours exhausting so speed-dating author series blurts too much . best read his blog his site his own name . i'll remove this review later because i like private ( i remove all my reviews ) , but this cockfight book , quick stabs , perfectly designed actual writers attention spans too short actually read real paragraphs anymore . it got so much teeth-baring energy irreverence someone who handle running into anyone street . we're talking courage , baby . no cowering here . [ way , writer/artist friends , read rollo may courage create see this all diagrammed out . ] eszterhas ' last book , hollywood animal , started out fine me , but end i wash my face afterwards . there just too much anger testosterone before he wrenched himself his previous hollywood life . he escaped hand-in-hand naomi his kids safety ohio like von trapps " sound music . " but perhaps bad-writing stories too close home , i felt same way nyc publishing world i sprayed my vitriol into many folks ' eyes , too . it burns like mace . but you can't imagine how it feels us inside . times like those , we one shrill ladies jerry springer . one . you hear me ? that very bad , bad place . splotchy skin , fishbelly texture all . ( don't you get springer pin up calendars ? )so i read around reviews before buying this hardcover . i'm cheap my own library readers who wonder why i quit writing books . too many books my excruciatingly tiny apartment it . so i also read joe queenan ny times interview , but i smile condescendlingly all through it , because writer , it really just smacks jealously bitter sibling sarcastic riff . ( when someone sees peer excel breaking very rules they've so assiduously following , it blows their cotton-picking minds they might've cheating themselves all these years . ) it cute little review , but i think critics just snide wannabes who should forced write each review gynecological chair , showing little pink room full people eating cheese talking cell phones . artists forced take take take again every word like sweet young thing our first night clink . but i like idea queenan fine . i miss philadelphia terribly , think everything everyone there great . except main line . it hard funny or cool main line . geez , thread count cityline avenue alone rivals finest egyptian cotton sheets . but he lived city once , right ? worked there ? bought four pretzels dollar once his car ? anyhow , i don't know where he lives but his writing smacks main line : well-to-do middle-aged guys trying just little too hip , surly , smug when there absolutely no longer any reason angry " young " man . if you afford frog , i don't wanna hear any bellyaching . our personal thread counts tell no lies ... besides , whole philadelphia area , anyone who knew john debella since ' 80s , when he wmmr head-to-head howard stern , knows he only one who gets play card all happened his wife all . talk your life publicly dragged behind old pickup truck fun . old " louie louie " parade yore should just parading him around everyone shoulders once year . but what i know ? queenan funny when he writing impossibility doing his own thing like trying make original $7500 movie under guise trying take down yet artist , robert rodriguez ( tsk tsk , looks like somebody needs hug , queenan ) . but queenan mere boy . it eszterhas who dirty dozens -- verbally disembowel best ' em any street corner -- still parts intact saunter off any actress who happens passing . so too bad he got sit there take ny times article like someone who his home number written truck stop bathrooms all over world . i feel him . there no back alleys critics . rest us ? -- yes . / critics ? -- no . they jam their thumbs their ears wiggle their skinny little weak fingers air skip off into night . ( ... where special chair ? )so i'm glad see readers stepping up giving eszterhas last word . it beautiful thing see artist triumph over ubiquitous critics his audience . i think posters aztec warriors around here ... eszterhas standing mountain top ... loin cloth pinned together regulation no . 5 brass fasteners . only two . formerly long malibu-blond hair blowing mountain wind , scantily-clad screenwriters napping his feet . anyhow , i surprised how much i like this book . it what it . i cringe while hearing creepiest side hollywood where scientologists ( religion cyborgs cash registers ) thrive next blockbuster producers , women seem plastic straight-faced janet jackson treat themselves like blow up dolls . it horror movie we're eating what they're farming ; i get so tired all those boys down there literally metaphorically poking all our faces , collecting our heads like shish kabob . but when i read it life advice writer , i'm ecstatic don't want it end . i'm always struggling where put tantrums my life like punctuation . if that what you want need , then don't listen any critics or people taking eszterhas down peg or star . it deserves all five stars just its relentless audacity . but hey , it pert ' darn near un-american not want bash anyone who much anything --- heck , it even hard me not joe queenan bash any baby boomer who ever more than one house when most us barely come up insane down payment one . ( i so don't wanna hear or see any more documentaries or books your " good ol ' days " ' sixties ' seventies , when rent bottle beer free-love hug . you all free time world stare ceiling , lovin ' , make " ground-breaking " art .... blibbedy blabbedy blue ... ) . but my pale , quivering writer friends , take him down ( new snide way we've all perfected ) your own peril ! reading this book like knocking back whiskey smoking too much our sailor suits , back bar eszterhas before he says : " okay , kid , i warmed holly ' up ya . go there show ' er how it !... oh , uh ... way , quit smoking . " --- then sends us off hollywood pick up where he left off , our shaky knees -- but blustery hearts . who cares whether you like his movie work or not ? that absolutely irrelevant most people know . we're all puerto rican here , whether you speak spanish or eat smoked herring also irrelevant . we writers spend too much time hunched over , writing others getting proverbial girl -- even if we girl . but we rarely swagger real life get our own girls . but he . smarmy or not , you've gotta hand it guy holding his own . this book doesn't need cover , it needs cod piece . all that relevant . we need this call war . because technology boredom what out there , things ' changing tectonic shifts taking place we've got psych ourselves up writer power like any self-respecting black panther would've ( back day before their name became used hip hop clothing line ) . there special way dial perfect combination so you " make money without losing your soul " he writes . but i'm almost forty , don't clue what it . i shake my shoes ask " what ? what exactly would jesus if he wrote his own book tried sell it ? " even though i haven't foggiest idea , i go make muffins because i figure jesus would make muffins because they hard make ( read : " sacrifice " ) , they make people so happy muffin kinda ' way ( read : " giving " ) . few weeks ' time , i'll back my old self , but here california , you've got least pretend you're outwardly " nice " every once awhile , some widely-accepted faux-spiritual zen-buddhist bowing way or they chase you up hill eat you like guy liz taylor/kate hepburn movie , " suddenly last summer . " ( yeah , yeah , hipocrisy abounds here . but you put up lot sunshine . ) anyhow , that what this book joe like : hungarian muffins . sure , there occasional shard glass , but it makes your teeth sharper . makes me happy . i'm terrified go back out there business because i don't care how spiritual you fancy you , when you're finally busy you've living ramen noodles so long your kitten danger around thanksgiving time , holly got you her electrically-heated embrace --- oh my oh my oh my -- it so hard think straight . vonnegut once wrote something nature surviving often creepy because survivors usually questionable things order survive . true . history full prematurely dead people who right thing . how you balance keep your ear against wall hear click right combination ? i don't know , but i'm gonna sleep this book under my pillow so i benefit somebody else hindsight 20/20 all " if i knew then what i know now " cliches . writers gods . i still can't believe movies " " director . it silly . but that what one last writers ' strikes , yeah ? they blinked . then they caved . eszterhas doesn't cave . i don't even think he blink .... because screenwriters gods .... not gazelles disemboweled serengeti . same bravado , i've writing my own first novel into my own screenplay myself , am calling my production company " monster girl movies . " i need all whiskey memorable eszterhas lines my head i cram there . so , you what you want . i'm running out energy time so i'm joining eszterhas union . not blinking caving union . everyone needs " i am god !

string theory formidable subject learn , both physical mathematical standpoint . but it even harder subject teach audience non-experts , not because its ideas hard express verbally front this audience , but because its practitioners sometimes feel it beneath them so . those who not familiar string theory but curious its conceptual foundations might therefore left themselves pursue understanding these foundations . however such understanding obtained , there late few books written experts string theory targeted readership strong desire learn subject . author this book recognizes paucity expository material string theory , particularly dealing mathematical formalism , although this book polemic against string theory its status physical scientific theory , author introduces ( perhaps purpose ) reader theory way understandable without sacrificing scientific accuracy . but book could also interest more advanced readers , i.e. those ( such this reviewer ) who thorough understanding physics mathematics behind string theory but who not conducting research it . author demands rightfully scientific theory must testable or least must some amount empirical predictions . he pulls no punches his critique string theory , very open what he thinks motivations behind those who actively involved it . researcher motivations course not germane validity theory he or she proposes , but they relevant understanding why particular theory entrenched scientific community , even though there no experimental evidence it . this reviewer disagrees author his claim string theory not " beautiful " theory . it mathematical formalism used string theory gives it its beauty . indeed , just algebraic geometry alone employed string theory example this . combined differential geometry , complex manifolds , algebraic topology makes string theory beautiful multi-faceted mathematical gem . said , there many ideas string theory deserve classified " speculative " mathematics , author this book . this classification arises because presence ubiquitous path integral , object resisted rigorous mathematical formulation . so yes , mathematical formalism behind string theory beautiful , intoxicates those who contemplate it . but physical theory must more than just " mental masturbation " ( characterization imputed physicist murray gell-mann book ) . it must also make predictions measured laboratory , these measurements must reproducible above all understandable interested parties . author not find any these predictions string theory it exists present time , he correct his claims . those who worked academic setting understand fully negative reaction author received when manuscript circulated review , which he describes some detail book . this criticism course anonymous , following usual practice research community , such anonymity temptation recklessness vituperation , author gives examples this . so book not only describe some ideas string theory , it also goes into social interactions attitudes among string theorists . it would unfair say all string theorists arrogant protective their status academicians . but those meet this characterization position cannot morally justified . discovery scientific truth demands transparency not only because complications theory , but also because those who not directly participating it responsible it financing ( taxpayer ) . string theorists , all scientific mathematical researchers morally obligated report their discoveries those who not their field manner makes it crystal clear what they all . string theory should not collection documents protected interpreted small body privileged priests knowledge .	1
philosophy , international labor , high tech , economics , globalization , internet virtual universes all neatly wrapped together this book . it very successful telling mr. dibbell what going right now ... not just mmo world but many aspects society . it so fascinating me read . he not hype up metaverse phenomenon . but , he make it bit less complicated . you really get message what currently undergoing not trivial serious implications how we all live our lives . play versus work , lines getting more blurry . but , it might not necessarily bad thing . if " liar poker " must read financial markets , " play money " should definitely counterpart virtual economies .	1
i thoroughly disappointed this book . it seemed so much promise ! main character completely unlikable- she made me never want get married ! she epitome woman who willing settle simply married . she seems view her fianc decent catch , but not something she madly love . addition , i strongly disliked author writing style . i can't put my finger it , but it just felt rough forced , like nothing flowed smoothly . choppy i suppose . perhaps this appeals some , but i found it hard read . someone stated earlier review , i also can't stop reading middle book or i would stopped . it bad . read your own risk .	-1
this book excellent introduction " big " history modern-day afghanistan , providing overview empire building collapsing ( either afghans pushing outward or others pushing inwards ) , succeeding waves tribes armies moving through region , etc . anyone interested understanding afghanistan some historical depth it , this book one i would , consequently , recommend . where author falls flat , my opinion , when he begins pontificate how united states should pursued its intervention nation . this instance he betrays minimal level understanding ( " where light parts 1st infantry division ? " question he asks , apparently unaware current answer such don't exist , instance ) . book redeem itself bit looking future afghanistan , author proposing rather novel notion modelling afghan government switzerland . author makes decent case idea , even if it might sound bit odd .	-1

i very much looked forward receiving this book through mail , due tons praise which people expressed it . i am however very disappointed . i only read first few pages ( including first one which quotes multitude praise ) emphasis summary/chronology south african history . i am south african , i find it littered inaccuracies which should not present history book . it painfully obvious book written foreigner . examples : boer war becomes " war whites " . i would liked see rand revolt mentioned name . botha becomes prime minister . botha who ? pik ? pw ? newcomer sa history should not guess such things . 1981-1988 south african forces invade angola . uh .... no . sa started incursions into angola 1976 . since this history sa , i point out quick scan book reveals no more detail around these events , yet he takes cheap shot afrikaner government making it sound though they willy-nilly went into angola sake oppressing people . it seems author opted avoid explaining historical facts behind these very important events . what reader not know , fidel castro through this period time circulated 350 000 ( if i remember correctly ) cuban soldiers through angola infiltrate southern africa communism , through war sponsored soviet money state-of-the-art military equipment training . south africans responding this threat avoid spread communism into region ( it rumored cia condoned this until withdrawal vietnam ) . simultaneously civil wars other southern african countries tied this , well soviet military training anc members such thabo mbeki others . events surrounding incursions into angola tremendous complexities tied into it direct cause effect role interaction government , apartheid era crackdowns , african political organizations . author not discuss these influential details modern history book scandal . he chooses refer province we officially call kwazulu-natal , kwazulu . overall first few pages not bode well rest book , but i report back when i'm reading i t.t his report-back : after reading book i realized my initial harsh criticism borne expectation purchased detailed history book . after realizing it not , i eased my expectations somewhat despite errors . overall book readable but superficial summary south african history , anyone who wants claim they balanced understanding south africa history cannot so without read further than this source . book clearly written audience ( perhaps freshman university level ) who need first-order introduction sa history . this sense book fairly well written but omissions essential events several factual errors prompt me rate it 3.5 stars . i rate it 2 stars however , because this book marketed authoritative book sa history , praise desmond tutu title book misleadingly suggests . it nothing kind ( least i hope it not best there !!!!! ) . i think praise this book received outdated inappropriate today day age title should read " summary sa history " . since author seems update book time goes , adding chapters , he cannot excused not filling gaps , correcting errors previous chapters , adding details . book therefore seems propagate gaps recorded sa history instead aspiring become accurate detailed authoritative reference time goes . it pity . one more comment : least one reviewer advised take last chapter grain salt since it appears too pessimistic him . i couldn't disagree more ! last chapter - apart few opinionated ( would subtle foreigners)statements author terms seemingly continuing make africans underdogs caucasians antagonists - factual , accurate ( perhaps even understated ) recording dismal deterioration sa society incompetence government played out 94-2000 . continuing trend these events clearly seen everyday south african news up this day .	-1

i not think subtitle " complete guide most popular cisco firewall security features " goes level credit this book truly goes too . david hucaby not only write guide , he wrote book clearly sit my quick grab shelf right next my desk years come ( or until next version ) . introduction states " book meant used tool every day activities .

first time i became acquainted wally lamb , i read " she come undone " english lit course . like many other i adored book , but hesitant when i picked up " i know this much true " two reasons . first , it seems like nowadays truly incredible books hard find . so what chances finding two same writer ? secondly , sheer length book ( just under 1000 pages ) little intimidating first glance . given my previous experiences lengthy modern novels , i ready big let down once again . yet , i pleasantly surprised find one best books i've read , ever . wally lamb such great job when tackling seemingly controversial topics most writers wouldn't dream touching . worked kids suffering behavioral/mental disorders i impressed his potrayal not only effect schizophrenia individual , but also effect people surrounded individual . granted he adds your occasional plot twist add " story " ( twins , flashbacks , ex-wives ) he still manages hit nail head . both dominick thomas so well rounded you feel angst pain every treacherous turn battle both fight against thomas disease . novel evokes every human emotion possible end you may find yourself smiling ( or frowning ) through tears . i know i love book make this happen i recommend it anyone who looking something absolutely incredible . even better yet , despite length book i couldn't put it down . far it one easiest 900 page reads i've ever picked up . my only complaint , book come end .	1
arguably robert heinlein best work , starship troopers classic piece science fiction displaying earth future galactic war against sentinel race giant bugs set destroying humankind . story told through eyes juan rico , member mobile infantry . rico explains how he joined mi , some his adventures , how he rose through ranks . starship troopers actually more book philosophy military thought set against backdrop society which only people who vote those who served military ( makes one think term " citizen soldiers " completely different ) . far action story , starship troopers doesn't much offer . much book given dialogues explaining philosophy book promotes . also , many action scenes more concerned military strategy than describing action . however , i found most meaningful works sci fi those deal deep philosophical issues or social ills . starship troopers isn't everyone . however , it piece classic sci-fi worth reading if you don't mind not read lot action sequences	1

there irrestible desire compare this 800 plus page novel russia stalingrad leo tolstoy much longer novel russia napoleon moscow 1811 , some respects they alike . both superb . both express russian love homeland . both extol russian defeat invader . both bring russia past up close . but there dirrerences - substantial diffeences . tolstoy portrait painter words writing two generations after fact . grossman there time he damn good - photographer words . tolstoy romantic ; grossman unblinking realist there nothing " sweet " what he tells you , upside down orwellian morality stalinist state , where evil good , where good rewarded evil , where bad things happen again again good people no reason other than fact they somehow innocently run afoul some small deail machinery party . example there colonel pyotr novitov who exemplary officer commanding tank corps stalingrad encirclement . he through retreat across russia 1941 now , staffed again fine division , he move regain caucasus ; he love yvengenia shapsonikov who formerly married nikolay krymov commissarin red army . she given him every reason believe she loves him too come him field . but krymov , who served party faithfully without stint over years , set up , horribly beaten nkvd lubyanka pison moscow , forced confess politcal crime sentemced labor camp . yvengenia stands novikov up goes back krymov . then novikov suspended his command instance commissar his division ( politican named getmanov ) because he paused rest his men ten hours after advancing battle without pause everal days ( getmanov wanted division first into caucasus ) recalled moscow political punishment krymov type . i cite this example - one many similiar stories - typify tone this book - unremitting , steady black gloom . nothing good happens anybody - ever . sons killed , mothers sent gas chamber , families riven distance over whole deadful scene , hovering like deadly miasma death , stalinist state , cruel , dishonest , cynical fundamentally personification evil , just bad nazis - maybe worse because it purported represent common man . so should you read this book ? absolutely . while it would help understand how spelling russian names apparently changes gender while you ned chart characters better than one back book ( i finally made one my use ) while you really need some knowledge russian history post 1916 - revolution , collectivization , famine , purge 1937 etc . - you go it alone see how morally obscene communism really - particularly under stalin . you need . this angry book written without sunlight angry man writing death evil stalinist state cold gray dead winter 1943 stalingrad . tolstoy leaves you thinking mozrt , grossman writes dirge - but he good . very very good . read it compare	1

this fascinating , original take what lies ahead . rather than project single future , authors joel . barker scott . erickson examine existing trends group them into five regions technology . they explain each technology , extrapolate future it might create if it alone shaped world , then discuss how these different technological currents might intersect . barker erickson paint their five futures broad swaths . this allows them cover lot ground sketch many potential markets challenges , but it also means they cover their ground shallowly . five technologies they examine , they far more solidly grounded " super tech , " " limits tech " " nature tech " than " local tech " or " human tech . " they sometimes treat individual place them categories their fans might dispute . example , science fiction author isaac asimov long-time supporter population control limiting power machines , but he found here super tech rather than limits tech . these small nuances should not take away your enjoyment this book , which we recommend managers who want plan flexible , productive future , those who enjoy mental experiments challenges , since , times , it simply fun read	1

political memoirs usually disappointing . they're self-serving , self-aggrandizing ( i met blah , then i met blah2 , my wife loved his wife , blah blah blah ) , humorless pretentious . most all , they're boring . after all , constant name-dropping , self-justification glossing over any failures gets dull after , say , 20 pages . senator ( possible vice president ) john edwards ' book refreshing oasis among political memoir desert . one , it more focused than usual political memoir . sen. edwards before he senator already renowned fearsome trial lawyer . this book focuses mainly four trials sen. edwards won his 20-year career . john edwards likes consider himself warrior " little guy . " his first trial he highlights his book settlement he won alcoholic who given huge dose antabuse left completely debilitated neurotoxic drug . i couldn't help but admire edwards , who when he took this case rather inexperienced . many trial lawyers not take cases former alcoholics , they don't exactly make most sympathetic plaintiffs . but fact edwards refused settle fought this crippled alcoholic imo shows compassion . johh edwards this book comes across quite differently his television persona , which unfailingly sunny , even sweet . here he sounds fiercely determined . i thought if i corporate lawyer i wouldnt want mess edwards . particular he describes outsmarting " other side " courtroom -- he seems particularly fond letting unsympathetic witnesses dig their own graves . he describes personal tragedies ( like death his son wade ) there palpable anger towards irresponsible doctors companies . his book occasionally maudlin -- his descriptions his wife kids , example . book written mostly flat , inoffensive prose so prevalent these kinds memoirs . john edwards too young war hero ( la john mccain ) , but despite lack overt heroics i came away sense admiration john edwards , his fairness determination	1

this book certainly moments great insight . emerson passion quite clear often well-articulated . but this very lengthy book , many essays no longer much offer they perhaps once . there several invaluable , course , but many them simply become too obtuse arcane really relevant anymore . i read book all way through , but my recommendation would people purchase it simply reference , maybe read more famous essays now again . end , many essays disturbing undercurrents racism or anti-democratic sentiment emerson inability see nature dark force , it sometimes , sinks large portions book . we must bear mind emerson writing different time his comments now unacceptable not always way . clearly this book historically important , it obviously worthwhile one sitting shelf quote or occasionally reference , but it certainly not bulletproof guide living many made it out	-1
let freedom ring , sean hannity sends out subliminal message he his writing truth , justice , american way . just title represents everything true good him america . his five-star reviewers his message reinforces their pre-conceived beliefs hannity words validation those beliefs . if this written ghost writer , he should withheld payment . if it wasn't written ghostwriter , hannity should one his next attempt literary hyperbole . first chapter written maudlin , " those-were-the-good-old-days " wistfulness his immigrant grandfather who he describes honest man integrity , believer american dream . but before you say " erin go braugh " he talking courage george . bush standing up terrorism . exactly how g.w. , he doesn't elaborate . how he goes grandfather dubbya bit magic . hannity next trick impugn clinton gore soft terrorism . his source this , all people , dick morris who knew clintons now works fox republican advocacy network . he quotes morris who makes such vague statements " it seemed they afraid talking terrorism , " or " they seemed indifferent terrorism . " these " morris mind-reads " conjectural , but hannity uses them , which he impunity . let take closer look hannity unimpeachable source moment . it dick morris who quit clintons shortly after second election . it morris who penchant streetwalkers , some jail time , entered alcohol rehab . you'd think sh could find better source if he expects freedom ring ! but , hannity doesn't skip beat . he points out how democrats such senators kerry daschle voted against certain defense-spending bills . what he neglects inform his readers reasons they because riders attached bills , or number republicans who also voted against same bills , or many defense bills kerry daschle vote . he never once advises his reader defense spending programs killed dick cheney when he secretary defense . such deception called propaganda . propaganda something hannity no compunction using here . this he continuing tell tale long since debunked . namely , it story president clinton offered osama bin laden sudanese government . again , it what he doesn't say misdirects reader . sudan made offer hope economic sanctions against them slave-trading , lifted . however , fbi determined sudanese playing us because they neither ability nor intent handing over bin laden . sudanese also made offer saudi arabia , but saudis revoked bin laden citizenship , refused take him . benjamin franklin said " statistics liar . " hannity uses charts same purpose . he shows how under reagan , army bought over 500 tanks . under clinton , army bought none . this leads one assumption clinton nothing services . he doesn't mention army buys tanks , not presidents . he doesn't mention army all tanks they needed armored warfare against soviet union never came . he doesn't mention army began changing its warfare strategies which would include more transportable fighting vehicles . grateful hannity cannot rewrite famous works literature he attempts history . if he could , instead seeing dead captain ahab killed whale " moby dick , " we might just see grinning captain standing next tethered whale caption : " i caught fish this big ! " there something very fishy his facts , his historical parallels which aren't parallel , what he chooses tell you , what he chooses leave out . this book , he tells whale-sized whoppers !	-1

good dream interpreter offer multiple possibilities which you might pick . one make sense you surpass " reasonable " or " plausible " attain " feeling right . " similar sense , i enjoy franzen essays most when they elicit instant affirmation . those moments , you nod , say he hit upon something , notice what nifty way he found express what you should known before . surprisingly , he seldom achieves exalted state when he speaking personally , himself . he seems more effective when he triangulates his own views contributions other smart people . reading this collection essays , you occasionally detect prickliness makes him -- rightly or wrongly -- literary bad boy . his indignation veer into stridency . however , you also see sort warmth , me , corrections sometimes lacked . franzen suggests his essay " why bother ?, " i read confirmation life complicated . its best , how alone so way suggests not just solidarity franzen -- those he quotes -- but what franzen observes	-1

i over 30 years experience strategic thinking consultant planner . i constantly find people totally different concepts what strategy all . each tends either too focused one area , or incomplete some aspects . result , people logically arrive some pretty bad strategic conclusions . typically , this involves strategy organization cannot execute well or which competitors quickly negate . what i like this simple book it nicely summarizes case balanced perspective customer , competitor your own company . although most american companies believe they this , american approach much more superficial incomplete than japanese one . example , if japanese company wants add new product , evaluation looks heavily how well customer able use product how effectively company able provide it context probable competitive offerings . american analysis feature financial analysis forecast often based little more than spreadsheet doodling . weakness japanese model they typically look too little business environment ( notice how often they buy american businesses properties top market inflated prices ) , relatively insensitive financial implications . fast moving technology markets , japanese consensus-building process also tends slow down time market . clearly , there no perfect model strategic thinking fits all situations . major weakness many efforts assume future precisely forecast . patently wrong . typically , relative importance elements considered needs adjusted fit circumstnace . seems art rather than science this point . although this book its limitations ( suggested above ) , it valuable perspective strategy thinking helpful most american business people if they think concepts more thorough way . balance perspective here , i suggest you also read profit patterns get sense how circumstances play role profitability . good thinking ! may this book help you overcome any stalled thinking you not doing your home work thinking outperforming competitors provide benefits matter lot customers .	1

i just wanted add my own $0.02 already great reviews this book gotten . if you're like me , you'll hard time learning other methods primarily use sound/sight recognition memorization ( like rosetta stone ) . this book , however , takes very common sense ( logical , my opinion ) approach learning russian . example , it not show you verb conjugation just expect you memorize it ( like most russian books/materials seem ) - its approach , instead , first show you how conjugate variety verbs . armed this knowledge , you then step into useful examples . others recommended here , i also recommend finding course or tutor attend addition learning this book . i took cheap ($100 ) non-credit class semester local university ... it wonders - minimum - native speaker communicate . book great job sounding out difficult pronounciations , but it only go so far while native speaker could correct you spot minimal effort . sure , this book available online here $12 , but don't underestimate value learning language interactive environment ( don't even begin think such minimal investment all you need )	1

mcknight concerns communities ' dependency professional assistance legitimate , but disturbingly overstated this book . end i felt mcknight trashing already well-trodden government provision social services may not altogether helpful distressed communities . he sidesteps concerns capital mobility exploitation pernicious effects wrought years discrimination . any debate over when where how social programs effective cast aside well , since mcknight picture , social programs professional service providers , fact , vilains culprits most what ails society . one damaging fallacies seems perpetuated this book service professionals not able both professional caring - two deemed mutually incompatible . mcknights views resonate employers ' caring rhetoric - conveniently invoked every time healthcare worker tries claim she care patients but still entitled living wage or , perhaps , health insurance . what further implied communities readily ably take up reign providing themselves their members when denied more institutionalized professional services . it seems implied communities no problems before social programs solve them came into . this , i think i see mcknight invokeing idealized notion society earlier time ; maybe his argument would seemed more reasoble time when families less geographically mobile may constituted economic unit , when elderly lived shorter lives less numerous themselves more children care them , local economic activities more functionally interdependent . but mcknight model today cure doesn't seem fit today conditions . other hand , mcknights solutions may only ones available society where budget cuts elimination social services seem prevailing trend .	-1

before i even opened book start reading it , i already coming it filled particular expectations . i actually think we often/always approach books , among other things , this manner . this case , though , i fortunate enough aware what those expectations beginning . particular , given valerio past associations this bridge called my back this bridge we call home , i looking forward race feminism figured more centrally testosterone files than other ftm texts ( memoir otherwise ) . while no means i exhausted entire genre , i'd say my readings thus far , i've hard-pressed find ftm text leaves me feeling satisfied its treatment race . so , admittedly , testosterone files lot live up ... perhaps too much . frankly , i'm torn ... i'm definitely glad read book , well own it . i proudly display it my bookshelf ( where self space high premium ) . trans text , i think its focus testosterone ( opposed surgery ) helps stretch boundaries genre , how we think trans itself . like other ftm texts , there much focus body its physical transformations , but because emphasis isn't surgery it offers something those readers who either want transition without surgery , or simply transition live without surgery due other constraints ( e.g. , affordability , or lack thereof ) . even though valerio makes clear text he experienced discomfort his breasts , it because lack able afford top surgery he hadn't surgery ( well , until he wrote this book ! ) , need surgery becomes undertone text -- ever present but not overwhelmingly so . instead , what dominates talk testosterone . " hormones really work . " it realization valerio seems taken aback . he writes , " hormones ... i'd read testosterone its dramatic effects his [ lou sullivan ] booklet , but i never my wildest dreams imagined it could this good . this transformation miracle " ( 103 ) . like other similar texts , valerio describes changes his physical body undergoes he begins inject testosterone -- disappearance his extra fat , coarsening texture his hair , changes his skin . interestingly , valerio also describes changes his bodily emotions undergo effects testosterone . i say bodily emotions here because valerio makes clear it not just emotions disconnected his body , but precisely way which his body , because its changing chemistry , processes emotions differently than it once , ultimately resulting different physical manifestations those emotions . specifically , he finds testosterone limited his ability physically cry he once , instead increased his aggressiveness . when i first encountered these testimonials his how women biologically predisposed cry men fight , something me tightened . my initial reaction get defensive wonder how text i thought would so feminist could so blatantly reinforce traditional gender stereotypes . then i remembered there grains truth most stereotypes , what important not overcompensate trying make argument not all women cry drop hat , or men cry , but rather respect honor valerio experiences . this way , testosterone files , invaluable me challenging my understanding myself feminist , gently helping me grow further into kind feminism inspired me beginning -- one not only prized difference , but saw our power coming those very differences ( thanks audre lorde ! ) . i said earlier , however , despite ways which testosterone files added my knowledge understanding man transformation , i disappointed race wasn't more central issue throughout text . there moments when valerio writes his native heritage , his mother reserve , passing white some times , latino others , but these but moments , conversations race don't seem sustained throughout . end , i feel like book valerio wanted write testosterone above all else . respects , he succeeded . book i wanted valerio written negotiating racial feminist consciousness politics context ftm transition . i recognize my disappointments testosterone files not valerio failings , but rather signs my own longings .	-1

dr. thomas sowell book , " conflict visions " attempt explore primary , if unarticulated , philosophy historical conservatism liberalism . his thesis conservatism tradition operating vision humans sees them ' constrained . ' some characteristics this view :( 1 ) humans generally selfish natures . ( 2 ) human reason , while valuable , quite limited . ( 3 ) because this , society grows evolution , not central deliberate planning . ( 4 ) social decisions generally involve not ' solutions ' but ' trade-offs ' ( how much good how much downside ? )(5 ) procedural fairness , rather than results-based fairness , key just society . conversely , sowell writes liberal tradition operates vision humankind ' unconstrained . ' features include : ( 1)human selfishness quality overcome reason education . ( 2 ) human reason , when used properly , trump human impulses , emotions , feelings . ( 3)the planned society best . non-planned societies = chaos . ( 4 ) while policy trade-offs might good short term solution , reason discover true solutions equitable all . ( 5)procedural fairness not fair so long disperate outcomes result . sowell backs up his thesis impressive research , citations , quotes . this refreshing becuase it makes sure he not simply creating strawmen . conservative side , his quites tend come edmunde burke , adam smith , freidrich hayek , oliver wendell holmes . liberal side , his quotes tend come william godwin , marquis de condorcet , jean jacques rousseau , ronald dworkin . ( one who read all these authors , i assure readers there no strawmen here . ) only murky part book sowell makes this vision sound too simplistic . while he acknowledges not all thinkers fall into either one or other category ( even chapter marx mill - two thinkers borrow both sides ) , some his choices people quotes exempify each ' side ' less clean-cut than one might like . libertarian , it strange me see edmunde burke ( who valued tradition more than most anything ) friedrich hayek ( who valued innovation capitalism more than anything ) same group . ( holmes not necessarily best jurist exemplify ' strict construction ' contitution ) . [ it would interesting see , then , appendix ideological divorce libertarianism conservatism . ] other ' side , ' i kept thinking , although william godwin might good example someone who believed reason virtually omnipotent , he also liability sowell case , godwin not believe planned society whatever fact , anarchist who against planning any form ! while examples aren't perfect , sowell didn't intend them . all all , it good book i think sowell argument good one , most part , true . some other books similar vain - exploring ideological divide sides - try george lakoff " moral politics " e.j. dionne " why americans hate politics .

davidson trying solve age-old problem " unity proposition " . proposition socrates hits plato different heap socrates , relation hitting , plato . this corresponds semantic fact " socrates hits plato " sentence , whereas " socrates , relation hitting , plato " not . frege ineffectively tried solve this saying verb ( " socrates hits plato " ) denotes something which " unsaturated " , i.e. holes it , thereby enabling thing link up , proposition-forming way , items flanking it . frege theory radically confused , davidson noted many times . ( one thing , it absurd result thing corresponding verb " hits " hole it , whereas thing corresonding noun " relation hitting " not . but how this , given both expressions presumably pick out same relation ? frege gave absurd answer we cannot speak properties way we speak individuals -- this embodied frege dictum " property horse not property " . ) rightly rejecting frege view , davidson produces one his own , which -- like much his previous work -- involves dubious reliance tarski work relating definability truth-predicates formal languages . throughout his career , davidson often tried turn tarski technical points logic deep semantic metaphysical account . davidson also seems found support tarski work some extremely strange , i believe , false doctrines . tarski disquotationalism -- " snow white " true iff snow white -- apparently inspired davidson think ( ) there no propositions ( sentences enough ) , ( ) there no facts , ( ) predicate " true " corresponding property innocuous somehow vacant ( this supposedly evidenced apparent equivalence " snow white " " it true snow white " ) ( ) there no difference meanings truth-conditions ( tarski talks truth-conditions , not meanings ) . none these doctrines any real support tarski work ; davidson attempt give them support - particular , his use spurious " slingshot " argument prove there no facts , consequently , sentences not made true anything -- involved rather glaring fallacies . davidson views truth based complete failure see past phonetic surface structure indicative sentences . purely orthographic point view , " snow white " less complex than corresponding nominal : " snow white " . but semantically story very different . both encode proposition snow white . but " snow white " something additional : it manages ascribe truth proposition . ( how this delicate matter . ) once semantic anatomy " snow white " laid bare , it becomes impossible sustain idea truth-predicate innocuous or concomitant idea nothing makes sentence true . davidson views these matters projections folk-syntax , source annoyance anyone who ( unlike davidson ) gives any credence work chomsky other depth-grammarians . identity predication , unique blend obscurity , indirectness , flabby logic vitiated much davidson earlier work full bloom . further , he doesn't really add anything wasn't already found his earlier papers . philosopher , davidson some fine moments . his work scepticism original ( though unsuccessful ) . some aspects his work semantics -- especially his excavation logical form action sentences his scathing criticisms ( " theories learnable languages " ) frege bizarre views indirect discourse -- philosophical classics . but this work , davidson not his best , this exposes certain lack focus pervaded his career . scale 1 10 , i give it 2	-1

firstly , yes , if you're bound determined ride republican train into ground , or if you're afraid potty words , don't read this book . it could say stuff you don't like . most folks i know real tired sort holier-than-thou posturing . other hand , i felt like i reading book one my friends written . narcissism gets little grating , but that what we're like . that nature 30s 40s crowd . swearing ... well , again , i don't know too many people who don't talk way . but general sense loss purpose , grandiose plans gone hell , plain old existential angst far too familiar . one day we all realize if you look like marketing guy , work marketing guy , aren't actively writing , painting , acting , inventing , crafting , whatever -- guess what ? you're marketing guy . more practical level , it one those books , julie herself describes , demonstrates all possibilities out there see world larger than one you'd settled into . it kind book makes you think ' huh , wonder what i could dive into ?

like many groundbreaking works , this one must seen important when it written what it said then , important now what it led . inspired , without doubt , monumental drucker study ibm , it took case analysis step further . its seminal ideas found many contemporary studies schools or management thinking which taken these principles yet further . doesn't mean it should no longer read . but , after reading it , get most reading it , other contemporary works should included your reading list . example , jim collins ' " built last " " good great " , john roberts ' " modern firm " take peters watermans ' original insights many steps further .

what more said which already hasn't this extraordinary book written extraordinary man courage ? 900+ reviews , i not make this overly elaborate review , book simply not require it . elie wiesel story one one man courage , fortitude push when all around him lost ; friends , family , belongings , even basic human dignity . what struck me more than anything else his personal story retelling hanging three men ( well , two men one boy ) while he one concentration camps . millions perished , but way boy who suffered during hanging stayed me . his story story millions who perished who never got tell their tale , one few books i would call must read . different instances book i am quite sure strike readers differently . one things which struck me stayed me how he kept looking god , even amidst enormity man sometimes carry out his fellow man . what also struck me woman train who saw flames camps even before they arrived . times he scolded questioned himself his ethics even thinking selfish thoughts even though he dying . i still think would i ( could i ? ) same if i his terrible position ? this book shows worst mankind , sadly this terrible event known holocaust not entirely unique man history since freeing elie wiesel . we witnessed rwanda firsthand 1990 , told world authorities " this never happen again . " yet modern day sudan(and north korea , tibet ..... ) , we see much same ..... world turning its back millions people . there may not furnaces involved , but crime complicity through inaction little different than world which allowed human beings fed into furnaces . i guess final question i come away asking his book " mankind ever learn ?

i loved anthony swofford gulf war memoir , jarhead , but no disrespect its author or kirkus reviews which calls it " israeli jarhead " , company offers far richer reading experience . american-born watzman served almost 20 years israeli military , starting regular army 1982 , moving reserves ' 84 . this period covers broad swath modern israeli history , watzman brilliantly demnstrates how he able ( overcoming personal conflicts ) mix his political views -- anti-settlements -- his soldierly duties , which often required defending settlers unapologetically executing missions which he opposed principle . his company contained people across full spectrum israeli politics ( die-hard expansionists socialistic peaceniks religious zealots ) . watzman showed exceptional dedication doggedly reporting duty year after year into middle age , leaving his work wife 4 kids every year report front-line duty , when so many his peers easily managing escape reservist service . even after illness left him permanently disabled almost crippled he'd passed his 40th birthday ( ancient footsoldier ) , watzman insisted doing battle his adopted country . he true hero patriot wonderfully entertaining writer .	1

we know some things saul tarsus ( later named apostle paul ) but complete biography always lacking because sketchy incomplete information . most everything we know paul dr. luke book acts or paul epistles themselves . ii peter chapter 3 makes some very intriguing statements . peter , some his last earthly words before martyrdom , validates paul apostleship states some his writings teachings difficult but we should follow them . pollock book presented documentary-style reading since paul complete biography not entirely clear . there much author states inference or speculation . if you respect not build doctrine facts where evidence fuzzy , i think this excellent book . one example " fuzzy " facts pollock considers age-old controversy over authorship book hebrews . author hebrews not identify himself scholars argue who wrote it . pollock speculates paul , while imprisioned acts ch . 24 two years may time motivation write book people he so desparately wanted reach . his imprisonment his controversial style among jews , he may left his identity anonymous so he himself would not stumbling block reach his jewish brothers . eternity reveal who wrote book hebrews but it certainly plausible theory . overall , greatest benefit reading this book provide better framework understanding paul he travels among early churches wrote letters them correcting various false teachings problems developed .	1

this deeply flawed book . it purports description characteristics attitudes make wealthy people wealthy , but it based mostly their self-assessments without comparison control group . i suspect this heavily underplays role random chance success , attributes causation where there only correlation . further , author displays clear biases number topics , which leads him engage ad hoc interpretation his data , sometimes argue conclusions contrary clear implications data -- such his arguments importance religion lives millionaires . pp . 33-35 , author looks success factors , compares role luck pp . 82-85 , which he downplays favor discipline . while he touches importance right connections ( genetic contributions intelligence ) , . 85 he asks " what luck graduating medical school ? what luck successfully running medical practice ? very little , according these physicians . " but what luck born into family country where one chance reach adulthood , let alone able attend medical school ? quite bit . unlike its predecessor , which looked prodigious accumulators wealth ( paws ) vs . under-accumulators wealth ( uaws ) , this book focuses millionaires ( paws ) decamillionaires ( tiny subset paws , those net worth $10m or greater ) . lack comparison general public serves limit book value . misleading comparison businessmen stockbrokers pp . 76ff makes point . stanley states former occupation more likely higher net worth . but this comparison misleading because he only looking millionaire-plus sample ; he excluding more total business owner population his sample than stockbrokers . average median income net worth business owners likely lower than stockbrokers . if he made same comparison actors or musicians stockbrokers , example , problem more obvious -- excluding all those who aren't worth $1m or more up front , you exclude vast majority , pull up average . stockbrokers , other hand , higher percentage them top income earners wealthy . . 110 , after pages importance ethics advising " never lie . never tell one lie . " ( . 55 ) , he passes right over his example , mr. warren , lying college graduate order get job , without comment , without noticing hypocrisy . pp . 173-174 , author wants make point prayer important millionaires dealing stress , despite fact majority his surveyed population not regularly pray . ( he repeats this again . 370 , saying " nearly one-half millionaires ( 47 percent ) engaged prayer . ... significant percentage millionaires , their religious faith major force their lives . " ) trying emphasize point ( . 174 ) , he splits his sample into " religious millionaires " ( rm ) " other millionaires " ( om ) , observes 75% rm engage prayer while only 8% om , points out this " ratio more than nine one . " this meaningless comparison , however -- rm make up only 37% his total population millionaires , so his " more than nine one " ratio really nothing more than saying , those millionaires who religious , three-fourths hold religious practices which involve regular prayer ( 8% those who not consider themselves religious pray anyway ) . since om population much larger than rm population , absolute numbers that not nine-t o-o ne ratio -- his numbers show 28% his total sample rm who pray , while 5% his total sample om who pray -- closer six-t o-o ne ratio . but more importantly , author glosses over fact not only majority millionaires not religious , even quarter those who don't engage regular prayer ! given u.s. one most religious countries world , fact such low percentage millionaires religious quite interesting worthy further exploration cause , but stanley , religion prayer important foundation " millionaire mind , " he completely misses opportunity find explanation why millionaires so much less religious than general population . later table book . 366 , he shows activities engaged sample 733 millionaires during preceding 30 days . table includes 52% attending religious services , 47% praying , 37% attending religious events , 22% bible/devotional reading . these numbers don't quite match up rm/om data pp . 173-174 , which seem show even lower levels religious activity , but these still lower than they nonmillionaire population -- weekly church attendance notoriously over-reported surveys . work mark chaves , . kirk hardaway , p.l. marler 1990s found actual percentage attendance half what surveys show . this actually could mean millionaires attend more often , if stanley survey results don't similar over-reporting . author religious bias further leads him recommend student going through divorce she , despite not church attendee , search mate joining church group ( . 268 ) because she " believed marriage traditional family concept . " he writes " i believe one likely find better prospects church setting than singles bars . course , there no guarantees , but people religious orientation more prone respect principles espoused good book . " but why he just guessing this ? hasn't he asked his population millionaires -- ones who 63% non-religious -- how they met their mates ? he this , very usefully , regarding how millionaires purchase their homes ( pp . 315-326) -- yet isn't picking partner even more important ? this book some interesting data , its best when giving comparative results populations ( e.g. , house-purchasing characteristics economically productive millionaires vs . non-economically productive millionaires chapter 7 ) . but it doesn't stand up well comparison millionaire next door , which much better book	-1

i loved earlier nevada barr mysteries , their depiction national parks natural dangers . i wasn't happy some her latest efforts , but still hadn't given up her . now i'm not so sure . this latest novel started off well enough although idea two severely traumatized girls should clue what would follow . idea they polygamous mormon sect red herring . perhaps it barr attempt show us how these girls abused even before they met evil incarnate . scenes where anna realizes who real villian her interaction him poor tortured third traumatized girl went over 60 pages . each scene more disturbing one before it . i found myself skimming pages still am not sure how she resolved all loose ends . but i absolutely no desire re-read end book find out . i wish i could say i would read nevada barr novel because i so thoroughly enjoyed first ones . but after reading this disturbing , somewhat convoluted story , i would think twice . if i pick up anna pigeon novel , i'd make sure i something else read if story took dark turn . i would certainly not stick it end .	-1

i wary buying tarot book online , though i finally make decision buy this book based reviews here compared reviews other tarot books . i've rather impressed this book . author chose , wisely , use gold-standard tarot , rider-waite deck her demonstrations detailed study tarot symbolism . rider-waite widely available both original well other variations ( i personally love universal waite deck ... same deck prettier colors ) . i've waited some time review , but decided now would good time any since i see this book i working through some time . i've given it once-through , using it reference since i bought it . this book emphasises learning study ( which takes years ) over quick-fix guides tarot which suggest one could effectively read tarot only minutes . it long process , one i've working over decade casually , one which i continue work years come , aided this very good reference . seventy-eight degrees wisdom also presents use tarot without excess new-age trappings , focusing cards their symbols themselves , not extraneous things , particular religious views , or other things which i've read scanning other tarot books . i think this book excellent intermediate students tarot , gives wonderful sense complexities tarot , while keeping it basics , focusing foundations learning rather than host many spreads use . may your journey learning fruitful .	1
i don't usually read christian fiction . not because i'm atheist or agnostic or any other " " word would make my southern baptist parents turn over their graves , but because i like my fiction quite bit more true-to-life than usually allowed unrealistic restrictions most christian publishers place upon their authors . so i thrilled find joe box -- john robinson rough-edged detective until last dog dies -- real ... well , joe himself might say , real slap upside head your mama when you're not paying attention . joe multi-dimensional character who takes you him just deftly when he revisits 30-year-old memories vietnam when you follow him breathlessly through investigation into who killing all his former platoon buddies . all joe lingering hard-nosed habits , ever-present steadily growing inner peace unmistakable contentment come joe still-new relationship god allows him face madman who wants destroy all joe loves . imperfect christians much better examples non-believers than any holier-than-thou pontificator nary flaw , bad habit , or tarnished spot his halo . joe box real christian who learning live his faith -- warts all . readers all kinds both like him identify him , i can't wait join him his next adventure	1

first farseer book impressed me its great writing interesting characters . second book , though not great , still solid sequel . this third farseer book mess ( see kaymin comments ) . 757 page book ( paperback version ) should edited fewer than 500 pages . few ill-considered , disjointed plot lines also should encountered delete key . what could not repaired some idiotic key elements such fact no one remembered ancient race who helped citizens buck actually dragons exist stone statues until imbued memories , souls , lives multiple humans . what heck ? somehow , protagonist , fitzchivalry , continues make same stupid mistakes he teenager still manages survive . main characters , only his wit-bonded wolf made reliably sensible decisions . given flaws described above , i am astonished many five star reviews this book . i believe fans first two books overly generous this one	-1

what would you if you could drink elixir removes all guilt your mind few hours allows you partake things you normally would never dream ? robert louis stevenson gives us glimpse what could happen " dr. jekyll mr. hyde . " it wonderful classic originally published 1886 . it , well-worn battle good evil played out not forms hero villain , but inside mind soul one man who toys idea acting out his most carnal ( least that what reader assumes ) longings . this isn't your cookie-cutter hollywood version " jekyll hyde . " it much deeper study human soul it longing bit " naughty " suffer none consequences . time again , jekyll drinks his " liquid courage " unleashes evil lies within . days , weeks months pass , jekyll finds it harder control beast within , his unholy friend makes more longer appearances . eventually , mr. hyde goes too far one his escapades , it drives jekyll brink sanity . way , we introduced characters such utterson his friend enfield . we also meet poole , dr. lanyon , brief appearance , maid servant who witnesses actions against one mr. carew . although jekyll hyde title characters , most book focus placed utterson . jekyll gets one chapter ( final one ) which give his account what happens him he undergoes his changes . most films plays based this book portray doctor good , wholesome man . however , while reading this book , i found he perhaps more evil than hyde . he capable controlling his desires . hyde not . instead prohibiting himself taking more elixir , jekyll openly enjoys it . he begins lose more more control his situation , he attempts correct his own wrongdoing . when this occurs , we find one thing hyde fears . this particular edition " jekyll hyde " features rather humdrum introductory essay vladimir nabokov . my opinion , he goes depths stevenson probably never meant uncovered his morality tale . skip introduction if you unfamiliar story . it nothing more than spoil your read . i recommend afterword dan chaon . it much more interesting , less depth look this brief , wonderful story . i highly recommend tale . it gets five stars , but introductory essay drags story down makes it almost boring . therefore , i give this version " dr. jekyll mr. hyde " four stars	-1

i always thought boundaries way keeping others safe distance out my personal business . instead , after reading this book , i learned boundaries also way connect others , allow greater closeness intimacy people our lives . order this , we need cultivate something author calls " boundary intelligence , " which intentional management three aspects boundaries : their permeability , flexibility , complexity . four elements boundary intelligence : awareness , insight , intention action . it makes sense -- if someone stepping all over us , or if we trespassing their boundaries , we need first all aware transgression , then insight realize we need adjust our boundary permeability . then we form intention change formulate plan action address boundary transgression . all us different boundary styles , interesting quiz chapter 3 helps us understand our inner boundaries ; those we others our lives ; how their complexity , flexibility , permeability all impact our dealings others . i found this very interesting helpful . book several other quizzes , but they lacked enough explanation me make real sense them . throughout book , numerous anecdotes examples tell boundaries trampled ignored , all which further illustrated necessity understanding learning how successfully negotiate boundaries people our lives . one area dealt something author termed " emotional trespass . " this when " we may not know exactly where our boundaries , but we know when they've violated . " i think innumerable examples this my own life , but i never way describe it before . armchair interviews says : boundary intelligence help you navigate your way through all relationships your life .	-1

" tone -- usually it " shucks , it seemed like great idea time " grin instead . that really what makes book -- lighthearted , if not always lightweight , look her travels through music biz . trynin knack description , giving you just enough place you right there setting without overdoing it or stalling narrative . her recounting particularly awful radio interview highlight book , just flat-out funny ; conversely , section describing life home during respite touring , noting how difficult it her reconnect people her life , particularly enlightening thought-provoking . my only suggestion potential reader , then , if you've never heard her music before , finish book before you go hunting her cds . i picked one up ( " cockamamie , " main one written book ) , it bloody agony listen . i wouldn't enjoyed book nearly much i heard her music beforehand ; i mean , it almost wretched pixies , but i digress . so , sum up : fun book , so-so musician , i hope she book ( but no more songs ) her . like many reviewers here , i also read " so you want rock roll star , " while i agree it more dramatic tale , i'd say they're both rather well written would easily recommend either one	-1

lo que en el lejano 1997 comenz� siendo un entretenimiento , un osado intento de que los ni�os adolescentes espa�oles se aficionaran la lectura conocieran un poco de esa historia que hab�a desaparecido de los libros de texto , se ha convertido , al cabo del tiempo , en la mejor serie de novela hist�rica en castellano desde los episodios nacionales de galdos , en el plano internacional , el mas vivido �pico retrato de una �poca desde la trilog�a de los mosqueteros de alexandre dumas . igual que , despu�s de dumas , ya no fuimos capaces de ver al cardenal richelieu sino como al maquiav�lico villano en la sombra , tras p�rez reverte al gran quevedo no lo podremos imaginar sin la espada desenvainada el " no queda sino batirse " . en eso consiste el genio de la novela hist�rica : en ser veraz , ser puntilloso en descripciones lenguaje adem�s dar vida esos datos fr�os que llenan las biograf�as en las enciclopedias . dar vida los personajes hist�ricos no consiste en coger un fara�n , un emperador romano o lo que sea ponerlo descifrar enigmas polic�acos . consiste en tomar personajes reales , con sus virtudes defectos , hacerlos actuar seg�n las propias reglas de su tiempo su car�cter . el gran arturo , tras mostrarnos en las otras novelas de la saga las mazmorras de la inquisici�n , las trincheras de flandes el puerto de sevilla , nos lleva esta vez al teatro . teatro con may�sculas porque nunca antes desde luego nunca despu�s , conocer�a la historia tal concentraci�n de genios dedicados escribir para un publico que convert�a cada estreno en un acontecimiento social . ah� estaba el capit�n alatriste , code�ndose con los poetas , encam�ndose con las actrices como no , salvando el pescuezo al mism�simo rey de las espa�as . vuelven el cruel villano malatesta angelica de alquezar , ese bollicao mezcla de lolita femme fatale . como no , all� esta tambi�n i�igo de balboa para contarnos como ocurri� todo . finalmente , como es habitual en perez reverte no faltan los " cameos " de algunos personajes actuales que el lector espa�ol ( no as� los ajenos la realidad espa�ola ) no tardara en reconocer . en cuanto al titulo , aquellos que no sigan la trayectoria de p-r posiblemente no adviertan el gui�o sentimental que esconde . " el caballero del jub�n amarillo " es , seg�n dice p-r en el prologo de su primera novela " el husar " , el titulo de un follet�n que el propio padre de arturo perez reverte escribi� hace tiempo , cuando el folletin era ya un genero muerto muchos cre�an que enterrado . posiblemente el padre de p-r nunca imagino que su propio hijo desenterrar�a el genero lo elevar�a cumbres no antes holladas . en resumen : un nuevo acierto del mejor escritor espa�ol vivo .	1

this book ecumenical sermon global implications hyper-consumerism . it contains little information specific ways reduce consumption , leaving it open readers discover techniques work them . instead , it focuses ethical philosophy consuming only what you need . but foundations this philosophy firm ? author seems use guilt motivating factor getting westerners cut their consumption . he repeatedly states individuals west should reduce their consumption habits , suggesting implicitly high consumption west depriving developing world money or other resources . paradoxically , reducing consumption west would deny wages third world workers who produce consumer products western markets . so reducing western consumption means make world better place implies very simplistic view economics . besides , western hyper-consumerism pales face displayed affluent easterners or south asians . more defensible reason reducing consumption would because it simply makes you feel better personal level . also , it beneficial family budgets when money isn't spent before it earned . leads healthier family relationships . book focused its arguments such issues would far more convincing than this one .	-1

good part this book deals experiments conducted old school hypnosis . remember nancy school dr. liebeault your studies history hypnosis ? well , ormond mcgill brought them back life , so you'll get little bit more insight interesting experiments they used while hypnosis still used techniques mesmerism . i'm really glad all effort mcgill invested bringing back some valuable information enrich " modern " hypnotists - bringing life energy world hypnosis , because some intellectually oriented minds completely dropped energy out equasion due their own lack understanding . now , awareness using one mind work energy happily emerging west one may even thank proliferation eastern techniques methods ( india china - mainly area healing - sure , you've heard " chi kung " ) . west , these techings mainly wrapped mysteries reserved only those who inclination esoteric studies different occult practices . there two other books i recommend supplementary reading workbooks together this one - they ormond mcgill " hypnotism mysticism india " franz bardon " initiation into hermetics " . they help you better develop skills use techniques this book . after describing different experiments performed century or two ago ( matter , you find many other more modern books numerous other mind-over-matter experiments ) , ormond guides you through some practical techniques so you conduct your own experiments these techniques . book directed those who interest using them stage shows perspective , stage mentalists who only learn how use " tricks " make audience believe they something they not doing , benefit learning how able genuine mentalism instead faking using art deception . this account there some authors who entirely focused area deception because all they know all they aware , they live convinced everything comes even close it must some kind deception . but where here smoke , you rest assured there fire , too . even though they ignorant fire way how produce real effects , it doesn't mean real thing cannot . respect , i recommend this book all those " stage mentalists " who so far acquainted themselves only techniques producing different mind effects through trickery . they may surprise themselves what they able accomplish . this book also benefit regular hypnotherapist who no intention get involved any stage performance . they learn how add more power their hypnotic techniques , using power their minds , working energy direct thought transference , instead just using words . they may also become aware fact their own beliefs expectations , even though unvoiced affect outcomes they get their clients because there always silent communication going mental level it goes beyond subtle cues body language ( minimal cues , they called nlp ) . book called mindreading , but techniques covered also used what we call " remote hypnosis " or " remote influence " . it doesn't matter whether person sitting next you , or room , or even country - when you work mind energy . distinction made book contact non-contact mind-reading . contact mind-reading also used dr. milton erickson . here practice some essential nlp skills may helpful order good this , you'll aware subtle ( minimal cues ) given off person . it somewhat like " lie detector " , except instead machine , you using your own observational ( calibration ) skills notice subtle physiological differences person - this case through touch . non-contact mind-reading involves clearing your mind receiving mental impressions - something alike doing remote viewing , though there remote viewing techniques may go little bit further than this . those interested incorporating mindreading techniques this book their stage show , ormond mcgill provides several different routines spice up show .	1

this very important book , seeing it gives us access lives ideas normal americans , how racial dimension affects them . book includes 17 interviews various persons , including families couples . author edited himself out it , so it more like 17 monographs than 17 interviews . although not much new under sun me , book should read every fully european descended person america , show them they not alone their thoughts . recent poll i read time magazine ( all things ) , showed 70 % european americans found it important keep their race alive , so fact there no major racial awareness two big parties us , should point fact something not right american politics . there should large basis identity politics even among european americans , i'm confident such party become large quite soon . people book various experiences , vary their age sex . author very objective unbiased , which rare books this touchy subject . people interviewed sometimes bit gloomy outlook , but seeing world europeans today , who blame them . i highly recommend book both already " converted " , those think racialists insane . both something gain reading this very interesting book	-1

if schizophrnic person killed someone blamed it angelic voices , would we then take position also blame angels , or would we just realize it person who crazy ? similarly , just because crazy people say islam(or christian inquisitions , or communism , or building colonial america ) their motivation violence , why look islam(or others ) when we should looking their craziness( i.e. unstated ulterior motivations ) instead ? so many large groups people tend oppress , kill , or enslave either other populations or those within their own borders . why believe their stated reasons it , rather than look more common thread : human population dynamics . sorry , he just who , instead sociologically looking violent tendencies almost all large groups people general throughout history across cultures , he simply wants attack islam . he may right what he says islam , unfortunately it doesn't really matter because it really just " red herring , " where he blames surface rather than cause : humans . religion so often abused " reason " crime , but haven't we realized we shouldn't believe what crazy people name their religion their religion ?	-1
called ' war peace ' version financial planners , i found this book surprisingly readable , its conclusions ( while obviously controversial ) least thought-provoking . there four large concepts beginning : increasing liquidity , safety , rate return , tax deductibility , considering ' big picture ' financial planning . it eye-opener read through his analysis how quickly taxes eat up any tax-deferred gain 401(k ) or ira , well how few options there saving both tax-deferred tax-free withdrawals . roth ira great but so limited , thus when you get main section book ( investing equity indexed universal life insurance contracts ) author delves into great detail how they work how they benefit you . many articles newspapers not look eiuls , they comparing book approach other universal life products ( such fixed-interest product - which reviewer below apparently , or variable universal life product , which isn't same , or whole-life product ) . i also found 7.5% return bit high , but after looking eiul more closely ( reading up sp500 returns historically ) 7.5% number used conservative one . douglas andrew gets into technical detail how properly setup eiul yield ' floor ' 1% ' cap ' 15 or 17% ; i.e. when sp goes down -5% , you still get 1% return , when it goes up 5% you get 5% , when it goes up 20% you capped 17% . although i found out these eiul around only last five years or so , back-testing this approach 50 years yields some 9.4% , it makes sense you getting upside sp investment without downside risk , thus it bit lower than historical 50-year sp return . this reviewer thinks ' hidden costs ' properly constructed eiul , 1% ( average over 20-year span ) very reasonable , pay both administration well insurance component , but it tax implications ( grow tax-deferred withdrawn tax-free ) seems too good true . i haven't started eiul policy yet , but am seriously considering it , everything i've able find not able refuted many confuse equity indexed universal life properly constructed implemented ( following tax rules/laws ) other vehicles similar but not offer kinds growth advantage nor cost advantage this . while it may seem extreme no longer fund 401(k ) its maximum limit purchase universal life insurance contract instead , tax perspective there seems compelling case here . least i convinced ( after paying mortgage off early age 39 my case ) money could put better use elsewhere	1

ira levin , hands down , best suspense thriller author out there . his novels quick affairs fun read but leave you thinking once it all over . like no other , levin make impossible situation seem entirely within realm possibility . robot housewives ? satanic babies ? hitler clones ? his career covers it all , circumstances just real enough make you wonder if it could happen you . " stepford wives " came out decade when feminism taking hold nation making future gender roles uncertain . would women leave home forever -- taking jobs away men who feel entitled them forcing them cook wash their own laundry ? not if men stepford , connecticut help it . through desperate , brutal actions stepford men association levin makes bold statements how women chained their home lives made sacrifice their own desires their very humanity sake their family . true success levin chilling parable how timeless it proven . sure , specific details become dated since 1972 publication date , but message still target -- just look tabloid-infused botox-ification society occurs today proof . " stepford wives " great summer read beach , vacations , or rainy days when you're stuck indoors . like " davinci code , " it intelligence woven into its pot-boiler outline -- but fortunately it better writing back it up . it guilty pleasure isn't so guilty after all . aside : " rosemary baby " " stepford wives " ( levin most famous works ) suffer some fact now most people know what happens end , but don't let deter you . joy getting there still carry you through nicely ; fun no longer surprise twist but picking up clues get you there ( think it seeing " sixth sense " knowing bruce willis dead still appreciating movie craftmanship hid it original audiences ) .	-1

if familiarity indeed breed contempt , then perhaps explains why my opinion cooper most famous novel weakened over time . i recently reread book after interval many years ; not only i disappointed ( somewhat bored ) , but i realized it become my least favorite five leatherstocking novels . " last mohicans , " cooper aimed brazenly melodramatic adventure story romantic tradition novels walter scott . reading it adult , farcical caricatures delighted me boy made me cringe times , almost embarrassment . ( particular , psalmist named david gamut cooper jar jar binks . ) overwrought dialogue cumbersome even unintentionally comical ; only natty ( " hawk-eye " ) bumppo would deliver 300-word speech hush his compatriots order avoid imminent risk possible ambush . several things save novel its maudlin prose , they alone justify its status " classic . " first unexpected depth portrayal cora . modern standards , her character stereotypically feminine , but she pioneering heroine whose depiction violates nearly every preconception era . second aspect unhesitant ( its time ) graphic horror which cooper depicts hand-to-hand combat ; shocking episode opens massacre garrison still ability give me nightmares . , finally , there cooper decidedly " unromantic " willingness surprise reader killing off major characters startling ( believable ) twists plot . set aside cartoonish characters , overstylized prose , speechifying dialogue -- story alone worth read . so it not bad book any means , opinions depend taste . i prefer character-driven narratives almost pastoral mood " pioneers " or " prairie , " which times seem anticipate survivalist novels willa cather . those who prefer swashbuckling action " ivanhoe , " however , this book	-1

this extremely well written summary first 35 years patrick o'brian/richard patrick russ/richard ross life . nikolai tolstoy superb job mapping parallels unattested portions his step-father life through detailed analysis o'brian 3rd autobiographical novel , richard temple . tolstoy interpretations measured credible . while critical certain points dean king portrait , he avoids getting excessively embroiled their differences . what i still am loss understand exactly what prompted o'brian name change end wwii , particularly given richard russ operated richard ross while working what appears one propaganda branches british intelligence during wwii . tolstoy teasingly describes how richard russ a.k.a. richard ross assumed identity academic phd italian university . richard/patrick escaping these lies ? other area remains unexplored patrick o'brian craftsmanship . tolstoy certainly makes clear russ/ross/o'brian leveraged many his life experiences when writing his short stories ( many themes reappear aubrey/maturin series ) . but how largely uneducated writer evolve such potent writing style . tolstoy himself no mere scribbler . writing very clear moves reader effortlessly . but what his subject beautiful style ? tolstoy apparently access manuscripts this earlier period . they tell us anything ? finally , i believe this book help readers look characters aubrey/maturin series , especially female characters , new richer ligh t.t olstoy currently working part ii his o'brian biography	1

read several different translations lysistrata , i report one you select may make all difference your opinion this early comedy . roche translation very vulgar but good footnotes : get ready cockney spartans , however . jack lindsay translation , 1925 ( included bantam edition aristophanes ) seems overly literary comparison original but lacks notes . it reads well , though sounds little old-fashioned . bawdry present but made less direct ; this one spartan dialect scottish . i found parker translation least satisfactory . " hillbilly " dialect he gives spartans painfully overdone , not mention inaccurate , speeches awkward pedestrian . excellent edition overall alan . sommerstein penguin classic " aristophanes : lysistrata other plays . " introduction notes extremely informative , translation itself strikes right note represent aristophanes ' style english . ( once again , though , spartans scots . ) but perhaps best choice sarah ruden 2003 edition . her dialogue unusually funny without straying too far original . added value comes her four very readable essays greek democracy , warfare , women , comedy . it also printed quality paper comes great cover	-1

this one first rendell books i read , it absolutely knocked me out . i recovering cold , lying bed enjoying it nicely , when it took turn made me sit up straight go , quot ; say what ? quot ; i forgot cold , forgot everything but following this hypnotic tale its strange end . i've now read it three times , each time it got more impressive . present standards sex violence , it may seem understated . somehow , these days excess , just makes it more powerful . rendell empress accidental , queen chaos theory . something tiny happens , something else tiny happens , somehow , inevitably , chance becomes destiny or whatever passes it . oh , her books lovely , dark , deep . open this one up , you'll miles go before you sleep	1
dashiel hammett , author such classics maltese falcon thin man , certainly deserves credit one originators noir genre . unfortunately red harvest doesn't live up this reputation . red harvest starts continental op arriving mining town personville ( sometimes called poisonville ) . he hired editor local paper , who turns up dead . this editor also son mining magnate elihu willsson , who called collection hooligans break strike . what he not foreseen inevitability criminals would take over town . originally i idea " red " title something socialist workers movement or wobblies , logical assumption since hammett communist , but hammett settles obvious , red meaning murder after murder continental op turns criminals against each other . blurb back book lauds hammett " sharply economically defined " characters . they're sharply defined all right , so sharply defined they all run together . pete finn , lew yard , max thaler noonan , chief police , could same character . beginning novel , continental op learns history conflict bill quint , i.w.w. organizer chicago , but that pretty much last we hear him . only interesting character whole book femme fatale , dinah brand , but her sole motivation seems money . hammett also problems resolution conflict . when painted into corner , he simply kills off character . even continental op pretty much cipher . he doesn't seem much background , other than he somewhat afraid old man , who runs continental detective agency . we know he smokes drinks too much even takes cocaine , but other than he doesn't live up his cool name . unfortunately all this reads like bad comic book . even hammett would good laugh what new york times said red harvest , i would assume 1929 when it published : " red harvest more than superb crime novel : it classic exploration corruption violence american grain . " i'll give him two stars noir dialogue , but rest it pretty much dreck .	-1

luigi pirandello 1921 play " six characters search author " ( " sei personaggi cerca d'autore " ) deserved reputation first existentialist drama profound effect later playwrights , especially those practitioners theater absurd such samuel beckett ( " waiting godot " ) , eugene ionesco ( " rhinoceros " ) , jean genet ( " maids " ) . pirandello writing often focuses elements madness , illusion isolation , all which inspired tragic aspects his personal life which his wife went insane his daugther tried commit suicide . 1921 during five week period pirandello wrote his two acknowledged masterpieces , " six characters search author " " henry iv . " while " six characters " successful when it opened rome it also considered scandalous . however , it soon performed milan , london , new york , germany . because his great influence modern theater , pirandello awareded noble prize literature 1934 . two years later , while negotiations appear film version " six characters , " he died . setting " six characters search author " rehearsal play ( pirandello ) interrupted arrival six characters . their leader , father , tells manager they looking author . it seems author who created them never finished their story they unrealized characters who not yet fully brought life . father insists they not real people but characters , manager his cast only laugh idea . but then they become intrigued bits pieces story six characters tell . father intellectual who married mother , peasant woman . however , she fell love his male secretary father , bored his wife , encouraged her leave . she , leaving behind eldest son who embittered abandonment . mother three children this other man but then father starts miss her watches other children grow up . this new family moves away , but after other man dies mother her children return city . mother gets job madame pace dress shop , but it turns out brothel where step-daughter ends up employed . one day father shows up set up step-daughter . however , mother stops them reaching obvious conclusion entire family moves father resentful son . manager agrees produce their story become author whom they searching . he tries stage scene where father meets step-daughter dress shop but both characters insist what actors doing not realistic . manager allows them finish out scene instead . this sets up basic juxtaposition " drama " " reality " rest play , key scenes lives these characters providing more questions than they answer what happened what it means . point when manager no longer tell difference acting reality he becomes fed up entire thing ends rehearsal , providing audience already challenged these changing notions reality abrupt ending drama . almost all characters play known their roles rather than their names , such leading man second female lead . one few characters drama who name madame pace , who charge dress shop also serves brothel where step-daughter works . it perhaps this formality serves distance us production more than strangeness action or aged words , even though they adapted modern ear . there may or may not real story here , but ultimate point this play tradition reality theater no longer holds true . radical idea here there immutability reality these six characters . because they forms , forced into performing actions which they imagined , there inherent conflict life . this why son wants escape but cannot leave studio must play his role , must mother rest characters . this just true all other characters besides six , although others less inclined see truth , or least reality , their own situation until end , when final scene drama seeks dissolve " stage " reality completely . where pirandello succeeds end it both ways , we interpret what we seen reality or acting . either way , you left same conclusion .	1

bringing their only child into world , making lifetime commitment each other , changed everything chris sue rouse when they faced her unplanned pregnancy . chris 18 years old , still high school , when chris jr. - known throughout his life " chrissy " - arrived . sue gave up her dreams college , career , world travel so young couple could build business family instead . eventually they succeeded so well financially chris could afford such hobbies owning his own small airplane . then he discovered scuba diving , sport which he promptly introduced both sue chrissy ; rouse family lives changed again . never inclined toward doing anything halves , they soon moved recreational diving - relatively safe pursuit - adrenaline rush cave diving . rouses earned respect remarkably short time among their fellow cave divers , they made hundreds dives thoroughly mastered incredibly dangerous sport . next chris chrissy turned their attention open ocean wreck diving , which they applied their cave diving knowledge . into this new least equally perilous ( possibly more so ) universe , sue followed her men less eagerly . chris chrissy found kindred spirit bernie chowdhury , fellow cave diver also intrigued transferring sport principles diving inside shipwrecks . when chowdhury survived agonizing , temporarily crippling potentially fatal case bends , after pushing his body his skills too far during wreck dive forced choose drowning surfacing without hours life-saving decompression , rouses listened his story hoped learn it . yet they found themselves facing same decision during dive wreck mysterious german u-boat nicknamed u-who , after business reverses forced them cut corners supporting their expensive hobby . it alone , trying get compressed air dive so deep rouses would safer breathing more expensive " trimix " avoid nitrogen narcosis ? or there other factors , less obvious ones , leading up father son team fatal last dive ? author chowdhury book only partly loving memorial his two friends ' memory . it also analysis what motivates , often obsesses , not just cave wreck divers ; but everyone who pursues extreme sports require constant ( often escalating ) risk one life . his fascination rooted his own terrifyingly close brush not only death , but permanent physical disability . he not only interested why divers , mountain climbers , etc . pursue such sports ; he also wants understand why such men women rarely deterred hearing , or even witnessing , others ' fatal or crippling mishaps . while i notice some other reviewers not pleased chowdury personal narratives included this book , i found those narratives completely necessary achieving author purpose . i thought same details rouse family life , which illuminated chris chrissy behavior they made series decisions what turned out their final morning alive . no , this isn't shadow divers . if you've read both books , you must noticed puzzled - i - total disconnect john chatterton behavior during coast guard evacuation rouses dive boat seeker , chowdury described it here it described ( entirely different terms ) shadow divers . chowdury isn't accomplished author whom writing career . he simply man important story tell , who my opinion fine job doing exactly . nothing more ; but nothing less , either .	-1

i agree . seifert review . this book might thought provoking , eye opening , or supposedly mind-blowing some teenager who never considered technology might not meaning life , but any adult who already thought way beyond coupland very obvious comments modern society , book nothing new or interesting say wasn't all entertaining way . middle book , i actually enjoying plot wanted read more see how things turned out self-obsessed whiners ( " oh , i'm so lonely .

peter singer long since proven himself one most important influential ethical utilitarian philosophers 20th century . however , when singer steps into realm politics things get little murky ; this book , " one world " analysis globalization its effects , it less than perfect work . instance , singer provides thorough background information harmful effects industry environment form greenhouse gas emissions , then moves into section politics international law . now problem his research majority sources he cites footnotes outdated web pages no longer accessed , hardly something you want ground your beliefs globalization . exception this source footnote 33 page 45 " one atmosphere " chapter , which links excellent website detailing u . . ' steadily increasing rate carbon dioxide emissions which confirm his claims . unfortunately , number these online resources singer cites cannot reached , i'm referring now footnotes 5 6 chapter 1 which details u.n. reports , footnotes 2 4 chapter 2 also not available , footnotes 10 , 11 , 20 , 35 , 37 , 59 chapter 3 , " one economy , " these just sampling sources i checked . majority this highly unreliable data , it not just websites , singer relies very heavily thomas friedman biased book " lexus olive tree , " see footnotes 15 , 16 , 17 chapter 1 . clearly there dilemma people who serious this topic after reading through singer notes . hell , maybe every single source cited this book correct , but i couldn't verify great deal it . but that just one complaint i book ; addition , singer indicates me he just isn't expert politics any sense word . instance , when discussing international law humanitarian intervention initiatives , singer simply confuses political " authority " political " legitimacy " outright . not only , but he proceeds discuss genocide crimes against humanity regard democratic political systems without offering any kind working definition democracy . i wonder if he realizes so-called democracy u.s. contributed genocide east timor . anyway , i've said before singer excellent ethical philosopher , but his politics pretty amateurish . perhaps my biggest complaint book singer failure analyze connection rise globalization rise poverty , pollution , war , etc . he simply describes globalization phenomenon , detailing facets wto so , without offering much thoughtful connection phenomenon other ethical concerns book . put it simply , singer ultimately cops out offering normative judgment globalization whole , preferring instead move other issues like international law nationalism , issues me least intimately related globalization . book some good insights offer ; final section where singer analyzes u . . ' frugal contributions third world countries particularly striking , he offers some insightful solutions solving problems global poverty suffering . additionally , he offers some interesting criticisms john rawls ' work political justice his failure address issues justice differing societies . yet , i'm afraid this book too many problems recommend or rely , but i'm sure there many superior books globalization readers who willing look .	-1

when i bought this book , intially i open mind toilet training methods , but after reading this book i am sceptical child centred technique . reasons outlined book circular logic which makes no sense me . also , some suggestions seemed just silly me - instance , advice change active baby dirty nappy bath while she pulls herself up down ! dr brazelton outlines reasons changing child centred technique 60 - prevent high occurrence failure rigid early training schedules which involved punishment shame . much more rigorous study than one which dr brazelton describes would looked age training use punishment independently , then drawn conclusions what causing high failure rate . study conducted it impossible conclude which two factors - early age or punishment- more harmful . dr brazelton gives list signs readiness then assumes no child these signs before age 2 . i feel this greatly underestimating our children , also patronising other cultures around world ( who don't live " our mainstream hygienic culture " ) who train their children much younger age . i feel this book could very confusing parents they endlessly wait their child exhibit all signs readiness none signs not ready . but some signs child not ready could due waiting too long ; example , 1 . child sits toilet then pees soon after standing up : this could also due child made longstanding habit peeing standing up which possible diaper ; 2 . child not uncomfortable dirty diaper : this could also because child diapers so long , he conditioned accept walking around faeces smeared his bottom ! dr brazelton strongly emphasizes toilet training should up child it his achievement . course ! no one else control his muscles ! why then this only possible after certain age ? book , he desribes how he pre-empts toilet training questions 12 18 month checkups strongly advises parents not start until after age 2 . this me smacks interference well beyond what appropriate patient doctor . no wonder parents confused - they told ignore knowledge their own child . final note , i'm bit tired hackneyed advice " don't worry , your child won't diapers college " seems so prevalent toilet training experts . more point , " your child still diapers when he goes school ? " , which seems like possibility if you endlessly wait all signs readiness . perhaps then your child could attend dr brazelton toilet school untrained 4-6 year olds .	-1

several reviewers submitted highest life aristotle proposes consists " hard work " or " most difficult life . " i am afraid this language not accurately present aristotle description . aristotle writes these lecture notes contemplative life " superior human level " ( 1177b27 ) . yet , he distinguishes it secondary lives saying these secondary lives " require trouble " ( 1177b18 ) . aristotle calls contemplative life most pleasant life ( 1177a25ff ) . certainly , study hard work ; but this not hard work sense toil . work towards truth contemplate it once attained requires little strain . it virtuous agent right action any given circumstance : ease . through influence kant ( possibly stoics ) , we often associate virtue denying passions overcoming greatest obstacles ; likewise , we associate vice passions overcoming reason . this sense , most virtuous person would no passions all . however , aristotle suggests passions only conflict reason lower moral character . when reason prevails one right action against passion urges , he calls this ' enkrasia ' ; when passions overcome , he calls this ' akrasia ' . however , internal discord present these characters not present virtuous ( vicious ) . virtuous character most reliable participates definition virtue itself because agent habituated passions follow reason . his or her passions actually encourage agent what right .

orville schell works always exquisite . written crisp style , penetrating analysis , his books never failed breathe life into their subjects leave reader more informed than before . expecting same tour de force found mandate heaven discos democracy , i not disappointed virtual tibet : searching shangri-la himalayas hollywood . schell tackles topic receives plenty discussion fanfare , but experienced precious little objective study recent years . tibet labored under political cultural repression people republic china since 1951 . many believe china slowly committing cultural genocide through its repression tibetan religious cultural customs encouraging vast numbers han chinese settle tibet . help charismatic dalai lama throngs hollywood stars , tibetan issue received disproportionate amount attention relative its importance world events . whereas one struggles find quot ; free east timorquot ; bumper stickers cars , quot ; free tibetquot ; stickers far more ubiquitous . strong point schell work his analysis hollywood fascination tibet . he interviews many most visible promoters tibetan cause also provides fly-on- the-wall accounts numerous quot ; free tibetquot ; hollywood functions making movies kundun seven years tibet . through his interviews observations , schell largely confirms what i suspected years . hollywood promotion tibetan cause less its relative merits than it fact it become fashionable issue which associated . tibetan cause become virtual rohrsach test which hollywood supporters use feel better what ails them spiritually politically . schell works demonstrate uncanny ability meeting all right people convincing them reveal their true feelings . instead communist party officials or chinese gangsters his previous works , schell somehow able elicit revealing quotes otherwise elusive individuals such steven seagal brad pitt . although nobody complained misquoted my knowledge , i hope this reflects schell skill interviewer . it would shame if writer journalist schell quality needed embellish his subject words better copy . schell succeeds making subject tibetan history more entertaining general reader without sacrificing content . schell virtual tibet informative well-rounded work , lifting much mystique esoteric , yet prominent subject . while schell sympathizes their cause , he able remove veil motivation hollywood tibetan supporters . many readers may expected schell delve deeper into issues surrounding china tibet , but this would required schell tread over already well- traveled terrain . deciding leave debate over relative merits chinese policies toward tibet aside , schell produced original thoughtful work journalism . schell portrayal main protagonists tibetan cause unflattering bound upset many people . this hallmark fine journalist	-1

" star wars : empire strikes back , " written donald . glut , recounts epic tale 1980 " star wars : episode v-the empire strikes back , " sequel " star wars : new hope . " i found some things different movie rather interesting , first which yoda color blue instead pale green , second he gnaws his gimer stick , unseen me movie . this added story me terms who he how he acted . other things , though , seemed take away story . there wasn't great deal detail . this true previous novel , but this time fact everything little vague didn't always help fuel imagination . i liked author often used word " sword " instead " lightsaber , " but he never told reader color luke sword vader sword ( or if they both colorless ); i already knew colors just because i seen movie , but book seemed written someone who already seen movie ( fact very little americans not seen movie beside point ) when it supposed written anyone his target audience . he one point said battle taking place going back-and-forth red green laser blasts , but who green who red ? leaving some things imagination ( like how people look , their facial expressions ) okay , but if author going describe how something looks , he should finish job , not leave it halfway . this would still yet okay certain authors ' styles , but this author style doesn't seem tell it righ t.t here certain moments book should given more weight . they certainly depth , i could still vividly imagine what happening how it happening such rich atmosphere , but everything seems weighed evenly . when luke finds out yoda jedi master whom he searching , it just happens . author comes point where luke makes discovery then author just moves . book never sits down reader thinks , feels , wonderful moments . moment movie , well soundtrack , given great weight , but this book just tells tale too quickly without delight . same true when luke discovers darth vader his father . it just happens . author then , omniscient third-person view , describes luke thoughts , yet somehow author dries everything up reader . author gives fair weight what happening-yoda standing corner luke discovers jedi master ; luke fighting vader cloud city-when weight should given words they speak . book spendid just any moment yoda luke . luke well described too much pride his successes , yoda character comes alive . he described exactly how he should , which say he seems goofy first , yet you discover it not goofiness ; it yoda incredible jedi teacher . he may not even great teacher author describes it , but it described such delight . magic tree particularly enchanting ; luke goes off search cave because he feels dark side , he finds darth vader , or just mystical trick . i actually liked it better here book than movie . luke bewildered , chapter ends yoda gnawing his gimer stick . way author presents it so mystical , so enchanting , my eyes wide open even though i reading it very late night ( morning ) . chapter ended , i fell back my seat just wondering what happened me . i laughed . i really laughed this time . watching " star wars " movies over over again seems make it all dry sand me unless i consciously make sure i enjoy it , but reading this book really made me laugh ; han solo leia organa really some verbally delightful moments showing their affection or lack thereof ; this book got much wit movie . i'm sure i remember laughing whenever yoda nonchalanty went gnawing his gimer stick while luke struggled complete his daunting , seemingly impossible jedi training tasks . this book really makes characters spring life . " star wars : empire strikes back " tells epic tale told book format , highly recommended all " star wars " fans ; it little more classic science-fictionndash ; oriented , so i would recommend it any sci-fi reader well . some parts fans hold such high esteem movies told without any delight or without any weight , but depth still there , other scenes certainly delightful enough worth read . overall , it good book , emotional , powerful , enchanting ; everything here	-1

this marvelous volume enjoyed book photography lovers alike . object its own right it exhibits level refinement conception execution become rare our age mass-produced books . course , there many specialist photobook publishers but they seem focus exclusively print quality increase perceived value their publications , whilst neglecting vital contribution design book overall appearance ( desirability ) . phaidon-volume , exquisitely judged rhythm layout typography complement vivid reproductions vintage photobook material into very exciting whole . sure , care spent production this book not gratuitous . contrary , it statement reinforces basic conceptual tenets held badger parr . introductory pages we learn not every any book conceived around collection photographs merits included class " photobooks " . photobook - badger parr understand it - more than just sum its parts : pictures , words , design , choice subject all contribute something which transcends meaning photographic portfolio . this all illuminating one could certainly say " photobook " instructive example this synergy various elements . however , i wished editorial team would left it . i think badger parr moving onto much more controversial ground when they hold forth emblematic photobook kind dramatic event , " comparable piece sculpture , play or film " which individual photographs lose their own character things themselves . apart theoretically doubtful , i believe this criterion simply too stringent many vintage photobooks featured this survey not comply it . example , many early books photo albums true sense word : bound collections original prints glued onto white pages . similarly , it difficult see some modernist books - such erhardt " das watt " or mendelsohn " amerika " - anything more than expertly produced photographic portfolio . each these examples there coherence , but it not derive some kind dramatic or narrative logic . it simply unity style which holds photobook together . positioning photobook " novel film " , therefore , raises more questions than it provides us answers . it doesn't really help make sense " ragged sprawling subject , more than its fair share anomalies " . it perhaps more useful investigate how badger parr tried organise their material within confines this volume ( next ) . they seem relied three different lines thought . first chronological ( it history after all ) . survey starts very first publications , early history photography end section " photobook modern life " . this sense , book studied remarkably lively varied panorama how photographers engaged their craft over last 150 years . second organising principle geographical : some individual chapters focus distinct area cultural production ( us , europe japan ; next volume features chapter " worldwide photobook " ) . finally , there " intention " structuring element . photobooks produced serve variety purposes : tell story , tell non-story ( stream-of-consciousness-like books ) , non-tell story ( deconstruct ) , document , persuade , etc . indeed , valuable photobook even limit itself simply showing . most chapters two volumes put some kind " intention " center discussion . i think badger parr conception their own book certain extent odds their conceptual emphasis dramatic nature photobooks . if there drama " photobook " , it mediated words accompany various chapters , not visuals . other words : it conceptual not photographic narrative unfolds . regards visuals , curiously enough daring use white space drop shadows around book page reproductions really make them stand out preciously unique . leafing through book akin walking carefully presented museum exhibits . this sense , " photobook " clearly `shows ' , therefore pulls us away dramatic sweep history . despite these theoretical misgivings there not shade doubt my mind this book deserves five stars . it fabulous book i look forward keen anticipation second final volume .	1

i imagine my mind what it would like coffee luis borges sunday afternoon . borges would wearing suit little cakes hand , cane leaning his armrest , if nothing out ordinary occur . labyrinths useful first book kick off lifetime investigation into borges ' writings . borges truly original author much his intent his achieving it . not quite magic realist , not quite existentialist nor kafkan : no one borges ' equal taking established assumptions turning them into curious , elaborate , eruditely-supported flashing crossroads defy simplification . even most unassuming essays like " fearful sphere pascal , " subtle historical resketching , characteristically erudite , yet sticky complicate subject irresistibly your first reading onward . prickly thorns reach out your existing education subject designed flesh out glaring inconsistencies you read subjec t.t he garden forking paths example prime borges storytelling work . story itself ruse . first reading-through not time you affected most borges , but rather only after you put book down , when borges ' physics begin gnaw your world compact , necessary daily conveniences , even 2005 when we really ought intimately familiar his universe now . i think ultimately borges sets tiny mind bombs set detonate exactly time you seek superimpose newtonian universe upon one his stories , ultimately , later , when you seek superimpose order upon your own human experience . entrance seems same , but it clearly moved time you exit story . you become part puzzle , bedazzling signature borges , his unassailable virtue . everything solid universe daily lived experience becomes compost peacefully unsettled , it originally , before we came fix it up like morticians just before funeral .	1

david mills ' " atheist universe " lucid presentation rationalist viewpoint nature our world how it explained without resorting mysticism unprovable assertions supreme . it , mills carefully lays out reasons why we needn't assume existence god ( or gods ) understand natural phenomena , demolishes numerous assertions teachings religious spiritualist propagandists . his primary target christian fundamentalism , but he makes it clear his critique religious beliefs equally applicable other faiths well . places , his explanations get bit technical , but he fine job demolishing pseudo-scientific mumbo-jumbo used " intelligent design " crowd their fellow travelers . ( chapter internet porn , however , seems out place . yes , biggest porn-bashers often religious conservatives -- but so what ? what validity atheist viewpoint ? )one thing i particularly enjoyed numerous quotes past present thinkers mills includes throughout book . among those he cites albert einstein , thomas jefferson , thomas edison mark twain - numerous others whose writings i long admired . " atheist universe " probably won't convert many diehard religious believers , but if you all open-minded , qualms endless barrage religiosity engulfing america today , this book well worth buying reading	1

laurence bergreen " over edge world " great example how narrative history should written . he takes very interesting but overlooked story breathes life into it . most history books magellan first circumnavigation merits few sentences or paragraphs , but brief mention conceals rich story underneath . magellan portuguese man who sailed under spanish flag , five ships began voyage , only one completed circumnavigation . magellan died during voyage , but not before facing two mutinies countless other hazards . bergreen excellent job telling this story . he explains nautical terms shipboard conditions early 16th century , he puts story into its proper political cultural context - time when inquisition still powerful force spain age exploration changing europe . my primary criticism book should many more maps ; it only included one map ( displayed twice ) entire world inside each cover . my only other criticism , others pointed out reviews , bergreen sometimes seems not understand -- or explain -- concepts like international date line . this history book reads like novel . bergreen brings out human suffering , triumph , failings during this voyage . it great read anyone any interest history .	1

those who skeptical just anything coming llewellyn , i say , if they continue release extremely high caliber material like christopher penczak temple witchcraft series , then they fully redeem themselves publishers . though i share concerns other reviewers lack separation sets exercises cds , after listening several tracks i now believe exercises recorded way specific reason . series meditations visualizations , recorded , afforded me rich experience helped calm my mind increase my focus within first three days receiving set ! example , after initial relaxation counting-down induction , first " set " takes you through 3 ( or four ? ) sets simple visualization exercises . afterwards , he counts you up meditation state full awareness grounds you light chakra sweep clearing affirmation . each segment begins ends same calm , balanced safe manner . when i experienced exercises first time , i appreciated he didn't short-change coming-back-to-awareness sequence end each meditation , like some meditation recordings i've heard . if you're considering companion cds books , i would consider this required item purchase books . keep mind , cds companion books--they're not audio version entire text , just exercises , which comes very handy if you don't want work your meditation trance while balancing book your lap . many , many , many blessings mr. penczak his excellent soothing voice , caring warm reading , top-knotch level work this cd all his books . bright blessings	1

i concur most praise other reviewers , though someone who willingly chose megashul i am probably bit less dissatisfied ordinary synagogues than they . caveat or two : ( 1 ) schwarz seems writing distinctly quot ; new ageyquot ; audience -- baby boomers , politically ultraliberal , oriented towards mysticism rather than learning . i suspect many unaffilated jews aren't type would-be congregant schwarz most interested . ( 2 ) i don't think schwarz emphasizes education much i would ; certainly , i chose my shul partially because it seemed more educational opportunities than smaller ones ( e.g. study session after services saturday )	1

read several different translations lysistrata , i report one you select may make all difference your opinion this early comedy . roche translation very vulgar but good footnotes : get ready cockney spartans , however . jack lindsay translation , 1925 ( included bantam edition aristophanes ) seems overly literary comparison original but lacks notes . it reads well , though sounds little old-fashioned . bawdry present but made less direct ; this one spartan dialect scottish . i found parker translation least satisfactory . " hillbilly " dialect he gives spartans painfully overdone , not mention inaccurate , speeches awkward pedestrian . excellent edition overall alan . sommerstein penguin classic " aristophanes : lysistrata other plays . " introduction notes extremely informative , translation itself strikes right note represent aristophanes ' style english . ( once again , though , spartans scots . ) but perhaps best choice sarah ruden 2003 edition . her dialogue unusually funny without straying too far original . added value comes her four very readable essays greek democracy , warfare , women , comedy . it also printed quality paper comes great cover	1
david mamet one america most respected playwrights . this autobiographical essay jewish situation he writes wild passion outrage hatred jews unjustly subject , flight shame their own jewish identity good part american jewry . he starts out cry , ' world hates jews ' this becomes kind rhythmic chant all through his opening chapter , sense throughout work whole . revealed first shortcoming this work . while it true jews suffered historically hatred persecution most horrible ways , it true this very time historically jewish state israel subject continuous barrage hatred many sources it not true each every person nation hates jews israel . here i fault mamet allowing his rhetoric get best him unknowingly insulting not simply great share his fellow countrymen who actually sympathize allied israel but so many remarkable human beings who ' friends ' jews throughout history . moreover mamet not seem realize when one makes such claim one really work one enemies , one distances implication , friends seems invite others hatred jews . this qualification made i come what i regard strongest point mamet work , his pointing out biased discriminatory treatment state israel not only haters , islamists , neo- nazis , radical left chomskyians , but great share world nations media who continually show bias , discrimination towards jewish state . mamet here provides few recent pieces evidence back up his claim , but perhaps would better he focused present iranian regime talk ' wiping ' israel map- stressed too point this kind unprecedented declaration one u.n. state upon not met worldwide outrage sanction iranian mullah-regime . mamet second major subject assimilated , self- denying apologetic american jews , wicked son his title , who not simply resist jewish belonging but often curry favor others even join chorus hatred against jewish religion , jewish community , state israel . mamet i sense criticizes many what he somewhat misleadingly calls ' apikorsim ' their detachment jewish life , one senses it almost if he trying shame them back jewish belonging . it almost if whole book kind ' teshuvah riff ' which he reaching out assimilated jews urging them abandon their ' inauthenticity ' courageously take new interest pride their jewish identities . mamet celebrates importance ' belonging ' talks how it give greatest pleasure life . here he apparently referring his own return jewish observance kind communal experiences he under tutelage his own spiritual mentor , rabbi finley . here too i think great force passion mamet lead him bit exaggeration , we know nothing more evil than intoxications given mindless group- belonging . any case mamet specific recommendation return real jewish belonging through observance me both commendable incomplete . it not enough i understand it jew today world bound communal religious observance . additional necessity i understand it jewish historical awareness understanding well beyond kind character mamet reveals himself this work . i agree wholeheartedly his call renewed jewish communal belonging , identity contribution but i believe this broader conception ' jewish identity ' than one mamet provides us this work . i think however most important point mamet heart right place . he uses his extraordinary literary talents make not always carefully argued but most often emotionally convincing wake- up call american jews	1

let freedom ring , sean hannity sends out subliminal message he his writing truth , justice , american way . just title represents everything true good him america . his five-star reviewers his message reinforces their pre-conceived beliefs hannity words validation those beliefs . if this written ghost writer , he should withheld payment . if it wasn't written ghostwriter , hannity should one his next attempt literary hyperbole . first chapter written maudlin , " those-were-the-good-old-days " wistfulness his immigrant grandfather who he describes honest man integrity , believer american dream . but before you say " erin go braugh " he talking courage george . bush standing up terrorism . exactly how g.w. , he doesn't elaborate . how he goes grandfather dubbya bit magic . hannity next trick impugn clinton gore soft terrorism . his source this , all people , dick morris who knew clintons now works fox republican advocacy network . he quotes morris who makes such vague statements " it seemed they afraid talking terrorism , " or " they seemed indifferent terrorism . " these " morris mind-reads " conjectural , but hannity uses them , which he impunity . let take closer look hannity unimpeachable source moment . it dick morris who quit clintons shortly after second election . it morris who penchant streetwalkers , some jail time , entered alcohol rehab . you'd think sh could find better source if he expects freedom ring ! but , hannity doesn't skip beat . he points out how democrats such senators kerry daschle voted against certain defense-spending bills . what he neglects inform his readers reasons they because riders attached bills , or number republicans who also voted against same bills , or many defense bills kerry daschle vote . he never once advises his reader defense spending programs killed dick cheney when he secretary defense . such deception called propaganda . propaganda something hannity no compunction using here . this he continuing tell tale long since debunked . namely , it story president clinton offered osama bin laden sudanese government . again , it what he doesn't say misdirects reader . sudan made offer hope economic sanctions against them slave-trading , lifted . however , fbi determined sudanese playing us because they neither ability nor intent handing over bin laden . sudanese also made offer saudi arabia , but saudis revoked bin laden citizenship , refused take him . benjamin franklin said " statistics liar . " hannity uses charts same purpose . he shows how under reagan , army bought over 500 tanks . under clinton , army bought none . this leads one assumption clinton nothing services . he doesn't mention army buys tanks , not presidents . he doesn't mention army all tanks they needed armored warfare against soviet union never came . he doesn't mention army began changing its warfare strategies which would include more transportable fighting vehicles . grateful hannity cannot rewrite famous works literature he attempts history . if he could , instead seeing dead captain ahab killed whale " moby dick , " we might just see grinning captain standing next tethered whale caption : " i caught fish this big ! " there something very fishy his facts , his historical parallels which aren't parallel , what he chooses tell you , what he chooses leave out . this book , he tells whale-sized whoppers !	-1

i originally read this novel , its continuation fall hyperion , early 90 shortly after discovering it won hugo award . it engrossing read , i finished it satisfied quality hugo award winners time , then continued reading subsequent award winners . so here it some 15 years or so later , i'm re-reading it after hearing others rave it ( i've people exclaim me bus poland even ) , discover it now four-book series , status dune its generation 25 years or so ago . ( so if 25 year cycle continues , then it only 8 years or so until next dune/hyperion sci-fi novel . ) hyperion published before ubiquitous presence internet . just give idea what it like then , it time logging into internet very first time one life conversations such : `ok first type http ' , `why ' , `just it make sure it http not hhtp or htpp ok then type colon backslash backslash make sure it backslash not forward slash ' , `a what-slash what there two types slashes ... who thinks these things ' , `and make sure you type two backslashes ' , `why two why not three or four ' , `just type it ' , `ok now type three w ' , `oh so * now * we type three continuous characters ' . yes , it amusing time . so this book published before most these conversational interactions , so world web novel takes new meaning re-reading . terms like fatline could taken apple use `fat ' software codes written compatible their older hardware their newer power-pc-chip hardware incorporated into their computers late 80 . so simmons really cutting edge things when he published this novel . like dune , this sweeping epic novel part sweeping epic series . others commented , hyperion/fall hyperion ( foh ) not separate books , they one book split down middle published separately . means it really 1000 page novel . may seem daunting , but serious reader sf , you'll want read this , more importantly it hard believe you wouldn't enjoy reading this . there'll point your life , if not already , where additional $8 insignificant time it takes read this precious , so if you time now then now time . there some novels seem more meaning when read some point one life . this novel me personally takes more meaning now i advanced my career . i identify many characters ; their professionalism , occasion disillusionment , screw-ups , achievements . there things this novel sticks you through years . definitely shrike .

william cleveland " history modern middle east " without doubt essential book anyone interested or studying middle east history . cleveland presents history region late ottoman empire through more recent struggles dominating airwaves - this most important thing - explains what earth stake . this particularly important thing middle east history , some alliances divisions different groups somewhat arcane beginner . unlike many books covering history region , cleveland writes eminently readable manner . while some readers astonished lack diacritics like , this serves purpose communicating his information much more clearly . his analysis sense history spot-on . whether writing defeat ottoman empire or land-rights struggle palestinians israelis , cleveland presents facts clearly wry sense humour times - particularly his discussion iran modernising drive . cleveland also eye anecdote illuminating personality , which greatly improves his abilities writer . if there one problem lot contemporary middle east scholarship , it reliance dry historical record expense character sketch . if there one criticism which could made this work , it cleveland sometimes expects little more background knowledge his readers than perhaps he should . already interest this field , i not suffer too much this expectation , although absolute beginner might some problems . said , this book i highly recommend anyone keen learn genesis region which - better or worse - looks though it news headlines many years come . after all , winston churchill ( man who not come up roses history this region ) once said , those who not understand history doomed repeat it . arguably , this more true middle east than anywhere else earth	1

i thought idea each author write different chapter great idea , however after reading this book i extremely disappointed . each author clearly their own vision how this story should develop , but they not all same vision making this novel very confusing . there way too many characters it seems even up end new ones added . there no main characters you engaged their lives . it just mess . chapters 11 12 well developed flowed together nicely if those two authors understood each other . last chapter , well it different twist plot almost every chapter . it literally over . never entire book characters introduced suspects . it all just bunch victims no real villains so authors seemed feel need create more characters then try tie story up weak ending . this book not even worth checking out library . it just painful read . i hate say when there so many good authors collaborating this novel , but perhaps there too many not enough unity . don't waste your money this one	1
this first book doctorow i read . looking his other books , i wasn't quite sure what expect . but it certainly wasn't this . doctorow work feel kerouac , burroughs , heinein starship troopers , kesey , kafka . he takes incident one most turbulent trying times our nation history spins story young man trying understand life death his parents ( executed treason ) . doctorow takes religion , disney , political social attitudes america . he it well . daniel man who both confused very knowing . he radical but not like any you've seen before . doctorow style little disconcerting first few pages ( he jumps first third person , both daniel point-of-view , sometimes mid-sentence ) , but after you adjust it , it seems only way this story could told . this book you read . i didn't put it my list " best ever " , but it definitely short-listed it	1
john kelly written very complete text possible origin geographical course black plague took it swept through europe middle ages . while covering plague detail , kelly book contains much , much more information than romping ' yersinia pestis ' bacillus . kelly includes lessons history , map study both possible probable courses plague took its journey . i found map quite helpful , book interesting enough i've brushed up my geography now well . kelly includes tales kings , monks , priests , surgeons , wide-spread anti-semitism movement , great famine 1315 . despite rich prose , well written layman language , book remains dry times . flow timeline interrupted lot because kelly tends tell tale region rather than timeline , though two eventually meet shake hands . chapter ten , " god first love " took left turn went off its own into history jewish persecution rather than plague travels , not necessarily boring but enough off topic make me lose interest . while jews seemed unduly persecuted plague times , i question dedication entire chapter jewish history book . pestis . sheer volume information ' great mortality ' makes it one most informative books i've read middle ages , much less plague bacillus , but it also creates more difficult read . this might not book you looking if you wish skim surface black plague history . ' great mortality ' more like diving into deep water than gleaning field . kelly book heavy information , including footnotes , full notes/bibliography section , index . but , its also filled enough imagination intrigue maintain high level interest subject , even laymen . if you any interest plague or even functioning middle ages during adverse conditions such famine or plague , then definitely pick up copy ' great mortality ' . enjoy !	1

this last string ' juvenile ' ( young adult ) novels heinlein wrote late fifties early sixties before he began his series best selling adult noveles ( stranger strange land , moon harsh mistress etc ) . when heinlein first submitted it his publisher ending deemed too harsh he forced change it . story told , most part , podkayne fries , 16 year old girl , who lives her family mars . poddy intelligent , ambitious young woman whose chief interests coping her bratty younger brother clark , planning her future career starship captain looking forward family trip earth . unexpected arrival triplet younger siblings change her plans , however , poddy clark find themselves taking trip their uncle instead their parents . poddy clark discover there bit more their uncle than kind card playing layabout they thought him find themselves embroiled interplanetary politics . always heinlein work it background bits he just tosses out much main plot appeal . we get glimpse poddy life mars , see what life interplantetary luxury liner would like experience what entire colony run las vegas style would like . heinlein often criticized , particularly his earlier works , sexist . this novel he begins change this , story told mostly girl point view , her mother main breadwinner - highly sought after engineer , podkayne dreams piloting through space . downside heinlein abandons his feminist stance , podkayne who began story bright determined mid novel begins waver overwhelmed circumstances ultimately surrendering heinlein theme woman place home . rah would handle female charcters better later works . heinlein fans this pivotal work , poddy we see beginnings more independent women characters appear his later novels , clark there more than passing similarity young lazarus long , futility racism theme return later novels major point here . this must read heinlein fans , would also good place begin reading his works	1

" ... so when his reasons making pledge no longer operrative . " we live era high definition television , internet , fast cars , space travel when change word day everything seems become outdated before tomorrow arrives , then you come accross book like this ... you realise there something our nature not changed much . i read book disbelief , amazed how contemporary this text despite fact niccolo machiavelli wrote this book five hundred years ago . machiavelli wrote this book after losing high powered position florentine state . it believed he wrote book 1513 , or least he started working book year . you read text i quoted title my review you cannot escape thought how well applies today politics - any country . quote captures essence book , political manifesto applied practice hundred years later richellieu , creator " raison d'etat " concept . machiavelli focused stating principles acquiring sustaining political power italy . his belief true leader person political abilities , fortune military skills . while sifting through history find examples support his organisation various power systems , machiavelli uses his sharp observations discuss human nature attach them methodically arsenal skills successful prince needs master . thus book becomes something used debate history , politics , human nature , sociology or i dare say economics . this book excellent material people deep belief humans bad they managed mainly through fear : " this said generality men : they ungrateful , fickle , dissembling , anxious flee danger , covetous gain . so long you promote their advantage , they all yours ... " . this lack trust present throughout book machiavelli not discriminate his conclusion classes . poor rich alike when it comes interest . my view , this conundrum machiavelli : he generalises men untrustworthy yet he talks loyalty patriotism , especially when it comes himself . book more than study human nature politics . while reading it i started understand much better italian history . it clear my view why italy so fragmented politics this country so volatile . it goes back hundreds years struggle power influencial families . during this time they become experts diplomacy finding right balance power . i found amazing how papacy managed survive landscape littered stories ruin , deceit , death temporary success . italy battle ground papacy , powerful italian families , french spanish emperors . country lots old memories , i believe , still strong presence today affairs . it interesting machiavelli noted strong pricipality could based strong cities . he uses example german cities strong fortifications , moats artilery " ... they enough work sort mainstay city keep populace engaged their usual crafts space year " . this description economic power , seed future capitalism . i found interesting although he noted importance economic capacity , he missed it list critical elements success , limiting it include only political military . machiavelli principles power politics applied warfare business . he discussess extensively what prince should maintain power when conquering new territories . i worked couple years company aggressive acquirer i say machiavelli observations apply incredibly well many scenarios acquisitions , especially if they hostile . apart mergers acquisitions , some studies human nature revealed when people new leader apply quite well today politics played even department level . there few lessons there . example if new ruler conquers new territory chances preserving territory increase greatly if ruler moves residency new territory . this what turkish sultan preserve greek territory . i find instructive , today terms , follow more closely see if acquiring company high ranking officer moving new territory belonging acquired company . machiavelli master language . he manages express human beliefs touching primitive cord makes you pay attention wonder . he , however , biased too much towards idea humans either evil or greedy or arrogant or stupid . i supose one could forgive considering living conditions he endured when he wrote book . nowadays , he could published same book , cash royalties , make movie , make very comfortable living . here fragment letter he wrote his friend , francesco vettori : " ... meanwhile lunchtime arrives , together my family , i eat whatever food my poor house scanty patrimony afford . lunched , i return inn . there i generally find innkeeper , butcher , miller , two kiln-tenders . their company i idle rest day away playing cricca tricchetrach - games give rise host quarells , cutting remarks , insults . often we fight over penny heard yelling far off san casciano . set down among these lice , this how i keep mould my brain find release fortune malice . i am content her beat me down this way see if she won't become ashamed " great book , worth every penny every minute . served good glass wine , or cup tea quiet environment . get ready surprises , interesting associations intellectual delight .	1

this very clearly written exposition major threats facing mankind present near future . it provides sensible discussions incredible dangers most us not think most time . it also reasonable understanding nuclear threat not vanished fall soviet union but rather transformed . it too presents picture possible survival through colonization other worlds . it proposes whole set possibilities transformation humanity into some other form which would make our cosmic survival more likely . its focus however discussing kinds dangers human tampering nature environment bring future . hopelessness which i personally felt reading work comes not only possibility one ' doom scenarios ' might realized . it rather strong feeling which rees not alone presenting , we human beings we , only temporary stage which necessarily transformed into some other more durable , more intelligent kind ' thing .

i very disappointed this book . i very eager read this book learn wolfram thoughts new approach science , but there nothing this book justifies such lofty title . first six chapters book describe various types cellular automata , which computational models whose evolutionary behavior governed simple rules . wolfram devoted much his scientific career studying such systems . one particular system caught wolfram interest cellular automata model he calls " rule 30 " . what so remarkable " rule 30 " ? rule 30 starts off single element , through repeated application simple rule , rapidly evolves into system involving apparently complex behavior . there two big problems first six chapters this book . first , wolfram never bothers try explain what so special " rule 30 " . why doesn't rule 29 or rule 31 show complex behavior ? what essential elements rule 30 give complexity ? wolfram gives no information this . second big problem wolfram much too repetitive . point complexity generated simple rules hammered over over again . this book could clearly used lot editing . rest book describes ways which cellular automota applied various scientific problems , but no concrete , specific pathways given how tackle these various problems . rather , chapters consist various suggestions musings wolfram how cellular automata may relate wide range scientific problems . breadth his discussions more impressive than their depth , which often never gets much deeper than noting visual similarities some his diagrams physical appearances shells , tiger stripes , snowflakes , etc . key problem this book it never attempts analyze why some rules give " complex " behavior why others don't . i'm reminded story wolfram himself related time he showed richard feynman printout " rule 30 " : " well , we'd just crawling around floor -- help some other people -- trying use meter rules measure some feature giant printout it . feynman takes me aside , rather conspiratorially , says : " look , i just want ask you one thing : how you know rule 30 would all this crazy stuff ? " " you know me , " i said . " i didn't . i just computer try all possible rules . i found it . " " ah , " he said , " now i feel much better . i worried you some way figure it out . " " both wolfram feynman geniuses , but feynman something wolfram doesn't: gift seeing past unessentials getting gist problem . wolfram fills his books countless pages diagrams showing " complex " behavior , but never tries explain essential nature rule 30 . after reading this book , i'm also reminded statement freeman dyson , brilliant scientist , after he looked wolfram book : " there tradition scientists approaching senility tocome up grand , improbable theories . wolfram unusual he doing this his 40 "	-1

i've only read first 70 pages or so , but agree others this repetitious . you better love acc , because it mostly those teams . ucla . errors . clearly author trying churn out two books once ( other nfl ravens ) , it shows . 1 ) coach krybaby " his " introduction says scott may broke his leg indiana , cost them national championship 1975 . assistant bobby knight . well , actually may broke his arm against purdue february 1975 . arm , leg , what difference , right ???? 2 ) author says michigan state beat penn 32 1979 semis . actually it 34 points ( 101-67 ) . penn beaten unc earlier . unc beaten msu 1 early regular season when magic johnson ( dean smith points out book ) eight turnovers . that all well good , but latter game also infamous when one tar heel radio guys said , " magic johnson no phil ford .

i must say this book stand it presents radically different view parenting than most books i've read . it holds most important thing kids very strong relationship their parents , almost all woes today kids caused them peer oriented instead parent oriented . authors make very strong case this so . i convinced time this part book over . however , many books this type , section where we told what this problem weaker . most ideas would work best very young child not yet become peer oriented . if you already child who rebellious addicted peers , i don't think speaking them kindly looking them eyes going much . author gave example his own children taking them away week vacation just child parent . sounds good , but i don't think his children severe problems other examples we given . book also perspective parents caring , kind , loving their childrens ' best interests heart . i know parents who read parenting books more likely fit this perspective , but i kept thinking not all parents completely wonderful . i think many child saved childhood would otherwise hellish their friends . author also feels children friendships not really true friendships , they not mature enough true friendships . i respect their courage say peer relationships not important we always led believe . but i think childhood friendships true ones . i know i still am very , very close least 3 my friends young childhood , i say looking back our friendship true start . i don't mean overly dispute message this book . i think it extremely well written brave book , i influenced ideas presented here very much . i just think it like most ideas taken extreme --- they fall apart bit when this case . but i want thank authors presenting this view parenting . it going play part my decision whether or not homeschool my oldest child . definately worth read	1

superstars children literature often contend continual cries their fans further adventures stories . how long you think j.k. rowling able keep her promise only seven harry potter tales before she breaks down consents one further story ? we should never forget when character ( or characters ) becomes famous beloved , he/she/they cannot rest peace . even sherlock holmes rose his grave star further adventures imaginings . it should come no surprise then lloyd alexander acquiesced , after fashion , his adoring public . after asked writer further tales land prydain , alexander chose give public what they wanted . sort . stories this book take place prydain they contain many beloved characters we've grown know . sly twist , however , alexander sets all these tales before any action we read prydain chronicles . this experiment prefacing stories we already know so well could ended up either derivative or depressing george lucas attempt create first three movies " star wars " series . instead , they end up tiny parables speak hope , light , beauty midst potential bloodshed terror . they're well worth reading . there eight stories this book total . first , " foundling " tale how sorcerer dallben raised three weird sisters midst swampy home gained more wisdom than he wanted . " stone " shows us dwarf doli his encounter man who wants live forever ( finds it unaccountably dull ) . " true enchanter " kind how-they-met tale explaining why princess eilonwy mother ( who , like all alexander heroines , exactly like eilonwy herself ) fell her very unmagical father . " rascal crow " just alexander excuse write his very own aesop tale too-clever crow his animal allies . " sword " explains why sword drynwyn met taran black blood . " smith , weaver , harper " parable , this time displaying continual greed man something little better . finally " truthful harp " shows how fflewddur fflam got his magic harp how coll dallben met " coll his white pig " . stories ( alexander himself points out author note ) read without picked up single prydain book before . i wouldn't necessarily recommend doing though . how significant average reader going find fact king rhitta died hand his own sword deep spiral castle if they haven't already picked up " book three " ? or dallben grew old before his time ? these stories aren't strictly need-to-know , but it certainly help . tales themselves , they're all right . nothing too spectacular , if you want my honest opinion . they take most basic elements all good folktales rework them over over . if there common theme any these stories , it all good tales work threes . alexander reworked them such way they appear somewhat original , but don't particularly surprised if you predict where each story going long before its close . end , this book really best those die-hard fans " prydain chronicles " who're clamoring further lloyd alexander facts fancies . anyone else probably find books little repetitive not particularly new . they're lovely little tales but there little recommend them but books they preface . nice but unnoticeable .	1

it insulting ( it must disheartening)for poet john ashbery stature told , again again , his poems don't make any sense . ashbery artificial superficially . it his critics who generally seem cold clever me . i laughed wept over his books ! i am hoping others my age ( i'm 30 ) not fall into same trap , which seems toplague older readers , smug vague their approval his work ( i.e. imitating what they think he like rather than what he poet . ) like allen ginsberg sylvia plath , different ways , i suppose , we need establish new critical basis discussing his work , which falls outside conventional opinions prejudices day . this may only say , ashbery become part canon american poetry ( this hardly denied) -- raises him higher plateau than those poets we see simply contemporaries ; it doesn't make him boring stiff . we enjoy unconventional ideas this most surprising poets ? example , much i admire self-portrait convex mirror book individual poem ; i acknowledge it masterpiece ... i nonetheless don't find it entertaining touching , ultimately , books included selected poems such some trees houseboat days wave . tennis court oath , which represented breakthrough both ashbery poetry , contains some his most beautiful , rapturous work , like quot ; how long i able inhabit divine sepulcher ... quot ; i don't think he wrote freely again , such musical emotional pull , until later flow chart , which sometimes similar even extact detail . bees , instance : quot ; probably always haunted beequot ; quot ; polluted any case bees . quot ; love main theme , after all , ashbery entire oeuvre . somebody once said me his poems like whiff perfume . it true , best sense . because they lovely contain sort romanticism eroticism one remembers them fondly . he may , i believe pauline kael wrote filmmaker max ophuls , quot ; nostalgia present . quot ; although he sometimes risks becoming objectionable purist himself -- he appear too fussy argumentative it own sake , or even rude , times -- he mostly kind , fair balanced , funny though he undeniably . who doesn't like poet like , or understand him ? even if one very different aesthetic , it intoxicating or even comforting voice listen . selected poems good place start , but then , if you chance , read whole volumes , what come after . you'll chance , because they ought around forever	1
like du maurier rebecca or tolkien sauron , julius caesar play which bears his name less focal presence than force largely off-stage which provokes choices actions more evident characters . caesar put several brief appearances during first three acts , but it marcus brutus whose nobility , naivete , seduction , treachery , rationalization , ultimate downfall make up overarching plot . shakespeare here avoids taking sides , however , so provides us shrewd study diverse motives attitudes always precede insurrection , chaos inevitably follows . most arden series , this critical edition represents superior scholarship valuable reader assistance . its extensive footnotes should illumine most instances unfamiliar language or allusion , appendix provides relevant excerpts plutarch lives , which shakespeare consulted many his details . those new julius caesar , however , best advised begin text play itself ( volume central section ) , saving so-called ' introduction ' until afterwards ; daniell excellent discussion relies heavily citations play content , his insights apt lost reader who , yet , little or no frame reference . it should noted , too , arden shakespeare editions best suited serious students amateurs already acquainted bard aspiring more advanced appreciation . come late field myself , i mean no condescension suggesting someone just setting out may find wealth material here bit overwhelming . potential rewards shakespearean discovery incalculable , it always tragic when worthy ambition burns itself out , want patience , attempting too much too soon . i began more modest editions , such signet classics or pelican , which i found very accessible sufficiently annotated provide help i then needed . arden , which issuing revising its series since 1899 , still around when one ready it .	1
it likely neither ha jin nor his publisher ever expected his novel , war trash , become best seller or anything . it , after all , story chinese prisoners-of-war american prison camps south korea during korean war . not exactly kind thing most people think first thing morning . but if goal good novel entertain inform , then this one passes flying colors . it narrated first person yu yuan , one few captured chinese education one fewer still who able speak smattering english . though not communist , he nevertheless associated them because he knew it his only hope return mainland china , where both his ailing mother fiancee resided . if he side nationalists , he would repatriated taiwan , never hope visiting mainland china again . ( this , way , very interesting . many chinese looked upon their prisoner status way which escape newly formed communist government mainland china . ) , it turns out , it great conflict novel . both nationalist communist forces struggled mightily each other hearts minds those unallied prisoners , often most brutal fashion . one education one who spoke english , narrator himself considered prize , therefore received great deal attention both sides . indeed , after knocked unconscious one night , words , " *** communism , " tattooed bold fashion across his belly nationalists , who assumed he would no choice but side them . this , it turns out , rather common tactic . but narrator refused side them -- although occasionally pretending so out fear or self-preservation -- instead staying allied his communist protectors only so he could return his girlfriend mother . this plot . both his his fellow prisoner struggle survival prison , unwavering behind-the-barbed-wire war nationalists communists narrator fulcrum point , what comprise bulk novel . it should come no surprise anyone who any knowledge history all learn narrator ultimate repatriation mainland china bitterly disappointing . though not communist , he still traitor , you see , allowing himself captured . he found his mother died , his girlfriend could not afford associate him any more , he " disgraced captive . " narrator assigned middle-school hinterlands teacher remainder his career , sentence not nearly so dreary those given true communists he associated camps . no , this book not bestseller , but it nevertheless important book book needs read americans , many whom seem utterly unaware dangers posed unwavering , tyrannical political ideologies , horrors inflicted mankind because them .	1

there much like much useful bock commentary gospel luke . bock obviously his homework . one feature his commentary first rate when he approaches difficulties text or areas where scholars disagree , bock provides lists alternative explanations , who advocates them , his view their respective strengths weaknesses . if bock not see clear winner , he candid it . bock practice providing clear explanation different approaches text or problems history or sources extends excellent series " excursuses " end book . topics covered include census quirinius , sources synoptic relationships , genealogies matthew luke , discussions son man sayings . each section well written provides reader clear picture possible conclusions . bock more emphatic his own conclusions some sections than others . this section greatly enhances his commentary . feature distinguishes this book other commentaries luke its focus sources historicity . bock spends more time these issues , obviously linked his mind , than most other commentaries . he also highlights discussions their own sections . though they well written , degree satisfaction i felt after reading each one varied . some left me wanting much more discussion . i realize there space limitations gospel-specific commentaries , but sometimes felt bock bitten off more than he could chew . not he could not handle issues informed manner , but he simply insufficient space so . introduction well written , but not spend much time issues like authorship dating than i would liked . i am sure bock more offer those issues . instead , introduction spends more time dealing specific topics lucan text , such jerusalem : innocent one slain raised , faith dependence , prayer . most commentaries introduce reader some gospel authors theology focus , but i thought some these discussions would better served special notes within general discussion text , or more excursuses end . this simply organizational preference mine . sections well written . finally , i one other organizational criticism . he usually begins his discussion particular set passage overview his opinions passages . then he discusses " source history " , includes examination structure outline passage . only then he actually repeat text full section " exegesis exposition . " bock then includes summary additional notes . placing actual text middle discussion seemed odd me bugged me throughout . again , this just organizational , ergonomic , preference mine . actual discussions good . i simply believe they could enhanced different organization . overall , though i my organizational quibbles , valuable commentary exposes reader many different perspectives potential solutions problematic passages luke .	1

this third book " liveship traders " trilogy , following " ship magic " " mad ship . " all divergent storylines two prior books ( e.g. , chaos bingtown , dragons seeking their destiny , althea seeking her family liveship while figuring out she love , wintrow coming-of-age , redemption paragon , kennit attempt become king pirate isles , malta search love ) finally weave together . these story-lines converge like different streams water going down funnel , spinning coming together ever-increasing speed . why i gave this book it four stars : characters not only three-dimensional , but also evolve . kennit , paragon , malta dramatically different end story , compared who they when " ship magic " introduced them . pace this book slightly quicker than its two predecessors . magic involved these books not magic harry potter j.k. rowling , bartimaeus trilogy jonathon stroud , or most fantasy books , although it some kinship themes " eragon " christopher paolini . it more subtle more complex than magic any those books . , complex life-cycle history dragons ms. hobb books , work art . oh , mysterious character amber treasure , especially if one also reads farseer tawny man trilogies . why i not give it fifth star : while pace quicker than two prior books , it still its slower spots , there still some unnecessary detail . most all , though , i could not give it fifth star because this book , entire trilogy , fell just short standard set ms. hobb farseer trilogy tawny man trilogy . this book , trilogy it concludes , very , very good . but , farseer trilogy tawny man trilogy even better . treat yourself , read them all , starting farseer books ( " assassin apprentice , " " royal assassin , " " assassin quest " )	1

this book , ' critique judgement ' , third volume immanuel kant critique project , which began ' critique pure reason ' continued ' critique practical reason ' . immanuel kant ( 1724-1804 ) considered one giants philosophy , his age or any other . it largely this book provides foundation this assessment . whether one loves kant or hates him ( philosophically , ) , one cannot really ignore him ; even when one isn't directly dealing kantian ideas , chances great kant made impact . kant professor philosophy german city konigsberg , where he spent his entire life career . kant very organised clockwork life - his habits so regular it considered people konigsberg could set their clocks his walks . same regularity part his publication history , until 1770 , when kant ten-year hiatus publishing . this largely because he working this book , ' critique pure reason ' . kant professor philosophy familiar rationalists , such descartes , who founded enlightenment many ways started phenomenon modern philosophy . he also familiar empiricist school ( john locke david hume perhaps best known names this ) , which challenged rationalist framework . leibniz ' monads hume development empiricism its logical ( self-destructive ) conclusion , coupled romantic ideals typified rousseau , philosophical edifice enlightenment seemed topple . this book divided into two major sections , critique aesthetic judgement , critique teleological judgement . part aesthetics , kant sets up possible judgements - agreeable , good , sublime beautiful . this relates back ' critique pure reason ' ( scholar j.h. bernard indicates this framework sometimes bit shackle placed kant ) . those things agreeable wholly sensory character , whereas those things good ethical nature . kant argues those things beautiful sublime fall two poles ' agreeable ' ' good ' . beauty involved purpose ( teleology ) , whereas sublimity which goes beyond comprehension ( object fear ) . this also involves idea mind allows genius creative activity . section teleology , this way looking things based their ends ( telos ) , links aesthetics terms beauty ( which sense finality form ) well links scientific purposes - kant particularly concerned explore biology telos natural world . this also involves physics logical principles , bringing kant full circle back some ideas ' critique pure reason ' . this one kant master works , while there much modern philosophers disagree , there also sense which no subsequent philosophy ignore developments implications kant critique project .	1

clearly , proust remarkable gift perception , if he able see human experience , circumstance , even plain objects , exploded detail , distill them reader . particularly first third parts book , he frequently drops gems absolute truth , much same way shakespearean couplets remarkably capture essence love or revenge . me , this reward reading book , what makes challenge worth undertaking . first , you may overwhelmed his very complex sentences , others noted . it important proust express entire thought one sentence ; lofty objective sometimes dire consequences , but proust adheres it admirably . you soon learn maintain subject sentence your head while proust explores two or three tangents original thought before he comes back it . what works reader favor proust very regular his sentence structure , so once you develop feel it , it ceases intimidate . book divided into three parts : first third parts recount experiences proust early childhood , while second part details love affair charles swann . me , first part most beautiful , followed third part . you able tell within first 50 or so pages whether or not proust suit you . second part book becomes plodding monotonous , proust narrates even simple set circumstances many layers redundancy , each recounted exhaustive detail , his complex style which begins feel formulaic , wordy , indulgent . here subject sentence , tangent number one , tangent tangent number one , tangent number two , then it ends yet metaphor invalids . regularity sentence structure much easier tolerate first third parts because proust flits several ideas or subjects , whereas second part , he drills very core earth one or two subjects few variations . i found myself feeling pretty burned out , counting down pages end part 2 . my advice pick up your reading speed if it starts become boring or if you lose your concentration . if proust not quite so overly thorough part 2 , or if he varied his cadence or sentence structure bit more , i could recommend this book without hesitation . it , it require unusual investment concentration patience , but i believe it worth it	1

shakespeare scholar , i read countless books my favorite writer . two books stand out best : john dover wilson quot ; what happens hamlet ? quot ; caroline spurgeon quot;shakespeare imagery . quot ; if i could only keep two shakespeare books my library , i would choose these . dr. spurgeon spent ten years sifting through entire shakespeare canon pulling out every metaphor simile she could find . then , she organized them into like groups . this offered her , us through her writing , insight into shakespeare creative genius . evidence hand , dr. spurgeon explored how shakepeare mind actually worked ; she uncovered his patterns creative thinking . his abundant use garden household images his relatively few uses classical or scholarly images show us writer more touch real everyday world . his childhood homelife , images one tends carry throughout one life , become crystal clear when set side side this fashion . spurgeon book , we clearly see works shakespeare written shakespeare , who born small town stratford , not works university trained dramatist or member queen elizabeth court . it fascinating see shakespeare images compared contrasted those marlowe , dekker , johnson . each writer thought created images unique manner . seeing understanding differences , expertly explained dr. spurgeon , gives one deeper insight into appreciation one greatest minds all time . if you love shakespeare then not miss reading this book	1
best military history i've ever read believe me i've read lot ' em .... explodes lots myths ( some intentional us navy ) much stuff wasn't declassified until late 80 . i think they ( us navy ) embarassed this book explains why . very little opinion it all thoroughly documented foot-noted . it reads like novel , mostly german british viewpoints . i couldn't put it down . there definitely severe criticism u.s. navy actions during 1942 before , but author gannon gives sound reasons coming his conclusions . one may argue details , but 3,997 ships sunk atlantic enough testimony something went haywire . gannon refuses gloss over mistakes made all sides conflict just lays out all facts . admiral king , gannon references excerpt general eisenhower 1942 wartime journal said quickest way end war atlantic " shoot admiral king .

" " dreadful stasi " which read this book , seems me miss key points value this book . yes , book inevitably light some personal failings but given heavy volume many western intelligence chiefs self serving tomes lines " i fought side right " , this one read much better warts all history . given his limited access old records ( reasons well stated story ) , his overall coverage what he ( both good bad ) not unstinting collpase later western german legal case against him shows how misplaced many those perspectives . what very clear wolf unique product his time . result his parents left wing political leanings he forced teenager into pre-ww ii exile stalinist moscow , which gave him great understanding dealing russians post 1945 . committed socialist he see faults eastern germany accepts his personal responsibility much what happened but also clear what he not or could not eaily influence e.g. harbouring terrorists wide domestic repression stasi hated . finally jew post war germany under control mielke , east german equivalent beria , one left amazed what successes he achieve foreign espionage very limited resources . book not mea culpa many feel it should , but it provide focus way many western intelligence books not what real value all they achieved how intelligence used plus very honest analysis why stasi all their reputation only ever successful against western germany nato ( exploiting german connection ) . one fact left feeling end real failing western intelligence organisations ( esp . western germany ) inability understand how weak eastern germany economically different policies could worked bringing its early downfall . one side point nowhere book best known reason wolf infamous stated - basis karla character john le carre smiley novels	1

twisted selection short stories thriller writer jeffrey deaver . deaver points out intro one advantage short stories you alter ending or characters make story little darker or depressing than novel . since reader only invests few minutes into short story , they don't expect happy or tidy ending . all stories this collection suspensful involve twist some sort . services rendered triangle probably two best . they stand out because twist . all stories similar they only involve few characters . so when story goes one direction , you correct assuming twist involve story going other direction end . this book easy read may perhaps persuade me pick up jeffrey deaver novel . i'm all twists turns , but some reason not enjoy empty chair . i haven't read any more deaver since . i don't know if its worth paying money short story collection . but if you deaver fan , or suspense fan , i'm sure you'll enjoy this collection stories .	1

i listen dr. dean time time i really enjoy listening him . i thoroughly enjoyed reading his book well . first all , you need realize dr. dean not practicing physician . ( he doesn't see patients or perform procedures diagnoses ) however , he claims spend lot time reading research studies , something many busy physicians may not time . so , sense he different kind experience - knowledge gained study , not first-hand experience . this good because it different view what your doctor may . this book , dr dean challenges many myths we what it means " healthy " . one opinion he shares his readers little overweight may not such bad thing . fact , it gives body some reserves case illness . this goes so contrary what we usually hear , but it really makes you think . he also challenges number myths we hear such " exercise increases your appetite actually makes you gain weight " . he explains why these aren't true . dr. dean also touches one my personal favorite myths - germophobia . some our ideas where germs hide how prevent getting sick aren't always correct . example , place your home most germs not your bathroom - it your kitchen . if you read this book , you may not so excited get hotel room jetted tub next time . most valuable thing this book it makes you think . media loves hype up health concerns - " ebola virus spread kill us all ?

book concisely uses gardens aesthetic terms vehicles better understand both . keane insight into changes aesthetic focus different historical periods clearly constructed . it enhances reader insight into further studies japanese aesthetics , gardening or history . readers makoto ueda , sen'ichi hisamatsu et al . japanese aesthetics particularly rewarded simple structure considering complex terms they expose more detail . garden book , it rates quot ; 9quot ; ... introduction japanese aesthetics , it clearly quot ; 10quot ; ... unique perspective japanese history , it stands alone . while others said most what keene notes , none integrated it so well . beauty garden book , aside its text , exceptional . one could only wish pictures larger format	1
black woman i enjoyed reading this insight into how people see black men how they see themselves . there not enough positive role models form black fathers young black men look up . there very strong critical element black families could sometimes make me cringe child growing up . you felt if you constantly explain yourself walking egg shells not positive encouraging comment sight . my step-father very negative never really showed much consistent interest anything you interested or wanted achieve . thinking umpteen reasons why it could go wrong or couldn't . not very tactile or loving man either . always busy workaholic casting very controlling element over whole family . this made you feel if you worth nothing could achieve nothing . these days i hate see this rap culture baseball caps turned backwards this loping walk looks like they've got limp . or worst thing i hate see tracksuit bottoms pulled down so you see their underwear !! i find this sloppy despicable close indecent exposure . also you walk past black person not even recognition form smile or friendly hello . this very bad , so i recently made decision make effort make eye contact smile or say hello . it up black people read more their own history culture . we should know all black inventors people who played their important parts history . we should know names african peoples areas map africa they occupied . we should know african jamaican proverbs stories etc . not latest rap artist their explicit lyrics track they've recently cut !! we should also know ins outs slavery . i don't care if no other race recognises us important present tense or what our ancestors through . quite frankly what new ? it us recognise bring memory . black children , both male female need more positive role models within their own families . black parents relatives need stop so apathetic teaching black children their culture backgrounds . charity begins home not just form good manners .	1
loved book . i purchased it book i would use university course-assigned " book report " art studio : small metal construction ii . i chose present information book contents class then offered review it resource book small metal artists . ten penland school instructors featured masters techniques they present . they offer detailed information how they came their favored approaches , what influenced them their artistic direction , include lots insider advice modifications adaptation techniques . i admit i don't always read text art books , but these entries very inspiring . step step pictoral " hands " sections one application each artist technique give kind detail hard come most art books ( e.g. , 25 steps -- student learning small metals , this reality based if you want final result looks wonderful these artists ' end products) ! reader gets really good sense many things must considered applying technique skillfully . gallery sections which each artist asked colleagues they admire provide other examples give reader sense breadth application technique . end my book review after looking book themselves , several people class said they going buy it themselves . what wonderful book ! go penland	1

books leadership dime dozen these days , often they start blending together . however , john maxwell put together some great insights into leadership often taken granted or not well described . book starts solid question any leader ; " am i raising up potential leaders ? " . what makes this focus important fact too often leaders focus leading results , not future leadership . important distinction . aspect book looks ripple effects leaders . true leaders able attract potential leaders because ; leaders think like them ; leaders express feelings other leader sense ; leaders create environment attracts potential leaders ; leaders not threatened people great potential . author lays out what happens when strong leaders not selected . they turn hire people less leadership skills than they , so . organization whole suffers result this domino effect . leaders who mentor potential leaders multiply their effectiveness . while this sounds simple , it rare . " there no success without successor " ( page 11 ) . leaders take others them , or they not true leaders but mere managers . delegation most powerful tool leader . ( page 159 ) however , if delegation so important then why some leaders fail delegate effectively ? some ideas postulated here ; insecurity ; lack confidence others ; lack ability train others ; lack time ; etc . my experience most common these aspects lack confidence , many so called leaders never take final step " giving complete authority " others . this derails success future potential . i find this most common weakness leaders corporate america , who turn should not considered leaders , but rather just people higher titles . overall , this very good book . author asserts leadership both combination tactical choices personal character , latter more important . great book , easy read , some assessments other tools included . this book benefit anyone who wants enable success their organization through leadership .	1
what it mean woman ? shields explores this question her book stone diaries . answer complex , simple , enlightening , ignorant , thoughtful , thoughtless . we ultimately find there no simple answer . we love our roles women , we also despise sometimes social burdens placed upon us . life sometimes very profound . sometimes it very meaningless . very seldom narration our lives , however , reflect importance - or even accuracy - who we really . this make our lives any less signicant ? or perhaps there significance how we interpret our life , how we struggle make our life meaningful . whether if falls short what we consider ideal , end , we learn , whole our lives sum its many , many parts . i give this book only 4 stars , because i read shield other book unless , which far surpasses this one . there times when i not quite sure where book going , after while i became irritated main character . yet , i knowingly recognize this mirror reflection how i perceive my own life . very well	1

like alison lurie first novel , " love friendship " , her second deals marital disharmony among members america academic community . whereas earlier book , however , set wintry new england , " nowhere city " takes place sunny california . paul cattleman , young university historian , accepts job big corporation based los angeles write company history . one major themes book cultural differences america east west coasts . paul his wife katherine both easterners , she upper-class new england family . first they react their change scene very different ways . paul loves los angeles its sunny climate its relaxed lifestyle . katherine , other hand , hates city . this partly because atmospheric pollution aggravates her allergies , but mostly because she regards it cultural wasteland , " nowhere city " book title . los angeles , her , appears no sense history , place living " eternal dizzying present " , where differences seasons , even day night , less distinct than they north-east . differences couple create tensions within their marriage . paul begins affair young waitress named ceci gets drawn into her circle unconventional friends living venice beach , time centre beatnik community . ( book set early sixties ) . this leads into theme book , way which california became americans second half twentieth century what america general europeans earlier generations- frontier , place refuge those dissatisfied one reason or life home seeking better life elsewhere . los angeles area therefore natural magnet beatnik hippie movements . ( this idea california " last resort " also theme eagles ' song name ; it interesting lurie later borrowed title one her own novels , although book set florida rather than california ) . katherine , seeking something which occupy herself , finds work secretary university california , where she too begins affair her boss , academic psychiatrist who estranged husband glamorous hollywood starlet named glory green . this leads complex emotional entanglement . paul affair ceci comes end ; she knows full well he married , but cannot accept idea he still sexual relations his wife . paul then seduced glory , who seeking revenge against her husband . eventually , paul finds himself falling out love california lifestyle , especially after company refuse publish his history which shows them too harsh light , decides move back east take up teaching job prestigious new england college , decision which provokes ironic role-reversal book ending . i can't agree earlier reviewer who said you begin book hating katherine sympathizing paul . my sympathies katherine throughout . paul selfish character who always put his own needs before those his wife ; he bullies her into moving california , ceci no means his first extra-marital affair . it seemed me book written subtly feminist viewpoint interpreted story how katherine learns stand up , say no , her self-centred husband . normal lurie work , tone book , despite some serious themes , relatively light , plenty satirical humour aimed characters ' pretensions . big nutting corporation like social kudos harvard-educated historian their payroll , but not like it when he tells them some truths they not want hear . dr einsam psychiatrist so busy analysing life he unable experience it . glory film industry types who surround her shown up shallow , vain insincere . ( satire hollywood sixties reminded me joan didion " play it it lays " , although book darker more serious tone ) . beatniks childish , more economically dependent than they like think " square " society they despise . although they see society intolerant narrow-minded , same could said their own system values its " them us " mentality . times i found some this satire somewhat unfair . beatnik hippie movements may their hypocritical side , but least their unconventionality idealism force middle america ask itself some difficult questions it might preferred avoid . there really no unpretentious or sincere people working entertainment industry ? nevertheless , satirist role not fair-minded ; satire strains see both sides every question nails its colours firmly fence hardly worthy name . theme cultural differences east coast west coast america perhaps less interesting me , englishman , than it would american readership . ( it always struck me , anyway , two coasts more common each other than either america interior heartland ) . although this not my favourite alison lurie book ( i prefer some her later books such " real people " " truth lorin jones " which greater depth insight ) , " nowhere city " certainly enjoyable read	1

this book describes few simple techniques dealing difficult questions audience after formal business presentation , or journalists after press conference . particular , author explains how control interaction questioners , formulate answers less likely perceived audience contentious or evasive , how forcefully get one message across part answer . techniques themselves could described 4 or 5 pages . nevertheless author manages put together whole book - firstly analogizing them martial arts , then providing detailed examples last 40 years presidential debates . this works out very well indeed , reader left thorough understanding mechanics involved handling these situations - based both concepts debate examples described . after finishing book i really felt i coming away something tangible could utilized my advantage variety situations - both professional personal .	1

prose author delightful : it originally published 1930 when better authors genteel but sophisticated style . author original intention set forth theory metaphor distinguishing analyzing , title says , seven forms ( linguistic ) ambiguity . he draws examples which he exercizes his probative skill mostly great writers english language . but those schooled after , say , 1950s it wonderful exhortation read , speak write more subtelty than usually encountered . corollary case he makes ambiguity -- carefully crafted ambiguity , not ambiguity slothful kind -- very powerful , but it presupposes precision reading writing which precondition well-crafted metaphor . such it stands our generations exhortation lingusitic sophistication implicit disproof quot ; libertyquot ; goes hand hand slovenliness . it certainly make better readers out those who go through his book	1

history english language , special emphasis dialect forms . much book deals early history english . this interesting topic , but unfortunately crystal account distinctly slow going , larger picture often lost details . there relatively little origins , structures , or differences recent british dialects .

i read whole ender series , but strange sequence which may affected way i view different books series . first book i read shadow hegemon , thanks tourist left it library hotel skiathos island . this book got me hooked , but it confused me also i didn't know if i should start reading next books or previous ones . general pattern whole series : beginning book ender game . then we two subcategories , one shadow series ( which , exception first book , take place earth more within military strategy ) one ender series ( which take place space more into new sci-fi ideas ) . shadow series probably read everyone , while i guess ender series ( especially speaker dead onwards ) would read mainly sci-fi fans . below my comments books series , order i read them marking ( 10 highest mark ): shadow hegemon : first book i read , which i could not leave my hands . i finished it 2 days . it fast paced action , very smart plot after reading it i believed orson scot card ( osc ) invented/re-invented new genre literature . military strategy adventure combined brilliance/mind games hidden portions romance . such books always existed but this seemed book . it like way dan brown re-invented books trivials puzzles , together fast paced adventure . i strongly recommend it everybody likes such type books . ( mark : 10)shadow puppets : sequel above . i found it interesting but somehow boring above story developed little focus characters ( maybe too much focus so it seemed me it slightly mumbling jumbling . strategy , brilliance adventure seemed very low here . i would not recommend it anybody read it isolate , unfortunately you read it if you want go next book . i really believe osc made mistake here ( deliberately or not ) this book should told 50-60 pages included previous or next book . ( mark : 6 but you read it because you want read shadow giant)shadow giant : ( see below)ender game : really great book read , probably best series , however , i read its sequels first , when i reached 80% this book , i predicted end . however , it highest standards sci-fi , military strategy , adventure , brilliant mind games very good depth human aspect characters . comparison shadow series , it more " space " sci-fi , while shadow series much lesser sci-fi elements more down earth . ( mark : 10)speaker dead : great book , but different style . less adventure , more human aspect , more maturity . brilliance yes , but not military , sci-fi yes ( some great ideas ) but not spaceship style . ( mark : 9)xenocide : good sequel previous novel . certain points more brilliant , other sections more boring , however again very good sci-fi book . only flaw these series ( speker dead , xenocide , children mind ) idea behind one alien species described which i found outrageously extreme , however if you ignore it becomes first class reading . ( mark : 9)children mind : i think osc wrapped up his case pretty badly one . it fair book except fact i felt osc mumbles jumbles one third novel not decided how end it . other critiques i found it described nice approach moral dilemmas , however , moral dilemma when you describe it once make your choice , while here dilemma repeated repeated ... i felt like i watching movie worth 10 oscars end not worth included even cheap video movie . again , many open ends end ( possible sequels ) . ( mark : 7 but you read it you hooked previous ones ) . ender shadow : read enders game shadow hegemon , i found this book probably best series , which course my subjective preference . i could characterize it probably best book i read ever ! not repeat myself , it all shadow hegemon ender game , even more ... ( mark : absolute 10 ) . shadow giant : when i read shadow puppets , i said , " that it , osc lost either his talent or his appetite good writing ... " , so i pretty unwilling read it . fortunately i decided , it proved good one , i believe osc nicely wrapped up his story , two small flaws . * one described below ( its end needed slightly more complete ) , * other fact although he describes certain smart battles , he not focus enough them it seems he hurry wrap all things up . it all elements become masterpiece but it ended up good read book ( mark : 9)in general , both series three categories good stuff : 1 ) some great sci-fi ideas ( battle room , battle games , fantasy game , ansible , aia , jane , in/out travel , raman varelse etc)2 ) great military strategy , mind games etc combined adventure3 ) certain books , depth characters , moral dilemmas etcand two main bad stuff : 1 ) mumbling jumbling certain books which completely unnecessary ( either osc wanted just produce sell title - see shadow puppets- or he could not decide how story continue-see last book ender series ) . 2 ) one alien species described ender series so too outrageous even sci-fi made it look ridiculous . idea behind it brilliant sci-fi terms , but he could try different living organism ... finally , osc left open ends both series ( probably next sequels ) , however i believe there two things missing . ) story hive queen hegemon , told metaphorical manner so it means much humanity . ) ancient theatre , story should end way brings " katharsis " story , souls readers . i believe end shadow giant may smart commercial purposes but it very unfair reader it not bring full " katharsis " .	1

epic tale combining mystery fantasy , treason more than meets expectations--i'd even go so far say it one card best . although storylines completely different , card visits moral dilemmas familiar readers ender series : genocide acceptable tradeoff salvation entire planet ? sacrifice one individual justifiable greater good entire race ? ender game , card creates cold oppressive cage known battle school confine young ender . treason , card creates lush diverse world his protagonist lanik mueller explore his exile . whereas ender growth largely internal self-driven , mueller picks up extraordinary powers while walking earth , meeting new people learning new skills . lanik frequently forced ask himself deeper questions life , sacrifice , identity , all while understanding more he learns , more complex difficult his choices become . he starts novel alone freak ; saving his own skin almost more than he manage . he ends novel terrible powers responsibility comes them , forced choose best way save planet hurtling towards destruction death . unlike ender , he fully aware choice he must make , making his decision all more anguishing tragic . card takes many risks creating fantastic world reader must simply accept -- this tale belongs more realm fantasy than pure " science " fiction . yet risk pays off , making reading experience all more memorable . reader drawn nature protagonist grotesque transformation beauty world stretches imagination . mystery intrigue surrounding planet sudden power shifts keeps plot moving nicely , card creates strong believable cast characters breathe life into story , giving it center soul . finally , card leaves reader ponder lanik decision face nearly impossible choice , world characterized not black white but subtle shades grey . treason probably never garner attention ender game , but nevertheless it excellent thought-provoking story . this book hidden gem canon modern sf fantasy literature reward reader who takes time unearth it	1

since i took graduate seminar course women memoirs american literature , i read several books heilbrun . i not going specialize autobiography/memoirs or feminist theory , i read her more writer than scholar or theorist , focusing more how she says things than what . this regard , i enjoyed every book i read because her language something unique . it clear concise , without simple , authoratitive without pedantic , seemingly aloof yet strangely persuasive . if passion name talent , she very , very passionate , but passion moderated unique kind resignation ( or perhaps , wisdom ) . this book not my favorite , compared other titles such writing women lives , it indeed gets slow heavy here there . there parts where even those same line work heilbrun would go , " who cares ? " or " why bother ? " yet , largely , it accessible * fun * . read intellectual memoir , it story how heilbrun gratefully influenced three men , how she resisted embraced their influence , how she finally grew out it . there many interesting anecdotes coming her encounters these men ( barzun , fadiman , trilling ) her life graduate student 50s one most highly regarded universities us . students today would gasp nightmarish inconvinience only two copies their papers , painfully taking turns reading other student papers due lack copies . heilbrun devoted chapter diana trilling , which wasn't her plan when he planned book . she fascinated gained admiration her process research book , readers would clearly see why chapter her . sum , according heilbrun , diana trilling woman whose insights her life come largely feminism ( " most successful revolution our century , " trilling herself called it ) , yet who not herself feminist . she accepted life belittlements others , while penetrating understanding those belittlements . early book , heilbrun notes perhaps one most palpable influences she got lionel trilling would notion " tragedy what most marks us if we thinkers . " this what trilling shares freud , this what heilbrun shares trilling , despite her distrust freud , some extent , trilling well . this comment comes after anecdote trilling inspiring lecture henry james , which young heilbrun took idea " essence literature tensions thinking life . " this part book strangely moving , makes me think hard interplay among " tension , " " thinking life , " " tragedy , " " literature . " small not really ambitious book , but contains much fun insights .	1

just finished reading tragedy triumph where dr. loovas persuaded author tell her story , i find similarities sound miracle dr. bernard rimland coaxing this author , annabel stehli share her story . while reading these two books any parent child autism spectrum shocked learn what parents ahead us endured via professionals media based their incorrect perception autism . what i not agree promotional aspect these books , suggesting autism cured these kids overcome disability . sound miracle touted tribute mother courage , yet after reading same book , i feel mother failed daughter not gain proper insight into her autistic daughter georgie . there two parts sound miracle , auditory training not discussed first half book . not wanting criticize author too harshly i feel book delved more into her older daughter dotsie , who passed away leukemia , mother two marriages her own addictions religious beliefs . this could easily written into two or three books covering each topic depth . there gap many years when georgie graduated college author wrote book . maybe time she could see more clearly how georgie needed help right beginning . it obvious author not confident her parenting skills questioned herself throughout process raising children . author hard time cuddling receiving eye contact time georgie born 1965 , plus she knew there something odd her eyes , she low apgar score . there always seemed turmoil their apartment new york . her husband bill not very involved parenting aspects girls . early story annabel took girls away few weeks one summer vacation . during this time bill affair her best friend things went downhill drastically . bill not mentioned too often after , only briefly when dotsie died then when annabel wanted take georgie france . sound miracle upsetting me because after dotsie passed away georgie institutionalized many years . this started trial since there no alternative georgie . annabel intimidated staff institution believed them when they stated her lack parenting blame . one point she drinking taking many prescriptions , ended up committed herself . i found period time confusing because her mother siblings only involved intermittently . moment there i not want finish perusing this because i not sure which direction sound miracle headed found passing dotsie very sad . how parent time never heard dr. bernard rimland beyond me . it certainly seemed me author would not act her own parental instincts needed reassurance every move then it even took others persuade her remove georgie institution try auditory training dr. berard . while georgie institution her mother met married peter two more children . author actually pondered several times leaving georgie institution starting her own life her new husband children . she not devoted her daughter she wanted normal child her new son not risk her daughter coming home possibly hurting her baby . parent two children autism i learn great deal auditory aspects , but this due georgie sharing her personal experience not anything author shared parent . all those years georgie just assumed everyone saw heard things way she , but she crazy not able handle these issues same manner . one hand i truly disappointed first section book after reading suffering georgie endure due no one researching further her issues . i questioning author remarrying starting family when i felt she abandoned failed her daughter . most shocking part within book when institution contacted her ex husband , bill try persuade him keep her taking georgie out country . bill some relative look into dr switzerland agreed annabel this worth trying . it turned out otherwise i would very upset feel professionals should punished their wrong doing interference her life . i prefer books positive outlook autism not those base outcome miracle . although this one those some aspect , it still worthwhile read know firsthand what journey like others . but my children autistic what i gather always since i am not looking cure , but hope actually hear sound my child voice one these days . reader i cared dotsie georgie heartbroken over death one lost childhood other . i came away learning more trials tribulations this family know what avoid when pursuing therapies searching schools my children future reference	1

this book basically well-organized laundry list hoaxes . author arranges hoaxes logical categories based type deception involved . some , especially those further past , sound preposterous , but one must always account differences knowledge thought processes times past now . what most disturbing me fact some hoaxes sounded plausible ; it makes you wonder how many pieces knowledge we take granted might well-contrived hoaxes . conspiracy theorists take attitude extreme , seeing hoaxes everywhere . but hoaxes most prevalent when it hard get independent supporting data topic , which this book points out . instance , if white fellow turned up europe claimed taiwanese native , we would laugh him . but white fellow turn up europe several centuries ago , claiming native formosa ( taiwan former name ) . without additional information ( taiwanese asians ) , people europe unable quickly discount story	1

i've always looked upon " christian " fiction rather wary eye . it less subject matter than lesser quality these works ; it if publishers cynically assumed merely presenting something " christian " would enough guarantee certain level readership , no matter how poorly written book ( this often science fiction fantasy well ) . three ( or more properly , thr3e ) ted dekker little alter my view . ( why i read book ? because when i bought it ( dekker book ) , i didn't realize fully what i buying . ) three tells story kevin parson , seminary student who suffered strange , semi-abusive childhood . he gets phone call one day warning him unless he solves riddle within three minutes , his car explode . kevin doesn't solve riddle car blow up , but he escapes intac t.t hus begins cat-and-mouse game slater , who may or may not serial killer named riddle killer . slater believes kevin committed grave sin requires confession or death . kevin , his childhood friend samantha ( now state cop ) jennifer peters ( fbi agent ) try hunt down slater , but slater apparently too clever caught easily . there not much truly christian this book other than few religious lines ( never getting very preachy ) definitely pg-rated material : language gentle enough , romance chaste violence relatively bloodless . i'm fine all long story good , that not case here . it actually too bad , because dekker seems like decent enough plotter , but story relies plot twist one most annoying suspense fiction ; i won't say what it , but even dekker seems bit uncomfortable it , he spends lot time rationalizing it . addition , perpetrate this twist , he actively deceive ( not merely mislead ) reader , which cheat . addition , even though dekker good sense plot ( till end ) he able maintain fast , tense pace , he overall , just passable writer . i suppose technically his work proficient , but compared great names crime stories ( elmore leonard , michael connelly , lee child , etc . ) , dekker prose just flat . two-star rating , it not worst book out there , but it one avoid .	1

bloody bones continues anita blake series exploring anita " gifts " developing characters very well utilized later novels . while i give this novel four stars , i consider series total five star quality they get much better storylines become more complex . this novel emphasises her skills necromancer , ton vampire action ( introduces few new types supernatural creatures ) . also , it worthwhile note cover art , one may assume this novel would fall paranormal romance genre , but i not believe case ; instead i would more inclined classify this book action adventure touch noir . later books series however , shift bit include elements romance genre ( my mind , book six " killing dance " marks change tone series ) . even after genre shift however , books retain strong emphasis action macabre . bloody bones , it light , fast-paced all-in-all fun read	1

this book annoyed me . start my diatribe , there too many characters , each every one one whom seemed illogical , stupid , not all endearing . " paranormal " branch mounties ? i thought it supposed fantasy affecting real people this world , not fantasy affecting fantasy . one gets idea author tried explain what happening readers , but ended up explaining things characters instead which why one never believe it when characters disbelieving . i never believe it when characters anything , actually . i don't understand how anybody brains could function like . their thought processes just absurd . protaginist needs stop smoking , because she seems roll new cigarette every sentance she inhabits . hard-boiled investigator should take look what his girlfriend puts his dinner because he accepts unacceptable ( least hard-boiled investigator ) unblinking reserve . male lead needs stop speaking thinking (!) french because he not , eccentric millionaire uncle needs borrow some protaginist ciggarettes calm down . only character i liked even remotely biker art critic , but i think author trying little too hard clever when blue born . it also very confusing way plot jumps around goes backwards forwards thirty some characters ( all whom , i must mention again , really annoying ) . it makes it hard one keep one attention book , instead just going over one grocery list whilst staring page . looks like delint some time travelling too . you excuse him , he gets mixed up . all those quantum leaps . what all outdated profanity ? i mean , who says " lord lifting jesus ! " anyway ? i agree reviewer named bounci , those ... occurances not fit just made me want laugh ( or cry , seeing it doesn't stop entire book ) instead shocked . it credit , book very interesting story , lot interesting things happening . it good suspense ( when it doesn't ramble hopelessly ) sometimes exciting . it while away hours though , it keep you book while you plod through	1

inner temple first book series penczak writing beginners . they based classes he teaches live , take much different approach than standard 101 guides . first , there well-laid out structure these books i find extremely helpful . each book designed year-and-a-day study course . there few introductory chapters followed 12 lesson chapters . you spend roughly month each lesson ( some more complex take more time , but they balanced simpler lessons ) . this gives you time absorb material , complete exercises , some additional reading . second , penczak emphasizes importance strong foundation meditation , visualization , psychic development dedicating entire inner temple these practices . more complex lessons circle casting , ritual design , spells saved outer temple . i found this major improvement over standard 101 book includes both same book no clear indication how much time you should spend foundation exercises before trying ritual , or worse , skip foundation exercises entirely . i honestly wished i picked up this book first when i started my journey . penczak approach witchcraft emphatically eclectic . you see concepts practices many occult traditions here . there obvious new age influence his work come across " fluffy , " but i don't think it bad some reviewers thought . he emphasizes love his practice , i not see anything wrong . should he emphasized potential dangers some practices more ? perhaps . he includes cautions , but tries put them perspective peel away intimidating veneer created horror movies like . course takes you varied tour starting simple skills like basic meditation , affirmations , very simple magic , more complex practices like astral travel , working spirit guides , healing , past-life regression . style also very open non-dogmatic . penczak presents lots personal opinions theories , but they presented opinions theories , not holy writ . because this eclecticism , this book could used selectively course psychic development anyone open mind , not just people interested wicca or paganism . all all , while i could find quite bit this book argue , i think it deserves five star rating its usefulness presentation . i thank mr. penczak making his teaching available wider audience this way	1

i enjoyed first two books this trilogy . however , this third book needs some serious time intensive book surgery unit before it should even published . frankly , this manuscript should kicked back editor author refused . i realize that pretty heavy thing say , but it true . something went badly wrong here . author not his job bringing his protagonists closure ; two kids fall love , then decide live apart rest their lives complete crock . puhleaze . i grew rather like aeronaut texan explorer , they're killed little point . puhleaze . iorek bear darn cool , he barely ( sorry ) makes appearance book 3 . puhleaze . , way , who mary , introduced so late trilogy , underfunded dark matter physicist ( who just happens ... ex-nun ... now , just wait minute here , heavy handed or what ? ) ... dark matter would * under * funded ? puhleaze . ( although these days , she'd working global warming . ) mrs. coulter , lifetime full evil , suddenly turn heart ( yes , just like grinch ) , , her new fullsome goodness , helps kill angel . huh ? what ? say again ? i thrilled ( not ) pullman description endless , boring ...

" never give reader chance put down one your books , because if you , they , they'll never pick it up again . " . i zoomed non-stop through first two books this trilogy . last book took me week plus i extremely annoyed it . i amused philip pullman , his afterword , gives credit stealing his ideas ( those his words ) paradise lost ( john milton ) . frankly , i wish he stolen more , this book would better . his utter hatred church shines through this book . he sort idiot guide quantum mechanics but isn't up it . this mess needs storyboarded , everything not promote story needs chucked out . that half this book . whoever edited this book badly needs chewed out . i suspect , though , it boiled down " not enough time fix " publishing schedule ; del rey not noted publishing messes like this .	1

" bright forever , " unusual it both page-turner skillfully written piece fiction . author , lee martin , tells tale 9 year old girl , youngest member most well-to-do family small indiana town , disappearing while returning library books her bicycle . through four alternating narrators , lengthier connective third-person chapters , we agonizingly learn tragic circumstances what happened . jumping back forth days surrounding principle event , author successfully heightens tension dread narrators slowly reveal everything they know . principle characters their secrets guilt , most mixture good bad . boy relationship his ambitious father , lonely man ambiguous love little girl , teenager forced make choice she'll regret rest her life , older woman who comes painful realization her younger husband may not whom she thinks -- there just so much packed into this relatively short novel . martin also utilizes things like memories nature ( especially birds ) foreshadow parallel main story . perhaps all-encompassing theme how small , seemingly insignificant incidents seem so important when one looks back sees how they all contributed one life-altering event . i highly recommend " bright forever . " it certainly not feel-good book , but it well-written memorable page-turner	1
case " sky walking , " dr. thomas . jones , answer resounding " yes . " this book stands head shoulders above many other works former astronauts terms its story , style substance . immensely readable presented just right level detail , " sky walking " chronicles dr. jones ' spaceflight career , which spanned more than decade included four space shuttle flights . his description sights , sounds sensations his first launch aboard endeavour april 1994 mission sts-59 , which he mission specialist first space radar laboratory flight ( srl-1 ) , best i've ever read . he payload commander srl-2 mission ( sts-68 ) october 1994 , later flew two additional shuttle missions . sts-80 , addition setting shuttle endurance record 18 days orbit , involved satellite deployment retrieval . sts-98 , february 2001 , delivered installed destiny laboratory module international space station ( iss ) , mission which dr. jones made three spacewalks lasting more than 19 hours . " sky walking , " dr. jones describes all his missions detail , terms both " space geeks " casual readers find interesting informative . his narrative style refreshingly friendly accessible without simplistic . one thing i particularly noticed his skill covering highly technical issues related space shuttle -- most complicated machine ever built . example , he describes problem space shuttle main engine turbopump rotor tip seals such way casual reader understand issue , yet he supplies enough " meat " satisfy more technically inclined reader . he excellent job " balancing act " finding just right level " nasa-speak " entertain wide audience . highly recommended	1

this book not what it says it !! while title suggests it real sternberg williams book , reality , it thin " study guide " real book some clowns called " cram 101 " . i nothing against study guides general , but when book not identified such , i big problem . i shipped something i not expect , i then order real thing wait even longer it arrive . what worse , this book lousy study guide . it sparse collection glossary words each chapter . there no outline or even hint content each chapter , just list generically defined keywords someone thought important relevant chapter , roughly presented order appearance chapter . i needed study concepts real book somehow , so i took those keywords bunch ' net searches try learn topic . this approach didn't work . when i ordered then received real s+w book , i able compare content chapter glossary words , there some important omissions distortions . this book should banned - it waste paper " authors " should ashamed themselves . this " study guide " could cobbled together afternoon third rate college student . if i turned work shoddy one my teachers , i would surely get failing grade . amazon needs change their representation this book , since it suggests you getting somehow bargain priced version real thing . i honestly thought it closeout version , remainder , or other bargain priced book not some shabby attempt study guide real book . avoid this book like plague !	-1
this author unfortunatly gives christians bad name . not only he profess kjv bible only viable translation ( just read introduction ) but he also believes , " satan despised america her unique relationship king james bible ... " ( . 329 ) . i guess he doesn't understand preservation god word or understand greek , but i could wrong . basically my title states it best : stupid people believe anything , anyone who buys this book believes dr. grady truly winner . now i state there few truths dr. grady claims ( probably more than i am even willing admit ) , however structure his book very laughable his broad claims concerning kjv numerous scriputure verses taken out context ruin any chance believability . this book clearly falls under category christian conspiracy theory . i'll leave you one last quote this book summs up my feelings , " exaggerated masonic connection birth our republic led many well-intended conspiracy writers overreact , sometimes brink lunacy " ( . 330 ) . well least he knows how describe himself	-1
i think alot reviewers both sides here no business reviewing this book first place . let me explain this example : if you don't speak french you pick up book written french you probably recognize some words even understand few sentences based knowledge you might basic french because similarity many french words english words ( or whatever language(s ) you know ) . but you won't able completely understand book unless you sit down translate it . it would stupid proclaim book failure just because you don't understand language . same way , you might appreciate beauty french language think book sounds pretty even if you can't understand it , but this no reason claim book masterpiece . we might well consider finnegan wake book written different language we aren't fluent . book ( or any work art , matter ) isn't bad just because you work understand it . may make it frustrating but it doesn't make it bad . so , if you don't think it worth time effort use reading guides or whatever make sense this book , then you should just leave it alone instead going around acting like anything you say book any merit whatsoever . note , it completely absurd review this book just you would book stephen king - based how entertaining storyline or how realistic certain characters - simply because this not what book aiming first place . this would like judging mona lisa piece crap because you're big fan cave drawings showing chain events you didn't see what chain events mona lisa . you judge work based how well it succeeds what it trying , not how well it succeeds what everyone else it trying	1

love him or hate him , dfw prodigious talent . except disturbing " conversations hideous men " i found his previous material so hilariously , intelligently , on-target i willing overlook multitude stylistic transgressions ( chiefly , overly cutesy tone , gratuitous flaunting author erudition , footnote fetish ) . so i reasonably disposed like this book looking forward reading it . sadly , it turns out this case where dfw various idiosyncrasies combine produce book which fundamentally unreadable . normally , once i start book , i feel enormous guilt if i don't finish . no guilt here - just exasperation . one reasonably argue dfw enormous talent might justify certain peculiarities style , but every author needs discipline good editor . w.w. norton seems dispensed editors altogether , certainly sentient kind . pity , because somebody should explained dfw prefacing any section text title " soft-news interpolation , placed here ante rem because this last place it without disrupting juggernaut-like momentum pre-cantor mathematical context " not just completely unhelpful . it irritating distraction , sorry result inability this talented writer vanquish demons which continue plague his undisciplined style . unfortunately , this kind self-indulgent stylistic mannerism recurs infuriating frequncy . result , this book complete train wreck	-1

angela davis talks many different points her book prisons obsolete ? she tries convince audience current u.s. prison system not run adequately . davis questions united states system justice prison system currently houses over two million people throughout nation . her book , she argues prisons not solve crime over past twenty years prison boom not lowered crime rates across country , but intensified criminal behavior . injustices within current prison system , including institutionalized racism , gender inequalities , class segregation thoroughly explored this book . she also debates whether prison reform would enough or prison abolition necessary . this book great piece literature exposes readers little no knowledge prisons some cruel realities . book offers overview history prisons . davis takes example california , state which " landscape thoroughly prisonized over last twenty years " ( davis , 12 ) . this overview extremely important underline davis ' point prisons become ineffective rehabilitatory institutions . although , theoretically , main purpose prison rehabilitate criminals , economic factors well racist motives , quickly drove prison system emulate new way slavery . davis says : " segregation ruled south until it outlawed century after abolition slavery . many people who lived under jim crow could not envision legal system defined racial equality " ( davis , 23 ) . need cheap labor south incited spur legislations promoted incarceration many african americans possible after civil war . these prisoners , then , leased out resulting productive yet cheap laborers . davis touches base racism economic oppression issues chapter two her book . evidence help us understand causes which prisons started proliferate when official studies showed crime rate going down ( davis , 85 ) , professor davis uses fact " many corporations global markets , now rely prisons important source profit " ( davis , 85 ) . all data compiled chapter five davis ' book important explain how prison system embodied prison industrial complex manipulates inmates ' labor exchange economic gain . she attributes so-called " tough crime " legislation private prisons other corporations ' interests . although chapter five bombards reader communist idealism , communist mentality not necessary understand davis ' conclusions . even though not enough facts statistics given book regards problem system , book offers two chapters full first hand information gathered davis . nevertheless , book emphasis proposing prison abolition program should go hand hand prison reform movement ( davis , 9-10 ) . she voice many prison reformers who trying end violence sexual abuse prisons , provide prisoners education so their civil rights not stripped away , most importantly , work prisons part solution not cause problem . her last chapter , professor davis proposes , not so concrete ideas adopt completely different system or correction . this book weakest chapter since it too rhetorical lacks solid proposals . she implies amount knowledge work necessary make solid change fact not very achievable saying : " abolitionist approach seeks answer questions such these would require us imagine constellation alternative strategies institutions " ( davis107 ) , referring questions such " how we imagine society which punishment not based race class ? " (davis107 ) . nonetheless her ideology optimism opens many possibilities could fact effective substitutes incarceration . it all these reasons i recommend this book everyone who interested knowing hidden problems within current u.s. prison system ongoing racial segregation issues . this book makes us think whether or not prisons obsolete . davis thinks they .	1

this book excellent biography james monroe . read biographies several other founding fathers recently , i decided pick this one up well . it very thorough review our fifth president entire life . i found it well not focus monroe doctrine , showing him who he , not history remembers him , simply author doctrine . this book portrays james monroe hard working member republican party , who gradually rose through ranks become evident choice successor his friend fellow virginian , james madison . not because he charismatic or genius , but simply because he good man who served his party well , would not cause infighting amongst other members party . if you're looking learn more our early presidents , all means , pick up this book . but if you're looking book charismatic hero revolutionary era , it certainly isn't going james monroe	1
i throughly enjoyed scoop . it isn't this book some sort hallowed masterpiece nor one those brilliant , brutal satires summarizes absurd actuality particular state or belief . no , scoop just , quite simply , pure fun . story becomes rather obvious after while , but ' obvious ' not cliched or predictable manner , but keeping within consistant vein waugh narrative voice here . oh , sure , there some still relevent statements made regarding incompetence petty biases newspaper men their dictatorial bosses there clearly put case made how newspapers run wealthy industrialists who use their ownership media advance their own selfish agendas , but all this ultimately falls wayside we follow adventures boot , disinterested chronicler seemingly important events he finds himself unable even bother trying understand . this very good book , more like 4 half stars , rounded up , this rare instance , just because it made me laugh out loud more than few times . enjoy-	1

i'm surprised so many feel these cards not appropriate beginner . i suppose it depends reader objective . tarot provides answers querent questions but always positive somewhat elliptical manner . reader forced interpret insights broadest sense . it delivers answers within context how subject question fits into your general life path , interpretation complex abstract . gypsy witch deck supplies more concrete accurate answers ; it pragmatic states facts . this deck highly useful if reader desires yes/no answer or wishes provided timeframes . example , if you ask tarot your current relationship , it may reply relationship him/her important life lesson you , it happy relationship but you need ensure you don't lose your own identity . asking gypsy deck may return answer you receive proposal while vacation expect married within 11 months . this merely my opinion after years practice many would disagree my assessment . i especially like use this deck gain specific insights into other individuals ( optimal accuracy obtained if you know person birthday and/or sign ) . it also true gypsy witch cards mixture positive negative but then again isn't life ? additionally , don't feel obligated use traditional layout your readings . simple five card spreads adequate . both decks excellent tools if you find your energy or thoughts scattered ; both force reader focus . additionally , you'll find practice either deck increase your sensitivity ability empathize emotions those around you . never feel uncomfortable answers you receive , cartomancy merely allows you tap into information already contained your subconscious . there always some controversy surrounding gypsy witch cards regarding original deck , numbers deck person who created them . this information really doesn't matter since you develop your own personal intuitive rapport each card . personally , i can't see myself ever returning tarot cards since i found gypsy witch deck .	1

( writing bad review one book even earned me nasty email author !! lol)but i digress . this book incredible . it well thought out planned . it completely linear - it only deviated timeline introduction book . black approached writing this book one would academic research paper . he researched , researched , researched , his works sited he gave all credits where it rightly due . i found out much i didn't know r.e.m. early days . great thing this book it really recent , it goes up right before around sun came out , addresses . . .

hi , my name cara i am almost finished book heart chief . my rating this book 4 stars . i learned indians this book . some things i learned this book most indians today live reservations , go school drive cars . chris like me ways not like me ways . he not like me because he indian he wears indian clothes shoes . he like me because he human he goes school friends . my favorite part when chris his friends burn surveyors flags . i like part because it shows chris cares loves his island . my favorite excerpt page 24- " we kinds indians know hope rhymes nope .

crick claims investigating consciousness through visual system because he believes visual system more amenable scientific investigation . those who not appreciate this tactic , he sniffily claims , not understand how science operates . it should clear why it often necessary study what experimented first , but this no way validates this particular strategy . crick approach lot like trying understand mechanics car engine studying its wheels . yes , there connection , yes , wheels lot more accessible ( especially if you haven't yet figured out how open hood ) . but you won't necessarily learn very much how engine actually works . closely connected this difficulty his refusal countenance very question what consciousness actually . course , not doing so makes his investigation visual perception `mode ' consciousness much more plausible . if one explicitly refuses define what under investigation , then investigating almost any related phenomena . unfortunately , this mindset not actually serve advance enterprise very far . crick uses glib analogy battle : war , he notes , one not get far trying define what battle when what needed troops strategy . it should go without saying this analogy so deeply flawed useless , except its intended rhetorical purpose . there no need define battle because clearly understood all out outset ; same hardly said consciousness . if one not know what battle objective , fighting it well becomes lot harder . unfortunate plight this book . more specific , it seems relatively apparent whatever else we say consciousness , it involves essentially subjective dimension . crick makes no mention this , except dismiss it something perhaps considered much later . conversely , it far apparent consciousness must involve visual awareness inherently . where this leave blind persons , one might ask ? they not fully conscious ? today we close developing sighted machines , which process navigate three-dimensional environments using lasers or stereoscopic video cameras ( e.g. , darpa challenge ) . these machines therefore approaching consciousness ? this seems patently absurd . book whole reeks lack erudition beyond narrow scientific training . we treated freshman physiology lessons neurons , brain areas basic visual processing , details which both not deep enough real scientific comprehension far more detailed than necessary advancing concepts discussed . times , it reads like undergraduate report which student eager impress not let single fact they uncovered go unreported - no matter if they actually enlighten stated aims or not . sum , most problems this book could fixed single simple but profound change : change title " primer vertebrate visual physiology " , circa 1995 . it probably would not sold many copies way , though .	1
i thought this okay book . it definitely not one my favorites , i wouldn't really recommend it . there some things i liked it some things i didn't like it . one reason i didn't like it because opening scene , main character ( rory ) outside watching her dad cut down tree their yard she talking how great tree . when i first started reading it , i like " okay , she must really like tree , " but after 20 pages her talking this tree , you get annoyed don't want read it anymore . only reason i kept reading it because it school it incredibly easy read so i kept reading . i also didn't like it because i didn't think author described things book too well . when i read book i like know what each character looks like but this story she really didn't give much what people environment like . i also didn't like how they kept talking drawing how draw everything , so got kind boring . so i finished book . it didn't get much better . but there some things i kind liked it . most book , i could really relate what rory going through . i think most girls friend they start lose , most teenage girls off-and-on relationship her parents , so that why i kept reading . way author girls act around boys teachers their parents very realistic so i think anybody reading it knows exactly what characters book going through . i think teenage girls who love draw would like this book .	1

i enjoyed this book immensely now look forward reading more holzer this period . it answered so many questions i messy circumstances surrounding slavery formation country . what i always thought such hypocrisy , i now understand it , incredible lesson human tension reality ideals -- such christian tension so true life , such grand significant scale . rather than merely acknowledging " stain " , indeed it , focus today should triumph overcoming it . his highly detailed telling , holzer over over exposes linclon myths surrounding event , themselves so revealing human tendencies . while deflating so many these myths , doing he so much explain likely origins -- often humourous , sometimes self serving , but always understandable enriching his story . not just myths . one i found particularly poignant repeated occasion son robert who exeter time speech . while it only 4 months since they seen each other , visit robert one lincoln excuses taking time incurring expense going east speak . lincoln ultimately made 10 subsequent stops speak new england his return trip exeter before heading home . while these speeches laid foundation his calculating father ultimate nomination election , robert steadfastly maintained purpose trip see him . i found very touching -- it one thing father your country , but still so your son . heart it all speech itself eager ears , eventually eyes , which took it . while lincoln personality factor , power his words what carried he day . i found this revealing tonic today politics -- altogether different america then . this democracy its best . there clearly , me least , no ideal political system , all manipulated . now hamas victors palestine , i guess even current administration might thinking this . i could go , but won't other than quote following recollection attributed lincoln which might best read thought current schooling mind : i remember how , when mere child , i used get irritated when any body talked me way i could not understand . i don't think i ever got angry anything else my life . . . i remember going my little bedroom , after hearing neighbors talk evening my father , spending no small part night walking up down , trying make out what exact meaning some their , me , dark sayings . i could not sleep , though i often tried , when i got such hunt after idea , until i caught it ; when i thought i got it , i not satisfied until i repeated it over over , until i put it language plain enough , i thought , any boy i knew comprehend . this kind passion me , it stuck me ; i am never easy now , when i am handling thought , till i bounded it north , bounded it south , bounded it east , bounded it west . perhaps accounts characteristic you observe my speeches , though i never put two things together before . ps graduate cooper union , i find holzer account cooper amazing building bit thin . plans photos available web . stage west , not north holzer says , there 18 obstructing columns , not 16 . these inaccuracies not altered my faith his account . i inserted plan hall my copy .	1
this benchmark when it comes books homes frank lloyd wright . text scholarly highly informative , while easily accessable even most nyophite wright follower . images crisp well executed , they just bleed off page . i not always huge fan wright , frankly he racist homophobe , interesting considering most his devotees taliesin where gay , man voratious ego would make donald blush . he all accounts just nasty piece work , i first found his architecture austere cold , but now i am huge admiror his work , if not man . this book shows vivid focus , what makes his homes so unique what made him american icon . i may not think much wright man , but his work ages this book simply fantastic . highly recommended .	1

although this book ostensibly " beginner " book flash actionscript ( no previous programming experience necessary ) , i got more out this book than you imagine , i'm not it yet . i've already got few favorite pages i come back again again . what struck me right off bat this book wasn't code-heavy , but much more way explanations than most books , which exactly what i seeking long time now . then , i got into it , i realized this book changing my whole way thinking coding flash actionscript , it because their heavy stress " modular " coding techniques . authors call it " black box " programming making " building blocks " code . it really encapsulation . whatever you want call it , they back it up solid examples . demonstration apply () method pages 360 361 alone worth price book ! pages 308 309 , there example making movie clip containing video controls you just drag drop into any movie , bingo ! you've got set controls movie ( play , stop , pause , fastforward , rewind ) . again , idea if you build something once , you should able reuse it , minor tweaking here there . chapter 10 , games sprites , really cool ! there fully functioning " zapper " arcade-type video game complete explanation rationale behind how something like designed coded , what variables should global , which ones belong _root , which should stay local each object ( all examples book downloaded publisher website , btw . fact , you download examples even if you haven't yet bought book ) . although lot stuff earlier chapters very basic , taking you through stuff like variables , arrays , loops , conditionals , etc , stress modularity woven throughout . main idea you come away ( certainly central idea book ) it worth time it takes design plan something modularly . even though first it take longer , end you wind up something that way easier modify . now , i say all my own perspective , i'm probably intermediate level programmer . so maybe stuff i'm saying this book it stress modularity would old hat pro . i don't know . then again , i've got 8 books actionscript , each one stuff unique itself , this one things it just aren't found others . all through book , there also ongoing project building modular flash website . i haven't gotten into working yet , but i'm sure i eventually ( i've book month ) . any case , they add little more project end each chapter , so it progresses into more advanced stuff same pace rest book . there basic introduction classes oop last chapter . it should understood it not extensive , that not focus this book anyway . it tie stress modularity , there good explanations when how you might use classes your programming . but if want material specifically classes , there other books make their focus . sum up : i would recommend this book beginner intermediate programmers . although much stuff earlier chapters probably rehash what you already know , stress modularity there beginning , there good material throughout . if you've heard modular code code reuse , but never really seen good examples it , open this book some pages i mentioned above ( 308 , 356 , 360 , 361 , 364 ) see if any it registers " aha " moment . also , if you're looking bit less code lot more explanation techniques , get this book . i also recommend " foundation actionscript animation : making things move " keith peters , same publisher	1

summer 1994 i received original hardcover version niv men devotional bible through book club . i hadn't intended use it myself , rather i thought it might make nice gift friend . after i started going through daily readings accompanying devotions , i decided keep it myself . although i've christian many years , i've always found it beyond my level self-discipline continually practice habit daily bible readings ; using this bible , i changed . although it still took me nearly two years read through one year devotional readings , me infinitely better than any other daily devotional books or bibles , none which i ever finished . since time , i am now going through it third time . i can't say enough how this edition bible changed my life . bible change anyone life , if person willing read it meditate what it says . this bible edition , first time , helped me daily basis . since i started reading it , i given it gift nearly every male friend mine , always hope they gain it some what i've received . if you'd like good taste some better devotionals , if it possible either find them on-line or your local bookstore ( walmart used carry it , even ) , i'd especially recommend looking devotions song songs ( aka " song solomon " ) . beauty devotional writings their depth breadth , which incredibly diverse . while there some readings which little challenge or encourage me , i'm more impressed how many actually . best recommendation i give this book this : any male christian who uses this bible devotional tool , reading meditating daily scripture readings , grow know , love , obey god deeper sense . i believe those who know me would agree god used this my life make me more loving sensitive , well more assertive outspoken my faith	1

this well-written book logically moves through certain events where america needed act , those actions either increasing or decreasing odds 9/11 happening . graham book shows bureaucratic silos focused departments themselves , rather than objectives like national security , allowed 9/11 happen . case cross-functional organizations focus intelligence security objectives well-made graham this book . i also appreciated his perspective committee chairman senate select intelligence committee . graham provides great insight into workings senate , especially also monitoring specific executive bureaucracies . while i agree him better reagan/bush/clinton/bush focus terrorism would prevented 9/11 , bush executive branch many opportunities stop 9/11 , i don't agree graham final thesis bush alone could stopped 9/11 . i would suggest however most what graham recommends happening executive branch happening , just not quickly potentially necessary since we spent spending inordinate amount men , money , material iraq rather than fighting terrorism securing our country terrorism	1
i went my university library tried compare goldrei book almost all other popular accounts set theory , prior investing my time learning basics subject . after almost finished reading it , i believe this model how textbooks mathematics should written . let me little bit more specific : 1)suberb organization material . ideas built gradually without logical gaps or regressions . definitions theorems clearly stated . " what follows what " always transparent . even choice paragraphs so well thought , one easilly assign title each them quick reference later . 2)each subject clearly introduced within its historical logical context . each theorem ( even exercise ) motivated its importance its merits global picture set theory . 3)the logic intuition behind proofs given ( well proof itself ... ) well organized not unecessarily wordy manner . 4 ) there exercises within main text ( which , usual , well motivated their importance ) solutions folowing right after . this way , one may develop skills understanding , without getting frustrated or spending too much time . there also exercises end each section which interesting not too difficult . 5 ) there comments aside main text , which range ideas concerning proof historical remarks or recommendations reader . this way , main text remains clean tangencies , but never dry . i could continue praising this book , but let me cut it short saying just this : it one those proper ( i.e. rigorous ) math textbooks invite you read each following chapter turn each page see what next . finished it i feel i pretty firm understatnding basics . i only wish goldrei could write second book specialized topics ( say , similar topics covered devlin " joy sets " , or moschovakis ' book ) , same energy enthousiasm wrote this one	1

sadly , chicago poems ( 1916 ) , author first published work , book which self-styled folk poet carl sandburg best remembered today . collection takes hard unswerving look grim realities urban life common man , funneled through flume author committed socialist ideological perspective . such approach poetry may somewhat novel america time , both history critics kind sandburg sympathetic portraits human suffering . but whether he addressing " dago shovelman , " immigrant who forgotten dignified his ancestors europe or who no longer recognize " new-mown hay smell calling wind , " street walker " haggard poems desperate eyes , " or young woman burned death factory fire , sandburg continually adopts simplistic notion lower economic strata society always victimized but virtuous , while governmental institutions , bosses all stripes , professional classes , wealthy uniformly cruel , oppressive , exploitive , , best , indifferent . thus , chicago poems reads like 132-page polemic very narrow political point view . while many author observations poignantly insightful ( such poverty-stricken family dead boy ' right grief , ' who " glad it gone , rest family now more eat wear " ) , poems , when read together , take oppressively unbalanced character their own . ' fence , ' example , " rabble all vagabonds hungry men wandering children looking place play " stand outside gates newly constructed " stone house lake front " built wealthy man , who , poet infers , nothing but immoral , amoral , or corrupt . author usher-esque vision , nothing able pass through gates property except " death rain tomorrow . " tomorrow , such corrupt individual or family , inevitably bring nothing but waves bad conscience fevered isolation . ' soiled dove ' examines life woman who " not harlot until she married corporation lawyer , " but who automatically becomes one acquiescing such marriage , who soon discovers her husband also loves " six other women , " if marital infidelity limited exclusively upper economic classes . contrast , ' happiness ' confidently represented " crowd hungarians under trees their women children keg beer accordion , " image which may seem simultaneously na�ve , patronizing , condescending many readers . occasionally , sandburg wisely acknowledges some portion tragedies man existence simply inherent natural human life cycle . " hand god " also comes blame several poems . chicago poems most effective when sandburg bypasses social divisionalism -- he often his later volumes poetry -- simply addresses everyman individual . while these poems often infused lyrical tender sentimentality slightly reminiscent james whitcomb riley , they also locate acknowledge beautiful within tragedies perpetually arise human frailty , vulnerability , mortality . ' dream dusk , ' author warns " tears loss broken dreams may find your heart dusk , " while ' under harvest moon ' identifies " death " " gray mocker , [ who ] comes you beautiful friend who remembers . " ' i sang ' describes lover who given up his heart " you moon , " but " only moon remembers , kind me . " other poems more pronounced folk character sandburg later volumes . speaker ' theme yellow ' pumpkin , who celebrates paganistic dance children around him " last day october ... singing ghost songs love harvest moon ... i am jack-o-lantern terrible teeth children know i am fooling . " most recent edition complete poems carl sandburg ( 2003 ) , which contains chicago poems its entirety , 832 pages long , provides its readership full range sandburg original often gloriously rich sensual vision life . it also contains works like ' gates tombs , ' slabs sunburnt west ( 1922 ) , which sandburg , " crazy wild dreamer , " more fully maturely developed his political vision . comparatively , reductive , often despairing chicago poems reads like immaturely polarized work it .	1
